Welcome to <em>Installer</em> No. 60, your guide to the best and <em>Verge</em>-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, it’s a lot of gaming stuff this week, and also you can read all the old editions at the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/installer-newsletter"><em>Installer</em> homepage</a>.)&nbsp;</p><p>This week, I’ve been… doomscrolling about the election, if I’m honest. But let’s not talk about that. I’ve also been reading about <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/11/11/the-shipwreck-detective?__readwiseLocation="><strong>shipwrecks</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/final-flight-airline-magazine-united-digital.php?__readwiseLocation="><strong>in-flight magazines</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-10-25/influencer-brothers-are-selling-more-baseball-bats-than-pro-athletes"><strong>baseball bat influencers</strong></a>, making a bunch of lists in <a href="https://listy.is/"><strong>Listy</strong></a><strong>, </strong>dusting off my <a href="https://bsky.app/"><strong>Bluesky</strong></a> account as Threads becomes increasingly worse,<strong> </strong>logging a surprising number of hours in VR with <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/batman-arkham-shadow/3551691271620960/"><em><strong>Batman: Arkham Shadow</strong></em></a>, playing with tasks and notes in the <a href="https://www.craft.do/"><strong>Craft</strong></a> beta, seeing if I can replace Gmail with <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/mobile/"><strong>Thunderbird for Android</strong></a>, and trying really, really hard to convince myself I don’t need a new <a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?subId1=VergeInstaller110824&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmac-mini%2F"><strong>Mac Mini</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I also have for you a couple of new games to play this weekend, some fun stuff to watch, a nifty new way for Mac users to take notes, and more. And I have some ideas for everyone looking for a place to put all their articles, newsletters, and other online stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, housekeeping note: <strong><em>Installer</em>’s off next week</strong>. We have some planning meetings going on, and also, honestly, this is one of the driest times of the year when it comes to new stuff. I’ll be back with a big issue in two weeks ahead of Thanksgiving, and then we have some fun plans through the rest of the year.</p><p>All right, it’s a lot of games this week. Which feels right. Let’s go.</p><p>(As always, the best part of <em>Installer</em> is your ideas and tips. What are you comfort watching this week? What have you been playing / reading / downloading / baking that everyone else should know about, too? Tell me everything: <a href="mailto:installer@theverge.com">installer@theverge.com</a>. And if you know someone else who might enjoy <em>Installer</em>, tell them to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/installer-newsletter-sign-up">subscribe here</a>.)</p><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p> / <span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div><p><h3>The Drop</h3></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fmario-and-luigi-brothership-switch%2F"><em><strong>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>It feels like we get a fun new Mario game like every two weeks these days. And I’m not complaining! I’m into the teamwork-y vibe of this one — and the amount of pure unadulterated exploring it asks you to do.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/275103-game-changers"><em><strong>Game Changers</strong></em></a><strong>.</strong> The first two episodes of this new Discovery series tell the story of two of my favorite things in gaming: Nintendo and Madden. There are also episodes coming about <em>Call of Duty, </em>Scrabble<em>,</em> and other iconic games. The nostalgia is through the roof with this one. <em>&nbsp;</em></li><li><a href="https://www.raycast.com/blog/raycast-notes"><strong>Raycast Notes</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Raycast has become one of my most-used Mac apps: it’s a launcher, a clipboard manager, a window reorder-er, and a million other things. Its built-in notes app just got a big upgrade —&nbsp;it’s as simple as opening a text file but much more powerful.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://nytimesguild.org/tech/guild-builds/index.html"><strong>Guild Builds</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289937/nyt-tech-workers-strike-games-wordle">striking <em>New York Times </em>tech workers</a> created a pretty fun set of games you can play instead of <em>Wordle </em>this week. <em>Match Strike </em>is hilarious and fun, as is <em>Scabby’s Fair Contract Builder. </em>Who knew you could build a good game that’s also a sick burn against your boss?</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1138194-heretic?language=en-US"><em><strong>Heretic</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>I’ve been excited for this movie ever since I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24241767/heretic-review-a24-hugh-grant">read Andrew Webster’s review</a>, which confirmed that Hugh Grant can be as terrifying as he is charming. Plus, a bad guy you can describe as “a theological debate bro?” I’m in.</li><li><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/9000-series/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d.html"><strong>The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This CPU is power-hungry and expensive, but Tom Warren called it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24288948/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">the best gaming CPU on the market</a>, and that is no small feat. If you’re building a gaming PC this holiday season, this is where to start.</li><li><a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/blog/"><strong><em>Stardew Valley</em> 1.6.9</strong></a><strong>. </strong>I have heard from a <em>lot </em>of folks who retreated into <em>Stardew Valley </em>this week as a reprieve from the real world. The newest update adds new items, the ability to retrieve things you’ve dropped in water, and lots of other useful and delightful changes.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/274413-countdown-paul-vs-tyson"><em><strong>Countdown: Paul vs. Tyson</strong></em></a><strong>. </strong>Look, I’m not proud of the fact that I’m fascinated by next week’s Tyson / Paul fight. Is it even a real fight? Is it all a bit? Who knows! But leave it to Netflix to milk it for all its worth; I bet you $10 this series will be more fun and dramatic than the fight itself.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/940139-here"><em><strong>Here</strong></em></a><em><strong>. </strong></em>By most accounts, this movie is bad. But director Robert Zemeckis did some fascinating and AI-forward work to de-age Tom Hanks and Robin Wright in order to make the movie work, and I’ve enjoyed the way all three have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/movies/tom-hanks-robin-wright-here-forrest-gump.html">talked about the process</a>. This feels like a movie we’ll remember in the story of AI filmmaking.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/videos/"><strong>Google Vids</strong></a><strong>. </strong>The pitch for Vids — “what if making a video were as easy as making a Google Doc?” — is a really clever one. And now, months after Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24124168/google-vids-video-ai-workspace-app">first announced the app</a>, you can give it a whirl. Send me all the weird stuff you make!</li></ul></div><p><h3>Group project</h3></p><p>Last week, a lot of you reached out saying you were bummed to see that <a href="https://omnivore.app/"><strong>Omnivore</strong></a>, a really great app for reading articles, newsletters, and other stuff, <a href="https://blog.omnivore.app/p/details-on-omnivore-shutting-down">was shutting down</a>. I was bummed, too! I’ve recommended Omnivore to a lot of people and really liked the app. (PSA, by the way: if you’re still using Omnivore, you only have a few more weeks to get your stuff out.)&nbsp;</p><p>Now, a bunch of us are stuck trying to figure out where to go. So I asked you all to share what you need most in an app like this —&nbsp;and lots of you did! Thanks, as always, to everyone who reached out with thoughts and recommendations. I think I have a pretty good sense of what we’re all looking for, so let me try and recommend a few things.&nbsp;</p><div><ul><li>If all you need is a place to save articles and read them later, you have lots of options. <a href="https://readwise.io/read"><strong>Readwise Reader</strong></a> is the most powerful (and the only one that also does RSS and newsletters), but it’s also $8 a month. <a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/"><strong>Matter</strong></a> is a lovely app but is mostly Apple-only. <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/"><strong>Instapaper</strong></a> is a great option and works across basically all platforms — it’s probably the one I’d recommend to most people. <a href="https://getpocket.com/home"><strong>Pocket</strong></a> is solid, too, but I just don’t like the interface.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>If you want something a little more open and versatile, I’d go with an RSS tool. I use <a href="https://feedbin.com/"><strong>Feedbin</strong></a>, which I love. <a href="https://feedly.com/"><strong>Feedly</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.newsblur.com/?next=premium"><strong>NewsBlur</strong></a> are also good for this kind of thing. All three give you an email address you can use to subscribe to newsletters and a way to manually save a page to your reader.</li><li>If you’re trying to build more of a database of stuff that you can search through later, I’d start with a bookmarking tool. <a href="https://raindrop.io/"><strong>Raindrop</strong></a> is my go-to, but if you’re an Apple user, there’s also <a href="https://goodlinks.app/"><strong>GoodLinks</strong></a> and <a href="https://anybox.app/"><strong>Anybox</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.plinky.app/"><strong>Plinky</strong></a>. You can also use an app like <a href="https://obsidian.md/"><strong>Obsidian</strong></a>, with its web clipper, to turn webpages into text files.</li><li>If you want something that will truly last forever, the best move is to host something yourself. A few of you recommended apps like <a href="https://wallabag.org/"><strong>Wallabag</strong></a>, <a href="https://linkwarden.app/"><strong>Linkwarden</strong></a>, and <a href="https://linkding.link/"><strong>Linkding</strong></a>, and if you’re willing to do the work, this is the most durable option by far. There are some folks working on <a href="https://github.com/omnivore-app/omnivore/pull/4465"><strong>ways to self-host Omnivore</strong></a>, too, so keep an eye on that.</li></ul></div><p>The best answer for most people, I think, is to use an RSS reader like Feedbin to compile all your incoming stuff and then a read-later app like Instapaper to go through your reading list. Readwise Reader is the closest thing I’ve found to Omnivore’s all-in-one capability, and it’s definitely the one I’d recommend to people looking for a one-to-one replacement, but you’ll pay pretty handsomely for it. Maybe Omnivore was too good to be true this whole time.</p><p><h3>Screen share</h3></p><p>I’ve been listening to Brian McCullough talk for a <em>really </em>long time. I think I first encountered his work on the <a href="https://www.internethistorypodcast.com/"><em><strong>Internet History Podcast</strong></em></a>, which is like a treasure trove of early Silicon Valley stories. He also hosts the <a href="https://www.ridehome.info/show/techmeme-ride-home/"><em><strong>Techmeme Ride Home</strong></em></a> podcast, which is an awesome way to get daily tech news. And more recently, I’ve been listening to his newest show, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG053d_xzCEervxkoBeZR1w"><em><strong>RAD! 80s90s History</strong></em></a><em>. </em>(I might even be on that show in a few weeks… stay tuned.) And in addition to all that, McCullough is a general partner at the <a href="https://www.ridehomefund.com/"><strong>Ride Home Fund</strong></a>, investing in tech companies. Busy guy, that Brian.</p><p>I asked Brian to share his homescreen to see if we might learn how he manages it all. Here it is, plus some info on the apps he uses and why:</p><p><strong>The phone: </strong>An iPhone 16 Pro. For the first time in my life of using iPhones, I have a case on it,&nbsp; because my son dropped my previous one twice and shattered the front and back glass. I wouldn’t have upgraded this year except for that. So, lesson learned. <em>Kids</em>.</p><p><strong>The wallpaper: </strong>The wallpaper is a picture I took some night on Prospect Park West years ago. The lockscreen is obviously an old iPod interface, my favorite version of the iPod. I bought it from some collection of wallpapers about a year ago. Can’t remember where from, though.</p><p><strong>The apps: </strong>Phone, Fantastical, Apple Maps, Settings, Slack, Microsoft Word, Shopify, Citi Bike, Audible, Microsoft OneNote, Carrot Weather, Amazon, Jersey Mike’s, Wallet, Tovala, Threads, X, York, Claude, Messages, Overcast, Safari, Superhuman.</p><p>I’m fairly basic with the apps, as you can see. Apps to get news from, like Threads and Twitter. Slack for work. Superhuman for email.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve totally moved over to <a href="https://claude.ai/login?returnTo=/?"><strong>Claude</strong></a> in the last few months thanks to <a href="https://www.bigtechnology.com/"><strong>Alex Kantrowitz</strong></a> evangelizing it to me constantly. So much so that I’ve canceled my OpenAI subscription. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tovala.com%2Fsmart-ovens"><strong>Tovala</strong></a> is a smart oven / meal plan company that I’ve been using religiously since the pandemic. Basically my lunch every single day is a Tovala meal. <a href="https://www.jerseymikes.com/mobile-app"><strong>Jersey Mike’s</strong></a> finally came to Park Slope and so that’s also a meal go-to. I use <a href="https://citibikenyc.com/how-it-works/app"><strong>Citi Bike</strong></a> once or twice a day.&nbsp;</p><p>The app that says “York” is interesting. That’s my subway stop for my office in Dumbo. This random dude made this thing that you can get at <a href="https://nextstop.nyc/"><strong>Nextstop.nyc</strong></a>. Basically, it gives you real-time train times for whatever subway stops you use all the time, and then you put an icon for that on your phone. IT. IS. AMAZING. It is insane that, 20 years into my living in NYC, it took this long for someone to do this right. “I’m about to leave the office, when is the next train? Should I leave now or wait five minutes?” Amazing.</p><p><em>I also asked Brian to share a few things he’s into right now. Here’s what he sent back:</em></p><div><ul><li>My kids and I are playing tons of <a href="https://pouncelight.games/tiny-glade/"><em><strong>Tiny Glade</strong></em></a>. “Relaxing” game that can also be super complex and sophisticated if you put in the time. It’s like <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us"><em><strong>Minecraft</strong></em></a> in that way, but with a sort of romanticist feel.&nbsp;</li><li>The book I’m obsessed with right now is Rick Atkinson’s <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781627790437/thebritisharecoming"><em><strong>The British Are Coming</strong></em></a>. I’ve read Rick’s other books about the US Army in World War II, but he has a new series about the American Army in the Revolutionary War. It’s amazing and detailed like all of Rick’s books, but full of stuff I didn’t know. Like, the battle of Lexington and Concord: oh, Paul Revere, the British go and try to shut down a weapons depot and the minutemen take potshots at them? Oh no. WAY more bloody than that. Like hundreds of people died on both sides. Savage fighting. Very interesting stuff. I’m almost to the Battle of Brooklyn and can’t wait.&nbsp;</li><li>I rewatched <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/379-miller-s-crossing?language=en-US"><em><strong>Miller’s Crossing</strong></em></a> a few nights ago, and god damn if that movie isn’t the most underrated and underseen of the whole Coen filmography.</li><li>I’m looking forward to the next book in Brandon Sanderson’s Stormlight Archive series, which is coming next month: <a href="https://read.macmillan.com/torforge/the-stormlight-archive/"><em><strong>Wind and Truth</strong></em></a>. Even though the previous book in the series was pretty boring.</li></ul></div><p><h3>Crowdsourced</h3></p><p><em>Here’s what the </em>Installer<em> community is into this week.

A beautiful app to keep tabs on ongoing sports events and matches.” – Karan</p><p>“I’ve been using this little-known news app called <a href="https://info.adarga.ai/panoptic"><strong>Adarga Panoptic</strong></a>. Has this interesting take on the news where it’s provided through the lens of a person’s perspective rather than just headlines. Content is a bit limited, but with some added customization options, this could be a really cool way to see the news differently.” –&nbsp;Alen</p><p>“<a href="https://www.scribenotes.io/"><strong>Scribe Notes</strong></a>. It’s like Whisper Memos but has more features. Sort of like Cleft but cheaper. I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and I love it. Helps me get my scrambled thoughts and to-dos out of my head and into a place where I can make sense of them all.” –&nbsp;David</p><p>“Check out the <a href="https://www.mobapad.com/products/mobapad-m6-hd"><strong>Mobapad M6 HD</strong></a> for the Nintendo Switch! It’s a Joy-Con alternative that has ergonomic grips, Hall effect joysticks, and gyro and HD rumble. It essentially has every feature of the Joy-Cons, but they’re actually comfy to hold. The buttons are a little clicky, and the travel case is almost as bulky as my Steam Deck, but it’s definitely the most comfortable and feature-packed Joy-Con alternative I’ve found. I picked one up on a recent trip to Hong Kong, and it completely changed my Switch playing experience.” –&nbsp;Kevin</p><p>“I’ve been keeping an eye on an app called <a href="https://openvibe.social/"><strong>Openvibe</strong></a>. It’s able to aggregate your Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon (and Nostr, too, if you’re into that kind of thing) feeds into a single feed you can scroll.

It’s fine, I like it, whatever, but I’d rather wear another watch. So I went down a YouTube rabbit hole: can you turn an Apple Watch into a standalone, pocketable device that works even when it’s not on your wrist? Turns out, you can! There are a lot of good ideas out there, but I’m basically just following the ideas in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tzvmRp1EJY"><strong>this video from Jose Briones</strong></a><strong>. </strong>(I’m also intrigued by the <a href="https://thetinypod.com/"><strong>TinyPod</strong></a>, but that one doesn’t <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rJa-0YOkwk">seem to be very good</a>.) I’m turning my Watch into basically a teeny-tiny iPod and backup communications device that I carry around like a pocket watch. It’s silly, but it’s fun. And it works!&nbsp;</p><p>See you in two weeks!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At the time of writing, it's unclear if the physical edition will ship with any accompanying goodies, such as an instruction manual, but it has been confirmed that it includes the "deluxe edition upgrade" as well as the base game.</p>
<p>The deluxe edition includes the Bronzecloud Staff weapon, Wind Chimes curio, and the Folk Opera armour set. You'll also get a "selected" digital soundtrack.</p>
<p>Microsoft has again confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delay to the Xbox release of Black Myth: Wukong</a> is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">not due to "platform limitations"</a>.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong was released in August on PC and PS5, but the Xbox version was delayed for an unknown reason. Speculation grew the developer was struggling to run the game on the Series S console, while other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">rumours suggested the game was, in fact, a PlayStation console exclusive</a>.</p>
<p>A representative from Microsoft has now confirmed the game is still on the way, though it won't comment "on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-its-dominance-with-new-milestone">Black Myth: Wukong had already sold 10m copies</a> after just three days on sale, even without an Xbox version.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-modest-cpu-system-limitation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro's modest CPU upgrade, only 10% better than the CPU powering the base model, is the system's primary limitation that continues to impact CPU-bound games such as Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>In their in-depth analysis of the mid-generation refresh system released a few days back, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> went over the console's CPU and how it impacts the performance of both unpatched and PS5 Pro Enhanced games. Unpatched games such as Cyberpunk 2077 do see a small performance improvement in line with the 10% CPU improvement over the base model, but still cannot keep a steady 60 FPS framerate. The situation is not much different in patched games like Baldur's Gate 3, which still struggles to run smoothly in the city of Baldur's Gate, one of the game's most CPU-intensive scenarios, even on the PlayStation 5 Pro, although it does run slightly better than on the base model. At the end of the day, the console still delivers as a mid-generation refresh, but its dated Zen2 CPU falls behind today's mainstream CPUs in the gaming space, which deliver way better performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro CPU Tested: A Modest Upgrade - But Are Games Improved?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z93qm89nkcE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Another limitation that the PlayStation 5 Pro shared with the base model is 4K, 120Hz output, which is still limited by the HDMI controller. In turn, this also somewhat compromises 8K output, although the limited adoption of 8K display and games supporting the resolution makes it less of an issue.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro Display Controller: How 8K Works &amp; Why 4K 120Hz Is Still Compromised" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3celIKKFPO4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Digital Foundry also took a good look at the PlayStation 5 Pro's PS4 Image Enhancement feature, which brings a variety of improvements to PlayStation 4 games. This feature is a post-processing upscaling filter likely using machine learning, which reportedly only applies to games that render to up to 1080p resolution, improving details. Unfortunately, this feature doesn't improve antialiasing in any way, so games with AA issues continue to have them. In addition, it does seem to impact performance in some titles and causes visual glitches in others. Overall, this feature seems to be a preview of future backward compatibility that will bring some visual improvements with upscaling and very little additional work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/10/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I don’t think it’s especially controversial to say that Dragon Age: Inquisition sort of sucked. Well, it wasn’t bad – it did win a bunch of Game of the Year awards – but it certainly fell short of the first two games, and the open-world take on the game ended up being a painful slog of side-quests and wasted time. It wasn’t bad, but I never felt like it did the series justice. I’m pretty happy, then, that Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a far more focused affair, with a generally faster pace, and open zones rather than full open-world gameplay. It’s so much better, and while it’s not perfect, it does feel like a return to form for the series and for Bioware as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdtmtuzICOI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Things kick off really fast, with you being introduced to Rook, your character, as they’re going into a bar to try and meet one of their companions. Things don’t quite go according to plan, and you soon find yourself instead teaming up with the familiar old face of Varric. Not that this really improves matters as things continue to go south, one thing leading to another, some ancient Elven gods getting released, and it now being your job to try and un-release them. Classic RPG stuff, really.</p>


<p>The trials and tribulations that you’ll have to navigate on The Veilguard’s overarching quest will often have you battling your way through demons and blightspawn. So it’s a pretty good thing that the combat is an absolute blast, letting you easily switch between two weapons, regardless of the class that you settle on. As a mage, that meant switching between a magical staff, and an orb and dagger combo that let me cause miniature explosions.</p>


<p>Levelling up naturally gains your character new abilities, and you can easily respec within your class if you want to try out a different build, which is nice, though you’re locked into your overall class from the beginning. You don’t get to test the classes out before deciding what to be, just watch a video showing what they can do. Would it kill big old RPGs to allow us to test the classes for a bit? At the very least, there’s only three fighting classes – rogue, mage or warrior – and they’re broad enough that you should know what you want to be.</p>
<p>Of course, you’re not going to go alone – that’d be dangerous, wouldn’t it? Two companion characters can go into battle with you. Dragon Age has changed a lot since the original game, and with the more action-heavy combat, BioWare has scaled back the control you have over the rest of the party, now more about ordering and using their abilities to the fullest. It’s a simple system to use through the ability wheel and feels incredibly smooth, allowing you to feel like you’re half-controlling your whole crew.</p>
<p>While we’re talking companions, gosh, it’s a good group. The mix of characters here is very good, and you’re bound to find a couple of characters you like spending time with, and writing and performances that you’ll enjoy. I was a big fan of Neve, mostly, and her general “Sherlock Holmes but fantasy” vibe was incredibly cool to play along with. This helped a lot as, during the character creation process, I chose to be from the Shadow Dragon faction, which Neve and I had in common. I do feel as though I preferred the options in Dragon Age 2 overall, mostly because of Isabela, but it’s still a good bunch to mesh with this time around.</p>

<p>And the writing is mostly good throughout the game… mostly. It lacks the same backwards-facing decisions as the original trilogy, which is something of a shame, and the way that your decisions in The Veilguard impact the world and your team tends to be a lot more immediate. It’s more immediate that way, letting you know what’s going down straight away, but is another shift for the series.</p>
<p>In the moment-to-moment, though, there’s a weird, uncanny feeling that permeates a lot of the general chatter between characters. It feels like Iron Man or Loki could pop out at any given moment; it’s all just a bit Marvel. There are quips, and a vibe that just doesn’t quite mesh with the high fantasy feel, and which feels rooted in scriptwriting trends that felt played-out half a decade ago. That’s my main gripe though – and specifically with Bellara, who was the biggest offender on this front – and plenty of you will enjoy having that style of conversation sprinkled throughout.</p>

			<p>There's rather "interesting" news around Nintendo this weekend, as the firm is said to have sued a streamer who allegedly showed "unreleased and pirated" Nintendo Switch titles on public forums. In another development, Palword's developer Pocketpair has given insight into the ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo, disclosing the amount they have been sued for.</p>
<p>Nintendo's track record of suing individuals and organizations and bringing them to court is pretty lengthy, and the firm has now decided to add another entry. In a new report by <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-emulator-gamer-who-streamed-pirated-games-before-release-241108/">TorrentFreak</a>, Nintendo has filed a lawsuit against Jesse Keighin, or EveryGameGuru, saying that the individual is involved in leaking Nintendo's unreleased titles on multiple occasions. Keighin is accused of streaming on platforms such as YouTube, Discord, Twitch, TikTok, Trovo, Kick, Vaughn, Dlive, Picarto, Nimo, Facebook, and Loco. Here's what the lawsuit says:</p>
<p><em>Defendant is a recidivist pirate who has obtained and streamed Nintendo’s leaked games on multiple occasions. Leaked games (sometimes referred to as ‘prerelease games’) are copyrighted video games which Nintendo has not yet publicly released.</em></p>
<p>Nintendo says that they have rolled out multiple DMCA notices at Keighin's streams, but the streamer continued to show unauthorized gameplay, which ultimately forced Nintendo to adopt the legal approach. Interestingly, the pre-released in-game content shown wasn't simply of the title itself; rather, Keighin had access to pirated copies, which were played on an illegal emulator.</p>
<p><em>The use of emulators, which circumvent these technological measures, allow people such as Defendant to play pirated Nintendo Switch games — including leaked games — on PCs, Macs, and Android devices.</em></p>
<p>Nintendo claims that Keighin&nbsp;is responsible for pre-release streaming of titles such as Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and Super Mario RPG. Apart from this, Keighin is alleged to have encouraged infringement to its viewers as well, saying that he supplied "links" to pirated titles, ultimately being involved in extensive violation of Nintendo's copyright laws. Nintendo is seeking maximum statutory damages of $150,000 for the infringement by EveryGameGuru, which is indeed a hefty amount for an individual.</p>
<p>Nintendo isn't just after individuals like Keighin. Since the company is pretty committed to its copyright laws, we recently reported on how Nintendo has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">filed a lawsuit against Pocketpair</a>, the creators of Palworld, claiming that the developers allegedly infringed multiple patents on the title. Now, in a <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108">follow-up post</a>, Pocketpair has revealed that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are now seeking compensation for damages incurred in the filing process, equaling five million yen ($32,846), to both parties.</p>
<p>The lawsuit comes at a pretty questionable time, especially since Palword has been out there for quite some time now, yet Nintendo has been quiet after the actual launch. It is uncertain how the lawsuit will turn out for the parties involved, but it is clear that Nintendo was surely influenced by the massive success of Palword.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol">The Rise Of The Golden Idol</a> will crack its new case wide open on November 12th, but the detective sequel is just the beginning. Color Gray Games are planning another tranche of DLC akin to that received by the first game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-case-of-the-golden-idol">The Case Of The Golden Idol</a>: four standalone mysteries that introduce more mysteries to solve.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"There are a ton of additional standalone stories we want to tell set in the Golden Idol universe, and we found that the best way to tell these stories is through four self-contained DLC chapters - called Investigations," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2716400/view/4478360632965464065">the announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>"Similar to the DLC released for The Case of the Golden Idol, these are optional side content and are not required to conclude the story in The Rise of the Golden Idol."
</p>
<p>The base game will include 20 scenarios and will cost $20 (or your Steam-recommended regional equivalent), with each of the four DLC adding "at least" four more. The first will arrive in the first quarter of 2025 and is called The Sins Of New Wells. Two DLC will then arrive in the spring, and a fourth in autumn. "This a living roadmap, and may change", of course.
</p><p>The Case Of The Golden Idol was one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-game-of-the-year-2022">our favourite games of 2022</a>, and ranks among the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">best puzzle games</a> on PC. Rise Of seems to follow in its footsteps as a mystery-puzzler with grisly death, but it's trading the original's 18th century setting for the 1970s, which ought to give it a new flavour.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/woojer-haptic-vest-feel-games-play/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/woojer%E2%80%99s-new-haptic-feedback-vest-made-me-feel-the-games-i-play.1031934/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/woojer-haptic-vest-feel-games-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Woojer Vest 3 is here and I was fortunate enough to take one for a spin around the block. Not entirely impressed with the concept of a ‘haptic feedback vest’, I was willing to give one a try and see if I could be converted by this luxurious technology.</p>



<p>It might be extremely expensive and rather cumbersome-looking at first blush, but the Woojer Vest 3 is a remarkable piece of technology that allows you to <strong>feel </strong>the games you play – and the media you consume – like never before. Is it a bit too fancy to win over the average gamer, though?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-price-heavy-vest">High Price, Heavy Vest</h2>



<p>You’d be surprised to learn that the Woojer Vest 3 will run you up a bill of almost $500 if you choose to invest. This next-generation haptic vest screams high-quality production value, but it’s an eye-watering sum to part ways with for ‘an experiment’, so I’m thankful to Woojer for providing me with a review sample.</p>



<p>From the moment I pulled apart the box, I knew that I was in for a treat. The Woojer Vest 3 screams ‘premium accessory’, from the packaging to the parts, and the materials used to construct the vest to the companion app. I’ll admit I had some teething issues getting the app paired with the vest, but they were my fault and Woojer was instrumental in getting me online as soon as possible.</p>



<p>Wearing the Woojer feels weird at first. It’s not a light thing, nor is it too slimline, and you’ll <strong>absolutely </strong>notice that you’ve got it on. The Woojer Vest 3 is almost built to be paired with a Meta Quest headset for the ultimate sense of gaming immersion, and that’s the feeling I got when I used it – but I also came away <strong>sweating</strong> after a moderate session.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most adjustable things I’ve ever worn, and as a bigger gamer, I was pleased to see the Woojer Vest 3 accommodated my frame. It’s marketed as ‘one size fits most’, so I shouldn’t have been surprised.</p>



<p>It didn’t take long to get to grips with it, and I was able to try it out across a range of functions, pairing it with audio sources for music, my Meta Quest 3 headset, and my gaming PC. On every occasion, I came away pleased with what the Woojer Vest 3 had shown me.</p>



<h2 id="h-but-what-does-the-woojer-vest-3-do">But What Does The Woojer Vest 3 Do?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>As it says on the tin, the Woojer Vest 3 is a haptic feedback device. That means it allows you to feel your game, music, or movie by providing tangible feedback across a range of ‘transducers’ when they detect an appropriate input.</p>



<p>It relies on an audio level and range, so the deeper and louder a sound, the more impact you’ll feel through the transducers located on your chest, back, and abdomen. Admittedly, I thought it would be super accurate, and that firing a rifle would allow me to feel a punch in my shoulder, but it’s not <strong>that </strong>specific.</p>



<p>I charged around on Black Ops 6 while wearing the Woojer Vest 3, though – and it was a blast. On Nuketown, the cacophony of explosions, gunfire, and other sound effects made for a unique sensation across my body. For a laugh, I cranked the feedback volume to the maximum level and the vest drilled me and left my skin buzzing.</p>



<p>It’s a versatile device that works with basically any input, but it can be a little fiddly when it comes to using cables. For instance, I had to run a cable from my PC into the vest, and then I plugged a wired headset into the vest’s control panel to accommodate an audio passthrough – but there are less cumbersome ways to make it work.</p>



<p>In terms of technical specs, the Woojer Vest 3 is equipped with six newly designed oscillators that offer ‘360-degree perceptual inference’. It can be tweaked with a handy app, and it supports Bluetooth and a range of wired inputs (USB-C, 3.5mm, etc). One charge can last up to eight hours, and it uses a unique charging solution to ramp that battery level up as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the Woojer Vest 3 is an innovative and intriguing device, but as it’s both drastically expensive and quite a chore to wear, I’ll be honest and say it doesn’t have much of a place in the market at the moment. It’s too niche a piece of technology for the average gamer to buy, and even enthusiasts might find it a bit gimmicky.</p>



<p>It felt great wearing it for a while and the reliability of the haptics blew my mind when I first tried it out, but taking it on and off for each session became tiresome, and in the summertime, I could see the Woojer Vest 3 being stuffed in a cupboard out of fear of overheating. </p>



<p>If you’ve got $500 burning a hole in your pocket and want to try something new, then maybe invest. Otherwise, keep a hold on your money.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-election-donald-trump-unions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re reading this website, odds are <em>very </em>good that you had a bad week. It’s likely that you’re feeling dejected, perhaps even hopeless, in the face of a country that has gone fully mask-off for fascism. But! There are things that you can do! Right now! For example, you can organize your workplace. It’s not a silver bullet for all of society’s ills, but the skills you’ll pick up will help you in a variety of situations – and will likely only appreciate in value these next several years. On the latest episode of <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a>, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by labor reporter <a href="https://linktr.ee/mel_buer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mel Buer</a> of <a href="https://therealnews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Real News Network</a>, a very good nonprofit newsroom, to discuss what we, as normal people, can do in the wake of Trump’s reelection. The short version? Organize! Not just your workplace, but also your local community. Meet your neighbors. Start a community garden. Put together a game night. The government isn’t going to save us, so we’ve got to.&nbsp;</p><p>We also touch on the recent <a href="https://aftermath.site/times-tech-guild-strike-wordle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times Tech Guild strike</a> and the callous cynicism that led bosses to refuse reasonable demands even with a massively consequential election bearing down on their news organization. Oh, and we talk about eating our feelings, which all of us coincidentally did recently, for some reason.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can become the liberal Joe Rogan, whatever the hell that means.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> There’s often a lot of talk about this notion that, especially in a country like the United States, there’s only so much you can do through traditional electoral means, and the way for the working class to amass actual power is through labor organizing. So let’s say there’s a hypothetical person. Seeing the election results, they decide “I want to get involved today. I want to start down the road to organizing a workplace I’m part of or organizing generally.” Where do they begin? Where are the resources? How do they embark down that path?</p><p><strong>Mel:</strong> There’s a number of different ways to organize beyond just union organizing, because the fact of the matter is, union density – which is to say, the number of people, the number of workers unionized – is still struggling to get about 12 percent. There’s close to 60 percent of workers that would love to organize a union, and there are a variety of reasons why they can’t, or they’re being blocked from doing so, or the organizing frankly takes a long time.</p><p>We need only look at Trump’s campaign promises to get a glimpse of what a Trump administration is gonna look like this time around. I think we kind of got some of that glimpse in the last months of his presidency. The chaos kind of crystallized into what is sort of this MAGA ideology. And that’s only entrenched itself further in the past four years. So you’re allowed to feel that: anger, despair, fear. You’re OK. It’s OK for you to sit with that for a while.&nbsp;</p><p>When you’re ready to begin to think of ways to not only organize but to thrive under this incoming administration and the ideology it’s pushing forward, the best place to start is in your own neighborhood. Get to know your neighbors. It’s a cliche, but legitimately, begin to build community outside your online circles, outside of the people you talk to on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram, outside of the sort of book clubs you’re in or socialist organizations. Talk to your neighbors. Get to know the people you live next to. Get to know who they are – purely for the fact that fascism in general and capitalism writ large is that it is designed to alienate people from themselves and the people around them.&nbsp;</p><p>The more alone you are, the harder it’s going to be to push your way through the next four years of nonsense. Because that’s what we’re looking at: four-plus years. Potentially a couple decades depending on the judges Trump appoints in the coming years. So get to know the people you live next to. Start there.</p><p>Get to know your coworkers. This is how you start a union. You have to know who you’re working with – not just on a clock in, clock out basis. I come from the service industry. A lot of those relationships are easy when you’re clocked in. You kind of trauma bond your way through working a shift in a bar or a restaurant or what have you. But do you know who their family members are? Do you see them outside of work? Are you interested in creating relationships with them outside of work? Friendships that lead you to dinner together or a movie or some kind of other thing. Get to know them in their lives. Open yourself up to be somebody who can also be gotten to know. It’s only at the point that you can start building that relationship that you start to plant the seeds of solidarity.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s how you move into potentially organizing a union in your workplace. Reminder: a union only needs to start with two people. Just two. Start with two, start with someone that you trust. And work slowly.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>[Nathan and I] both worked together at Kotaku, which was Gawker, which was the first digital union. I was our site rep and on our bargaining committee, and one of my favorite parts of that was that it helped me get to know other people at other sites – and not just “They work at such-and-such place,” but the things that were important to them.&nbsp;</p><p>I think a lot about how we were bargaining for parental leave, which wasn’t important for me, but by talking to them the people it was important to and learning more about their lives and their plans and fighting for them, getting to know my colleagues in that way gave us power in the workplace beyond “We’re having a union meeting.” Those relationships and that solidarity let you take on the bosses and fight for everybody.</p><p><strong>Mel:</strong> Yeah, one thing that a lot of people don’t realize about union organizing or being in a union is that there’s a lot of bureaucracy involved. A lot of long meetings. A lot of establishing processes to establish processes. Votes and so on that are just part of the practice of working with and upholding the union as an institution. It can seem kind of clunky, and it’s fucking boring sometimes. One, it’s good to be involved in that process and understand how it works when you finally organize and win your union. It prepares you to be more involved in the running of the union.&nbsp;</p><p>Often, it’s a democratic process, especially in unions with one member, one vote. What that means is, it’s a direct democracy – not only how you run your own shop, but how you can also influence policy and decision making at a higher level within the union itself. It’s really empowering to be able to understand that, but it is boring. So in a lot of ways, building that solidarity with coworkers and starting there and then meeting other people in your union local [is especially beneficial].&nbsp;</p><p>For example, I’m in News Guild 32035; it’s the Washington-Baltimore News Guild. I think there are dozens of units that exist in this local that are nonprofits, nonprofit newsrooms, places like The Washington Post, various other social justice nonprofits, [and so on]. I think the ACLU is there. Without participating, it’s difficult to meet those people. If you participate, you can. Suddenly, it’s not just about my unit of seven people – which is how small we are – it’s about the local of 1,000 who are all making decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>In the context of the election going the way it did this week, and with people being scared and concerned and feeling helpless, if we’re talking about labor organizing and unions in workplaces, how does that coalesce into broader power in or around politics? Because earlier you were talking about how we’re in a situation where 12 percent of workers are unionized. That’s obviously not a very big number, at least relative to how things were at other points in this country’s history. How can we build on that? How does it manifest even right now as a means of wielding political power?</p><p><strong>Mel: </strong>One good example, in terms of wielding political power, one only needs to look at the Labor For Palestine movement to see how you can employ the skills you learn when you participate in union democracy and when you organize within unions. Whether that means you’re a staff member getting paid to organize or whether you’re just a shop steward, those folks took that work ethic, that discipline, that formula for convincing and changing minds and getting people on board, and they walked it into the pro-Palestine movement. There is a large contingent of labor organizers who are both agitating within and without to build that sort of momentum, [to] lend that sort of experience to the BDS movement writ large, for example.&nbsp;</p><p>And again, it’s a long process. But that’s just one piece. You also see them doing the same sort of thing with door knocking for get out the vote. We saw a lot of union members doing that in states like California, Pennsylvania, and so on. So you can take those skills and apply them to a broader sort of coalition-building process. Really, it’s about what’s transferable. And when you’re building solidarity with your coworkers in your community, that’s also power building. That’s the kind of thing you need to create the bulwark against this no longer fascist creep, this fascist sprint.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Its new chips should be performing better, and the company will have an ETA on getting them there soon, according to Robert Hallock, Intel’s VP and GM of client AI and technical marketing, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/P2OHRH7221w?t=637s">new interview</a> with <em>HotHardware</em>’s Dave Altavilla and Marco Chiappetta.</p><p>Intel was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24265928/intel-core-ultra-200s-series-specs-release-date-pricing">up-front in saying</a> these new chips wouldn’t beat AMD’s chips for gaming. But reviewers’ findings have been unexpectedly poor. Despite some efficiency gains like those noted in Tom Warren’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24265928/intel-core-ultra-200s-series-specs-release-date-pricing"><em>Verge</em> review</a> of the Core Ultra 9 285K, the new chip seems to lag behind even Intel’s earlier Raptor Lake chips in gaming. That’s to say nothing of its performance versus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24288948/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">AMD’s very good Ryzen 9800X3D</a>.</p><p>Intel’s Arrow Lake chips’ “bones are solid,” Hallock said during the interview. Still, the company has identified factors “that can combine to produce some pretty wild unintended effects.” Hallock was also clear that the new Arrow Lake performance issues are strictly Intel’s responsibility, and not the fault of Microsoft or anyone else. </p><p>As for when Intel will provide an ETA on fixes, Hallock said Intel hopes to give a “comprehensive update” on what the chip’s issues are and what’s causing them by the end of November or early December. The good news is that the fix will be easy, according to Hallock, who called it a “flash the BIOS and update Windows kinda situation.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-selling-better-than-ps4-pro-in-%E2%80%98the-same-period%E2%80%99-sony-says.1031913/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-sales-better-ps4-pro/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Sony’s CFO, Hiroki Totoki, has gone on record suggesting that the PlayStation 5 Pro is selling just fine per the company’s expectations. In a recent statement, the CFO (also the firm’s COO) said that the PS5 Pro is ‘performing slightly stronger’ than the PS4 Pro did in the same period – in 2016.</p>



<p>He was frank in noting that Sony didn’t expect ‘large sales’ going into the manufacture of the console</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-under-the-impression">‘Under the Impression’</h2>



<p>In a recent statement grabbed <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Media-Entertainment/Sony-raises-revenue-forecast-on-strong-game-and-music-results" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Nikkei Asia</a>, Hiroki Totoki explained how things were looking for the PS5 Pro, which was released on November 7:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is a high-end product targeted at core customers, so we haven’t been eyeing a large sales plan to begin with.</p>



<p>I’m under the impression that the product is performing slightly stronger than the pre-orders of the PS4 Pro during the same period, so I don’t think it is adversely affecting the product’s sales plan.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Critics were quick to point out how strange it sounds that the CFO is merely ‘under the impression’ that the console is selling well, but let’s ignore that for now.</p>



<p>Ahead of the release of the PS5 Pro, a few issues surfaced that many believed would hamper sales of the console. Firstly, the price point – at $699.99, the PS5 Pro is one of the most expensive consoles released in <strong>a very long time</strong>, but that doesn’t appear to have been a problem. </p>



<p>Also, users were concerned that the console wouldn’t make ‘enough of a difference’ to warrant the upgrade. It’s technically impressive, but many will be reluctant to purchase something new just to tease a few extra frames or a little more clarity out of their console. </p>



<p>Regardless, financial projections at Sony are on the up, and if Totoki’s statement is anything to go by, so are sales of the PS5 Pro. How many of those sales have been claimed by scalpers, though? At least there’s now so much stock available in some markets that they’re being forced to sell them at a loss…</p>



<p>Did you invest in a PS5 Pro? Let us know in the comments.</p>

		<p>It might have more than double the storage of the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, but even with a 2TB SSD now built into the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, it’s pretty much inevitable that gamers are going to start to feel the pinch of having too many games installed. Thankfully, you still have the NVMe SSD slot to enable you to upgrade the console with some off-the-shelf PC parts.</p>
<p>Sony has the exact same recommendations and requirements for a third party NVMe drive, but there’s an added wrinkle for the PS5 Pro, if you consider that a lot of buyers will be upgrading from the base PS5. That’s the situation that we found ourselves in and how to handle it.</p>
<p><iframe title="How to upgrade PS5 Pro SSD, and&nbsp;transfer SSD from original PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pZ1y-l9ja2k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<h2>What SSD expansion drives are compatible with PS5 Pro?</h2>
<p>Just as with the base PS5, Sony states that any PS5 Pro SSD needs to be PCIe Gen 4 with a target sequential read speed of 5,500MB/s or faster and with a heatsink recommended. In practice, you can actually make do with less SSD speed, though compatible drives are now plentiful, and there’s plenty of options that are marketed as being PS5 compatible.</p>
<p>Head here for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/29/ps5-m2-ssd-expansion-what-drives-are-compatible-heatsink-guide/">more details on PS5 compatible SSDs</a>.</p>

<h2>Will you lose data if you transfer an SSD to a PS5 Pro?</h2>
<p>No. You will not lose data if you move an SSD between PS5 consoles. Similar to an external USB HDD for PS4 games and storage, an NVMe SSD that has games installed from one PS5 will almost seamlessly let you play all of those games on another PS5 console – though obviously, it’s a bit more complicated and technical to do the actual swap!</p>
<h2>How to install a PS5 Pro NVMe SSD</h2>
<p>The process to install an SSD in the PS5 Pro is very similar to that of the original PS5 and pretty much identical to the PS5 Slim.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A steady, clear, well-lit workspace</li>
<li>A #1 Phillips cross-head screwdriver (a magnetic screwdriver is very useful)</li>
<li>Your NVMe SSD</li>
</ul>
<p>Now just follow these steps, or watch the embedded video above.</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the console upside down, from the perspective of using it horizontally. The bottom of the PS5 has the face plate with the four PlayStation button symbols on it – not the PS logo. Have the front of the console (with the two USB-C ports and power button) facing you.</li>
<li>Remove the smaller of the two face plates on this side, lifting from the front and bending the plastic until you hear a click. Do NOT lift from the rear, as there are three retaining clips that are designed to hinge out of position.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>This will reveal the main air intake for the cooling fan and the grey metal plate covering the NVMe drive slot.<br>
We recommend turning the console around so that you are not reaching across the fan as you remove screws.</li>
<li>Remove the screw from the expansion slot cover and lift the cover out of place.<br>
This reveals five screw holes for each possible size of NVMe drive, each with a length number etched beneath, and with a screw and spacer by default in the 22110 position. The most common NVMe drive is 2280, so remove the screw and shift the metal spacer to the corresponding indent.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
<li>Take your NVMe drive and align with the expansion connector, with the notch lining up if you have the correct orientation (heatsink up). Angle the SSD in slightly, with the slot slightly raised from the base of the drive bay, and push firmly into place before laying the NVMe drive down flat onto the spacer.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
<li>Fasten the drive in place with the screw.</li>
<li>Replace the slot cover and secure with its screw.</li>
<li>Reattach the face plate, angling in the three retaining clips at the rear of the consoleand then firmly pressing in the other clip points until they click.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the SSD installed, you can now hook it back up to power and a screen and turn it on. If it’s a brand new SSD, the console will prompt you to format the drive, but if transferring from another PS5 console, it will instead automatically rebuild the SSD database and process all of the installed games to be playable.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you now have *even more* storage in your PS5 Pro!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/konami-snake-eater-remake-reaso/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is an ambitious remake of the legendary stealth action title released on PlayStation 2 in 2004. It has been in development at Konami for some time, and amidst ongoing content drops including screenshots and teaser trailers, it was revealed that it’ll be released in full in 2025.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, MGS’ series producer, Noriaki Okamura, revealed one of the driving reasons why Konami resolved to remake one of the most iconic games in the series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-was-basically-our-duty">‘It Was Basically Our Duty’</h2>



<p>In the most recent iteration of Play magazine (and circulated <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-exists-because-konami-was-starting-to-get-worried-that-the-younger-generation-of-gamers-arent-familiar-with-the-metal-gear-series-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by GamesRadar</a>), Noriaki Okamura sat down to talk about all things Metal Gear Solid. He revealed one of the core reasons why Konami decided to remake Metal Gear Solid 3 more than 20 years after it was first released:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the things that really sparked us to do the remake in general is because we realised that a lot of the newer, younger generation of gamers aren’t familiar with the Metal Gear series anymore.</p>



<p>It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations. After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say—but again, who is Solid Snake?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the 2000s, Metal Gear Solid 3 became one of my most beloved games, and I looped the story time and again. It felt so ahead of its time, boasting an immersive, lengthy story, an open-ended operating system, and unique camouflage, healing, and survival mechanics.</p>



<p>All that will be present in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but everything has been improved upon immensely for this ambitious remake.</p>



<p>Okamura raises a good point, though. The first Metal Gear game was in 1987, and the <strong>last </strong>major release in the series was in 2015 with Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. That’s about the time that Konami and Hideo Kojima, the creator of the series, fell out of one another’s good graces.</p>



<p>The team at Konami tried to release a survival horror MGS game called MG Survive in 2018, but it was am monumental flop.</p>



<p>It has been <strong>ten years </strong>since the last Metal Gear Solid game, and there being so much that came before means it’s daunting to a newcomer who just wants to get involved and see what the fuss is all about. Where do you even begin with a franchise this expansive? There are almost 40 years of history wrapped up in Metal Gear Solid.</p>



<p>Let’s hope that the Snake Eater remake isn’t the end of it.</p>

            <p>A number of NetEase Games employees have reportedly been arrested on charges of bribery and money laundering.</p>
<p>As picked up by Chinese site <a href="https://www.leiphone.com/category/industrynews/D1r2qIXu83HaLD5q.html">Leifeng.com</a> and reported by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/netease-says-police-detained-executives-for-alleged-bribery">Bloomberg Law</a>, NetEase Games' general manager, Xiang Lang, was detained along with NetEase's esports lead, Jin Yuchen, and several other staff on anti-corruption charges.</p>

<p>In an internal memo to staff, NetEase Games - which develops Marvel Rivals and Destiny: Rising - announced it has since dismissed a total of nine staff for alleged bribery. It's thought the case impacts 28 suppliers to the Chinese megacorp in a case worth roughly one billion yuan - that's £107.5 million / $139.3 million.</p>
<p>The names of those implicated have seemingly been removed from NetEase's internal systems and shortly after the arrests, staff still employed at the studio reported that their usual computer screensavers had been replaced by reminders of NetEase's compliance protocols.</p>
<p>This is reportedly the second internal anti-corruption investigation NetEase has organised since September 2023.</p>
<p>A NetEase spokesperson said police were now investigating alleged corruption charges but would not disclose more details at this time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We expect to see steep discounts on a number of gaming goods when many of the early sales <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569881/black-friday-deals-start-time-hours-cyber-monday-stores">kick off next week</a>, but if you want to shop ahead of time, <strong>Seagate’s 2TB Storage Expansion Card for the Xbox Series X / S<em> </em></strong>is already matching its all-time low of $199.99 ($160 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BJYXMDW/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/7x46p0sfha73r">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/gaming-drives/xbox-gaming/storage-expansion-for-xbox-series-x/">Seagate’s online storefront</a>.</p><p>While pricey, Seagate’s proprietary expansion cards are a great way to expand the storage capacity of your Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S. The NVMe-based, Microsoft-licensed cards — of which there are currently two — are incredibly easy to install, fast, and allow you to run games as if they were loaded on your console’s internal memory. That means they support Microsoft’s Quick Resume function and prevent you from having to shuffle downloads around, which you’d have to do if you were to purchase a USB-based external hard drive (those are limited to playing backward-compatible games).</p><p>Understandably, Sony’s approach to expandable storage, which lets PlayStation 5 owners upgrade their console with any PS5-compatible M.2 SSD, is still far more inviting. But Seagate’s proprietary option has been coming down in price since the introduction of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/2/23666795/western-digital-xbox-storage-expansion-card">Western Digital’s WD_Black C50</a>, and Seagate’s 2TB model is far easier to stomach now than with its original starting price of $399.99. Here’s hoping the current price drop is a sign of steeper cuts to come.</p><div><p>Proprietary SSD expansion for the Xbox Series X / S consoles.

They’re a pretty notable step up from the prior model — particularly if you use a Pixel phone — with a smaller build, an excellent transparency mode, and some of the best battery life you can get in a pair of noise-canceling earbuds. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24254109/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Read our review</a>.</li><li><strong>Nomad</strong> is running an <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/">early Black Friday sale</a> through the end of today, November 9th, allowing you to save 20 percent on a variety of accessories when you use coupon code <strong>EARLY20</strong>. The promo applies to a few <em>Verge </em>favorites, including the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/products/traditional-leather-case-brown-iphone-16-pro">Traditional Leather Case</a> for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max ($12 off) and a selection of <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/products/sport-band-naval">Apple Watch Sport Bands</a> ($12 off), along with the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://nomadgoods.com/products/stand-one-silver">Nomad Stand One</a> ($22 off). The latter isn’t as capable as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24224358/nomad-stand-one-max-third-gen-magsafe-qi2-charger-price-specs">Stand One Max</a>, but it still offers up to 15W MagSafe speeds and an ultra-premium design made of metal and glass. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24224358/nomad-stand-one-max-third-gen-magsafe-qi2-charger-price-specs">Read our Stand One review</a>.</li><li>In some ways, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22982833/best-fitbit-watch-fitness-tracker">best Fitbit you can buy</a> is actually the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable">Google Pixel Watch 3</a>. The <strong>Fitbit Charge 6 </strong>isn’t a bad alternative for fitness tracking, though, especially since it’s fallen to $99.95 ($100 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Exercise-Equipment-6-Months-Membership/dp/B0CC62ZG1M/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FFitbit-Charge-6-Black-aluminum-activity-tracker-with-infinity-band-silicone-obsidian-NFC-Bluetooth-1-33-oz%2F5087333627">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://howl.link/bxj1pg5hp12dh">Best Buy</a>. The high-end band features a color OLED screen and a solid suite of fitness-tracking tools, plus EKG, EDA, and SpO2 sensors. It also offers turn-by-turn navigation via Google Maps and a haptic side button, one that’s far better than the inductive groove on the previous model. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23958997/fitbit-charge-6-review-fitness-tracker-side-button">Read our review</a>.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As people continue to get stuck into Dragon Age: The Veilguard this weekend, developer BioWare has shared a number of interesting statistics about its playerbase, including confirmation that High Dragon Corius The Icetalon is the game's "deadliest" enemy.</p>
<p>So far, it looks pretty evenly split across classes - 40 percent of us are playing as Mages, whereas the other 60 percent is spread evenly across Rogues and Warriors. However, the lineage delineations are interesting with 43 percent of us choosing to be human and 40 percent as elf.</p>
<p>The final 17 percent splits across Dwarf and Qunari, at 6 percent and 11 percent, respectively.</p>

<p>Factions are also a little uneven: 24 percent of players opt to play as both Grey Wardens and Shadow Dragons, whilst 16 percent are Antivan Crows. 15 percent of us joined the Veil Jumpers, 11 percent the Lords of Fortune, leaving just one in 10 of us opting to become a Mournwatch.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, more of us have died during the Sea of Blood mission than anywhere else.</p> <div>

<p>Eurogamer's Robert Purchese had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">lot of good things to say about BioWare's latest Dragon Age in his five star review</a>. "From head to toe, wing to wing, The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling," he wrote. "It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
