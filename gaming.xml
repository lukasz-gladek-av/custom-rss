            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prey-2-human-head-studios-gameplay-footage-leak/">gameplay and concept footage</a> of what would've been the sequel to Human Head Studios' 2006 game Prey leaked online, published on YouTube across multiple videos from a channel listed under '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidhalsted2611">David Halsted</a>.' Today, that same channel no longer has any of the Prey 2 videos it previously had publicly listed, and instead, more gameplay footage appeared on an old <a href="https://forums.duke4.net/topic/12181-leaked-prey-1995/page__pid__385337#entry385337">Duke4 thread</a>, spotted by New Blood Interactive's <a href="https://x.com/DaveOshry/status/1964840297889997048">Dave Oshry</a>.</p>



<p>The original post includes an Imgur link, though following it at the time of this writing is fruitless, sense the page no longer appears. Oshry, however, compiled the footage and put it together in a nearly five-minute-long video that shows a very solid-looking slice of what Human Head Studios was cooking up with Prey 2.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The footage shows that Human Head Studios was building something that, if it had made it to release, would've been compared to CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077, since it appears to be well ahead of its time with the kind of sci-fi world and setting it would have featured.</p>



<p>Interestingly, this is actually the third time in the last week that Human Head Studios' Prey has come up. In a <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines">recent interview</a> with former Bethesda executive Pete Hines, besides Hines taking the time to comment <a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-arent-rewarding-content-makers/">on subscription services and Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass</a>, he also talked about the struggle he faced when it came time to decide what Arkane Austin would work on next, and how he lost in the battle for its name. </p>



<p>"<em>Don't even get me started on that</em>," Hines said in regard to Arkane Austin naming its 2017 game Prey. "<em>I definitely pissed some people off internally over that because I fought so hard against using that name. I'm the head of the spear, but I had a lot of people across my team – brand, PR and community – and we feel like we're burdening it with a name where we spend more time explaining why it's called Prey than we do talking about the game. I regret that I lost that battle. But nobody on this planet could have put more of a good faith effort into changing minds on that. My whole point was, look how much time we spend talking about what the game is versus why it's called this and like, that is wasted energy. That is wasted excitement. We could be turning that into something positive.</em>"</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see if more Prey 2 footage is published, or if an unreleased build of what Human Head Studios had appears online. For now, we can only watch and wonder at what might've been if Human Head's story had gone differently.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Best Buy is liquidating its warehouse with a big clearance sale on an oddball assortment of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842">Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch physical games</a>. However, to find deals worth potentially grabbing, you’ll have to dig through some gunk and a lot of sports games from a year ago to find some good games worth adding to your collection.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1964929126176866311">As spotted by the internet’s favorite deals guru, Wario64,</a> Best Buy is currently holding <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?browsedCategory=pcmcat1487698928729&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;loc=1719813&amp;qp=currentoffers_facet%3DCurrent+Deals%7EClearance%5Esoldout_facet%3DAvailability%7EExclude+Out+of+Stock+Items&amp;ref=388&amp;sp=Price-Low-To-High&amp;st=categoryid%24pcmcat1487698928729">a large video game clearance sale online and in stores</a> around the country. Is this more evidence that Best Buy, like other retailers, <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-buy-dvd-blu-ray-games-sales-stop-2024-1851136668">is looking to exit the physical video game space</a> and just fill stores up with more cellphones, old Funko Pops, and fridges? Perhaps, but regardless of why these games are on sale, they are cheaper than normal, and you get a physical copy, too. You can add these to your library or even pass down a copy of <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> or <em>Diablo IV</em> to your grandkids.</p> <p>Anyway, we dug through the junk to find some of the best games and biggest deals currently available via the Best Buy clearance sale. Keep in mind these might sell out at any time so this list might be out of date by the time you see it. Also, many games are only on sale on a specific platform, which we have listed below next to the usual price and the new sale price.</p> <ul> <li><em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> – Xbox – $8 ($15)</li> <li><em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands Next Level Edition</em> – Xbox – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Redfall</em> – Xbox – $10 ($70)</li> <li><em>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em> – Xbox – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Midnight Suns Enhanced Edition</em> – Xbox – $12 ($20)</li> <li><em>Deathloop</em> – PS5 – $13 ($60)</li> <li><em>Sponge SquarePants A Patrick Star Game</em> – $16 ($20)</li> <li><em>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged</em> – Xbox – $18 ($30)</li> <li><em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> – PS4 – $18 ($30)</li> <li><em>Diablo IV</em> – PS5 – $25 ($70)</li> <li><em>Core Keeper</em> – PS4 – $18 ($30)</li> <li><em>The Smurfs Village Party</em> – PS5 – $21 ($40)</li> <li><em>Super Bomberman R 2</em> – PS5 – $24 ($30)</li> <li><em>Samba de Amigo: Party Central</em> – Switch – $24 ($40)</li> <li><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> – Xbox – $26 ($50)</li> <li><em>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII: Reunion</em> – Xbox – $30 ($50)</li> <li><em>NFS Unbound</em> – Xbox – $30 ($50)</li> <li><em>Neon White</em> – PS5 – $32 ($40)</li> <li><em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</em> – Xbox – $31 ($70)</li> </ul> <p>And yeah, <em>Redfall</em> wasn’t a great game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-redfall-offline-update-4-arkane-austin-1851484821">but it got an offline mode not that long ago</a> and is easily worth $10 if you are hankering for a vampire-themed RPG shooter this Halloween season.</p>

                <p>Battlefield 2042’s recently released “Road to Battlefield 6” battle pass has proven to be a popular addition. Given it offers multiple cosmetic items for the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>, a boost in active players makes sense. And with a more active community now playing the game, EA has announced that a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1965067993185972329" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">small hotfix update</a> is coming tomorrow, September 9.</p><p>The main issue seemed to be based on progression. Some of the weekly missions involving the M1 Garand, for instance, weren’t tracking correctly in All Out Warfare. Some players also felt that the grind to unlock the free cosmetics was a bit much. This has led to a Tier Skip function--a feature that, depending on who you’re talking to, presents its own set of issues--allowing players to pay to advance through the ranks. The hotfix also addresses some weapon/gadget balancing, fixed a Playercard issue, and updated the Team Deathmatch playlist.</p>

We still have a while until it's ready for release, as we learned earlier this year, the project <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/">has only entered pre-production</a>, and we still have plenty of questions about what the sequel will look like, though if Keanu Reeves gets his way, we can count on at least one familiar face in the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel.</p>



<p>While speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">IGN</a> and promoting his new film, Good Fortune, Keanu Reeves confirmed that he would "<em>absolutely</em>" return to play Johnny Silverhand in the coming sequel.</p>



<p>"<em>Absolutely. I'd love to play Johnny Silverhand again</em>," Reeves said. Of course, for anyone who's played Cyberpunk 2077, there are doubts as to how Silverhand could make a return at all, but there's always the chance we see Reeves step back into the role in a flashback scene or something similar.</p>



<p>The last time we heard about the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel was when Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith spoke about what he saw on his last visit to CDPR, calling the new location they were developing "<em></em><em>like Chicago gone wrong.'</em>"</p>



<p>It would be nice to hear more soon, but the reality is we likely won't get any major details about the coming sequel until CD Projekt RED is through with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-take-some-cues-sapkowski-latest-book/">The Witcher 4</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-warhammer-40000-drukhari-codex-brings-long-awaited-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-warhammer-40-000-drukhari-codex-brings-long-awaited-update.1291779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced its new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> Drukhari codex. This codex provides new rules and updates to an army that has been starved of support for a while. It also introduces new units for that army.</p>

<h2>The <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Drukhari Codex Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/5jk5xmlb/lady-malys-stands-tall-over-the-new-codex-drukhari/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community</a> post, Games Workshop gave a preview of the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Drukhari Codex. The first major draw is the introduction of a new named unit. Lady Malys, the Archon of the Poisoned Tongue, as the name implies, brings swift and deadly swordplay to the battlefield alongside deadly poison. Poison that improves not just Malys' lethality, but the effectiveness of units under her.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-drukhari-codex-lady-malys-miniature.jpg?itok=ivSS0Wb9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-drukhari-codex-lady-malys-miniature.jpg?itok=WcZy0n8K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Alongside Lady Malys are new customizable archon miniatures. These miniatures will have new wargear options and alternate heads and bodies. These new archons will be featured in the new Realspace Raiders Battleforce box, which will contain a new archon, 10 Wyches, 10 Kabalite Warriors, 5 Hellions, 5 Scourges, 5 Incubi, and a Venom transport.</p>

<p>As for the quality-of-life improvements in the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Drukhari Codex, a few are highlighted. The book contains rules on five new detachments and a new Power from Pain army rule, which aligns with the Drukhari's sadomasochistic methods. The army rule will add new pain abilities to every unit's datasheet, which can be activated by spending pain points.</p>

<p>In addition, one of the new detachments features the body horror constructs known as the Haemonculi. The aptly named Coven of Agonies detachment includes a Talos, Cronos, 10 Wracks, and a Haemonculus unit, all dedicated to dangerous close-quarters combat.</p>

<p>The announcement of this new codex is a huge relief to Drukhari players since the army hasn't been updated since the announcement of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-40k-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Tenth Edition</a> back in the Summer of 2023. That is more than two years of new substantive updates or changes.</p>

                <p>Warhammer 40,000 fans have no shortage of games to choose from these days, but right now, one of the very best in the franchise is easily Space Marine 2. The sequel earned positive reviews and a dedicated fanbase when it launched last year, and one year later, it's getting a new limited edition with a bunch of DLC and a stylish steelbook case. Priced at $100 and available to preorder now, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FPYJXJC2,B0FPYQPKN2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Ultima Limited Edition</a> will be released on November 18 for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPYJXJC2?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPYQPKN2?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p><p>The steelbook case features artwork of an Ultramarine statue in white marble and gold accents on the front and a chiselled Tyranid enemy on the rear, exclusive to this release.</p><p>The Ultimate Limited Edition offers solid value, as it includes Season Pass 1, Season Pass 2, and the Macragge's Chosen DLC. For reference, the Season Pass 1 + 2 bundle retails for $70 on the PlayStation and Xbox Stores.

The game has sold millions of copies, with fans praising the sequel for its no-nonsense gameplay, satisfying action, and impressive graphics. "Space Marine 2 is a fantastic sequel that builds on its predecessor in every way, bombarding you with an overwhelming enemy and chaotic action that makes you feel like a small part of a much larger war," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/1900-6418276/">Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's review</a>.</p><p>Since launch, developer Saber Interactive has frequently updated the game with patches and new content, like the addition of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2s-new-siege-mode-unleashes-endless-waves-of-enemies/1100-6532761/">new Horde mode</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2-just-became-a-whole-lot-more-modder-friendly/1100-6531452/">better mod support</a>. One of the big things coming next year is the Techmarine, Space Marine 2's seventh playable class.

The feature was first added in Battlefield 1 and its sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-v/" data-ref-id="5000-482208">Battlefield V</a>, but was not included in 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2042</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the video clip, Ter-Lee-Comedy also posted a before-and-after comparison screenshot of a pristine weapon as shown in the Battlefield 6 open beta compared to one covered in grime from a more recent playtest.</p><p dir="ltr">The difference is substantial, with the dirt-covered weapon looking to be caked in mud. While the buildup of mud and dirt on weapons is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect gameplay, it's still a popular visual feature that many players have said help battles feel more immersive. However, it's worth nothing that just because the feature is in a playtest doesn't guarantee it will be in Battlefield 6 at launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Combined with the greater destructibility of Battlefield 6's buildings and environments (something that players found lacking in Battlefield 2042), the latest installment of the franchise looks to be bringing back what fans loved from past Battlefield games.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/charting-the-stars-the-spaceships-that-inspired-magic%E2%80%99s-edge-of-eternities.1291752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We've been having a ton of fun with the latest <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>&nbsp;set, <em>Edge of Eternities</em>, and I've been especially enjoying the new Spacecraft card type, which sees massive ships, stealthy fighters, and powerful stations enter the game. This got me thinking about how the set's been influenced by sci-fi and pop-culture, so I reached out to Andrew Brown, a Game Design Architect from Wizards of the Coast who worked on the set, to learn more.</p>

<p>To begin our conversation, I wanted to know how Andrew's favorite sci-fi ships shaped the design for Spacecraft in <em>Edge of Eternities.&nbsp;</em>"This has&nbsp;to be the Eternity Elevator," Brown explains. "The infinite elevator has been a staple of many IPs and porting it into&nbsp;the vastness of&nbsp;space&nbsp;is charming to me. I&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;help but think of what kind of music they play in the elevator that lasts forever."</p>

<p>I really like the Eternity Elevator, and agree with Andrew that I've always found that idea of an Elevator from Earth to a space station or the moon really thought-provoking, especially when used as a focal point to the story ala&nbsp;<em>The Fountains of Paradise</em>&nbsp;by Arthur C. Clarke or&nbsp;<em>Old Man's War</em>&nbsp;by John Scalzi. Heck, there's even the Umbilicus used to exchange inventions with the Mads in&nbsp;<em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em>!</p>

Deftly avoiding naming other IP's, Brown still provides a truly thought-provoking answer. "For me," he says, "it&nbsp;has to&nbsp;be the International Space Station.&nbsp;I am a sucker for 5 color commander decks and to me that captures the exact flavor of it.&nbsp;People from all over the world banding together to search the final frontier is poetic and full of hope."</p>

<p>I like the idea of the ISS as a Commander,&nbsp; which feels like it would have Convoke to help get that message of universal cooperation through. Maybe we need a set of real-world spaceships in a future Secret Lair. I mean, <em>Assassin's Creed</em> got <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/ACR/en-us/193/leonardo-da-vinci" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, why can't we get Apollo 11?</p>

Image: NASA</figcaption></figure><p>Many spaceships in pop culture seem to take on a life and personality of their own (sometimes literally, in the case of <em>Alien</em>, <em>2001</em>, and many more). So I wanted to know from Andrew, which&nbsp;<em>EoE</em>&nbsp;Spacecraft, in his opinion, has the biggest personality of the set?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"<a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/EOE/en-us/238/dawnsire-sunstar-dreadnought" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dawnsire, Sunstar Dreadnought</a> easily has the most personality," Brown answers. "It knows&nbsp;it's&nbsp;the&nbsp;biggest,&nbsp;baddest&nbsp;and strongest around. No need&nbsp;to&nbsp;tell&nbsp;anyone!&nbsp;They know.&nbsp;20/20? Check. 100 damage? Check. The queen of the runway."</p>

<p>He'll find no argument from me on that one. My first encounter with Dawnsire was during the pre-release, where my opponent blasted that 100 damage at his own creature enchanted with&nbsp;<a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/EOE/en-us/151/pain-for-all" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pain for All</a>, smoking me for 100 to the dome.</p>

Which ship would he choose, and&nbsp;who’s&nbsp;in charge of the navigation?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We would live on the&nbsp;<a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/EOE/en-us/35/the-seriema" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Seriema</a>," Brown answers.&nbsp;"Magic design is a rag tag group of&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;from a ton of&nbsp;different&nbsp;backgrounds, so&nbsp;it's&nbsp;only fitting that we fly in the ship that embodies that&nbsp;mantra.&nbsp;Not to brag, but I would&nbsp;be in charge of&nbsp;navigation. I always remember which floor my car is&nbsp;parked in the parking lot."</p>

<p>"I can&nbsp;also&nbsp;intuit&nbsp;where every&nbsp;Starbucks&nbsp;is in any city with no map!" That's no easy feat for a company headquartered in Seattle, and will serve the MTG design crew well in their journeys across the Eternities.</p>

What are they sleeping on, and why does it deserve more love?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"<a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/EOE/en-us/242/extinguisher-battleship" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Extinguisher Battleship</a> deserves more love," says Brown. "It's&nbsp;a ship with one goal, destroy. How can you not fall in love with something so simple, compelling, and terrifying?"</p>

Former Bethesda marketing chief Pete Hines has been chatting about the ups and downs of videogame subscription platforms, such as Microsoft's Game Pass service, GeForce Now and whatever the hell Ubisoft are calling theirs at the minute. Subisoftscription? UbiPassPlus? Answers on a postcard.</p>
<p>Hines is broadly of the opinion that subscription platforms are failing many of the developers who sign up to publish through them, though he cautions that his experience is out-of-date - he retired from Bethesda in October 2023.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In his time at Bethesda under Microsoft, Hines helped Bethesda bring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> to Xbox Game Pass. He seems to regret this. "I'm not working in any of these companies anymore, and so I don't assume that everything I knew while I was in the industry still holds true today," Hines told <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines?trk=public_post_comment-text">DBLTAP</a> this month. "At the same time, I'm involved enough to know I saw what I considered to be some short sighted decision making several years ago, and it seems to be bearing out the way I said. 
</p>
<p>
"Subscriptions have become the new four letter word, right? You can't buy a product anymore. When you talk about a subscription that relies on content, if you don't figure out how to balance the needs of the service and the people running the service with the people who are providing the content - without which your subscription is worth jack shit - then you have a real problem. 
</p><p>
"You need to properly acknowledge, compensate and recognize what it takes to create that content and not just make a game, but make a product," Hines went on. "That tension is hurting a lot of people, including the content creators themselves, because they're fitting into an ecosystem that is not properly valuing and rewarding what they're making." 
</p>
<p>
Hines didn't go into proper specifics, so it's left to me, a no-nothing figures-averse jackass, to scrabble together what relevant insights I can in the closing seconds of this awful Monday. 
</p>
<p>
The battle lines for whether game subscription services are The Industry's second coming or the work of the Devil (why not both, etc) are pretty well-drawn at this point. Anecdotally, at least, subscription models appear to make people less willing to spend money on individual new games. They indisputably grant more power to platform holders and storefronts. 
</p>
<p>
Platform holders such as Microsoft have often contended that the relationship between the New Hotness of subscription and the olde worlde approach of owning (a license to play) a game is complementary. They suggest that a healthy subscription business will spill over into separate purchases down the line - for example, people buying games that are no longer part of the subscription library.</p><p>Without wishing to portray myself as a comprehensive researcher - see "no-nothing jackass", above - I have come across <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167811625000187#s0145">one study of Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus</a> that appears to bear elements of the latter argument out, showing that in contrast to the music or movie and TV industry, these subscription services have not "substantially cannibalized existing revenue streams". 
</p>
<p>
Still, that's treating the income from games on those platforms as a block. Individual developers have reported different returns from adding their games to subscription platforms. Posting on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369880832481660928?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7369880832481660928%2C7369898365943218176%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287369898365943218176%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7369880832481660928%29">LinkedIn</a> this week in response to Hines's comments above, former Xbox Game Studios vice-president Shannon Loftis suggested that games often suffer for appearing on Game Pass, unless they include a bunch of ways to make money after release. "While [Game Pass] can claim a few victories with games that otherwise would have sunk beneath the waves (Human Fall Flat, e.g.)," she wrote, "the majority of game adoption on Gap comes at the expense of retail revenue, unless the game is engineered from the ground up for post-release monetization."
</p>
<p>
The other question is whether subscription models are really worth it for the platform holders themselves, given that historically, subscription models have tended to rely on undercharging at first, then belatedly raising the price and making your money back once you've got the audience hooked.</p>
<p>In July, Microsoft reported $5 billion in revenue from Game Pass over the past year. Sources <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1941918116218638368">have told</a> Chris Dring, formerly of GamesIndustry.biz, that "Xbox Game Pass is profitable, even when you factor in the lost sales for its first-party teams". It doesn't appear profitable enough, however, going by Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">recent mass layoffs</a>, but then again, it feels like Microsoft could  pioneer a way to literally grow money on trees right now and still find cause to punt a hundred QA testers into the sea.
</p><p>
I don't have a Game Pass subscription myself, partly because I'm trying to support <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">the BDS campaign against Microsoft</a>. In general, I don't like subscription models because it feels like paying rent, and thereby teaches me to think of playing games as even more of a value-extraction exercise. I feel pressured to download and play a load of games to maximise the return on my investment, and then I start to loathe myself, because somebody poured heart and soul into e.g. that cottagecore feline frisbee simulator, and here I am shovelling it down to meet quota. How are you getting on with such things?

              <p>Have we hit peak licensed Lego set? Maybe. The brick builder toy maker has been releasing more and more elaborate sets based on famous franchises at higher and higher prices. The new Lego Death Star <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-death-star-1000-most-expensive-set-star-wars-size-release-date-2000623168">will be $1,000</a>. What fools would pay that much for plastic? But now Lego has teased an upcoming <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> set that’s probably the Enterprise-D and now <a href="https://youtu.be/nF-SR2UwGQ8?si=EEuRI0PGtYYUfzYw">I am that fool</a>.</p> <p>That’s because on Monday, Lego teased a new collaboration with <em>Star Trek</em> that saw Patrick Stewart’s Captain Jean-Luc Picard beamed into the Enterprise-D as a Lego figurine. Every nostalgic licensed cash-in seems silly until they finally find the one you can’t live without. A <em>Star Trek: TNG</em> Enterprise is about as close to that for me as you can get. I’m not saying I would make poor choices with my family’s finances to make whatever this set is show up on my doorstop at some point, but I’m not saying I wouldn’t either.</p>   <p>While an Enterprise-D Lego set seems like a sure bet with this tease out there, leaks from last month have only fueled fan speculation. Based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1mfzqbr/icons_10356_star_trek_uss_enterprise_d_via_4chan/">a 4chan leak</a> of the images, which may or may not be accurate but certainly looked convincing, the set will be 3600 pieces and ship November 28 for $400. Fans will get the Enterprise plus mini-figures of Picard, Riker, Worf, Geordi, Data, Dr. Crusher, Wesley Crusher, Troi, and Guinan.</p>   <p>The Enterprise-D is the only toy model I ever put together and it’s the only Lego set I’d ever consider spending $400 on. But it’s not the only <em>Star Trek</em> set I’d get out my wallet for. A Klingon Bird of Prey? A Romulan Warbird? Don’t get me started on the Borg Cube. I would, in time, buy and build them all. The best part? Because it’s Lego I can create my very own three-nacelle Enterprise from the <em>TNG</em> series finale “All Good Things.” Fine. You win Lego. Make it so!</p>

              <p>A sketchy home Wi-Fi system will drive you nuts in so many ways. Streaming fails, sudden lag fits during an intense gaming session, and those awful dead spots that somehow seem to move around the house — they all mean your home network is outdated or just too weak to give you a strong signal throughout the house.</p>
<p>A mesh Wi-Fi network is the answer — one hardwired mothership and two wireless beacons render your old router and extenders moot and give you a powerful, consistent signal everywhere. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3961/">Right now Amazon is running a great $140 sale on the TP-Link Deco X55 AX3000 Wi-Fi 6 mesh system</a>, which blankets up to 6,500 square feet in a signal strong enough to banish those dead spots and eliminate those laggy streaming and gaming sessions.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3961/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lose the Boosters</h2>
<p>Wi-Fi boosters and wall-outlet range extenders were the best weapons against Wi-Fi dead spots and weak signals for years, but even at their best they only gave you marginal relief. As both Wi-Fi and the devices that rely on Wi-Fi evolved, those boosters and extenders fell way behind the times, and the mesh network stepped up to take on the fight.</p>
<p>TP-Link was one of the early adopters of mesh technology, and this is one of their better systems at an exceptional price. Each one of the 3 units has three Gigabit ports if you want or need to hardwire, and the easy-to-install network supports up to 150 devices to ensure you’re not experiencing web traffic jams when everyone logs in at the same time. The difference you’ll immediately experience is huge&nbsp; — speeds of up to 3,000Mbps, with TP-Link’s AI-Driven Smart Mesh technology that learns your network environment and user behaviors and adjusts on the fly to optimize your signal.</p>



<h2>Bigger and Safer</h2>
<p>The 6,500 square foot range of the TP-Link Deco X55 network is enough to cover most homes and often backyards or garages in a powerful signal. But if your home or property outstretch that coverage, adding another TP-Link Deco beacon is an inexpensive and amazingly easy solution — just plug it in and the network immediately adds it, and your signal and coverage grow.</p>
<p>The TP-Link Deco X55 mesh network is also sure to upgrade your home internet security, with a real-time network scanner that automatically detects threats, robust and easy to operate parental controls, and for an extra $6 per month or $55 per year you can install TP-Link’s HomeShield Pro service for DDoS attack prevention, advanced parental controls, and more.</p>

            <p>If you peered into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-borderlands-4-celestial-empire-building-and-the-first-big-dune-awakening-dlc">Edwin's maw</a> this morning, you might have seen that Trainatic's out today, September 8th. Well, having now given its demo a go, I can waft away a bit more of the billowing steam of mystery for those standing on the platform who're considering boarding.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There's a thing you'll say very quickly once you fire up either the demo or full version of this train-builder from developer Ryan Forrester, whose previous works include idle frog collector <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/croakoloco-is-not-an-idle-game-because-simply-being-around-frogs-is-a-powerfully-worthwhile-activity">Croakoloco</a> and cleaning sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2113490/Mess_Quest/?curator_clanid=43192431">Mess Quest</a>. It's the following: 'Oh crikey, my train's stopped already.'</p>
<p>You see, while the aim of the game is to build a train that can chug along for ages, the loco you start with runs out of fuel when it's barely left the station. That's ok, though. You've got a machine gun perched on the single car behind your engine, and you can use it to shoot some trees during your next trip. This, as well as just running over trees which are perched too close to the tracks (though that understandably damages your loco), is how you gather resources to upgrade the train.</p>
<p>With fuel being the limiting factor on journey length early doors, I invested in improvements to both capacity and efficiency for that off the bat. Soon, with help from an upgrade that let me add an extra car to my train, beginning the process of <strong>enlengthening</strong>, I had a fuel support carriage which would replenish a bit of fuel whenever I shot a tree with my gun.</p>

<p>From there, I began to upgrade the likes of my loco's speed, its firepower, and its storage capacity. Some of the numbers assigned to these upgrades seemed a bit nebulous in terms of how exactly they corresponded to my loco's performance on the tracks, but I didn't much mind that given Trainatic's relatively chill approach to things. As a result of what's a bit of a grindy start, though everything's simple and quick enough that it doesn't drag, I started going on journeys that felt a bit less like brief jaunts down the road. That's when I saw it.</p><p>A pinkish purple orb, spinning its way across the dark and earthy terrain of the woodland surrounding the tracks. Back at the station, a line from my faceless trainmaster, speculating about some strange power that could be linked to the neon interloper. Hmmm.</p>
<p>While I've unlocked automatic acceleration to go alongside the automatic trigger finger Trainatic offers, it's not enough of an idler that I'll be able to pursue this orbnigma while doing something far less important in another tab. So, my full attention will have to be on the train building, the task of taping together a Thomas the tank teeming with tech to ponder those damn orbs.</p>
<p>So far, the game's steadily constructing what almost feels like a stripped-back rail roguelike, and one that's worth at least hopping on for a free test ride. If you fancy doing so, you can find both the demo and full version of Trainatic on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3208560/Trainatic/">Steam</a>, with the latter costing £3.99/$4.79/€4.71 as of writing, thanks to an offer running until September 22nd.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fans have been waiting almost a decade to go hands-on with <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and the hype was off the charts. Now that people are finally playing, those expectations have been brought back down to earth. <em>Silksong</em> is a good game. Maybe even a great one. But it is also a hard one. Harder than the first game? That depends on who you ask. While players rave about their favorite new characters, secrets, and boss fights, other are bouncing off the game, feeling unwelcomed by the new Metroidvania Soulslike.</p> <p>One of the biggest differences between<em> Silksong</em> and the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> is that enemies hit harder earlier in the game. Instead of taking one mask of damage off Hornet, even some rank-and-file minions can knock two off with each hit. Add to that the fact that Hornet can’t heal until a full wheel of silk has been earned and you have a recipe for an uncompromising early game. Maps and UI elements must also be purchased as upgrades, leaving newcomers who tend to easily get lost in 2D mazes scrambling more than usual to figure out where to go and what to do.</p> <p>“My wife is a massive <em>Hollow Knight</em> fan and has been waiting for <em>Silksong</em> to come out for years,” reads one of the biggest threads on the<em> Silksong</em> subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nb6u1r/my_wife_has_been_waiting_for_years_for_silksong/">from this weekend</a>. “She is not the most skilled of players but she was able to complete <em>Hollow Knight</em> and enjoy her time. <em>Silksong</em>, instead, is breaking her apart. She has spent three days fighting Moorwing without beating it and she’s dropping the game for good. I hope she’ll pick it back up sometime but it’s sad to see all the anticipation die out like this.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000624073" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624073"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624073">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>Moorwing has been brutalizing many players in the Greymoor section of the game. The flying moth has lots of attacks that are tricky to dodge, and it requires a shocking number of hits to finally bring down. There are ways to accidentally skip the fight altogether or cheese him into submission, but if you’re just grinding <em>Silksong</em> out without searching for guides or trying to exploit tricks, it’s a pain in the ass, one of those fights for true Soulslike sickos and not necessarily for the people who come to <em>Hollow Knight</em> for the worldbuilding, exploration, and wonderful characters.</p> <h2>Is <em>Silksong</em> really harder than <em>Hollow Knight</em>?</h2> <p>There’s a good comment on the <em>Silksong</em> Steam discussion page that breaks down some of what might be going on with the initial reaction to the sequel. “People are complaining because this game doesn’t give them nail upgrades and an early charm system with charms that trivialize a lot of boss mechanics for 3/4th of the entire game, and instead attempts to get its players to recognize tells, queues, patterns, positioning, and programmed it’s enemies to specifically punish overly aggressive or greedy play,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1nbjivd/thats_the_best_comment_about_the_games_difficulty/">it reads</a>.</p>

 <p>Instead of treating <em>Hollow Knight</em> like a tutorial for <em>Silksong</em>, this argument claims some players are treating the new game like a continuation of the old one instead of recognizing the clear yet subtle differences, including a diagonal downward attack that complicates combat and platforming, especially for people used to the first game’s more straightforward up/down pogo-ing on top of enemies. Though there are Crests players can find in <em>Silksong</em> even early on to help make the game easier, it seems clear Team Cherry also made a point of not greasing the wheels with combat as much as it did with <em>Hollow Knight</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hunter's March is insane bro.</p> <p>Crazy difficult platforming and the enemies are hard too 💀</p> <p>These stupid bugs took FOREVER to beat. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Silksong?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Silksong</a> <a href="https://t.co/2EAEAnq5Vq">pic.twitter.com/2EAEAnq5Vq</a></p> <p>— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1964177257175363631?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Enemies deal more damage, take longer to kill, and some of the longer run-backs after you die to a boss can be lowkey soul crushing. <a href="https://cdn.steamusercontent.com/ugc/13783810008345348251/6E499B8A265A90E34485F5954B0681F9DC5C8C8A/">Here’s a 30-second clip</a> of a player going back to the Act 1 boss after dying, a trek which includes more than one non-trivial platforming section. Whether players ultimately enjoy it or not, the double damage many enemies do compared to Hollow Knight is already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nb11gc/a_meme_about_silksongs_difficulty/">the biggest meme</a> coming out of<em> Silksong</em>‘s launch. “The reason it took so long to come out: Team cherry was trying to beat the game before they released it,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nbgmfr/the_reason_it_took_so_long_to_come_out/">one fan joked</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Silksong</em> is too hard vs. <em>Silksong</em> is bad</h2> <p>The post-launch conversation around the <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel has generally followed this arc, forking along to parallel tracks over the weekend. First: “Yay, it’s out!” Second: “Check out cool thing X.” Third: “Boss fight Y was incredible” or “Help, I can’t stop dying.” And finally: “This game is too hard and it’s the best” or “This game is too hard and it sucks.” We’re at the point where an initial backlash to how much more punishing <em>Silksong</em> is has been followed by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nbbr79/yes_team_cherry_isnt_above_criticism_but_that/">a backlash to the backlash</a>. Much of it essentially boils down to: okay, maybe <em>Silksong</em> is much harder but that doesn’t make it worse than <em>Hollow Knight</em>.</p> <p>My guess is that there are two things going on here. The first is that <em>Silksong</em> is reaching a much wider audience at launch than <em>Hollow Knight</em> ever did, and I would guess many of those players are coming to it from non-Souls-inspired backgrounds. They are here for the neat story, excellent art, and top-notch Metroidvania exploration, not necessarily the “git gud” grind that comes with hitting what seems like an insurmountable challenge you that you persevere through, knowing eventually, whether hours later or days later, you will overcome it.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000624072" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624072"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624072">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>The second is that so much is riding on <em>Silksong,</em> following years of hype and secrecy, that everyone is extra touchy about the possibility it could be <em>worse</em> than <em>Hollow Knight</em>. We’ve all been there. You go to see a movie you were really excited for. It washes over you in haze. There were parts you loved. You talk about them outside the theater with friends. Than days go by, weeks, years even, and you eventually admit it wasn’t as good as you hoped. Disappointment sucks! Do I think most people are actually disappointed with<em> Silksong</em>? Not at all. But I think any naysaying this early on in the “honeymoon period” of a new indie darling’s release can feel like an attack.</p> <p>TL;DR: the internet is currently designed to make negativity go viral, which elicits defensive hyperbole in response.</p>

 <p>What’s clear is that there’s a not-insignificant number of people already feeling burnt out on<em> Silksong</em> or bouncing off of it entirely because of its less forgiving design. “I beat <em>Hollow Knight</em> twice through (Radiance), I love the game and its world and its vibes and everything you mentioned, and I’m currently falling out of love with a sequel I desperately WANT to enjoy, due to a difficulty curve that feels completely out of sync with<em> Hollow Knight</em>’s,” wrote one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nbbr79/yes_team_cherry_isnt_above_criticism_but_that/">on the subreddit</a>. “I’m handling the difficulty fine, but it’s just exhausting,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nbdetn/comment/nd1gtpu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote another</a>. “I think <em>Silksong</em> is beautiful and a masterpiece, but the two mask damage is tiring. Most people WILL have a skill issue, even if they’re managing, so rather than the game be fully enjoyable like <em>Hollow Knight</em>, it will create exhaustion which is not fun.”</p> <p><em>Silksong</em> doesn’t have difficulty options or any other way to mitigate its challenge outside of in-game remedies like finding certain upgrades and Crests as early as possible. We’ll see if that ultimately holds it back from the same level of fawning adoration that its predecessor achieved, or if Team Cherry decides to address the skill gap in a post-launch update. Purists will be able to say they were there on day-one with their double-damage victories intact to prove it, but at least that way everyone else can discover the rest of the special game Team Cherry spent seven years making.</p>

If you want a home arcade cabinet that doesn't take up much space, I'd highly recommend the Evercade Alpha. It's my favorite home arcade machine I own due to its premium build and versatility offered by the cartridge library.

            <p>Hollywood actor Keanu Reeves has said he would love to reprise the role of Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">Reeves spoke to IGN</a> while promoting his new film Good Fortune, in which he plays an angel, fittingly. Apparently it's funny. When asked by IGN whether he'd like to be in CD Projekt Red's new Cyberpunk game, Reeves answered, "Absolutely. I'd love to play Johnny Silverhand again."</p>
<p>We don't know much about Cyberpunk 2 other than it will feature a new city that Cyberpunk TTRPG creator Mike Pondsmith - who collaborated heavily on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">recently described as "Chicago gone wrong"</a>. We also know the in-development game is called Project Orion and has around 80 people working on it, and is in pre-production.</p>
<p>The question of Reeves' involvement I expect depends on what part Johnny Silverhand will play in the second Cyberpunk game, if any. The entire plot of Cyberpunk 2077 revolved around Silverhand, so his story has been told, and it did have an end to it.</p><p>There's a possibility that Silverhand could still appear in a sequel but it depends which ending CDPR decides is canon in the game - all of which sounds like too fussy a narrative proposition to me. It may be simpler to rule Reeves and Silverhand out.</p>
<p>Ruling Reeves out, though, would mean no more iconic "you're breathtaking" moments on an E3 stage. But sometimes such sacrifices have to be made. Also, it would leave the proverbial door open for CDPR to hire another big name in Reeves' place.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> famously featured actor Idris Elba, and Charles Dance featured in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>. The Polish studio has a penchant for hiring big-name talent. The question is, who could it pick? My money's Sean Bean. Or Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="NBA 2K26 Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158559/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>As much as I can understand the derision from some quarters regarding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">FC 26</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden</a> — any of these big sports' games in their yearly, money-grubbing modern forms — I have, unfortunately, got a few of them to thank for several things that I enjoy in life these days. One of which is the old basketballs.</p>
<p>For most of my life, Basketball was a game where people ran up and down a court, scoring and then letting the other team score. There was no discernible defence, no strategy, nothing other than to be incredibly athletic and awesome and beautiful - and good at going airborne. Oh, and if you had a gigantic wobbly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/nba_jam">NBA Jam</a> head and a pair of fireproof sneakers, well, all the better.</p>
<p>Then I played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nba_2k25">NBA 2K</a>. And I got hooked. I went deep and I learned a whole lot about this most strategic, defensive, and awe-inspiring sport of kings. Yes, I do love basketball nowadays, and this series right here taught me everything (genuinely, literally everything) I know about the sport - beyond giant heads and shoes on fire.</p>
<figure><a title="NBA 2K26 Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158558/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So! I am an NBA 2K enjoyer, for all of its flaws, and with this in mind, I do believe this year's game, <em>in its current form,</em> is the most knockabout arcade-styled one I've played in ages. It's a hell of a lot of fun right now - and you can be damn sure they'll patch a lot of that fun out.</p>
<p>The shooting feels pleasingly easy to get into the rhythm of, with three-pointers proving much more reliable, and I'm finding that superstar players move, react, and play notably better on court than their mere mortal counterparts, ensuring there's plenty of spectacular dunking to be had. We've got a game here that's been providing me with a ton of fast-paced, action-packed, and very OTT b-ball good-times in both online and offline modes...on the PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>Yes, I just said dirty words on the Nintendo site. But I've been an idiot, you see, and threw away my money for early access (which we didn't get on Switch 2) on Sony's platform. If I were reviewing <em>that</em> version, which I don't mind admitting I'm addicted to, I'd give it a 9/10, absolutely no issue. I'd talk about how its various modes, whilst still way too busy with menus — and the constant noise of special offers that want to rinse you for all your real-world cash — feel more harmoniously in sync this time out.</p>
<figure><a title="NBA 2K26 Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158556/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I'd point to how 2K has finally managed to give us a shooting system that feels like it's letting me be properly in control in driving to the net, in making space, jostling, shooting on a dime. Improved animations help in this regard, but the underlying mechanics have been smartly reworked and make for game that's way less frustrating and random on offence and defence.</p>
<p>There'd be applause for how I can use MyTeam bits and bobs to compete and earn things in online park games with other humans more freely, for how there are more ways to criss-cross and press on with unlocking goodies in the mode you're throwing every waking hour into (spoiler alert: it's MyTeam all the way). Heck, I'd even say "Well done, 2K," on making the menus just that little bit easier to parse. It feels better on the UI front this year, easier to navigate.</p>
<p>On the court, I'd speak of the sweat, the glistening skin and the expressive — sort of — faces. It's all very shiny and nice and exactly what you'd expect from a series that bathes in your money. It also runs at a super-smooth 60fps on PS5 and looks crystal clear on my big telly. Wow. So much positivity! However, of course, and as you know, this is all leading to the bit where I say that this isn't the case on Switch 2.</p>
<figure><a title="NBA 2K26 Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158560/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn't the case on Switch 2. There. It's better that it's out, I feel lighter. Yes, as much as the 2K faithful expected this year's release to hit 60fps, which will be a game-changer if or when it does happen, it ain't going down in 2025. Not unless we get a magic patch. This is, once again, 30fps only. It's a super-solid 30fps this year, so...silver linings?</p>
<p>Am I surprised? No, not really. And I'll be totally honest, it doesn't bother me <em>hugely</em>. After an hour of playing, I'd picked up the rhythm and forgotten about it for the most part. But that's me.</p>
<p>Less forgivable is the fact that we've only got slightly better resolution than Switch 1's previous 2K efforts. It's not unplayable, but it's a little blurry, and a bit of a letdown - especially given that the graphics on Switch 2 have very obviously been shifted to the lowest settings. It still looks great, I should make clear, these games always do, and it is clearer — to my mind, at least — than Switch 1 2K25. But Jeezo, I think we all expected better from this series on what is substantially more powerful hardware. Surely more could have been done?</p>
<figure><a title="NBA 2K26 Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158566/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Apart from the downgrading of visuals, halving of the frame rate, and disappointing resolution, there's something else. Everything else I can, and will, live with. However, there's no cross-play — understandable with the frame rate disparity — and there's also no cross-saving or progression. Which is mind-boggling to me at this point. Why can't I at least progress my offline modes on multiple platforms? And why should anyone pay the same price for the game on this platform when it's therefore a lesser product with a much smaller pool of online players?</p>
<p>Head online and it's a ghost town on Switch 2 for this reason, just days after release, I'm currently wandering around barren courts, waiting in line for a game that'll likely never take place by the looks of things. This has a huge impact on how everything gels, how alive and busy and organic things feel, and it makes it more difficult to actually progress in-game to boot.</p>
<p>To finish on a more positive note, I want to point out that if you do buy in for the single-player experience — if that's what you're here for, and if this is your only platform to play on — you still have a lot to get through with the ever-excellent MyNBA Eras, MyGM, MyPlayer, and all the historically informative and really excellent additions that've been added over the past few years. The menus, I will also say, are faster and more responsive than usual on a Switch console, so you are saved the constant heartache of being sat waiting to load into a mode or menu, which is a nice upgrade.</p>
<figure><a title="NBA 2K26 Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158561/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Would I buy NBA 2K26 if I only have a Switch 2? As a fan of the series, probably. But I wouldn't be entirely happy about it. I'd be giving off behind your back about the lack of finesse in delivering this stuff.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>NBA 2K26 on Switch 2 fails to deliver the 60fps gameplay we've all been holding out for. It also runs at a lower resolution than I would have expected, and its online modes, thanks to no cross-play or cross-progression are ghost towns.</p>
<p>However, if this is your only platform, and if you are okay with 30fps, there is still a huge festival of basketball to enjoy here. This is a game packed full of fun modes, and it'll teach you everything you could ever need to know about the sport whilst giving you some fine on-court action to boot. Here's hoping for a patch down the line, but 2K26 comes off as a great game underperforming on Switch 2 at launch.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo is famously an extremely litigious company, going to great lengths to <a href="https://wccftech.com/genki-gets-sued-for-its-nintendo-switch-2-replica-says-itll-respond-thoughtfully/">sue anyone</a> who even so much as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">breathes</a> on its copyright. It's also usually successful in its legal pursuits, and a settlement in a recent case is its latest success. As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-wins-2-million-settlement-against-switch-modchip-seller-who-previously-denied-wrongdoing/">VGC</a>, Ryan Daly, who ran the online store Modded Hardware, agreed to pay Nintendo $2 million to settle Nintendo's case against Daly, rather than try to take it to court.</p>



<p>The legal battle began in July 2024, with Nintendo filing a complaint against Daly, though their communication began a few months prior in March, when Nintendo contacted Daly, warning him that they would pursue legal action if Daly did not cease the sale of Nintendo Switch mod chips and the "<em>trafficking in circumvention devices</em>." Per the complaint in July, Daly initially agreed to comply with the request, though continued to sell modchips and offer services allowing people to send in their own Switch devices to Daly and get modded Switch consoles back.</p>



<p>Daly argued that he was looking for a new lawyer, and when Nintendo filed its complaint in July, Daly answered with his own defence, and denied "<em>any wrongdoing</em>" on his part. </p>



<p>Now, however, instead of taking the case to court, he's agreed to pay Nintendo $2 million for his lack of wrongdoing, and comply with a "<em>permanent injunction</em>" that prevents Daly from selling modded consoles, handling modded consoles, promoting them, or providing others with information on how to mod console hardware.</p>



<p>Other recent suits from the Mario company include it going after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/yuzu-switch-emulator-hit-by-nintendo-lawsuit-seeking-damages-and-total-shutdown-of-the-software/">Switch emulator Yuzu</a>, a streamer who <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-sues-gamer-who-streamed-unreleased-and-pirated-titles-while-pocketpair-shares-details-of-palworld-lawsuit/">livestreamed pirated copies of old Nintendo games</a>, and of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">its pursuit against Palworld maker, PocketPair.</a></p>

It’s just small $5 discount, but this is something that’s worth jumping on if you’re planning international travel any time soon. Its slim design aside, I like that it has four ports (two USB-C, two USB-A), and support for Type A, I, G, and C plugs, which allows it to work in over 200 countries and regions, according to Anker. In terms of USB power, it’s on the slow side — best for when you want to charge gadgets overnight. For instance, one of the USB-C ports can deliver 20W to a device, or you’ll get 15W total when you’ve got two USB-C devices plugged in. Using all four ports will split 15W across devices.</span></li><li><span>Another inexpensive accessory that’d be great for travel, or even just for your daily commute, is <strong>Anker’s Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds</strong> that have active noise cancellation. They’re typically priced at around $79.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Auto-Adjustable-Cancelling-Wireless-Headphone/dp/B0B1LVC5VZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, but they recently dropped down to $44.99 in the white, blue, or black. This model can last 10 hours on a charge, and its wireless charging-supported case can fully recharge them five times, totaling 50 hours of playback. These also support multipoint, letting you connect to two devices at once via Bluetooth.</span></li><li><span>Lastly, there’s a solid deal happening <strong>Logitech’s G203 wired gaming mouse</strong> at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YN82X3B/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, where the black version with RGB LED detailing costs $18.99. This half-price discount is great for PC gamers on a budget, as well as for others who want a comfortable mouse with some customizable buttons and lighting. In addition to its two main buttons, the G203 has two thumb buttons, a tactile scroll wheel, and a DPI switcher on its top to change pointer sensitivity. It’s nothing fancy, but you may find this sub-$20 mouse meets all (or at least most) of your criteria.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/773698/college-football-26-ea-sports-ps5-xbox-deal-sale#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/773698/college-football-26-ea-sports-ps5-xbox-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Minimalist nightstand fans are going to love this limited-time Amazon deal. The<strong> Anker MagSafe Compatible MagGo Charger Stand</strong> takes your alarm clock and the charging cables for your iPhone and AirPods and combines them into one small, sleek, powerful fast charger, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3960/">it’s a steal at just $34</a>.</p>
<p>So many of these megadeals are marked down so dramatically because they’re somehow outdated or incompatible with the latest tech release, but this Anker&nbsp; MagGo 15W charger is Qi2 certified and able to fast-charge the latest Apple devices, including the iPhone 16 series, AirPods 4, and AirPods Pro 2. Chances are it’ll remain current when Apple’s next line of smartphones and AirPods drop too, because Apple looks to be locked into MagSafe and Qi2 charging for its devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3960/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ditch That Clock</h2>
<p>The iPhone is a brilliant alarm clock, but when it’s lying flat on your nightstand and hardwired to a charging block, it can lead to fumbling to find the phone as you come out of a dead sleep, and also hard to see the time. When you attach your iPhone to the Anker MagGo charging stand, you can turn it into horizontal position and place it in StandBy mode, giving you the clock display and customizable widgets and photos.</p>
<p>That’s a huge upgrade from the old digital clock, and you can also tilt the iPhone up to 45 degrees backward so you have the ideal viewing angle. Since it’s a MagSafe charger, there’s no wire to get in the way or come loose as you move the phone to exactly where you want it.</p>



<h2>Supercharger</h2>
<p>While it’s taking over for your alarm clock, the Anker MagGo is also bringing fast charging to your iPhone and your AirPods, so they’re both fully loaded when you wake up. The two built-in LED lights let you see that each device is charging, and charging quickly: An iPhone 15 Pro will go from dead to 25% charged in just 21 minutes on the Anker MagGo, nearly half the time a 7.5W charger takes.</p>
<p>The Anker MagGo dual charger comes in white or black to fit your decor, and it’s also a perfect fit for a desktop or work station. It comes with a 5-foot USB-C cable and Anker’s two-year warranty.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3960/"> Best of all, it’s 37% off right now at Amazon, just a little over $34 for this reliable and elegant-looking charging and spatial arrangement solution</a>. It’s a limited-time deal, though, so don’t hesitate and end up stuck with that old alarm clock.</p>
