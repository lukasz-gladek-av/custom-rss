<p>Counter-Strike 2 reached its highest ever concurrent player peak this past Sunday, confirming to all that the iconic first-person shooter from Valve is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very much not dead</a>. This peak came less than 24 hours after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the trophy was lifted at the Perfect World Shanghai Major</a>.</p>



<p>While this latest peak isn’t the highest in the history of Counter-Strike itself, it’s an incredible accomplishment for CS2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-upward-trajectory">Upward trajectory</h2>



<p>The Counter-Strike 2 player peak reached 1,740,261 concurrent players this past Sunday, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/#48h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to SteamDB</a>. This is the highest number of concurrent players on CS2 ever, roughly 180,000 more than the peak that was set when the sequel officially launched in September 2023. With the exception of June and July, the concurrent player peak has gone up every single month of 2024. Both monthly concurrent player peaks and player averages are up now compared to where they were when the year began.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The new CS2 player peak did fall a few hundred thousand players short of the all-time peak set in May 2023. The all-time CS2 player peak of 1,818,773 concurrent players was brought on by both the release of the BLAST Paris Major viewer pass and the ongoing CS2 limited test. CS:GO player numbers jumped following the CS2 limited test announcement as players tried to increase their hours in hopes of getting access.</p>



<p>The Major typically brings in more players throughout its duration, as players make Pick ‘Ems selections, redeem souvenir packages, and open sticker capsules. Following Team Spirit’s victory, the players’ championship autographs will become available for purchase soon.</p>



<p>Despite widespread player concerns about the amount of content and the state of anti-cheat, among other issues, CS2 is showing no signs of slowing down or a diminished player count. It still remains the most actively played game on all of Valve by a considerable margin, and that likely isn’t changing anytime soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/recent-magic-gathering-ban-list-update-bans-one-ring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has updated its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> ban list. The tabletop publisher routinely updates this list, affecting many different play formats for the popular card game, to help maintain a healthy competitive community. But the newest ban includes an iconic item from Middle-earth: The One Ring.</p>



<p>In an official blog post, Wizards of the Coast informed players about the upcoming <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> ban list update. For those that play Standard, Vintage, Alchemy, Historic, Timeless, and Brawl format, no changes have happened.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-split-twin-artwork.jpg?itok=PbNyOwD1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-split-twin-artwork.jpg?itok=PSx8eSau 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As for Modern players, a number of cards have been added and removed from the ban list. Wizards of the Coast state that Modern needs the most help. This is fair considering the last major shake-up happened in August with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-ban-list-update-bans-nadu-from-modern" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the banning</a> of <em>Nadu, Winged Wisdom</em>.</p>

<p>This latest <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> ban list includes the popular card, The One Ring from the Universes Beyond set, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-revealed-for-lord-of-rings-tales-of-middle-earth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth</em></a>.</p>

<p>The reason for this is the precious card has been used in a wide number of deck strategies in the competitive scene. It's a colorless artifact, allowing to work with any color deck, provides creature protection and the ability to draw cards, providing a card advantage. Finally, it synergizes well with the current dominant strategy of Modern: Boros Energy.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-armed-raptor-artwork.jpg?itok=BHRiyjMT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-armed-raptor-artwork.jpg?itok=VmooHq-Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition to one of fantasy's most iconic artifacts hitting the ban list, <em>Amped Raptor</em> and <em>Jegantha, The Wellspring</em> are banned from Modern play. The reason for these bans all relate to making Boros Energy strategies less viable in the current meta.</p>

<p>But some cards are coming off the ban list with this decision. Four cards will return to Modern: <em>Mox Opal</em>, <em>Green Sun's Zenith</em>, <em>Faithless Footing</em>, and <em>Splinter Twin</em>.</p>

<p>According to Wizards of the Coast, the competitive scene of the game has changed so much, the strategies leading to these cards bans aren't as viable anymore. Hopefully, this leads to continued health in the current meta.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/catly-creator-says-game-has-no-generative-ai-no-blockchain-and-no-nfts<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer of recently-announced virtual pet simulator game Catly has responded to allegations that the game's trailer and marketing was produced using generative AI, saying that no such technology was used in its announcement at The Game Awards, nor in the game itself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement shared with IGN, a PR representative authorized to speak on behalf of developer SuperAuthenti said that generative AI was not used to produce the trailer, nor the game. Furthermore, the representative said the developer was "very surprised by such speculations," adding that "We do not think there are any existing AI tools that can produce a video like that. Industry experts have echoed this opinion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PR representative also showed IGN a version of the trailer from The Game Awards that showed in-progress shots interspersed alongside the final version, which did seem to confirm the lack of AI use in the actual trailer production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, the PR representative said that other allegations suggesting that Catly was a blockchain game were similarly unfounded. They said that there has been "zero blockchain technology" involved in Catly or the company behind it, SuperAuthenti, and similarly there are no NFTs. "Our company/project has never issued any blockchain currency and any NFTs. Our company does not and has never owned any blockchain currency and NFTs."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Catly Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The spokesperson confirmed to IGN that Catly is being made in Unreal Engine 5, and said the developer uses "various software" to produce hyperrealistic fur and hair. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assertions that Catly was using generative AI technology began to circulate almost immediately after its trailer debuted at The Game Awards last week. The trailer itself featured hyperrealistic cats with brightly colored fur and features bounding around a fantasy playspace and interacting with a human wearing various detailed, high fashion outfits. The art style present was flagged by many critics as reminiscent of the hyperrealistic style often produced by generative AI. That said, Catly's statement is consistent with the current reality that game trailers of this quality are not within the reach of current generative AI technology without significant, obvious artifacting and other issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, others pointed out that while the trailer may be legit, the other aspects of Catly's promotion are still giving some off vibes. For instance, the game's Steam description awkwardly reads, "A Cat Open World, with Beautiful Cats. Hyperrealism, Actions, Cuddle, Speed, Islands, Fashion, Dreams, Snow, Robots, Plants -- all with and via Cats."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And a few of the game's promotional art pieces had odd details similar to AI artifacting, such as the odd paws and nose of this cat:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/catly-tga-poster-1734378475267.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And the text on the wall inside the right-hand side of the building in this image:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/16/catly-scenery-poster-1-1-1734378505910.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Others <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hdo5rf/comment/m1zej2e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unearthed more images</a> from the official Catly website that have since been removed, but which appear to raise even more questions about their veracity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update 5:57pm: </strong>A previous version of this story claimed the website had been down all weekend, but the URL for the official website provided to IGN was incorrect, and the website has remained live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Original story continues below:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While SuperAuthenti confirmed to me that it did not use generative AI in either the trailer or the game itself, it did not respond to my question about its promotional images on Steam or on its website.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for web3, speculation of the game's ties to the technology surfaced as individuals unearthed the studio co-founder, Kevin Yeung's, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hdo5rf/catly_has_direct_ties_to_ainftblockchain_gaming/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ties to other blockchain games</a>. Additionally, the game's Steam page features a glowing quote from League of Legends and Arcane producer Thomas Vu, who himself is a prominent web3 investor. However, it also contained a quote from Hearthstone and Marvel Snap creator Ben Brode, who has taken to Bluesky to say that he's heard nothing about either AI generation or web3 involved in Catly, and that his interest is sincere. "I saw 20 [minutes] or so of gameplay footage a few months back and thought it looked cool so they asked me for a quote," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benbrode.bsky.social/post/3ldbyrd72z22h" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he wrote</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, it does seem that SuperAuthenti is telling the truth about the Catly trailer at The Game Awards, though the question of whether or not, or how much, generative AI has been used in Catly's overall development and promotion remains to be seen. Generative AI is becoming an increasingly popular tool for game companies, too. Call of Duty <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic">reportedly sold an "AI-generated cosmetic"</a> for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 in late 2023, and fans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash">accused Activision of using generative AI again for a loading screen this year</a>. EA said in September that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">AI was "the very core" of its business</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, as the technology becomes both more prevalent and more complex, it seems likely it will become increasingly difficult to tell the difference between AI-generated and human-crafted work. In Catly's case, we'll have to wait for 2025 to find out more about what exactly is behind those hauntingly rainbow cat eyes from the trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>A crossover between Helldivers 2 and the Killzone franchise has seemingly been leaked, potentially featuring new armor and weapons.</p><p>According to Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/Iron_S1ghts/status/1867412305195282746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1867412305195282746%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Iron_S1ghts</a>, the crossover is reportedly called Righteous Revenants Warbond. The user has been datamining the game for months on end, and has previously leaked the designs of the new enemy faction, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HellDiversLeaks/comments/1c7cyq1/illuminate_adept_mage/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Illuminate</a>. There are <a href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1867659467573412075?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1867659467573412075%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">two screenshots</a> floating around showing some of the alleged armors. They have Killzone's iconic gas masks and red eyes that give them their signature sinister look.</p><p>One of them is called AC-1 Dutiful and its passive ability provides 50% resistance to fire, gas, acid, and electrical damage. The other one is called AC-2 Obedient, which has the same passive ability, but offers less protectional in exchange for more speed and stamina recovery. Sony has not made any official announcement yet.</p><p>Arrowhead Studios said earlier this year that it'd be open to crossovers but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-devs-are-open-to-crossovers-but-only-if-they-make-sense/1100-6522756/" data-ref-id="1100-6522756">"only if they make sense."</a> Given that Helldivers 2 and Killzone both have fascist themes, this particular crossover seems like a great match. Another potential match could be between Helldivers 2 and Halo, but Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-x-helldivers-crossover-probably-never-happening-arrowhead-ceo-says/1100-6523285/" data-ref-id="1100-6523285">that it would probably never happen.</a></p><p>Helldivers 2 recently added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2s-latest-major-update-goes-live-during-the-game-awards/1100-6528445/" data-ref-id="1100-6528445">new faction called the Illuminate</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-players-crush-illuminate-invaders-in-under-a-week/1100-6528505/" data-ref-id="1100-6528505">players have crushed them in under a week.</a> A limited-edition <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-limited-edition-dualsense-controller-revealed-preorders-live-december-20/1100-6528458/" data-ref-id="1100-6528458">Helldivers 2 DualSense controller</a> will also be available for preorder starting December 20.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/day-of-the-jackal-river-udc-redmayne<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Peacock’s <em>The Day of the Jackal</em>, a new adaptation of the novel by Frederick Forsyth, is pretty great television. There’s just one part that makes no fucking sense and causes me to laugh hysterically every time I think about it.</p><p><em>The Day of the Jackal</em> is an enjoyable cat and mouse game about a terrorist and a counter-terrorist operative trying to stop them. Eddie Redmayne stars as the Jackal, using his uncanny valley qualities appropriately to portray an exacting assassin who always gets his target, slipping in and out of new identities and leaving the scene without a trace. Lashana Lynch is an absolute revelation as the MI6 agent hot on his trail, struggling to balance her dedication to her job with the havoc it wreaks on her personal life. The only real problem with the show is the Jackal’s target: a tech entrepreneur with a killer app that does… something.</p><p>The motivations for the hit on this target make perfect sense. Ulle Dag Charles, or UDC, played by Khalid Abdalla, is like a reverse Peter Thiel in that he’s a weirdly menacing gay tech billionaire who, instead of ruining the world for his own benefit, wants to take down his fellow billionaires. The billionaire class has taken note, and they’ve hired the Jackal to kill UDC before he can do any damage.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Day of the Jackal | Official Trailer | Peacock Original" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/shsIx-ZVL0E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It’s just that UDC’s methods don’t make sense—and not only that, the show seems determined not to clarify them. UDC aims to change the world by releasing a killer app, River, which will… like, and, such as? Sometimes characters on the show say it will “provide economic transparency,” though they do not say how. Often UDC implies that it will allow people to look at anyone’s bank account, which simply raises more questions than it answers (like: why? We are already painfully aware that rich people are rich? Also I have some privacy concerns). In one scene, UDC describes the purpose of River as revealing the flow of money, which, again, is something that is already possible to track, though it can take a little leg work.&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever UDC gets close to describing what River will actually do, the show interrupts him. In one very funny moment, just as UDC is about to launch River, literally the moment when he is about to explain what River even is, a second, non-Jackal assassin appears and fires at him, scattering the crowd and ending UDC’s launch event. It’s made all the more comical because if I am interpreting the show I half watch while stoned with my husband correctly, River doesn’t actually do anything or reveal any information that the billionaire class would be worried about. We know rich people are rich—they truly aren’t trying to hide that! We know that they use that money to do terrible things and that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/02/1248693512/boeing-whistleblower-josh-dean-dead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bad</a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-whistleblower-john-barnett-suicide-police-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things</a> seem to happen to those who call them out.</p><p>I know that <em>The Day of the Jackal</em> is more about spy nonsense than whatever UDC is doing, which is why I can let it all slide. Redmayne and especially Lynch have two compelling performances that rise above whatever silliness is going on with River. Still, I hope the writing team can create a stronger target for the Jackal in their second season. There’s plenty out there that scares the ruling class. Why not try a charismatic Italian-American who’s been denied a healthcare claim?</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/australian-video-game-list"><h3>You Should Play An Australian Video Game, Many Of Them Are Very Good</h3></a><p>From Plucky Squire to Wild Bastards, some of 2024's best games came out of Australia</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After Valya catches her up on the Sisterhood losing its hold on the royal palace with Emperor Corrino refusing to have a Truthsayers, Francesca returns to sway Emperor Corrino in favor of appointing Constantine as the leader of his new fleet, without him knowing he was being manipulated to do so.</p><p>However, Valya doesn’t simply order Francesca to do so with the Voice or with threats, but rather by appealing to Francesca’s love of her son. Francesca is the trump card she’s playing now that her previous attempts to remind Emperor Corrino of the order’s influence on him have backfired. Remember, Valya’s ultimate plan is to have Emperor Corrino’s daughter Ynez (Sarah-Sofie Boussnina) study to become a Bene Gesserit so that the Sisterhood can have one of their own sitting on the throne of the Imperium to protect them from any impending trouble. For an unspecified (but clearly lengthy) period of time, Francesca wasn’t able to be around Constantine. Speaking with <em>Kotaku</em>, Tabu says she thinks that is what underscores the character’s hidden power.  </p><p> “I think she was purposely kept away from the son because for Valya, it could have been dangerous if Francesca was lurking around in the palace. Francesca has a very powerful position if she wants to utilize it. She can play her take-the-son card anytime she wants because  he is the natural heir to the to the throne.”</p><figure id="" data-id="6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-recommend-id="image://6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sister Francesca looking at Valya" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sister Francesca looking at Valya" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Attila Szvacsek/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-recommend-id="image://6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sister Francesca looking at Valya" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>She reasons that Francesca was kept away so “she does not become powerful, put her son on the throne, and turn against Valya.” Judging by the way Emperor Corrino nearly leapt on her in a moment of passion the minute he saw her, Francesca has a strong hold on his heart, which means she can control him. Her mere suggestion that the Emperor give his son more responsibility was enough to lead him to appoint Constantine the leader of his new fleet. If she’d been around during her son’s upbringing, who’s to say Francesca couldn’t have swayed Javicco to let Constantine be the next leader of the Imperium?</p><p>That question becomes harder to answer when you factor in how she refuses the Emperor’s romantic advances in the beginning of the episode, before submitting to them near the end. This could easily be looked at as typical Bene Gesserit sexual manipulation. However, the woman who plays Sister Francesca doesn’t think it’s so easy to determine. “She says she does not want to come between him and his wife, but she has very strong feelings for the emperor. She also wants to secure a place for her son,” she explains. “I don’t think she was just playing him for the sake of the Bene Gesserit.”</p><p>No Bene Gesserit is more closely tied to the throne than Francesca, which makes her one of the most powerful members of the sisterhood on the show in terms of influence. We’ll have to wait until the final episode to see if that influence helps or hurts Valya in the end. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – Ubisoft Wants to Change the ‘Far Cry Formula’ with Far Cry 7 and Maverick]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-ubisoft-wants-to-change-the-%E2%80%98far-cry-formula%E2%80%99-with-far-cry-7-and-maverick.1062879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2023, Insider Gaming had several reports on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-in-development-at-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry series throughout the year.</a> Notably, the Far Cry series currently has two games in development, which were both originally under the same game and codenamed Talisker. Its next mainline title is now under the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-story-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">codename Blackbird</a>, and an extraction-based shooter is under the codename Maverick. Both games are still in development at the time of writing, but their release dates have been pushed back internally from 2025 to 2026 due to complexities in development.</p>



<p>Moving from Dunia to Snowdrop and under development at Ubisoft Montreal, both games are set to move away from the ‘Far Cry formula’. Maverick, which takes place in the Alaskan wilderness, will see players fight one another, animals, and the harsh weather to survive. On the flip side, Blackbird will now see the player have to rescue his family (NOT played by Cillian Murphy), who have been kidnapped by a conspiracy cult who have been performing hallucinogenic experiments on animals and children. It’s said that the player has 24 real-life hours (72 hours in-game) to rescue their family, and the timer is reflected in-game by the player wearing a watch on his wrist.</p>



<p>But it isn’t just the gameplay loop of both games changing. It’s understood that both games have had a significant overhaul to their movement systems, too, including the addition of tactical spriting, sliding, vaulting, and more. Seemingly, this is due to both projects originating from the same game and sharing similar movement mechanics, with the similarities of both games bleeding into one another. Other aspects, including the inventory system and looting, also appear to bleed from the extraction-based shooter into Blackbird, too, with sources outlining that it doesn’t affect the mainline entry. “I’d argue it makes a lot of sense given your desperation to rescue your family,” said one source when asked.</p>



<p>Internally, Ubisoft Montreal and its supporting studios on Blackbird are optimistic, but some concerns over Maverick and its future loom given recent events at the publisher. Ubisoft has been attempting to do a Far Cry multiplayer for the best part of a decade, and while an extraction shooter could make a lot of sense for the Far Cry universe, it was ultimately greenlit to chase trends, and the genre doesn’t seem to have attracted the player’s numbers that the industry thought it would. </p>



<p>Defiant’s recent cancellation and subsequent layoffs felt like the beginning of a downward spiral, said some staff, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=yves" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yves’ internal memo</a> following the announcement of its cancellation not inspiring much confidence in those already unsure about their project’s future.</p>



<p>For now, though, Ubisoft is seemingly trying to break its own trend of chasing trends, and Far Cry 7 (or whatever it’s called) and Maverick seems to be a step in the right direction, albeit a considerable risk. </p>

<p>Throughout the entirety of 2024, it was a three-horse race to see who would be the best of the best Counter-Strike 2 players in the world. Three superstars, two of which are still in their teens, put up dominant performances during the most prestigious CS2 events all year.</p>



<p>By the end of the Perfect World Shanghai Major, and thus the 2024 CS2 calendar, one name stood the tallest amongst the best CS2 players.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-players-of-2024">Best CS2 Players of 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-danil-donk-kryshkovets">Danil “donk” Kryshkovets</h3>



<p>Thanks to a historic performance at the Shanghai Major <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/">culminating in his first Major trophy</a>, Team Spirit’s 17-year-old donk is the unquestionable best CS2 player of 2024. In Shanghai, donk <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donk-counter-strike-history/">posted the highest ever player rating at a Major ever</a> while becoming the youngest MVP ever. Donk’s mastery of crosshair placement, crouching, and the “donk slide” combined with his utmost confidence has been nearly unbeatable all year. And he’s just getting started.</p>



<h3 id="h-ilya-m0nesy-osipov">Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another special young talent that dominated 2024 is G2’s star AWPer Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov. After a breakout 2023, m0NESY showed no signs of slowing down, and is still the most lethal player in the world with the AWP in his hands. He has amazing aim and reaction speeds, but also the game sense of a veteran. Even though the AWP is the most dangerous tool in his arsenal, he can also produce highlights or clutches with a rifle if pressed to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-mathieu-zywoo-herbaut">Mathieu “ZywOo” Herbaut</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>ZywOo feels like the elder statesman when comparing him to actual teenagers like donk and m0NESY. But the prodigy and multi-time HLTV Player of the Year winner is still one of the best Counter-Strike players of the year. He put up nearly identical numbers as his younger adversaries <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/players?startDate=2024-01-01&amp;endDate=2024-12-31&amp;matchType=BigEvents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at big events</a> all year, and has grown more dangerous with the rifles after dominating with the AWP earlier in his career.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ps-placeable-the-adorable-mod-that-turns-a-playstation-portable-into-a-console/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When Sony launched the PlayStation Portable almost exactly 20 years ago, the value proposition was right there in the name: a PlayStation, but portable. But now modders have flipped that, introducing a PSP that can be played on a TV, console-style, and they've dubbed it the <a href="https://www.retromodworks.com/">PS Placeable</a>.</p>
<p>It's a non-destructive mod to PSP-2000 and PSP-3000 systems that allows you to play PSP games on the TV off the original UMD physical media format, with a wireless controller like the PlayStation 4's DualShock 4—all wrapped in a miniature, PlayStation 2-like enclosure.</p>
<p>Let's be frank: One of the main reasons this thing gets special attention here is that its look is both clever and, well, kind of adorable. The miniaturization of the retro styling of the PlayStation 2 is a nice touch.</p>
<p>Of course, there have long been other ways to play some PSP games on the big screen—but there has always been one downside or another.</p>
<p>For example, you could connect the original PSP to a TV with convoluted cables, but you would then have to use that tethered handheld as your controller.</p>
<p>Much later, the PlayStation TV set-top box made by Sony itself was essentially a console-style take on the PlayStation Vita, and like the Vita, it could play numerous classic PSP games—plus, it supported wireless controllers—but it didn't support most PSP games, and it only worked with those downloaded through Sony's digital store.</p>

                <p>The 2000s called, and Capcom answered last week by unveiling new entries in the Okami and Onimusha series. But the company doesn't seem done yet with bringing back old franchises. In fact, Capcom states it's "focusing on reactivating dormant IPs" alongside brand-new titles going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">A Capcom press release highlighting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/okami-2-announced-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528453/" data-ref-id="1100-6528453">the reveals of Okami 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-coming-in-2026-reviving-the-franchise-after-nearly-two-decades/1100-6528447/" data-ref-id="1100-6528447">Onimusha Way of the Sword at The Game Awards</a> offers insight into the publisher's plans for the future. "In addition to regularly releasing major new titles each year, Capcom is focusing on reactivating dormant IPs that haven't had a new title launch recently. The company is working to further enhance corporate value by leveraging its rich library of content, which includes reviving past IPs like [Okami 2 and Onimusha Way of the Sword], in order to continuously produce highly efficient, high-quality titles."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSoZgCCxyQc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mSoZgCCxyQc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Okami 2--referred as "Okami sequel project" by Capcom--will see the return of the original's director, with Hideki Kamiya. Okami originally launched for PS2 in 2006, and the series did get a follow-up in 2010 (2011 for North America) with Okamiden for Nintendo DS. There is no release window for the Okami sequel project.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Ominusha Way of the Sword is set to arrive in 2026 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. It's the first new entry in the mainline series since 2006's Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams for PS2.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not necessarily new for Capcom to note that it's looking into old franchises to revisit, by the way. In 2019, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-has-plans-to-utilize-dormant-franchises/1100-6470660/" data-ref-id="1100-6470660">Capcom discussed intentions to "utilize" dormant franchises</a>. In addition, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mega-man-hasnt-been-forgotten-capcom-insists/1100-6525220/" data-ref-id="1100-6525220">the company insisted Mega Man hasn't been forgotten</a>, meaning the Blue Bomber could possibly see a return alongside Okami in the years ahead.</p>

<p>I grew up playing Ghost Recon alongside one of my older brothers, and it was my go-to tactical shooter for the longest time. As such, when the franchise began to modernize, I certainly couldn’t stay away. After all, realistic tactics, weapon customization, and full co-op were too good to pass up. But something was missing from the Steam release. It’s no longer a problem, as you can now unlock all of the Steam Achievements in Ghost Recon Breakpoint as of December 16!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-steam-achievements-in-ghost-recon-breakpoint">All Steam Achievements in Ghost Recon Breakpoint</h2>



<p>Don’t expect too many for the third-person tactical shooter from Ubisoft. Ghost Recon Breakpoint features 50 Steam Achievements, the majority of which stem from single-player objectives and story beats, such as completing specific acts or tackling unique challenges, such as slaying a particular number of Wolves.</p>
