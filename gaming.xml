<figure><a title="NL Reader Survey 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1216dcd0f6c54/nl-reader-survey-2025.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>It's <em>that</em> time of year again folks. We would <em>love</em> to ask you some questions and would greatly appreciate it if you could take the time to respond to our anonymous survey.</p>
<p>Why is this important to us? Our websites survive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/ownership#how-does-site-make-money">mainly due to those</a> who choose to advertise their games on our websites. Advertisers typically (and understandably) want to know who they are advertising to, therefore, our survey gives us a snapshot view of our audience in 2025.</p>
<p>This year we're trying to keep things quite focused and have boiled everything down to 20 simple questions. Some of them are about you, some of them about which platforms you own and the games you buy and finally where you typically get your gaming news. All questions are optional, but any personal questions will contain a 'Prefer not to say' option.</p>
<p>We are running the same survey across all Hookshot websites; that is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Nintendo Life</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/">Pure Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/">Time Extension</a>. You only need to answer it once, and it doesn't matter which site you do it on.</p>
<p>We will run more site-specific surveys in due course.</p>

<p>Firstly, we need to know a little bit about <em>you</em>. Please remember that this information is <em>always</em> anonymised and helps potential advertisers know what kind of audience they can reach on our websites. All questions are optional or have 'Prefer not to say' options.</p>
<h3 data-toc="Gaming Platforms" id="gaming-platforms">Gaming Platforms <sup>(2 of 4)</sup></h3>
<p>Next, we want to understand which gaming hardware you currently own, what you intend to buy soon and which subscriptions you currently have.</p>
<h3 data-toc="Gaming Habits" id="gaming-habits">Gaming Habits <sup>(3 of 4)</sup></h3>
<p>Next, we'd like to understand how many games you buy, where you buy them, what format and genres you prefer.</p>

<p>Finally, we want to see which of our websites you visit and where else you typically get your gaming news.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-reeses-oreo-cup-review-tasty-cookie-snack-candy-2000623453</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-reese%E2%80%99s-oreo-cup-is-tasty-but-only-if-luck-is-on-your-side.1290105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the last few years, it feels like there has been a large increase in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/reeses-peanut-butter-cups-now-with-hard-bits-1776649563">number of limited-time Reese’s Cup variations</a> and gimmicks. Many of these have been bad. But the newest crossover featuring Oreo cookies is the first time I’ve tried one of these oddball concoctions and enjoyed it. But only when RNG was on my side.</p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/reeses/posts/you-asked-we-crushed-it-reeses-oreo-cups-are-coming-this-september/1218885443616524/">Released this month, the new Reese’s Oreo cup</a> isn’t simply a <a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-ranking-worst-best-list-chocolate-bar-1851679251/38">Reese’s cup</a> with some Oreo bits shoved inside. Well, okay, sure, it is mostly that, but the Reese’s cup itself is half milk chocolate and half white chocolate. As someone who is a big fan of the white chocolate Reese’s Cup, I was very happy about this choice. It also makes sense as the Oreo cookie bits, in theory at least, should blend with the white chocolate to create something similar in taste to an actual Oreo cookie.</p> <p>And then you have the classic Reese’s peanut butter filling, which is fine by me as I love that stuff more than real peanut butter. So does this all come together into a winning creation? Well, you know the answer already, I said it in the first paragraph. But yes, it’s pretty dang good!</p>

 <p>The cookie bits add a nice and crunchy texture to each cup, and the darker, more bitter flavor of the Oreo cookie cuts through the peanut butter, so they complement each other in a way that a lot of other gimmicky flavors have been lacking. But that Oreo-ness also doesn’t overpower the entire cup, something that can also happen. (Looking at you, fudge-filled Reese’s Cups.) Instead, the cookie bits and the rest of the cup blend together perfectly. The white chocolate top of the cup also helps add a bit of sweetness and creaminess to the candy, which does sort of recreate the taste of an Oreo that has been dipped in peanut butter. I would know how that tastes, as I’ve done that many times before.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000623478" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000623478"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000623478">©Reese’s / Oreo</figcaption></figure> <p>There is an asterisk, though, next to my “Pretty Dang Good!” appraisal of the new Oreo Reese’s abomination. It all depends on how much Oreo is in your Reese’s Cups. I bought four of the King Size version and three of them had a lot of cookie bits and were fantastic. But one had barely any inside the peanut butter, so you were left with a cup that was just half white chocolate and half milk chocolate. Not a horrible fate, but disappointing if you were expecting some Oreo goodness.</p>

 <p>For those of you out there who miss the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=crunchy+cookie+cup&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS955US955&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#imgrc=D8sfDROw0w3ReM&amp;imgdii=EKOEBjAnc7XWNM">Crunchy Cookie Reese’s Cup from the ’90s</a>, this might be your best bet for re-experiencing that fan-favorite flavor that is no longer sold by Reese’s. From my memory, it’s not quite the same thing, but it’s awfully close. And in the absence of Reese’s bringing it back, this will do just fine for all of you longing for the sweet return of the Crunchy Cookie cup.</p> <p>One last note: If you do buy some of these, stick ’em in the fridge. The one I stuck in the fridge and tasted a few hours later was even better. I mean, Reese’s Cups in general are better cold, but these in particular taste wonderful. The cold stiffens up the chocolate more and adds even more crunch. It’s nice. I can’t buy any more or I’ll eat them all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amazon Prime Video has given the green light to a Life is Strange TV series, a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/life-is-strange-tv-series-amazon-charlie-covell-luckychap-1236509181/">Variety</a> has revealed. It'll be written by Charlie Covell, the same writer recently behind Netflix's show Kaos and the Channel 4 mini series Truelove. Covell will also act as executive producer and showrunner, while Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg, and Timothy I. Stevenson will tag along as executive producers through Story Kitchen. Square Enix is also listed as one of the producing entities alongside Story Kitchen, Amazon, and LuckyChap, but neither <a href="https://wccftech.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-devs-deck-nine-lay-off-more-staff/">Deck Nine</a> nor <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/">Dontnod</a> seems to be involved.</p>



<p>It's the latest videogame to TV series adaptation Amazon has in the works, adding Life is Strange to its list alongside its <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/">Tomb Raider</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">God of War</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/">Fallout</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">Wolfenstein</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-tv-series-from-amazon-will-star-henry-cavill/">Warhammer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-is-a-live-action-tv-adaptation-of-the-game-series-due-this-october-on-amazon-prime-video/">Like a Dragon: Yakuza</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/">Mass Effect</a> TV series. Similar to some of the aforementioned adaptations, there have been multiple attempts at making a Life is Strange adaptation work in some way, with Amazon Prime Video finally being the one to close on a deal.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Amazon MGM Studios has greenlit Life is Strange, based on the critically acclaimed best-selling video game, straight to series from creator/showrunner Charlie Covell.</p><p>Square Enix, Story Kitchen, and LuckyChap set as producers. <a href="https://t.co/r595wGEVRx">pic.twitter.com/r595wGEVRx</a></p></div>— Amazon MGM Studios (@AmazonMGMStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmazonMGMStudio/status/1963995557673796088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>On the part of Story Kitchen, Johnson and Goldberg said, "<em>Story Kitchen has always believed that ‘Life is Strange’ deserved to be more than just a game—it’s a cultural touchstone</em>. <em>After a decade-long journey, we’re honored to be bringing this beloved story to Amazon MGM alongside our incredible partners at Square Enix, our brilliant showrunner/writer Charlie Covell, and the amazing team at LuckyChap. Together, this thoughtfully assembled dream team is ready to share Life is Strange with the world in an entirely new way!</em>"</p>



<p>For Covell's part, they added, "<em>It’s a huge honor to be adapting ‘Life Is Strange’ for Amazon MGM Studios</em>. <em>I am a massive fan of the game, and I’m thrilled to be working with the incredible teams at Square Enix, Story Kitchen and LuckyChap. I can’t wait to share Max and Chloe’s story with fellow players and new audiences alike</em>."</p>



<p>Square Enix External Studios co-studio heads Jon Brooke and Lee Singleton added, "<em>For years we’ve had so many people asking us to create a ‘Life is Strange’ TV show and we’re so pleased to finally partner with Amazon MGM Studios who we trust will do an incredible job bringing our universe to life</em>."</p>



<p>With its setting, gameplay, and narrative focus, Life is Strange is a clear candidate for adaptation fodder in what's been a renaissance for videogame to TV or movie adaptations in recent years. So far, Amazon has only proven itself with its Fallout series, and with so many other adaptations in the works, not just at Amazon, it's worth asking when people will start feeling fatigued from all these adaptations, especially if the quality bar on them takes a drastic drop. </p>

But it commits one terrible, unforgiveable sin: Silksong won't let players pet the dang dog-er, well, the bug that's <em>like</em> a dog.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warning: Spoilers for the first few hours of Hollow Knight: Silksong follow. Everything we discuss below can be found very early in the game, in the first two areas you visit.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're still wondering who or what the "dog" is, I'm referring to the Bell Beast, one of Silksong's earliest bosses and, once defeated, your permanent fast travel buddy. The Bell Beast is encountered early in the game in The Marrow, trapped within enormous silk webs. You need to unlock the Silk Spear to free it, and once you do, a fight will ensue. We've got a whole guide on this guy if you're having trouble finding or defeating him, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Bell_Beast_Boss_Guide">so make sure to check that out</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you beat the Bell Beast, it becomes docile, and you can summon it at any fast travel station to have it take you to any other station in Pharloom. That in itself is helpful enough, but the absolute best thing about the Bell Beast is how it basically acts like a big puppy whenever it sees you. It'll dig around in the bells beneath its feet, react excitedly when you ring the bells above its head, and genuinely just gives off enormous puppy energy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>But Hornet can't pet it. </em>And fans really feel like they should be able to!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-confirms-cast-and-release-date-for-street-fighter-movie-coming-in-october-2026.1290054/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Capcom and Legendary have confirmed the main cast for the coming Street Fighter Movie, which includes Callina Liang, Andrew Koji, Cody Rhodes, Eric André, and 50 Cent. We also got a confirmation for when the movie will premiere, which is set for October 16, 2026.</p>



<p>The cast was confirmed in the style of Street Fighter 2, with each of the cast members in their respective places for their characters in the character select screen. </p>



<p>"<em>Secrets don't last long in the arena - Street Fighter is now in production</em>," a post from the <a href="https://x.com/Street_Fighter/status/1963677608887095624">official X (formerly Twitter) account</a> for the film reads. "<em>In theatres October 16, 2026."</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The full cast stars:</p>



<ul>
<li>Andrew Koji as Ryu</li>



<li>Noah Centineo as Ken Masters</li>



<li>Callina Liang as Chun-Li</li>



<li>Joe "Roman Reigns" Ano'i as Akuma</li>



<li>David Dastmalchian as M. Bison</li>



<li>Cody Rhodes as Guile</li>



<li>Andrew Schulz as Dan Hibiki</li>



<li>Eric André as Don Sauvage</li>



<li>Vidyut Jammwal as Dhalsim</li>



<li>Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson as Balrog</li>



<li>Jason Momoa as Blanka</li>



<li>Orville Peck as Vega</li>



<li>Olivier Richters as Zangief</li>



<li>Hirooki Goto as E.Honda</li>



<li>Rayna Vallandingham as Juli</li>



<li>Alexander Volkanovski as Joe</li>



<li>Kyle Mooney as Marvin</li>



<li>Mel Jarnson as Cammy</li>
</ul>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-plot-cast-1236361494/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the film is set in 1993, with the plot kicking off by Chun-Li convincing Ryu and Ken to get back into the arena for the World Warrior Tournament. Unsurprisingly, there's more to the tournament than meets the eye, a fact that begins to reveal itself as the tournament goes on.</p>



<p>On the film, co-chair of Paramount Pictures, Josh Greenstein, said, "<em>Legendary has built a reputation for ambitious, globally appealing films, and we’re excited to be partnering with them.&nbsp;Street Fighter&nbsp;is the perfect start to our collaboration, which we believe will be strong and lasting</em>."</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the world of fighting games being made into movies, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-2-movie-trailer-debut/">the next Mortal Kombat movie</a> is premiering this coming October 24, 2025. It'll be interesting to have the Street Fighter film to compare it to a year later. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frosthaven-early-access-roadmap</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frosthaven-early-access-roadmap-promises-new-heroes-storylines-and-more.1290051/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Snapshot Games and publisher Arc Games have revealed their&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>Early Access roadmap, showing off what's coming to the turn-based tabletop adaptation over the next year or so.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>adaptation was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frosthaven-video-game-adaptation-announced" rel="nofollow">first announced back in March</a>, then released in Early Access at the end of July. Now, Snapshot and Arc have unveiled what's coming to the game over the next few months, and you're getting new heroes, new storylines, and much more.</p>

<p>First up, in October, a major update will arrive that adds the game's Unfettered storyline, as well as new playable heroes, new summons, and new quests. You can also look forward to two new features in the form of Challenges and Job Postings.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frosthaven-early-access-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=c7Pn9PLh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frosthaven-early-access-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=Sp3HzUHY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty is on the way to&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven&nbsp;</em>over the next few months.</figcaption></figure><p>Following that, another big update will be arriving in January, bringing yet more heroes, summons, and quests, as well as the Algox storyline for you to enjoy. You can also expect new bosses, new Challenges, and new environments.</p>

<p>April brings more heroes and quests, as well as new items and building upgrades. The Lurker storyline will also be added as part of this update. Finally (for this roadmap, at least), July will wrap up&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven</em>'s main story, as well as bringing lots more of the goodies other months have added to the game.</p>

<p><em>Frosthaven</em>'s Steam page proclaims that the game will remain in Early Access for "approximately one year", but that "this can change depending on player feedback". The current roadmap, however, would suggest that a July 2026 release date is on the cards for the game's 1.0 version.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven</em>, it's a video game adaptation of Isaac Childres' tabletop RPG&nbsp;<em>Frosthaven</em>, which itself serves as a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Gloomhaven</em>.</p>

<p>The original tabletop game proved phenomenally popular; it was, for a time, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/frosthaven-kickstarter-is-most-funded-board-game-on-platform" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter's most-funded tabletop project</a>, before being surpassed by Brandon Sanderson's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow">hugely successful&nbsp;<em>Cosmere&nbsp;RPG&nbsp;</em>campaign</a>.</p>

<p>Getting right into it, Indy update five adds a new "Very Light action experience" difficulty option aimed at folks who "prefer to be challenged by the exploration and puzzle solving, and prefer not to find the combat too challenging". Tell your nan who likes visiting historical sites and doing crosswords, now's her chance to whip some Nazis in a video game.</p>
<p>That's one of these few additions, but the main one that's piqued my attention's this: "New Radio MCs have been added to the Jazz and Opera radio stations found on radio sets in Marshall College and the Vatican. You can also now tune the Vatican radio sets to hear news broadcasts that cover the events from around the game’s world."</p><p>That's a cool touch, being able to turn a knob and hear about what that knob Voss is doing from the 1940s Italian equivalent of those dorks on BBC radio four. Beyond that, Machine Games have whipped out some extra-swanky ray tracing for Indy's hair, via support for RTX Hair on 50-series Nvidia RTX GPUs. "We recommend enabling this feature only on higher-end GPUs with 16GB of VRAM or more," they wrote. That's you told, no uber-luscious trim fidelity for those without top hardware.</p>
<p>The final new feature's a little tweak to the inventory screen that'll let you know which of your outfits will act as safe disguises for the area in which you're standing, and which will instantly alert the guards that there's a Harrison Ford sneaking around. For all the bug fixes and minor tweaks, you can check out update five's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/523101526048113591?l=english">full notes here</a>.</p>
<p>Our Brendy wrote the following in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-a-grand-adventure-that-keeps-faith-with-the-movies">Indy review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Machine Games have reproduced the experience of the Lucasfilm movies in a 99% accurate form. And they have done so in a manner only a megafunded Bethesda studio with a lot of Nazi-killing experience could. Yes, the video gamey seams stand out as you scarf down croissants for health and hear another bigot coughing behind a wall. But just as I'm not interested in Baker's performance reaching some unobtainable ledge of authenticity, I also don't want my adventure to abandon the language of games where it doesn't make sense to do so. I'm happy for this to be exactly the kind of expensive, cinematic, blockbuster explorathon it seemed predestined to be. Sneeze away, little Nazi. I know where you are.</blockquote>
<p>Oh wait. If I've got Vatican FM, the holy city's haven for the hottest hymns and coolest choirs, turned up to max, will I still be able to hear the telltale bodily noises of Hitler's goons?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-ugreen-usb-c-charger-drops-to-a-practically-free-stock-up-for-samsung-and-apples-new-devices-2000623225</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are too many devices and not enough outlets in my life. My phone, tablet, headphones, and everything else are in a constant battle to get plugged into my nearest USB-C port. If this is your life too, you need to upgrade from the cube that came with your phone to something much more useful. This UGREEN 65W USB-C charger has multiple ports to plug your stuff into so you can recharge all your devices at once. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3935/">The charger normally goes for $50, but for a limited time, you can scoop one up for 40% off.</a> That discount brings the price down by $20, so you’re only paying $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3935/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultra-Fast Charging</h2>
<p>This UGREEN charger is pretty powerful despite its small size. It’s got two separate USB-C charging ports as well as a USB-a charging port, and can hit a max fast-charging output of 65W. To put some numbers on that, a MacBook Air M2 can go from zero to over 50% in just 30 minutes. The charging block supports Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0. The S24 Ultra can be brought up to 50% in just 19 minutes. An iPhone 15 Pro will go up to 60% in only 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The charger is about 55% smaller than a MacBook charger, measuring in at only 2.08 inches by 1.57 inches by 1.25 inches. And because it’s so small, it will only take up a single outlet on a power strip. Huge pet peeve whenever manufacturers make their bricks so big they take up two or sometimes even three of them. Not and issue here.</p>



<p>Designed for portability, the prongs of the plug can be folded back into the brick. This let’s you toss it into your bag or pocket without risk of those little bits getting caught on anything or breaking.</p>
<p>USB-C and USB-A are pretty universally compatible at this point. So that means this UGREEN charger can be used with your phone whether it’s an iPhone or an Android from Google, Samsung, and more. It’ll work on a pair of JBL earbuds. It can even charge your Steam Deck or Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>UGREEN designs its charges with safety in mind. The upgraded Thermal Guard protection system can safeguard your devices from overheating or short circuiting. No worry with leaving them plugged in.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3935/">For a limited time, you can grab yourself one of these UGREEN 3-in-1 USB-C and USB-A universal chargers on sale</a>. Amazon’s limited-time discount has shaved 40% off the price, bringing what you pay down to just $30.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The grounded, relatable setting of a certain paper distributor in Scranton, Pennsylvania might be the furthest thing one could imagine from the endless, procedurally generated galaxy of <i>No Man’s Sky</i>, but one virtual space explorer has put some serious digital elbow grease into recreating <i>The Office</i>’s iconic setting. It’s a delight to check out for fans of the show or for those who appreciate some solid base building in Hello Games’ massive space sim.</p> <p>The replica’s creator, user Ok_Misterpiece_9363, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n8efk3/welcome_to_the_office/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">showed it off on Reddit</a> where it’s amassed more than 14,000 upvotes and tons of excited comments filled with <i>Office</i> memes from fans impressed by how faithfully the Scranton-based office space and warehouse has been reproduced.</p>   <p>What’s really neat about this office recreation is how much of the building and the experience of traveling through this space it captures. Having visited many Dunder Mifflin recreations in games like <i>VRchat</i> myself, I’m typically used to just seeing the main floor where most of the show’s action takes place. But this <i>NMS</i> version lets you walk in from the ground floor and, with a quick teleport jump, you can then explore the main office suite, the “annex” area, and even take a quick trip down to the warehouse.</p>

 <p>Those who know the fictional office well might be able to spot a few omissions and quirks, however. Intern-turned-fraudster-turned-hipster Ryan is missing his closet office from the later seasons; the conference room leads directly to the warehouse (there’s a corridor behind it instead on the actual set of the show); and speaking of the warehouse, it doesn’t look much like what we’d seen in nine seasons of the celebrated comedy.</p>   <p>These deviations aside, this is an undeniably cute homage to a beloved comedy, filled with references to various memorable moments such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n8efk3/comment/ncfue0a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Pam and Jim’s rooftop date</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n8efk3/comment/ncftytq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">the speedometer race scene</a> from an episode in season five, and more.</p> <p>If you want to visit galactic Dunder Mifflin yourself, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n8efk3/comment/ncea34o/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Ok_Misterpiece_9363 has provided the coordinates here</a>.</p>

That makes the handheld gaming PC quite expensive, but the device does have some high-quality hardware inside of it.</p><p>Internally, the base model is powered by the AMD Z2 SoC, while the premium model has more power with its AMD Z2 Extreme chip. Other specs include a high amount of LPDDR5X RAM, with the Z2 model getting 16GB and the Z2 Extreme having 32GB. Both of these devices are equipped with a 1TB PCIe SSD--with an option to add up to 2TB of extra storage via MicroSD--an 8.8-inch 1200p OLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate, and a 74Wh battery.</p><p>The Legion Go 2 also has Switch-like functionality, as its TrueStrike controllers are detachable. This allows the unit to shift between handheld, tabletop, console, or FPS modes. Switching to FPS mode is especially interesting, as the TrueStrike controller adopts a joystick position.</p><p>The Legion Go 2 also has an updated thermal design that delivers up to 45% more airflow, 2W speakers with Nahimic and spatial audio, near-field dual mics, and a 3.5mm jack for wired gear. You'll also get a voucher for three months of PC Game Pass, so you'll have a library of games you can access right out of the box, like Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p><div title="Legion Go 2 Z2 and Z2

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-launch-date-set-for-october-features-steam-deck-style-compatibility/1100-6534120/" data-ref-id="1100-6534120">as the ROG Xbox Ally is expected to launch</a> during the holiday season. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">Xbox partnered with Asus on this Windows-based handheld</a>, which will be available in a base model and a premium "X" edition.</p><p>The white base model Xbox Ally is equipped with an AMD Ryzen Z2A chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD with a 60Wh battery, while the black Xbox Ally X has an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme APU, 24GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an 80Wh battery. Both devices have the same 7" 1080p screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, and in terms of ergonomics, they're designed to feel more comfortable with their sculpted handles. The Xbox Ally targets a resolution of 720p, while the Xbox Ally X aims for a 1080p resolution.</p><p>The other big thing to note here is that both handhelds are running on a version of Windows that's designed to make accessing games easier and smoother. The main issue with Windows-based mobile gaming PCs is that the flexibility they give users with accessing various storefronts is countered by an unintuitive desktop experience. At the end of the day, they're still PCs, and accessing apps on them can be awkward due to the size of the screen.</p><p>With the Xbox Ally, the Xbox App now supports multiple storefronts like Steam, GOG, and Epic Games, allowing you to gather all of your downloaded games into a centralized launcher.</p><p>While the new Legion Go 2 is pricy, you can still get several of the previous models at a lower price. For an entry-level option, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Legion-Go-graphics-PureSight/dp/B0DTBN55K9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">there's the Lenovo Legion Go S for $650</a>, which has an 8-inch 120Hz Lenovo PureSight display and an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go chip with Radeon graphics. This one doesn't have detachable controllers, but with 16GB of RAM and a 512TB SSD, it's still a solid option that can easily play a wide variety of games.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Lenovo+Legion+Go+2+Handheld+Is+Up+For+Preorder&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-09-05+09%3A06%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-05+09%3A06%3A06&amp;fnarticle_id=6534509&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F614286%2F10014%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fproduct%252Flegion-go-8-8-144hz-wqxga-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z1-extreme-16gb-with-512-gb-ssd-windows%252FJJGYCGRK6W&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flenovo-legion-go-2-handheld-is-up-for-preorder%2F1100-6534509%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy also has the first-generation Lenovo Legion Go for $740</a>.

                <p>Subscription services in gaming are popular, and while they are very far from the only way to buy and play games, the profile of the business model is growing thanks in part to the backing of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reached-4-trillion-valuation-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533588/" data-ref-id="1100-6533588">multi-trillion-dollar company Microsoft</a> and its Xbox Game Pass service. Pete Hines, the longtime Bethesda marketing and publishing boss who retired after Microsoft bought his company, has now shared his thoughts on subscription services for games--and he has some issues.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dbltap</a>, Hines began by saying he doesn't work at Bethesda anymore and is under no assumption that he what he knew when he was there still holds true today. That said, he believes he is involved enough in gaming still today to understand "what I considered to be some short-sighted decision making several years ago, and it seems to be bearing out the way I said."</p><p>Hines said his main issue with a subscription service like Game Pass or others is that the economics might not always make sense--and that's a critical point in a world with mass layoffs, studio closures, and game cancellations.</p><p>"Subscriptions have become the new four letter word, right? You can't buy a product anymore. When you talk about a subscription that relies on content, if you don't figure out how to balance the needs of the service and the people running the service with the people who are providing the content--without which your subscription is worth jack sh*t--then you have a real problem," he said.</p><p>Hines went on to say a company behind a subscription service for games needs to "properly acknowledge, compensate, and recognize what it takes to create that content and not just make a game, but make a product."</p><p>The "tension" inherent in the situation that Hines outlined is "hurting a lot of people," including game developers, Hines said.</p><p>"Because they're fitting into an ecosystem that is not properly valuing and rewarding what they're making," he said.</p><p>These comments appear to be aligned with what Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said about subscription services. While the company might put some older titles on subscription services like Game Pass--and the company has done this with GTA 5--Zelnick said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-want-new-games-on-game-pass/1100-6494686/" data-ref-id="1100-6494686">wouldn't launch a brand-new game into Game Pass because of the economics.</a> Zelnick has acknowledged that Microsoft putting Call of Duty on Game Pass will no doubt help drive subscribers to the service, but the executive said this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">may only work "for a period of time."</a></p><p>While Microsoft launches all of its first-party games into Xbox Game Pass on day one, Sony doesn't do this with its own PlayStation Plus membership program. PlayStation's former president Jim Ryan seemed to agree with Zelnick and previously discussed how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-on-why-it-wont-launch-games-day-one-on-ps-plus-like-xbox-game-pass/1100-6501975/" data-ref-id="1100-6501975">this doesn't make economic sense.</a></p><p>For its part, Electronic Arts has a subscription service called EA Play Pro, and for $17/month, members can get access to the company's newest games at launch. Ubisoft, meanwhile, has a subscription service called Ubisoft+ ($18/month) that allows members to play new releases on day one.</p><p>Of course, subscription services are not the only way to access games today, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-not-for-everybody-phil-spencer-says/1100-6530894/" data-ref-id="1100-6530894">Microsoft has maintained from the onset of Game Pass that it's just one option for players</a>--they can always buy a game outright as well. Still, some fear that the economics of Game Pass could lead to troubled times down the road.</p><p>There has been significant upheaval at Microsoft in recent times, with the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">enacting mass layoffs, cancelling games, and closing at least one studio.</a> For the latest financial year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-nearly-hit-5-billion-in-revenue-says-microsoft/1100-6533574/" data-ref-id="1100-6533574">Xbox Game Pass generated nearly $5 billion annually for the first time.</a></p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

<p>We've all been getting a little caught up in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> hype recently, but we thought it best to remind you that Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is out now on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, a new launch trailer specifically for the Switch 2 has been released, and yeah, it's cool. We get a good look at some combat, traversal mechanics, and some of the funky character that you, as protagonist 'The Traveler', will encounter on your journey.</p>
<p>We've been playing Cronos over the last couple of days or so and we'll have a review ready for you very soon, but early impressions point to a solid experience on Switch 2; it looks great, performs well, and the gameplay is a wonderful blend of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/dead_space">Dead Space</a>, with a little bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/returnal">Returnal</a> thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Oh, and cute cats bring you useful goodies. Winner.</p>
<p>Here's a reminder of the game's synopsis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From the acclaimed developers of the SILENT HILL 2 remake, Bloober Team presents <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> — a third-person survival horror experience like no other. Set in the haunting ruins of New Dawn, a world inspired by Nowa Huta, a real historical district in Kraków, Poland, the game unfolds across two timelines: a post-apocalyptic future decaying in despair, and the gritty, industrial 1980s reality. This powerful duality blends retro realism, dystopian sci-fi, and a retro-futuristic atmosphere to create a deeply immersive world filled with tension, mystery, and terror."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Big <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> DLC and even bigger PC gaming handhelds. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I am still recovering from the Philadelphia Eagles’ narrow escape from the Dallas Cowboys last night. It only took six seconds for star defensive tackle Jalen Carter to get ejected from the game for spitting at opposing quarterback Dak Prescott, only for a second angle to reveal Prescott actually spit first.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">DAK SPAT FIRST?!?! <a href="https://t.co/J2xrMlJRLj">pic.twitter.com/J2xrMlJRLj</a></p> <p>— Bussin' With The Boys (@BussinWTB) <a href="https://twitter.com/BussinWTB/status/1963806763418829238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Carter apparently then asked him if he just spat at him (Prescott’s loogie had little hang-time before going straight to the ground) and Prescott said something to the effect of “why the hell would I do that?” and then Carter decided the time for words had ended and fired back with his own salvo of saliva aimed squarely at Prescott’s chest. <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/05/sports/dak-prescott-explains-his-version-after-new-video-emerges-in-eagles-spit-gate/">The curse of <em>Madden</em> continues</a>? I can’t wait to suffer through another season of the 2024 Super Bowl champions looking like utter frauds.</p> <h2>The Legion Go 2 is almost twice as expensive as the original</h2> <p>Lenovo revealed its newest PC gaming handheld and its impressive specs are overshadowed only by its price tag. It starts at $1,100 or about the price of a 15-inch MacBook Air. For that you get an 8.8 inch OLED display, an AMD Z2 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost"><em>The Verge</em> reports</a> it won’t launch with SteamOS, and it won’t have Microsoft’s new Windows gaming UI that’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-price-pc-gaming-handheld-asus-pre-order-2000622751">releasing with the Xbox ROG Ally</a> either. That option won’t arrive until <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/772853/the-lenovo-legion-go-2-will-get-xbox-flavored-windows-in-spring-2026">sometime in spring 2026</a>.</p>

 <p>None of this is doing much for my enthusiasm for an otherwise cool upgrade. It’ll be the beefiest portable PC gaming competitor to the Switch 2 when it arrives on October 31, complete with detachable controller grips, a kickstand, and optical mouse controls. But with the best Legion Go 2 model coming in at almost $1,500, I’m not sure any number of new bells and whistles will get prospective buyers over the sticker shock.</p> <h2><em>Cult of the Lamb</em>‘s <em>Woolhaven</em> DLC will be almost as long as the base game</h2>   <p>The action roguelike base-builder has an expansion coming in early 2026 and developer Massive Monster claims it will <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cultofthelamb/video/7546404300310859026?_t=ZN-8zTCaEzxTMM&amp;_r=1">effectively feel like a second game</a>. The wintery DLC adds new settlement mechanics, levels to explore, and brutal weather to survive. It looks neat but unlike all of the free updates generously showered on players, <em>Woodhaven</em> will be paid. No price has been revealed yet.</p>

 <p>“We tend to go all out, be at weddings, to raves, to three free massive content updates,” the devs said in a TikTok. “This DLC is not free, but I promise you’ll love it.”</p> <h2><em>Schedule 1</em> fans are voting on whether to finally bring shrooms to the hit Steam game</h2> <p>The drug-selling <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/schedule-is-solo-smash-hit-and-the">crewlike</a>‘s <em>Rival Cartels</em> update is live and the next <a href="http://Hireable Drivers, Fishing, and Shrooms.">community poll</a> is available for players to vote on. The three options are between Hireable Drivers, Fishing, and Shrooms, a psychedelic not currently available in the game. While drivers would be the most practical, fans of funky fungi have been waiting for their moment in the spotlight. Some players are chanting “Shrooms, baby!” Others say “Fishing EZ.” The weirdos howl “I want police raids so bad.”</p>

 <h2><em>MindsEye</em> devs surprise remaining players by actually continuing to fix the game</h2> <p>“I can’t wait for the next statement from the studio (it’s so fucking over),” wrote Electrical_Sugar_742 a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/comments/1n73bx6/i_cant_wait_for_the_next_statement_from_the/">couple of days ago</a>. But Build A Rocket Boy responded with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1n90pgy/update_4_pc_console/">update 4,</a> which is full of changes to the beleaguered action shooter. It addresses PC performance issues and adds quality-of-life improvements, including the ability to finally skip cutscenes. How are players responding?</p> <p>“I’ve deleted it for now,” wrote one. “Maybe by 2040 the game will reach 1.0,” wrote another. The most controversial patch note is “Removed EVERYWHERE vehicles from Build.MindsEye – those vehicles were made accessible unofficially, and we will bring them to MindsEye when they are ready.” User RazorLined wrote, “You guys really thought this was the time to make that change. Really guys. REALLY!?!” Tough crowd.</p>

 <h2>Repair support for every old Nintendo console before the Switch has officially ended</h2> <p>The <em>Mario</em> maker ran out of replacement parts for the New 2DS XL this week. “Due to the depletion of parts inventory required for repairs, we have terminated the repair service for the New Nintendo 2DS XL console as of September 4, 2025,” a&nbsp; <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1838479151034175962">post on X</a> reads, per X’s built-in translate function. “Repair services for all other Nintendo 3DS series have also been terminated.”</p> <p>The company ended <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1808707230377914724">repair support</a> for the Wii U last year.

                <p>Former longtime Bethesda marketing and publishing boss Pete Hines retired after Microsoft bought parent company ZeniMax, and in a new interview, he discussed one part of his career where he did the "dumbest thing."</p><p>Some may recall that one of the promised items in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-power-armor-edition-sold-out-bethesda-/1100-6461399/" data-ref-id="1100-6461399">Fallout 76's $200 Power Armor Edition</a> was a canvas West Tek bag. However, upon delivery, fans noticed that the bundle came with a low-cost nylon bag instead. Bethesda eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-power-armor-canvas-bag-flub-update-bet/1100-6463608/" data-ref-id="1100-6463608">did right by players</a>, but the events clearly left a mark on Hines.</p><p>He said in an interview with <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dbltap</a> that the version of the Power Armor Edition that he signed off on did not have a canvas bag. Someone was trying to "add more value" to the premium edition, and while Hines admits to throwing "sh*t fits" from time to time, in this case, "their hearts were in the right place" with the idea to add more value. What happened was that there was "literally a canvas shortage" at the time, and it was decided by "some folks" to include a nylon bag instead.</p><p>"My biggest failing there was not pushing immediately for making and sending one to everybody that wants one. Because I was still annoyed that the damn thing was in there in the first place, and nobody had told me and that this canvas shortage happened. It's probably the dumbest thing I ever did at Bethesda," he said.</p><p>Bethesda initially announced it would compensate purchasers with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-power-armor-edition-flub-leads-to-free-/1100-6463537/" data-ref-id="1100-6463537">500 Atoms for Fallout 76</a>, but players quickly roasted Bethesda for this, as it only amounts to $5 worth of compensation. The company later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-power-armor-canvas-bag-flub-update-bet/1100-6463608/" data-ref-id="1100-6463608">allowed purchasers who received a nylon bag to request a canvas bag.</a></p><p>Fallout 76 is still getting new updates and support, with plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-will-have-more-content-based-on-the-tv-show/1100-6533192/" data-ref-id="1100-6533192">more content to come based on the Prime Video Fallout TV series</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Star Wars Outlaws makes a strong case as being the best Star Wars game of recent years. Don’t get me wrong, I like Cal Kestis well enough, and I enjoyed Star Wars Hunters’ riff on Overwatch, but neither of them captured the universe of Star Wars in the way that Outlaws does. It’s helped immensely by lead Kay Vess, a charismatic swindler who never gives up despite finding herself drawn into shady shenanigans far bigger than she could imagine. While it’s been a long time coming, Outlaws finally arrives on Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo’s new handheld proves a perfect place to experience Kay’s adventures.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws: Nintendo Switch™ 2 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4pJCxIUm6Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Starting in the casino city of Canto Bight – memorably last seen in Star Wars: The Last Jedi – Kay, and her alien companion Nix, immediately show that they’re not the squeaky clean heroes we’re used to portraying in many other gaming universes. She skulks around the city’s backstreets, readying herself for a big score, stealing credits and insinuating herself into the right place at the right time. Soon enough, she makes the mistake of stealing from the wrong people, leaving the planet with the vicious Zliro at her heels.</p>


<p>It’s a great setup, and after crashing on Toshara, you find yourself balancing dirty work between a multitude of shady organisations, trying to curry favour with one, while attempting not to piss the others off too much. Actions have consequences to the story and the options that you’ll have later on, and it feels organic and interconnected, even as you’re embroiled in another unsavoury score with a different alien group.</p>
<p>When the time for being quiet is done, Kay is more than capable of making a hell of a lot of noise, blasting enemies into oblivion, and Outlaws’ mix of sneaking and shooting comes away feeling more like a Star Wars take on Uncharted than the many Assassin’s Creed comparisons. In fact, that’s nigh-on what it is, with plenty of clambering to be done between the quipping and thieving. Nathan Drake would be proud if he wasn’t at the other end of a galaxy, far, far away, and, you know, fictional.</p>

<div id="attachment_463530"><p id="caption-attachment-463530">Credit: Ubisoft via Nintendo</p></div>
<p>Here on Switch 2, you’re likely clamouring to know about performance, and while there have been clear cuts made from the PC, PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series consoles’ visuals, Switch 2 continues to impress as a viable place to play large, graphically intensive open-world games like we’ve seen with the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/hogwarts-legacy-on-switch-2-is-a-transfigurational-new-port/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>.</p>
<p>The first cut is to the frame rate, with the maximum refresh rate sitting at an expected 30fps. Anyone who claims that this is no longer playable hasn’t spent the last twenty years gaming, and it’s a locked 30fps too, making everything feel consistent, smooth and reliable. Would it feel better at 60fps? Yes, of course it would, but if that’s what you’re demanding, then you need to look at playing games of this scale and scope on other, more stationary platforms. This strikes the right balance for Switch 2.</p>
<p>Still, at times, Star Wars Outlaws looks amazing, and it manages to retain the same sense of scale and wonder that the original release did, even with a reduced resolution and trade offs with texture detail and foliage. That carries through to handheld mode, and while it’s a further step down in terms of resolution, it’s a thoroughly playable way to experience the game, with some smart changes to the UI to make it more palatable on the small screen.</p>
<p>Personally, the most noticeable differences are in the character models, and Kay Vess in particular looks far less detailed in in-engine cutscenes than she does on PC and the other more powerful systems. The character models were many players’ major complaint about those original versions, and they’re cut back further here.</p>
<p>However, you’re mostly going to view her from behind as she sneaks around and shoots aliens in the head, so personally, I wouldn’t worry too much about it. The stellar voice acting is fully present and correct, and the drama continues apace, even without a batch of hyper-detailed character models saying the lines.</p>
<div id="attachment_463538"><p id="caption-attachment-463538">Credit: Ubisoft via Nintendo</p></div>
<p>Distractions do come though, including the anti-aliasing shimmer around characters’ hair and beards, and there’s texture and shadow pop-in at what doesn’t always feel like the most obvious time. To be honest, the hair is the thing I dislike the most about the whole port, so I really hope they can find a way to alter that, or give you the option of turning some effects off. Crucially, none of these things alter the way the game plays, or how it feels, and they’re easy things to live with when you have a version of the game you can take outside.</p>
<p>There are a few different visual options that affect how you see Star Wars Outlaws, and the cinematic, 12:9 aspect ratio is probably key amongst them. This adds black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, while widening your field of view, and it really makes Outlaws feel more like a part of the Star Wars cinematic universe. You can add the film grain effect to that as well, but while I’m a fan of film grains in general, many will be glad to be able to toggle it off.</p>
<p>While these features were in the original versions, the Switch 2 gains a few exclusives of its own, and motion control is probably my favourite inclusion. Whether you’re playing in handheld or with a Pro Controller, you can utilise motion controls for some added nuance when aiming, and it makes a world of difference to how the gunplay feels and how precise you can be while playing. On top of that, there’s also a nice spot of HD rumble, bringing some extra feels to everything from footsteps to explosions, equivalent to a DualSense on PS5, and there’s the ability to use the touchscreen for menu management when you’re playing in handheld – something even Nintendo forget to include in many of their games!</p>
<div id="attachment_463537"><p id="caption-attachment-463537">Credit: Ubisoft via Nintendo</p></div>
<p>The final, and most stupefying thing, is the install size. This massive, open-world game – and all its previous DLC – has been compressed down to a measly 20GB. You’d expect the audio to have taken a massive hit as part of that, but it’s been done in such a way that I couldn’t tell, and I’m hugely sensitive to audio quality. It’s disappointing that this is yet another Switch 2 key card – apparently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:l45oa4c3p2ndptazexy33q3z/post/3lxzsvi6s7c2e">because the Switch 2 cartridge isn’t fast enough</a> compared to internal SSD and microSD Express – &nbsp;but at least it’s not making your storage creak and groan any more than is necessary.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a0675815f8305/octopath-traveler-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last weekend, the intrepid Alan Lopez hit Seattle to see what PAX West had to offer this year.</p>
<p>He went hands-on with a bunch of titles, large and small, coming to Switch 1 and/or 2, plus a handful more games from devs who would <em>love</em> to bring their work to a Switch near you...but have nothing to announce at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Let's kick things off with a big one from Square Enix...</p>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0 (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>“Octopath Traveler, but with a town builder” is a bit of an odd pitch. That’s where my mind went as I held a Switch 2 unit to demo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, a prequel to an RPG series that’s built up a lot of good faith among old-school RPG fans over its first two entries.</p>
<p>As this still relatively young series is held up proudly as proof of the timelessness of classic RPG elements — pixel art, turn-based combat, a deeply laboured soundtrack, and so on — that this new entry boasts town building as its showstopping new feature felt a little bit more trend-chasing by comparison. Not to mention that in this demo, I was tasked with the customisation of my own party, which flies in the face of the series' namesake, which is predicated on eight-way, pre-written narratives. “How much story are these random characters going to get?” I could only wonder as I clicked on generic avatar after generic avatar.</p>
<figure><a title="Octopath Traveler 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ade87bf13b895/octopath-traveler-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>To that point, it was only after I finished blindly placing homes and characters onto my plot of land that Octopath 0 started to feel more engaging in ways I could more immediately perceive. (The promised benefits of the town couldn’t be felt in under 30 minutes of gameplay, after all.)</p>
<p>After all the decorum, I left my little town and began exploring. Unlike the last games, your whole eight-person posse joins a battle as you're attacked in the wild. Every battle screen looked like a moshpit of anime characters, so much so that I found myself button-mashing my enemies to their death (to the disapproval of my Square rep), rather than conducting eight-way permutations of strategy. I get the sense this might only work in the early game, however, alluding to an added depth that could produce a kind of strategy RPG fans could really scale up to.</p>
<p>Luckily, there were elements of the demo that didn’t need any time to coalesce. The gorgeous art direction of HD 2D is looking better than ever, and the HD rumble from just walking around and tapping on things — let alone from the chaotic battles — felt phenomenal on the handheld Switch 2. And yes, we can all rejoice, as the “soundtrack-as-a-character” makes a triumphant return to the series, with musical cues and orchestrations which remain almost distractingly great.</p>
<p>Everything else, however, remains a matter of potential. I look forward to seeing how all these new decisions ultimately gel.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: December 4, 2025</strong></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bubsy-4d">Bubsy 4D (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Did you come here to read that a Bubsy game might actually be good? Or were you like most people, hoping to rubberneck another massive train crash? Because I’m about to type that a Bubsy game might finally, actually be good… and I’m worried that you, me, and anyone who loves to hate Bubsy might not have prepared ourselves for a universe with a fun Bubsy game in it.</p>
<p>Speaking of universes, that’s where this sequel to the hilariously maligned <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/bubsy_3d">Bubsy 3D</a> (1996) takes place. You’re in space, or something like it. A UFO comes and steals some sheep… or, something? Look, it doesn’t matter. It barely even matters to Bubsy himself. It’s all just an excuse to go jump on stuff, which is where that aforementioned good gameplay comes into play.</p>
<figure><a title="Bubsy 4D" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5522c9932cc24/bubsy-4d.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Atari</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Helmed by developer Fabraz (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/demon_turf">Demon Turf</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bubsy-4d">Bubsy 4D</a> takes clear inspiration from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Mario 64</a> speedrunning fandom culture that’s developed in the wake of that seminal game’s intervening 30+ years. In <em>4D</em>, Bubsy is tasked with reaching checkpoints separated by obstacle courses that have plenty of old-school platformer challenge, along with old-school ways of outsmarting all of them.</p>
<p>The physics of Bubsy’s moves are comprised largely of the most tippy-top, dopamine-producing aspects of Mario’s long jumps, double jumps, and climbing. In other words, it’s a game where the only way you <em>can</em> move makes you go “Weeee!” It’s all very janky! And the game’s visuals and style reinforce and celebrate that jankiness, though not for lack of a mastermind concept; everything you do in Bubsy 4D is designed to be broken. It rewards blistering speedrunning gimmicks most, yet still feels oddly satisfying any way you choose to hop around.</p>
<p>So when I say this game is weird, and kind of “bad” intentionally, I mean it from a place of deep reverence for the platformers of yesteryear, which Bubsy 4D clearly demonstrates a full understanding and clever embracing of. For once, it feels like Bubsy might be in on the joke.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: “Coming soon”</strong></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/love_eternal">Love Eternal (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>After experiencing this impressively produced indie title by developer brlka and publisher Ysbryd Games, I couldn’t quite tell you what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/love_eternal">Love Eternal</a> is about. But here’s what I can say: this horror 2D platformer makes you feel constantly on edge, quite uncertain, and eventually <em>locked in</em>.</p>
<p>You play as Maya, “a suburban child stolen from her family on the whim of a lonely god…escaping a castle built of bitter memories,” or at least that’s what’s going on according to the press release. As far as the demo goes, all you really know is that you’re a sleeping girl who gets called down from her room to join her family for dinner. Teenager stuff. Before you can sit down and eat, though, your mom asks you to go pick up a ringing telephone — yes, a landline, really accentuating the “bitter memories” part of the game’s description. It’s a fruitless task that rewards you only with a dial tone and an empty dinner table upon your return.</p>
<p>Then you go outside. Your house is magically burned to the ground. The atmosphere is morose and an ugly kind of blue. Lacking any alternative, your adventure begins as you head right, giving way to a series of 2D gravity platforming challenges that borrow most heavily from indie classics <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vvvvvv">VVVVVV</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>, except with an added nagging stress that something is very, very wrong.</p>

<p>It’s that upsetting undercurrent that makes Love Eternal conceptually exciting well beyond its gameplay influences. Without spoiling too much, it’s a very bold game that feels free to mess with you however it pleases, whenever it pleases.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: “2025”</strong></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/table_tactics">Table Tactics (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>What <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/table_tactics">Table Tactics</a> currently lacks in total polish, it makes up for in deeply amusing physics-based gameplay, the kind that kept me glued to my demo — as if I need another “just-one-more-turn” game in my life.</p>
<p>Those familiar with tabletop RPGs will have a leg-up on this action-strategy game, but honestly, despite the game’s menus borrowing from the complexity of that fandom, you don’t really need any experience with TTRPGs.</p>
<p>The game presents you with a literal table that you strategically cover in battle units: archers, swordsmen, catapults and the like. In typical medieval fashion, bad guy units begin to flood the table in waves, which you engage with in turn-based combat, not using hitpoints, but physics. For example, using my catapult, I sent a literal marble through the air and right into a pocket of enemies. It sent them all flying but one, which wobbled and survived like a stubborn bowling pin keeping me from a strike.</p>

<p>Using not much more than geometry, Table Tactics brings an excellent dose of action into a genre that is typically monopolised by number crunching and rules, which is giving my attention-deficit-brain a strategy game to actually look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: TBD</strong></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/woodo">Woodo (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>What sets <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/woodo">Woodo</a> apart from other 'cosy' games is obvious at a glance: holy heck, this adorable little puzzle game looks stunning, punching way above its weight in the graphics department. It's quickly obvious what a labour of love this is for developer Tiny Monks Tales, a tiny team of three, with the care and attention put into every single pixel.</p>
<p>The premise is far less complex than its visuals. You follow the tale of a little fox named Foxy, or at least you do once you click and drag pieces of her into the appropriate places to build her. That’s the gameplay; you get presented with a wooden, lifeless diorama of a scene, which you spin around in order to hunt for the exact location where every item in your inventory should go, almost like building a Lego set with light suggestions rather than instructions. Placing the right piece into just the right spot brings it to life with colour, often triggering a calming narration designed to feel like someone reading you a kid’s book.</p>

<p>It’s an extremely relaxing and charming game, akin to kicking back and painting little figures. (And frankly, it might be perfect if you want to gateway your little ones into painting Warhammer figurines.)</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: "2026"</strong></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sacrifire">SacriFire (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>The love affair between modern-day game devs and turn-based strategy feels never-ending these days, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sacrifire">SacriFire</a> is a game that aims to blend some new ideas into that original RPG recipe.</p>
<p>The game has been in development for several years, and this latest coat of paint from developer and publisher Pixilated Milk really showed off how far the game has come. The whole experience is gorgeous to look at with its 2D and 3D blended art direction, and it’s equally interesting to play, thanks to its real-time RPG mechanics where battle only moves whenever you do.</p>
<p>In the demo, after some basic RPG set-up, you find yourself in a dynamic battle where health and data are propped up above the characters as you run around a given circle to fight. Enemies shoot their shot (literally), which only move across the screen as you move your character within a circle, everything completely freezing when you do. It produces a sort of slow-motion bullet-hell kind of dodging and weaving.</p>
<p>For comparison’s sake, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/xenogears">Xenogears</a> was offered by the developers as a major inspiration, though the unique battle system reminded me of the recently released indie gem <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arco">Arco</a>, with a little bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/kingdom_hearts_-_hd_1_5_plus_2_5_remix_-_cloud_version">Kingdom Hearts</a> (if it were on the Sega Genesis) vibes — two very high compliments.</p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that it’s hard to tell with limited exposure how the full soundtrack will sound, but it is highly anticipated, as SacriFire is being helmed by none other than Motoi Sakuraba, composer of such OST gems as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/golden_sun">Golden Sun</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_ocean">Star Ocean</a>, and yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_tennis">Mario Tennis</a>.</p>
<p>As for how the story holds up — “Ezekiel Ridan, a young priest, struggles to keep his faith as the world he loves is threatened by a war between gods and demons.” — we’ll have to wait and see, as SacriFire is nearing release early next year.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: Q1 2026</strong></p>

<p><em>And now for a handful of games not yet confirmed for Switch, although we (and indeed their makers) have our fingers crossed...</em></p>
</div><div><h2>Rebounder</h2>

<p>As a professional game reviewer, you get exposed to so many games that you rarely get stunned into submission. So on that rare occasion when it’s a game’s graphics that stop you in your tracks, you do your best to communicate it with words. But honestly, I implore you to just click on the trailer and watch it, because nothing besides moving pictures can do <strong>Rebounder</strong> true justice.</p>
<p>This game is like if the <strong>Cowboy Bebop</strong> intro was a video game. This game is like if the grainy comics of a 1930s newspaper were magically animated on the paper, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics_Code_Authority">Comics Code Authority badge</a> and all. This game feels gritty, surprises you with off-the-wall animations screen after screen, and feels ice cool. Reader, I don’t want you to stop reading, but please go watch it in action.</p>
<p>Sadly, it’s just a fact that a lot of people are going to be stuck <em>watching</em> someone play this game, rather than playing it themselves; Rebounder’s gameplay is absolutely brutal. Whatever exists of a plot is centred around space-industrial labour extraction, as you’re a sort of coal miner of the future. That sets up the core idea of spelunking to grab these little floating orbs scattered around 2D obstacle courses, which you can grab and carry, and which have the bouncy physics of a basketball. They allow you exactly one double-jump before they expire back to where you grabbed them from.</p>
<p>Thus, what begins as a simple double-jump to the next room quickly evolves into elaborate off-the-wall self-passes through dangerous twists, turns, and spikes. You will die over and over again. People had to look away from the screen out of sheer frustration while I was playing. Though for anyone who loves outrageous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_maker_2">Mario Maker</a> levels and old-school platformer challenges, Rebounder is <em>heavenly</em> the way it makes you feel like a Harlem Globetrotter in space. Whether you are a fan of the genre or not, keep an eye (or two) on this one.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: TBD, Switch version TBD</strong></p>
</div><div><h2>Hyperbeat</h2>

<p>Rhythm games can sometimes feel like a simple way to get started in game development — build some menus, grab a song, and build the entire experience out on rails. <strong>Hyperbeat</strong>, an upcoming indie title from co-developers Alice Bottino and Chancellor Wallin, is having <em>none</em> of that; it’s narratively ambitious from the first screen on, and it never stops being extra wild, weird, and interesting.</p>
<p>The demo started with a strangely gripping scene between your low-polygonal character and a crow. Then followed an amusing character-building menu where you choose between irreverent but awesome neon styles. Oh, and it’s also worth mentioning your character’s walking animation, which consists of, I wanna say, three or four frames. In all, this low-fi, retro style might be easy to emulate, but it’s difficult to really make this style one’s own the way Hyperbeat does with ease. For those with an encyclopedic knowledge of video game history, I have to go back to 1999’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/vib_ribbon">Vib Ribbon</a> for my nearest point of comparison between narrative, graphics, and sound.</p>
<p>All of this stuff happens before you get even a single note of music — you know, the actual game itself — which is ultimately delivered in the form of your stick figure creation flying through a cylindrical tube aiming for octagons and arrows to slash at, hopefully in perfect time with the music. Something about how the gameplay flows in Hyperbeat really gets at your dopamine, because it’s all so extremely satisfying the way it comes at you so quickly. The fact that missing notes doesn’t make the experience stumble to a crawl goes a long way to making you feel like Mickey Mouse in <strong>Fantasia</strong>, majestically pointing things into existence — in this case, a dope-ass techno beat.</p>
<p>Hyperbeat might sound a bit unassuming of a title, and its creators are still green, yet this is somehow one of the most satisfying rhythm gameplay loops I’ve ever played. I truly can’t wait to play (and hear) more of it.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: TBD, Switch version TBD.</strong></p>
</div><div><h2>Echo Weaver</h2>

<p>From the developer of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikmin_1">Pikmin</a>-like indie title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wild_at_heart">The Wild at Heart</a> now comes <strong>Echo Weaver</strong>, a self-described <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/what-the-heck-is-a-metroidbrainia-introducing-the-newest-genre-on-the-block">“MetroidBRAINia”</a> title that plays like Metroid, but on a time loop.</p>
<p>It’s a little hard to keep up with that description, just the same as it is to understand what’s happening when you first start it. You play as a “weaver” in a labyrinth not unlike any Metroidvania you’ve ever played. But unlike Metroid itself, the game is <em>technically</em> beatable from the very first screen, earning its “MetroidBRAINia” description by the way you learn from your mistakes as you go.</p>
<p>You will do this in speedrunning fashion, as the flow of the game picks up steam until your sad, untimely death, after which you teleport back to your previous save point on a time loop, armed only with the knowledge of what you did wrong. When it all clicks, the gameplay unfolds like a clever speedrunning action piece where you bound over explosions, outsmart booby traps, and simply knowing what the door password is the next time around</p>
<p>It’s like if the classic movies <strong>Aliens</strong> and <strong>Run Lola Run</strong> had a baby, which of course would be stylistic and fast. Not a bad combo.</p>
<p><strong>Release Date: TBD, Switch version TBD</strong></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, the highly anticipated remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic, has officially reached a milestone of one million copies sold. This figure, announced by Konami via its official <a href="https://x.com/KONAMIUK/status/1963892658960482616" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UK Twitter account</a>, represents internal sales tracking rather than third-party verified numbers.</p><p>Still, the milestone marks a significant achievement for the project, which has faced intense scrutiny and pressure given the iconic status of the original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It's on par with sales figures for <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Gear" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">other remakes in the series</a>, and could potentially surpass them given time.</p><p>The milestone is notable not just for the sales figures, but also for the weight of its legacy. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the first major installment in the series since Hideo Kojima, the franchise's creator and longtime creative force, parted ways with Konami in 2015. The spin-off Metal Gear Survive, which was developed after Kojima had left the company, was not well-received.</p><p>Kojima himself was asked earlier this summer whether <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/" data-ref-id="1100-6533601">he would consider playing the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>, and his response was candid and dismissive. With a laugh, the legendary designer replied, "No, I won't." While brief, Kojima’s comments highlighted the enduring tension between him and Konami, a rift that has continued to shadow every Metal Gear-related development since their split.</p><p>Solid Snake's original American voice actor, David Hayter, said he would have liked to have been involved with Delta just so he could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/david-hayter-would-have-loved-a-redo-with-metal-gear-solid-delta/1100-6534214/" data-ref-id="1100-6534214">redo a lot of the dialogue</a> which carried over from the 2004 game to the remake. "I do feel that I'm a little better of an actor now than I was then," said Hayter. "It was fine back in the day, but I would have loved to bring some of the knowledge that I've picked up over the past 20 years to it."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
