                <p>Bandai Namco premiered a handful of new titles during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>, including a new, anime-inspired roguelike called Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree, which is coming to all major platforms this September.</p><p>Described as "a game drawing from classic Japanese art with a whimsical spin on Eastern mysticism," Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree pits players in the role of the titular priestess, who embarks on a journey alongside one of eight other guardians to defeat the evil Magatsu.</p><p>Towa and another guardian work cooperatively as a duo, delving into dungeons and battling Magatsu's minions together. According to Bandai Namco, "Each guardian has its own abilities and set of swords, making each combat style and guardian pair unique."</p><p>Between quests, players will spend time in a village, which develops over the course of the game. "As the guardians pursue their quests across different timelines, the village evolves over the years. Develop unique bonds with its residents and learn more about their customs and stories that are woven into the inner workings of the village," Bandai Namco explains.</p><p>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree launches for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch on September 19. The game supports solo play as well as local and online co-op.</p>

                <p>After almost a year of beta testing, Indonesian developer Fajrul FN dropped a new trailer for their new indie beat-'em-up Acts of Blood during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>.</p><p>Set in a hazy southeast Asian dystopia, the game focuses on a young man attempting to avenge his dead father against a seemingly infinite number of hard-hitting criminals. Our hero, however, looks like he hits harder. The combat appears to be very much influenced by the recent slate of absolutely brutal Indonesian martial arts flicks, such as Gareth Evans' The Raid, or Timo Tjahjanto's The Night Comes For Us. Gameplay-wise, though, Acts of Blood appears to be taking its cues from the free-flowing mechanics of Sloclap's Sifu, another unique take on beat-'em-ups pitting a lone fighter against a keen-to-kill swarm of enemies, except Acts of Bloods hero apparently isn't above laying waste to his enemies with the nearest baseball bat, crowbar or shotgun.</p><p>All that combines with a hint of Mirror's Edge-style parkour across the city. There even appears to be a direct homage to The Raid 2's infamous prison courtyard fight. That means, a lot of hectic, bonecrushing hand-to-hand fights, narrow acrobatic escapes from the authorities, and, apparently, one badass jacket.</p><p>The game is due out on Steam in Summer 2026. Check out the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBrShm1X61U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sBrShm1X61U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

                <p>Epic Games Publishing announced Wiredfly and Kong Orange's Out of Words during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest</a>, a co-op side-scrolling action-adventure game. The characters have lost their mouths--and the ability to speak--and must work together during their colorful journey as they engage with a variety of challenges. A distinguishing feature is that all of the characters and environments have been crafted and animated using traditional, physical stop-motion animation, with the trailer showing part of the creation process for characters.</p><p>The game is based on an original concept by Danish poet Morten Søndergaard. The two leads, Kurt and Karla, find themselves in the fantastical realm of Vokabulantis, where they must work together to overcome the various challenges in their way. While the two are described as "friends," there are hints that the game will see their relationship blossom in a more romantic way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdOLvr2MQjI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gdOLvr2MQjI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game features both online and local co-op play. Despite the leads' wordless nature in-game, you'll need to communicate with your co-op partner in order to solve puzzles. Puzzles shown in the trailer include elements like shifting gravity and using a grappling device to traverse the side-scrolling landscapes.</p><p>Out of Words is planned for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via the Epic Games Store. No details on potential cross-play or a release date have yet been given.</p>

Studio co-founder Graham Smith claims that the newly announced Blighted is the team’s “largest and most ambitious game to date.”</p><p>Revealed for the first time during today’s Summer Game Fest presentation, Blighted is an isometric action/RPG that calls to mind games like Hades at first glance, but the developers actually cite Metroidvania games as a core direction.&nbsp;</p><p>Playable either solo or cooperatively, the game focuses on a lone survivor who must retrieve the lost memories of his destroyed village after a being named Sorcisto has consumed them. Blighted features a focus on precise and fast-moving combat built around combos and finishers, and your own Blight acts as a dynamic difficulty scaler that changes enemies, your own character, and the surrounding world.&nbsp;</p><p>Blighted is being scored by Jim Guthrie, whose prior work includes titles like Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP, Below, and Nobody Saves the World.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on both the concept and the pedigree of the studio, this feels like a title worth watching closely.&nbsp;</p><p>Blighted doesn’t yet have a release date, but the developer shared that we can expect it to arrive on Steam.</p><p url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGU-7zvoNfU&amp;ab_channel=DrinkboxStudios" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OGU-7zvoNfU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Neil Patrick Harris is stepping into the leading role, and based on the banter from this reveal, he’s got a strong handle on the irreverent tone of the sometimes-hero.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a surprise to see a VR title for such a high-profile Marvel superhero franchise, but the involvement of developer Twisted Pixel gives good reason to be hopeful. Through titles like ‘Splosion Man and Comic Jumper, the team established solid cred for doing goofy humor, and that same team has done work on VR in its more recent releases.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on the initial trailer, Deadpool VR appears to feature a thematically appropriate mix of weird characters, extreme violence, and idiotic humor. The gameplay shown appears to be first-person shooting and other actions, such as driving and traversal.&nbsp;</p><p>Deadpool VR is targeting a release later this year, and you’ll only be able to play on Meta Quest 3 and 3S.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jof1MtYccs&amp;ab_channel=MetaQuest">age-restricted full trailer on YouTube</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mechabreak">Mecha Break</a> has just got a release date revealed at Summer Game Fest! It'll launch on July 1 on Steam and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>This reveal came with a lengthy cinematic trailer in which a whole lot of robot action happened, some sad lad hanging out in a ruined city dropped a dog tag, and then hopped into his own mech to fly about and shoot lasers. It was pretty cool! You can watch the trailer below.</p>

<p>Mecha Break proved exceptionally popular on Steam when it held an open beta test earlier this year, and it was great fun too. You can play standard PvP matches against an opposing team of mech pilots, or alternatively head into the battle royale Mashmak mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Summer Gamesfest continues with the first proper look at ILL,a narrative-driven first-person survival horror game that transports you to a sinister settlement where the inhabitants have gone bonkers, removed most of their clothes and want to eat your face, so a bit like Liverpool city centre at 4am.</p>
<p><iframe title="ILL - Official Gameplay Trailer (New Photo Realistic Horror FPS)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D0OuzKYGRVo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here’s more from the Steam page for the game:</p>
<p>“Prepare to embrace new boundaries of horror. ILL offers a visceral and realistic depiction of body horror: disgusting, monstrous creatures can be gruesomely dismembered and traumatized. Torn flesh, exposed bones, and gutted organs—all combine to create an unprecedented and vicious experience that will leave you breathless.”</p>
<p>“Your enemies are cunning and unpredictable. They don’t remain in a constant state of attack but suffer pain and react to all manner of events. Hits on different enemy body parts elicit unique reactions, replete with animations and visual effects. Enemies’ appearance will vary with diverse textures, proportions, and animations — you’ll never know what twisted form your adversaries will take next.”</p>

<p>“Experience a comprehensive weapon system where malfunction checks, ammunition types, and mandatory maintenance are crucial. Feel the weight and realism of each weapon in the protagonist’s hands, thanks to procedural animation that considers physical characteristics. The game’s world offers a range of ammo and weapon upgrades, demanding strategic choices for survival. Stay sharp, as every decision can mean the difference between life and death.”</p>
<p>“ILL will captivate you with its physically believable world, teeming with rich possibilities of interaction. Manipulate objects, navigate through intricate levels, and experience the consequential effects of real-world physics in gameplay and combat. This means the game’s world is not just a backdrop but an integral part of the gameplay experience, drawing you deeper into the terrifying reality of the town and its deadly creatures.”</p>
<p>ILL will launch on PC, no console versions have been announced yet.</p>

		<p>On their last night together, three friends embark on one final adventure and you get to play it all while listening to an era-defining collection of songs from the likes of DEVO, Roxy Music, Lush, The Smashing Pumpkins, Iggy Pop, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, the Cure and many more.</p>
<p><iframe title="MIXTAPE | Summer Game Fest 2025 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6TQF6eJa3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“En route to their final party together, a perfectly curated playlist draws three friends into dreamlike reenactments of their formative memories. Experience a variety of narrative vignettes exploring the pivotal moments that shaped them. Players will immerse themselves in the teenage wasteland by playing through a mixtape of joyful gameplay, from skateboarding and flying to taking photos after hours at an abandoned theme park, hitting baseballs, and putting on a fireworks show from the backseat of a car. It’s the greatest hits of the teenage experience, from the first kiss to the last dance.”</p>
<p>“From Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur, developers of BAFTA award-winning game The Artful Escape, Mixtape draws inspiration from classic coming-of-age movies, bringing together nostalgic aimlessness, mischief, music, the highs and lows of adolescence, and the bittersweet feelings brought about by growth, transformation, and moving on.”</p>

<p>Mixtape is coming soon on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/mina-the-hollower-release-date-announced-demo-now-available-on-steam/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mina-the-hollower-release-date-announced-demo-now-available-on-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mina the Hollower, the next game from legendary indie developers Yacht Club Games, the team behind beloved 2D platformer <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/shovel-knight-spectre-of-torment/">Shovel Knight</a>, finally has a release date. It'll arrive on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC on October 31, 2025.</p>
<p>Since Shovel Knight launched, Yacht Club has only made <a href="https://wccftech.com/shovel-knight-dig-king-of-cards-showdown/">Shovel Knight-related games</a>, with a brief publishing stint to publish Cyber Shadow. Mina the Hollower is the first non-shovel-related game developed by Yacht Club in a decade.</p>
<p>Thankfully, players who've been waiting for something totally new from Yacht Club for years don't have to wait entirely until October 31 to try out Mina the Hollower, as there's a demo available on PC right now.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mina the Hollower: Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KT4R9pu1Ew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Whereas Shovel Knight had his shovel, Mina the Hollower has her whip and digging abilities, and by the look of the trailer, there will still be plenty of platforming for players to enjoy.</p>
<p>Yacht Club games is arguably one of the best indie developers in the industry right now, so expectations for everything they make are set very high. After so long without anything not involving a shovel, it'll be interesting to see how Mina the Hollower lands with players when it arrives this coming Halloween.</p>

My bad, too much <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-gets-a-release-date-plus-a-creepy-new-trailer-with-more-limb-cracking-noises-than-a-chiropractor-convention">Silent Hill going around</a>.

<p>Definitely one for the photorealism fans out there. But it's not just about admiring (?) the wobbling flesh and unhealthy pallor of your enemies, says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757350/ILL/">the Steam page</a>. Your weapons are designed to be a bit more frictional than your average FPS. </p>
<p>"Experience a comprehensive weapon system where malfunction checks, ammunition types, and mandatory maintenance are crucial. Feel the weight and realism of each weapon in the protagonist’s hands, thanks to procedural animation that considers physical characteristics."</p>
<p>Ill was once known as "Project Ill" and began life as a concept trailer from a couple of brothers making horribly detailed fear with Unreal Engine. Since then it has grown to become a realistic horror shooter, albeit one in which you'll still have to do the requisite video game crafting and scavenging. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Earlier this week, IO Interactive showed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">the first trailer</a> for their long-awaited Bond game, 007: First Light. Now they're bringing a bit of Bond back to their most famous creation, Hitman: World Of Assassination. Starting today, a new Elusive Target has been added to the game: Le Chiffre, as depicted Mads Mikkelsen in Casino Royale. There's a trailer below.

<p>The new target was announced during this evening's Summer Game Fest stream. Apparently Mads will be added to Hitmads in a few hours from when I'm writing this, and will be available in-game to kill for 30 days. If you play it, you'll unlock some sort of reward in 007: First Light when it launches next year.
</p>
<p>World Of Assassination is what the modern Hitman trilogy morphed into once IO Interactive had finished it and grown tired of releasing their games in the most complicated bundle of products possible. It contains all the levels and story modes from Hitman 1-3, various challenges modes, a roguelike mode, and a rotating cast of Elusive Targets, often based on celebrities or famed fictional characters. Mads is following in Sean Bean's footsteps, basically.
</p>
<p>Whenever Le Chiffre arrives, you'll be able to grab it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659040/HITMAN_World_of_Assassination/">via Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I don’t mean in terms of the games it’s showing, I’m talking about the actual showmanship. Keighley’s stage show has been pretty paint-by-numbers without a lot of good bits and showmanship. That changed when he read a snarky letter from someone who wanted to show off a new game. As he recited the monologue, rough stick drawings appeared on the stage’s screen, eventually adorning the stage with <em>Deadpool</em> logos and crude drawings. The thought of a new game starring the Merc with a Mouth got my attention...until it was revealed to be a VR game.</p><p>Folks, I’m in Los Angeles right now for the Summer Game Fest event, and after spending so much less time in cars while living in New York City, I’ve gained a newfound disdain for things that give me motion sickness. I can’t get anywhere without becoming nauseous in the backseat of an Uber. This has plagued me every time I have tried a VR game over the past decade, and that means these games are a non-starter for me. So I guess y’all have fun with <em>Deadpool VR</em>. Maybe I’ll watch a Let’s Play. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195579" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="178" data-playlist="195579,196411,195891" data-current="195579"><div><p>This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21074.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>One cool thing is that Deadpool is voiced by <em>How I Met Your Mother </em>star Neil Patrick Harris this time around.

After escaping from a decade in captivity and the horrific experiments performed on him by the Baron, Crane makes his way to the once-bustling tourist destination in search of vengeance and finds it overrun with zombies.</p><p>Like previous games, the infected people stalking the streets during the day will be the least of your worries, because once the sun sets, the worst of the zombie horde comes out to play.

If brute force isn't enough, Crane can also make use of various melee weapons and firearms to even the odds. Priced at $60 for the standard edition, preorders will unlock the Hero of Harran Bundle.

Another Shovel Knight project, the upgraded Shovel Of Hope DX, was announced during a Nintendo Indie World last year as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Mina The Hollower launches October 31, but PC is the only platform confirmed as of this writing.</p>
