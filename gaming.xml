            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/16/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Alongside the earth-shattering appearance of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, there has come a bevy of new peripherals. Nintendo’s submissions have included the new Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, alongside a brand new iteration of their Pro Controller, for those that think sticking two Joy-Con into a hand grip is beneath them. Or maybe, they just want to play multiplayer?</p>
<p>The first thing that hits you about the Switch 2 Pro Controller – henceforth the Pro Controller 2 – is the quality of the soft touch plastics Nintendo have used. The surface feels genuinely lovely, perfectly smooth and supple under your palms and a match for the feel of the Switch 2 and Joy-Con 2 themselves. The downside of that is that there are no textured sections or grips, so there’s a higher chance if your hands are of the sweatier persuasion that they’re going to start sliding about. Personally, I’ve had no problems through a heap of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/fast-fusion-review/">Fast Fusion</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/cyberpunk-2077-switch-2-review-ps4-xbox-comparison/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, but, well, you know your own hands.</p>



<p>The Pro Controller 2 is relatively plain, with black used through the main body, with a light grey panel across the top for the shoulder buttons and beneath the sticks. I don’t really like the two-tone look, if I’m honest, but when you’re playing you can’t see the white section at all, so I guess it doesn’t matter all that much.</p>
<p>The Pro Controller 2, like its predecessor, is here to make your Switch 2 gameplay feel a bit more familiar, aping the Xbox controller’s layout and giving you an experience that is closer to the other console manufacturers. Ergonomically, it’s similar to the original Switch Pro Controller, and I still think that’s amongst the most comfortable controllers out there, so we’ll take that as a win.</p>


<p>The Pro Controller 2 is ever-so-slightly less wide, though, and 15g lighter at 235g, making it just that little bit easier to live with through longer gaming sessions. It still has enough weight not to feel like a throwaway toy, but if you like a chunkier feeling controller, this might not be the way you wanted Nintendo to go.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that the new Joy-Con 2 and their included grip don’t feel good – they do – but there’s still the uncanny sense that something is slightly amiss and the dimensions might not meet what your hands want, or a little too cramped for larger hands.. The Pro Controller 2 completely remedies that, purely based on ergonomics, and if you’re planning on spending a lot of time with your Switch 2 docked, it takes a step towards essential.</p>

<p>The major improvements that the Pro Controller 2 has over its predecessor are a 3.5mm audio jack socket for attaching your wired headphones to, enhanced HD Rumble 2 and the addition of two ‘pro’ back buttons underneath each grip, labelled GL and GR. The audio out is a massive boon, and it was a major omission the first time around. The ease of attaching any wired headset shouldn’t be underestimated, and the audio being piped through sounds spot on.</p>
<p>On top of that, the improved rumble is much more powerful than that of the original Pro Controller, which I thought was interesting given the reduced weight. As <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review/">Welcome Tour</a> teaches you, it’s not all about how much things weigh, with the HD Rumble 2 altering the way the weight moves in order to create both more powerful and more nuanced feedback. I think the DualSense’s haptics are better than those in the Pro Controller 2, but this isn’t too far off.</p>

<p>The GL and GR buttons are also hugely welcome. They’re placed well beneath your fingertips, just out of a position where you would accidentally catch them, but easily pressed when you want them thanks to the generous proportions.</p>
<p>Even better, the programming for them is baked into the Switch 2’s UI, and you can clone pretty much any of the regular inputs. That’s been great for Cyberpunk 2077, moving the reload function to allow my fingers to stay on the analogue sticks. I’m not sure it helped all that nuch with my aim, but I think that’s more the game’s fault than mine.</p>

<p>Those analogue sticks feel great too, with smooth, frictionless motion, and a nicely weighted spring back to centre. Now, it is obviously disappointing that Nintendo haven’t opted for Hall Effect/TMR sticks, especially when they had serious problems with stick drift through the last generation, but only time will tell just how robust Nintendo’s manufacturing is. Right now the sticks feel great with a very smooth feeling action. Two years down the line? It’s hard to say, but when you’re paying £75 for a controller, you want to be certain that it’s going to last and Nintendo haven’t put the question to bed.</p>
<p>The other input buttons are responsive and comfortable in use, membrane buttons through the main face buttons, D-pad, shoulder pads and triggers. The shoulder buttons activate all the way along their length, and the triggers are quick while their wide surface makes them incredibly comfortable to use.</p>
<p>I do get to air my massive gripe here though – why don’t Nintendo like analogue triggers? They’re basically saying that they don’t want serious racing games on their platform, and when you’ve got a system that’s capable of handling realistic ports alongside Xbox and PlayStation, I think it’s a real misstep. Amusingly, they have set themselves up as a great place for FPS though, from the digital triggers on the Pro Controller to the Switch 2’s new mouse functionality, so I guess it’s a one step forward, one step back kind of thing.</p>
<p>Nintendo have tweaked things elsewhere with the Pro Controller 2. The face buttons are slightly larger, so they’re easier to activate, and they’ve raised the + and – buttons to make them easier to find without looking. I do not like how they feel though, as they stand a bit too proud from the controller for my liking, but then they’re better than on the original Pro Controller. Somewhere in between would have been the sweet spot, but I guess that will come with the Switch 3 in 2032.</p>

<p>Other than that, there’s the new Chat button, right in the bottom centre of the faceplate. This is actually a great little innovation from Nintendo, putting chat and communication front and centre for once, and with the added GameShare possibilities that let people easily play multiplayer from one copy of the game, I think that this is quietly the Nintendo Switch 2’s best feature (not including a working eShop).</p>
<p>Nintendo have once again priced the Pro Controller 2 at the top end of what I’d expect to pay for a console’s ‘standard’ controller, now coming in at £75 compared to the last generation’s pricing of £60. That’s going to be pretty rich for a lot of people, but it is definitely a very nice rendition of the Nintendo Pro Controller style, with the added benefit of audio out, onboard Chat button, and the easily remapped grip inputs. However, I really wanted to see Hall Effect sticks – or similar – and when Gamesir are putting out great options like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review/">Super Nova</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">Cyclone 2</a>, I think Nintendo have missed an opportunity to put their controller at the top of the tier list.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the original Pro Controller, and original Joy-Cons for that matter, all work with the Switch 2, and many third party controllers are getting firmware updates for compatibility as well. With Nintendo’s older controllers you’ll be missing out on the new bells and whistles – frankly, the 3.5mm output is enough for me to make the jump – and it’s always a bit fussy pairing third party controllers, but if you’ve spent all your money on a new console, and you’ve got some of the older peripherals lying around, there’s definitely less rush to upgrade than there might have been before.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/misc-a-tiny-tale-looks-super-smooth-on-switch-2-thanks-to-a-dev-hunch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We have been following development on the cosy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>-style adventure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/misc_a_tiny_tale">Misc. A Tiny Tale</a> since way back in 2021. The game is set to arrive on Switch on <strong>22nd July</strong> and, through the magic of backwards compatibility, you'll also be able to play it on Switch 2 with better resolution, frame rates and more responsive gameplay. That all comes despite it being in development for years. Why? Because developer Tinyware Games had a hunch about what Switch 2 would be capable of.</p>
<p>The new gameplay comparison (above) showcases the performance improvements in action, but they were only made possible after the team took a punt on Switch 2's upscaling features long before anything was confirmed.</p>
<p>That is according to Tinyware founder and Misc. lead developer Michael Pearce, who recently told us that the team "had a theory before the Nintendo Switch 2 was even revealed, that it may play backwards compatible Nintendo Switch games at a better and more stable resolution and frame rate, especially the games which had no cap put on their rendering". With this in mind, the team "purposely made our resolution on the Nintendo Switch version dynamic, letting it scale up for this theoretical new system," and it did the same thing to the frame rate, "uncapping it to give it room for a max of 60 FPS, which is more than the S1 could theoretically handle".</p>
<p>Like so many studios, Tinyware was not given access to a Switch 2 dev-kit before launch, so it had to wait until it could borrow a system to see if the gamble had paid off. And pay off it did. "The resolution had jumped from (in some cases) 480p at 30fps in handheld mode on Nintendo Switch, to 1080p at 60fps on the Nintendo Switch 2," Pearce told us. There were a bunch of other improvements too: "load times are much faster on the Nintendo Switch 2 system," he continued, "Texture pop in is practically absent, button presses are more responsive, and the overall experience is simply smoother and better".</p>
<p>According to Pearce, Switch 2 "runs the game like a dream". Of course, this isn't to the detriment of the Switch 1 version — "We’re really proud of the performance we’ve achieved over the last few years making the game for the Nintendo Switch," he clarified — but the Switch 2 improvements are apparently "really special".</p>
<p>Gosh, it sounds like quite a risk, but at least it paid off, eh! Misc. A Tiny Tale will arrive on Switch and Switch 2 (via backwards compatibility) on 22nd July.</p>

On May 9, after Nintendo and Xbox had announced $80 video games like<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262?_gl=1*1wff535*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTAwODUwMzAkbzQ0MyRnMSR0MTc1MDA4NzEyOSRqNyRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262?_gl=1*1wff535*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTAwODUwMzAkbzQ0MyRnMSR0MTc1MDA4NzEyOSRqNyRsMCRoMA.."><em> Mario Kart World</em></a></span>, Pitchford told fans at PAX East that a price was going to be announced soon. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-preorders-randy-pitchford-pax-east-1851780045&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-preorders-randy-pitchford-pax-east-1851780045">He also claimed to have no idea what the price would be</a></span>, but assured people that the game would be worth it. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-games-1851781445&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-games-1851781445">Then, on May 20, Pitchford really stepped in it</a></span>. When a fan asked him on social media about a possible $80 price tag on <em>Borderlands 4</em>, he infamously replied: “If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen.” This went over poorly with the internet. A few days later he said he didn’t mean to sound like an asshole. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855">A week later, he posted a 573-word tweet</a></span> apologizing and explaining that he just meant that <em>Borderlands 4</em> would be  fine even with the higher price tag, and that he didn’t intend to set off a firestorm of controversy and discourse. </p><p>That brings us to today, where 2K has finally confirmed that <em>Borderlands 4</em> is only $70. After all that hoopla and online drama, it turns out the game is going to cost what nearly every other AAA video game in 2025 costs: $70, plus tax. Was any of that worth it in the end? Not really. But hey, at least <em>Borderlands 4</em> isn’t going to hold the game hostage and force you to pay a ransom fee to play a few days early. That’s nice! </p><p><em>Borderlands 4 </em>launches (for everyone, at the same time) September 12 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC. </p><p>&nbsp;.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whenever a new game comes out, be it big like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> or small like <em>Blue Prince</em>, mods quickly become available on Nexus for everything from helping with inventory management to enhancing visuals. It’s been a cornerstone of PC gaming for many players for decades now, though Dark0ne suggested nothing much will change in the day-to-day now that he’s no longer running it. </p><p>“I started this project back in 2001, in my bedroom, with a 56k modem, an excitement for the upcoming release of <em>Morrowind</em> and with no grand ambitions or intentions,” he wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in an update on the Nexus Mods website</a></span>. “I didn’t set out to build a business, I just wanted to make a place where modders could share their work without worrying it would vanish into the internet either [<em>sic</em>] the next time a fansite went offline or a publisher decided they were done with it. That idea grew legs, sprouted arms, and turned into Nexus Mods.”<br></p><p>Dark0ne said he’s been looking for someone else to take over management of Nexus Mods for a while now due to all the stress of running a small online social network, but it wasn’t until recently that he found someone to take over who “really ‘gets’ the modding community the way I do.” He didn’t reveal who that someone is, though, or the price tag for the deal. Is Nexus Mods about to get way worse? Some users are already freaking out about paid subscriptions coming. Dark0ne claims not much will change in the immediate future, though. <br></p><p>“Behind the scenes, I’ve already been stepping back bit by bit,” he wrote. “Over the past few years, the team has taken on more of the weight and the site’s been doing better than ever. What’s changing now is simply the formality of it, making sure the right people are in place to guide Nexus Mods into the next era. That includes some structural updates to the company ownership that we aren’t shouting about, but I want to be transparent: they’re about long-term stability, not changing the values or direction of the platform. Nexus Mods is community-first and mod-author focused, that’s not up for negotiation.”</p><p>Some shifts have already been underway at Nexus Mods, which is run by a team of 40 people. A big one was moving to ease rules on modders <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13501488-publisher-approved-paid-modding-policy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13501488-publisher-approved-paid-modding-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting paid for their work</a></span>. Some modders now link to Patreons and other places where people can donate to them directly for ongoing updates to certain popular mods in games like <em>Starfield</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em>. Nexus Mods community managers said at the time that the goal was to find a way to balance compensation incentives with the desire to keep the modding scene free and open, even as companies like Bethesda try to monetize creator work in their games. </p><p>Nexus Mods has also recently taken stands again bigotry. The site refused to host a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nexus-mods-starfield-pronouns-removal-deleted-why-woke-1850843599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nexus-mods-starfield-pronouns-removal-deleted-why-woke-1850843599"><em>Starfield </em>mod back in 2023</a></span> that deleted pronoun options from the game. Nexus Mods told <em>404 Media </em>at the time that it wasn’t meant as a political statement, but as a way to protect its users. “[The] removal of diversity, while appealing to many, does not promote a positive modding community,” they said. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official 18 Minute Gameplay Deep Dive Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Each Bounty Pack will feature a new area with fresh missions alongside a unique boss fight, loot, a new type of personalized Digirunner vehicle, and a Vault Card with its own set of rewards for completing certain challenges. Bounty Packs will be included in the Deluxe and Super Deluxe Editions of the game.</p><p>The previous mainline Borderlands games have had four post-launch expansions. The first Borderlands game introduced fan-favorite character Moxxi in the Underdome Riot expansion, Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep from Borderlands 2 was critically acclaimed, and Borderlands 3 brought back everyone's favorite villain Handsome Jack--kind of--for a heist story.</p><p>Paywalling new Vault Hunters behind post-launch content isn't unusual either for the series, as characters like Gaige, Krieg, Handsome Jack's doppelganger Timothy, and Aurelia were all available as DLC or as preorder bonuses. The only exception to the rule is Borderlands 3, as all four playable Vault Hunters were available at launch and no additional characters were introduced as post-launch DLC.</p><p>Borderlands 3 also had a lot of free DLC added to it over the years, with one of the more notable examples being a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-science-a-puzzle-game-with-real-world-/1100-6475772/">block-shifting puzzle game</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/millions-of-borderlands-players-have-been-recognized-for-their-contributions-to-science/1100-6522765/">helped real-world scientists organize data</a>. Millions of players took part in this project, and they were officially recognized as scientific contributors for their help. Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Switch 2</a>, and ahead of its arrival, Gearbox has been sharing a few more details on the game.</p><p>We've already seen some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-will-feature-substantial-changes-for-co-op-players/1100-6531451/">big co-op changes that Gearbox has been working on</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/">more details on the new Vault Hunters have been revealed</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-loot-system-offers-more-variety-than-ever-before/1100-6531246/">loot system has also been overhauled</a>.</p>

                <p>2K Games has officially announced the price point for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a>, and it's not $80. In a <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/pre-order/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the publisher confirmed that preorders are now available, and the game's standard edition is $70.</p><p>Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal, but with Mario Kart World going for $80 and The Outer Worlds launching later this year at $80, many are wondering how many other games will follow suit. The pricing discussion for Borderlands 4 was further elevated by Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford, who controversially said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-says-he-didnt-mean-to-trigger-people-with-comments-on-the-price/1100-6531910/" data-ref-id="1100-6531910">"real fans" would find a way to pay $80 for the game</a> if it ended up costing that much.</p><p>Although Borderlands 4's standard edition is priced at $70, Gearbox is offering other options that cost more. There is a $100 deluxe edition that comes with various extras, while a $130 Super Deluxe edition has even more. A $150 Collector's Edition is also on the way, and it doesn't include a copy of the game.</p><p>Beyond the various editions of Borderlands 4, Gearbox is inviting people to pay even more on the game's post-launch content. Borderlands 4 is getting two Story Packs (included with the Super Deluxe edition), and each adds a new vault hunter, a new region of the game world to explore, more missions, and additional loot. There are also four Bounty Packs coming after launch, adding new areas with more missions and a "unique" boss fights. Pricing for these packs outside the game's premium editions was not disclosed, but be sure to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-post-launch-plans-include-new-vault-hunters-but-they-wont-be-free/1100-6532453/" data-ref-id="1100-6532453">read up on all the Borderlands 4 post-launch DLC information.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-price-is-a-mystery-even-to-randy-pitchford/1100-6531437/" data-ref-id="1100-6531437">Speaking at PAX East</a>, Pitchford said it's a "gnarly" time in the video game industry when it comes to economics.</p><p>"On one level, we've got a competitive marketplace where people who make [pricing] choices want to sell as many units as possible and they want to be careful about people that are price-sensitive," he said. "So there are some folks who don't want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are. There are other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing and there are tariffs for the retail packaging."</p><p>Borderlands 4 has "more than twice" the development budget of Borderlands 3, Pitchford said, adding that he hopes the game sells as many copies as possible so Gearbox can reinvest those funds into future products.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="712655663"

So with <em>Mario Kart World </em>kicking off the Switch 2’s launch this month, why not see if we can end a few more by trying to rank these games from worst to best?</p><p>The series has evolved over the years, from a simple racer based on the Mushroom Kingdom to a motorized <em>Smash Bros.,</em> drawing in racers and tracks from across the Nintendo universe. And as it’s got older it’s got bigger, going from a mere karting game to something that let us drive quads, bikes, hovercars and even two-seat mobile weapons platforms, and now to a full open world.</p><p>As is often the case with Pecking Orders, the idea here isn’t <em>really </em>to rank these games from worst to best, because even the ones down the bottom of the list are still loads of fun. It’s to pit these classics against one another, to not just see which one comes out on top, but <em>why</em>.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-super-circuit-yoshi-bowser-mario-peach-luigi-1850155523&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-super-circuit-yoshi-bowser-mario-peach-luigi-1850155523"><em>Mario Kart</em> Fans Aghast To Learn About Secret Points That Tilt The Scales</a></span></p><p>Note that we’ve excluded the arcade games on two grounds: one, that loads of us (and you) haven’t played them, and two, because so much of their content, from tracks to sound effects, is recycled content from mainline games (in a more literal way than newer console games including older tracks).</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-recommend-id="image://xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="787" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-recommend-id="image://xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="787" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We’ve got to start somewhere, and this is easiest place. Concessions had to be made to make the game work on mobile in an <em>economic</em> sense, we get that. You can’t release a phone game in the last decade without tying it to some kind of bizarre money-making scheme.</p><p>But the game itself could have been so much better. Emulation of classic Nintendo games is at the point where many people could play <em>Double Dash</em> on their phones if they wanted to, so to offer up such a compromised version of the series as an official release is a crushing disappointment.</p><p>By the standards of 2019 mobile game releases, it’s fine? But by the standards set by the rest of this series, <em>Mario Kart Tour</em> is a comfortable last-place finish, no red shell required.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-recommend-id="image://wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-format="png" data-width="960" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-recommend-id="image://wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-format="png" data-width="960" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s many people’s least favourite (at least proper) <em>Mario Kart</em> game because it’s both so old and there’s so little to recommend it. The original has the purity of its vision and nostalgia to play on, while later games are just, well, better. <em>Super Circuit</em>, caught between the original’s pioneering release and releasing long after the series’ 3D debut, is trapped and a little lost, at least when we’re looking back on the series as a whole from our contemporary vantage point.</p><p>Know what’s really cool about it though? The original’s visuals haven’t aged that great, but <em>Super Circuit’s</em> cheery pixel art is one of the Game Boy Advance’s most underrated achievements. Everything is just so damn colourful and cute and pretty in the same way so many first-party SNES and GBA platformers were, only here it’s moving real real fast as well.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-recommend-id="image://h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-format="jpg" data-width="2050" data-height="1153" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-recommend-id="image://h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-format="jpg" data-width="2050" data-height="1153" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This game was so damn popular! It sold <em>37 million </em>copies! And you’d think, from the size of it to the funky motion controls, that it’d be higher up on this list. But again, like <em>Super Circuit</em>, <em>Wii </em>gets a little lost in the passage of time, as there’s very little reason to play this when <em>Mario Kart 7</em>, and then <em>8</em>, came along and did everything it did but so much better.</p><p>Not helping it here is that, despite the game being perfectly positioned to cash in on the Wii’s motion control hype with its iconic plastic steering wheel, the game’s motion controls—the one defining feature of the game that anyone remembers—were actually straight garbage.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-recommend-id="image://xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-recommend-id="image://xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In many ways the most limited mainline <em>Mario Kart</em> game, this could have been down the bottom of this list after all these years, as subsequent games have some along and slowly improved and built upon the foundations it laid.</p><p>But man, there’s still so much to love, and respect. While its lack of 3D terrain is a little jarring in this post-Nintendo 64 world, the slippery, slidey cornering might still be the best in the series, from its exaggerated reach to the way the entire camera is wrenched around to accommodate it.</p><p>It’s not the fastest, smartest of even the most fun <em>Mario Kart</em> game, not by a long stretch, but it’s somehow still the most kart-y game of the lot. And being the instigator of the entire series, in many ways the purest expression of the original vision, it felt wrong putting it any lower.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-recommend-id="image://fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-recommend-id="image://fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is going to start harsh for a game that’s a lot of people’s sentimental fave, but time has not been kind to this game. Where once it was a pioneer of 3D multiplayer gaming, now it just looks like shit and has a surprisingly high number of empty, boring tracks. </p><p>As we’re going to find as we get further into this list, though, even the weakest <em>Mario Kart</em> games (by 21st century standards, anyway) can often be saved by moments of inspirational course design, and while like I’ve just said many of <em>Mario Kart 64's</em> are a snooze fest, when it shines—like Toad’s Turnpike—it <em>shines</em>. </p><p>Also, this is the game that introduced the blue shell. We weren’t sure whether to praise or punish the game for that, so in very un-blue shell fashion it ends up dropping it in the middle of the pack.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-recommend-id="image://it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-format="jpg" data-width="917" data-height="517" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-recommend-id="image://it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-format="jpg" data-width="917" data-height="517" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s a pattern emerging here, born of the series taking relatively few major advances over the years: this is yet another entry that was ridiculously popular, and another where there isn’t much reason to play it today, coming as it did between everyone’s childhood favourites and the more expansive offerings on the Wii U and Switch.</p><p>But can we just take a step back and appreciate its online play? This was a DS game, from 2005, made by Nintendo, and to play it online was both a breeze and an absolute joy.<br></p><p><em>Mario Kart DS</em> was the first game in the series to open us up to a whole world, quite literally, of <em>Mario Kart</em> in a way that not even some more recent home console titles have managed.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-recommend-id="image://mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-recommend-id="image://mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Can we just start this one by saying that more <em>Mario Karts</em> (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-vr-looks-nuts-1796865368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-vr-looks-nuts-1796865368">outside of VR experiences</a></span>) need first-person racing? This game had it, and it sucks that more don’t!</p><p>Anyway, <em>Mario Kart 7</em> had a lot more to offer than just that gimmick. <em>Mario Kart 7 </em>made some big innovations for a handheld game, most importantly in the way players were now able to drastically customise their cars, and also how you could drive underwater.</p><p>The game is often criticised for leaning a little heavily on the rest of the <em>Mario Kart</em> formula (as if every game barring <em>64</em> hasn’t done the same thing), but that was always a little unfair, coming as it did on a handheld system whose primary innovation—3D visuals—could never really be taken advantage of in a way that could have fundamentally changed the <em>Mario Kart experience</em>.</p><p>Indeed, for a game that at the time felt a little derivative, its introductions ultimately paved the way for a lot of the stuff that <em>Mario Kart 8</em>—which you’ll note we haven’t got to yet—does so well.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-recommend-id="image://bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="999" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-recommend-id="image://bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="999" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Wait, what? Yes, you’re reading this right. <em>Double Dash</em>, baby. The first fully-3D <em>Mario Kart</em> game. It’s up here for two reasons.</p><p>Firstly, the two-player thing was great, and it’s a shame it hasn’t returned (outside of an arcade cameo) since, even as a secondary mode. Having one player concentrate on driving while the other handled the timing and direction of weapons might not have been ideal in every multiplayer circumstance, but when it did—whether your partner was less skilled than you or just wasted—it was glorious.</p><p>And secondly, as you’d expect from a game coming out on the GameCube, <em>Double Dash’s</em> course design is some of the wackiest—and thus best—of the series. From Baby Park through to DK Mountain, it’s not until you cycle through some of these tracks again in later <em>Mario Karts</em> that you realise so many of the absolute classics are from this one release.</p><p>But its GameCube-ness extends beyond just the course design (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9D3DC6664BCC050F&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9D3DC6664BCC050F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and its killer soundtrack!</a></span>). This is just so much <em>fun</em>, one of the shining examples of the weirdness prevalent in Nintendo games throughout the GameCube’s lifespan, where it was able to build on its cutesy past and polish it into a mirror-like sheen, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8s-dlc-is-so-gross-1616697911&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8s-dlc-is-so-gross-1616697911">wasn’t yet having to run commercial tie-ins for Mercedes DLC</a></span>. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0bee9da494eac2a8d0f7ba64301eafdc" data-recommend-id="image://0bee9da494eac2a8d0f7ba64301eafdc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi flies through multi-colored lights." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luigi flies through multi-colored lights." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0bee9da494eac2a8d0f7ba64301eafdc" data-recommend-id="image://0bee9da494eac2a8d0f7ba64301eafdc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi flies through multi-colored lights." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The latest entry in Mario’s kart-racing jamboree is a rollicking good time, and also a somewhat frustrating one. <em>Mario Kart World </em>is the best the actual driving and control has ever felt, and all the new maneuvers Nintendo has added this time around make it the most expressive and freeing in the series. But as the game gets bigger, with more players and entire modes that feel like they are meant to showcase the multi-track-spanning open world at the expense of more condensed races on bespoke tracks, playing the game requires you to get past some growing pains. It’s more experimental than it might seem at a glance, and for that, it deserves its flowers for injecting some really cool ideas into a 30-year-old franchise.</p><p>With 24-player races that let you ride on just about any surface you can reasonably get your wheels on, <em>World </em>is the most chaotic <em>Mario Kart </em>has ever been.

There are so many players on the track at once that you can spend several minutes of a race doing alright, just driving along your designated path, then suddenly face an onslaught of item-based attacks that will send you back a dozen places in the blink of an eye.</p><p>This all then needs to be weighed against the new inclusion of a vast, open world, around which you can freely drive, finding bonus items, mini-missions, hidden secrets, and so many coins. It’s the biggest shake-up the <em>Mario Kart </em>series<em> </em>has seen in decades, but time will tell if it sticks as a favorite racing game.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-recommend-id="image://pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-recommend-id="image://pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Can you believe <em>Mario Kart 8</em> came out nearly a decade ago?

It’s innovations are rare, but its perfections are everywhere, particularly in its course design, which features truly breathtaking moments as gravity is inverted, whole sections of track disappear and coins are turned into rupees.</p><p>Quite simply, if you want to play <em>Mario Kart</em>, online or solo, with traditional characters or newer introductions, classic tracks or modern masterpieces, this is the game to play.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The top three best-selling Switch 2 physical games sold during the first week in the US were Mario Kart World, Cyberpunk 2077, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Switch 2 Edition, according to Circana. Mario Kart World has big shoes to fill, as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe sold 68.2 million units, with Mario Kart 8 shifting 8.46 million copies for a combined total of 76.66 million.</p><p>Finally, Piscatella said the Switch 2 set a new all-time record for first-week sales of video game hardware in the US, surpassing a record previously held by the PS4.

			<p>Borderlands 4, the next entry in the series launching later this year on PC and consoles, has become available for pre-order today, finally confirming the game's price.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/borderlandsr-4-now-available-for-pre-order-post-launch-content-to-include-story-missions-and-all-new-vault-hunters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> shared today, 2K and Gearbox Software confirmed the game's Standard Edition will launch in the United States for $69.99 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. For a few weeks, statements from Gearbox's Randy Pitchford <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-says-a-real-fan-will-find-a-way-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-if-that-ends-up-being-the-price/">suggested</a> the fourth entry in the series would be among the increasing number of games retailing at $80 at launch, but thankfully, that was not the case.</p>
<p>Besides confirming the price of the Borderlands 4 Standard Edition, 2K and Gearbox Software confirmed the details of the Deluxe Edition and the Super Deluxe Editions, which will retail for $99.99 and $129.99, respectively. The first will include the Bounty Pack Bundle featuring four separate post-launch DLC packs, each with distinct areas, new missions, and unique bosses; four Vault Cards with unique challenges and rewards; new gear and weapons; four new vehicles, and Vault Hunter cosmetics; and the Firehawk's Fury Weapon Skin. The second will include not only the Bounty Pack Bundle but also the Vault Hunter Pack featuring two new Story Packs, each featuring a new Vault Hunter, story, and side missions, two new map regions, new gear and weapons, more Vault Hunter cosmetics, and new ECHO-4 cosmetics.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on September 12th. The game will also be available at launch on the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud gaming service.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-mods-founder-steps-down-from-management-after-24-years.1219557/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nexus-mods-founder-robin-scott-steps-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Robin Scott, the founder of modding platform Nexus Mods, has announced he will be stepping down from his management role at the site after 24 years.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Scott says that he thinks the decision to step back from managing Nexus Mods is "in both [his] and the community's best interests". He says that the "strain" of responsibility for the "behemoth" he's created has "taken its toll".</p>

<p>According to Scott, running Nexus Mods for 24 years and having to be "on call" has caused "anxiety and stress-related health issues" for him, and that since he's been "burning out", it's best for him to "step aside and bring in new leadership".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nexus-mods-founder-stepping-down-front-page.jpg?itok=owbs5AIY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nexus-mods-founder-stepping-down-front-page.jpg?itok=Gagyq0q_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nexus Mods founder Robin Scott is stepping down after 24 years.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Scott, ownership of Nexus Mods has "changed hands", but he says the sale "isn't some corporate 'exit' or a backroom deal". He doesn't specify who exactly owns the site now, instead referring to "structural updates to the company ownership that we aren't shouting about".</p>

<p>Despite this, Scott says the changes are "about long-term stability, not changing the values or direction of the platform"; according to Scott, Nexus Mods will remain "community-first and mod-author-focused".</p>

<p>He says that from a user perspective, "not a lot" will be changing, and that behind the scenes, he was already beginning to reduce his involvement in the Nexus Mods platform. As such, the site will likely continue to run as it has done for the last few months.</p>

<p>As for Scott himself, he says he won't be "disappearing" from Nexus Mods altogether. He'll remain active on the site's Discord channel, and he'll also be "working with the team to help guide the overall direction" of Nexus Mods.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nexus-mods-founder-stepping-down-skyrim.jpg?itok=a-Oi3eT0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nexus-mods-founder-stepping-down-skyrim.jpg?itok=7rymQArt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nexus Mods plays host to mods for games like&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&nbsp;and many more.</figcaption></figure><p>Nexus Mods was founded by Scott back in 2001, at which point it was a fansite for&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</em>. Over time, it became a modding platform for that game, eventually expanding to encapsulate other games as well.</p>

<p>It hasn't been without controversy; Scott and Nexus Mods have found themselves in hot water numerous times over their decision to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nexus-bans-all-us-political-mods-going-forward" rel="nofollow">ban certain mods</a>, or, indeed, to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/nexus-mods-decides-to-allow-an-oblivion-remastered-mod-that-changes-body-type-options-to-male-female-declares-its-not-a-battleground-for-broader-cultural-or-political-debates/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">allow</a> certain mods. That's doubtless the kind of back-and-forth Scott wants to escape.</p>

<p>In any case, it's not clear how Nexus Mods will change in future, but one thing's for sure: it won't be changing under Scott's leadership. Stay tuned for more.</p>

        <p>Your firepower's still on the weak side, SteamyBladers</p>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> modders have made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/40-of-stellar-blade-mods-are-nsfw-but-dont-worry-weve-narrowed-that-down-to-three-guaranteed-to-raise-your-heart-rate">a lot of sexual stuff</a> so far. As it turns out, the game's director is cool with that, though he is hoping that despite the game not having any official tools, modders'll have a go at creating fresh wrinkles that add to what the Stellar Blade experience offers.</p>
<p>Hyung-tae Kim gave his opinion on where the game's modding scene is currently at in a recent interview with South Korean site <a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/special/nboard/5/?n=214039">This Is Game</a>, translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blades-director-doesnt-plan-to-police-modders-but-would-like-them-to-be-mature-and-stay-within-reason-with-what-they-make/">Automaton</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1934199332787679533">Genki</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the director's general view on Stellar Blade modding's pretty positive. He doesn't see the need to interfere with them except by encouraging folks from being careful with or avoiding stuff that could mess up their base game. Exactly the kind of view you'd hope a developer would have, rather than panicking and calling the lawyers the moment someone figures out how to replace a texture.</p>
<p>He's also cool with the idea of folks making reams of NSFW stuff like nice suits for the game, since Stellar Blade has a strong rating and is therefore aimed at adults. I'd caveat that as adults you might find a bit weird, but I digress. To be clear you can do the dirty to whatever floats your boat, as long as it's not doing any harm. The trouble with Stellar Blade has been misogynistic players and online dicks treating Eve, jiggle physics et al, as an example of how all women should look in games - see some of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3489700/reviews/?browsefilter=funny&amp;snr=1_5_100010_&amp;p=1">Steam reviews</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the director's less of a fan of paid mods that charge high prices, but generally seems to trust players not to engage with anything that crosses a line or involve material that could be classed as harmful or sensitive.</p>
<p>All of that said, Kim is keen to see Stellar Blade modders spread their wings a bit. While acknowledging that the game's lack of official tools will likely make this more difficult, the director's interested in seeing folks make mods that switch up what it's like to play the game, but without straying too far from its original vision.</p>
<p>According to Genki's translation, that wish was accompanied by Kim using the killer phrase "modders' firepower is still weak", as part of suggesting that he thinks the current crop of new cosmetics and minor tweaks don't go much beyond the stuff the base game offers. Which, to be fair, is the norm for games that haven't been out on PC long.</p>
<p>So, we'll have to see if the SteamyBladers accept this challenge, put aside their jiggle physics manipulation for a second, open up new tabs that cover their pretty out there desktop backgrounds, and set about pushing the limits of modding potential rather than the limits of taste. You can do it, high-five Stellar Blade modde...actually, you know what, maybe not. I don't know where that mitt's been.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As such, it makes for a good time to see which pulls from the long-awaited return of Team Rocket are fetching the big bucks, and how much you’re going to need to fork out if you want to add a specific special art to your collection.</p><p>All year long, <em>Pokémon TCG</em> has been plagued by issues of availability, and the accompanying misery of resellers wreaking havoc on the market. Destined Rivals is certainly no exception, and for once it’s not just because of people wanting to turn a profit at the expense of the real players: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001">this is a <em>damned</em> good set of Pokémon cards</a></span>, adding a huge amount of new fun to the live game, as well as being a set packed with stunning art, and most excitingly of all, better pull-rates.</p><p>When it comes to prices, I’m also pleased to report that things aren’t nearly as crazy as I’d expected. Now, for the sake of my own ego, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160">I did correctly call which would be the biggest cards</a></span>, but I’m  happy to say I got the pricing trends wrong. I’m not sure if that’s because of the better pull rates (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/Pok%C3%A9mon-TCG-Destined-Rivals-Pull-Rates/43ba832e-44c9-45a4-ae2e-594df2defdda/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/Pok%C3%A9mon-TCG-Destined-Rivals-Pull-Rates/43ba832e-44c9-45a4-ae2e-594df2defdda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they appear to be almost identical</a></span> to those of Journey Together, itself a big improvement since the removal of Ace Specs, but with twice as many cards in this newer set, there’s so much more variety to enjoy), or if perhaps at last the whole global fuss is finally calming down, but either way it’s great news for the hobby. So sorry, if you <em>did </em>pull a Cynthia’s Garchomp, you’re not quite as rich as you might have expected. Although not too sorry, since the numbers here are still double what we’d have seen a year ago.</p><p>I should note on prices, while the individual cards themselves aren’t going <em>quite</em> as mad, the sealed packs themselves still are. Right now, a booster box of 36 packs is selling for $250, over a hundred bucks over its RRP, while Elite Trainer Boxes are also 50 percent higher than they should be at $87. If you’re chasing particular cards, <em>please</em> don’t spend that—it’s far smarter just to pay for the specific card you’re after.</p><p>So, that all said, here are the highest-priced cards in Destined Rivals. All prices are accurate at the time of writing, but likely to change very quickly:</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-recommend-id="image://2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-recommend-id="image://2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>So, you know what, this one gives me a bit of hope. Prices of <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards are so often determined by two factors: the rarity, and whether there’s a pretty girl. But here, Ethan’s Typhlosion is <em>not</em> a super-rare card. There are very many cards in this set that are vastly more difficult to find, that are fetching far lower prices than the <strong>$42</strong> this is going for at the time of writing.</p><p>And why? Because it looks so fricking cool! The average price for Illustration Rares in this set is about ten bucks, and a lot of them look fantastic, but damn, this card is incredible. This feels like the sort of card that’s going to gain a lot more value over the next few years, as numbers thin out and people start to reflect on what a stunner it truly is.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-recommend-id="image://270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure Special Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-recommend-id="image://270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ethan’s having a good showing in the top ten, and he’ll be back yet.

(Sorry Slugma, but no matter how hard artist Kariya has tried to make you cute, you’re still a slug made of fire.)</p><p>It’s selling for much the same price as Ethan’s Typhlosion, at <strong>$42</strong>, although it had nudged ahead by a few cents at the time I put this together.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9a9f4ecc79396c0cd5dbad62bcfe5eff" data-recommend-id="image://9a9f4ecc79396c0cd5dbad62bcfe5eff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty’s Psyduck Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Misty’s Psyduck Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a9f4ecc79396c0cd5dbad62bcfe5eff" data-recommend-id="image://9a9f4ecc79396c0cd5dbad62bcfe5eff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty’s Psyduck Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>At <strong>$54</strong>, Misty’s Psyduck is a very expensive Illustration Rare.

Misty, in the fiction, is 10 years old. Let’s move on.</p><p>This is a completely lovely card; the colors, the realistic effects of the water over cartoon characters, and just the happy freedom it represents as Misty swims with a Psyduck that for once doesn’t look horrified.</p><p>$54 does represent a massive drop in price, the card first fetching around $95 before that was cut nearly in half, likely by the relative ease with which it can be found.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bde8b6cacf5b456d4686afd707513df1" data-recommend-id="image://bde8b6cacf5b456d4686afd707513df1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Gold" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Gold" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bde8b6cacf5b456d4686afd707513df1" data-recommend-id="image://bde8b6cacf5b456d4686afd707513df1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Gold" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The so-called “hyper rare” gold cards haven’t been desired by collectors for many years now, with the Scarlet &amp; Violet sets trying all manner of variants to see if they can ignite a new interest.

So the Golbat and Zubat flitting around behind, accompanied by a Team Rocket member, boosts this.</p><p>It also helps that it’s a real tank of a Pokémon. If you can get it in play (which requires two evolutions) you’ve got a 120 attack for just two energy, with a massive 310HP. It can dish out the hits while absorbing a lot itself, and the moment it’s looking vulnerable, you can return it to your hand for no cost and save a prize card. Neat.</p><p><strong>$65</strong> makes this a very expensive way to play the card, however! Thankfully, the identical ability is available on the regular version of the card, which is currently selling for 72c!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e7af90b4fb05556dd4950df94726bede" data-recommend-id="image://e7af90b4fb05556dd4950df94726bede" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Nidoking ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Nidoking ex Special Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e7af90b4fb05556dd4950df94726bede" data-recommend-id="image://e7af90b4fb05556dd4950df94726bede" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Nidoking ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Boast though I might, I did miss this card when predicting the big sellers.

This spectacular card, which is so detailed that it’s hard to believe it’s not actually moving when you look at it, will currently cost you a cool <strong>$210</strong>. </p><p>Now, it’s worth noting that the price on this one has been unusual. You’ll usually see these cards get a crazy price on day one, as silly people pay massively over the odds for a card that’ll cost half as much in a week. But in the case of this card alone, its current price is higher than where it began, and that’s <em>after</em> it took a dip. This means that unlike most of the prices here that are now levelling out, this one could still be climbing. The fluctuation hasn’t exactly been significant—it only dipped to $195—but breaking the pattern remains of note, and we could be about to see this climb much higher. At grade 10, it’s currently dancing around the $1,000 mark.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-recommend-id="image://7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Special Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-recommend-id="image://7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>So yes,  predictably it’s the the extra-rare Mewtwo that comes out on top. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160">But like I said before release</a></span>...it’s ugly, right?

But it wouldn’t trouble the front page of any of my binders.</p><p>Given I didn’t manage to pull one, it’s not a situation in which I’ll find myself. This is currently selling for an average of <strong>$378</strong>, and you can find it for a lot higher. On launch it went for $450, before plummeting to $320 in its first week. The second week, however, has seen that somewhat recover, seemingly levelling off at its current point.</p><p>Mewtwo cards do tend to keep their value, however, and if yours has any hope of scoring a PSA 10, I’d seriously think about getting it graded. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/405948857118?nordt=true&amp;rt=nc&amp;customid=noId&amp;toolid=10001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/405948857118?nordt=true&amp;rt=nc&amp;customid=noId&amp;toolid=10001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One has sold at a 10 so far</a></span>, getting $1,451.</p><hr><p>There you have it. It’s a pricey pile of cards, but it could have been a lot worse. And, vitally importantly, you do not need to be spending anything close to this to play these cards in your deck. Everything is available in a regular version, usually for cents, and even the Mewtwo will only cost you about $6.</p><p>Next up is the big finish for Scarlet &amp; Violet in the TCG, with the first ever international split set of Black Bolt and White Flare on July 18. It’s going to be <em>ridiculous</em>, with literally hundreds of full-art cards spread across the two sets, and no booster boxes to be able to buy them in. Urgh. See you then!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But this trick can be a great way to share the wealth around if only one person managed to pick up a powerful weapon with the right affinity for the Nightlord’s weakness. It’s also an easy way to stack certain secondary gear bonuses, like increased damage negation and improved ranged attacks. It’s not necessarily going to break the game but it’s a neat little thing players can try if they’re struggling against a particular boss. </p><p>Some players have been experimenting with this item duplication glitch since <em>Nightreign</em> launched weeks ago, so it’ll be interesting to see when FromSoftware actually patches it out. It’s in many ways antithetical to the entire ethos of the game, though anyone who’s been hitting their head against Libra for hours at night might not mind using any extra advantage they can find.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It has plenty of stuff to pick apart for lore fiends. Much like the towering Erdtree, Nightreign is just one branch, one alternate timeline, with roots in the world of Elden Ring. Nightreign  brings its own unique  ideas and new characters to Elden Ring, even if the events of the game don’t tie directly to the original. You’ll know what we mean when we start exploring the ending of Nightreign below. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This article contains spoilers for the ending of Elden Ring Nightreign.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Is Nightreign Canon?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightreign bends the history of The Lands Between in a different direction, forking off from a pivotal moment in the lore to give us a peek at what might've happened if things had gone much, much worse. It’s better to think of the events of Nightreign as an alternate timeline rather than a canon storyline. You don't need to know everything about Elden Ring to enjoy it, but you do need to spend quite a bit of time running expeditions and fighting Nightlords to get the full picture. Once you do, you'll start to grasp how Nightreign fits (and doesn't fit) into the story of the Lands Between.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/2622380-20250519175129-1-1750056432765.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Elden Ring Nightreign Ending Explained</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As the intro cutscene explains: Nightreign takes place in a world where the Tarnished never show up. The war between the gods—known as The Shattering—breaks out after Marika stirs chaos in The Lands Between by smashing the Elden Ring. Thousands of years pass and nobody takes the throne, eventually luring "an abomination" known as the Nightlord to the land. This unnamed being is basically a walking natural disaster. Wherever he goes, the Night follows, and an endless torrent of rain slowly dissolves the world into nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leave it to FromSoftware to come up with an even bleaker version of the timeline than what we have in the original game. Here, the Elden Throne is just an empty chair sitting in the ruins of a world fading out of existence. There's nothing to rule or to conquer. And yet a peculiar group of people have been chosen by some unknown master to try and defeat the Nightlord anyway and end the Night. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's where we come in. The Nightfarers team up to hunt down lesser Nightlords on their way to the source of the catastrophe. This involves dropping down onto what's left of Limgrave and battling familiar monsters and bosses from not only Elden Ring, but the Dark Souls series as well. While the game doesn't explicitly state why the worlds have converged, I like to think of it as the result of ruptures in reality as the universe collapses in on itself.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Elden Ring Nightreign Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you bring enough of the Nightlords down, the true culprit is revealed to be the husk of a man named Heolstor. He carries what looks like the Moonlight Greatsword from Dark Souls in one of his three arms, and is one of the most spectacular boss fights FromSoftware has ever created. Defeating him rewards you with the Primordial Nightlord's Rune, which resembles the Great Runes you find in Elden Ring, only with an inky hue. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Usually you return to see your allies hanging out in the Roundtable Hold after defeating a Nightlord, but killing Heolstor leaves you standing in front of a Roundtable Hold that has been long abandoned. A petrified corpse sits inside and when you place  the rune before it, it causes your Nightfarer to dissipate into streaks of light that fly into the sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A post-credits scene shows the Lands Between as we know it from Elden Ring—Erdtree and all—with golden leaves wafting in the air. One of those leaves lands on a tree branch atop a giant that looks a lot like Heolstor if he were made out of wood. It rises out of the sea, pausing a moment to face the Erdtree, and then steps away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's heavily implied that by defeating Heolstor we've retroactively stopped the Night from ever happening in the first place. In other words: We've chopped off Nightreign's branch of the story for good, leaving the events of Elden Ring to play out as we know them from the original game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Who is Heolstor and what happens in the alternate endings?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/spoilers-elden-ring-nightreign-heolstor-the-nightlord-final-boss-fight-youtube-0-11-30-1750056469544.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't know a lot about Heolstor outside of the relic you get from defeating him. It tells a brief story of a knight who was slain by a hero before mysteriously waking up to curse the world. It's vague enough to fit into several different interpretations, but the most plausible one seems to be that he is intentionally a nobody, a cosmic inevitability as natural as the sun setting in the evening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This lines up thematically with the alternate ending the Wylder can get if you finish his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Wylder_Remembrance_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>remembrance quests.</u></a> Instead of erasing the timeline, the Wylder takes up the mantle of Nightlord by using a Larval Tear, an item from Elden Ring that is associated with rebirth. You learn earlier in his quest that the Roundtable Hold only exists because the Nightlord exists, and his sister, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Duchess_Remembrance_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>the Duchess</u></a>, is locked to the same fate. He sacrifices himself to the Night to keep her alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Ironeye_Remembrance_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>Ironeye's</u></a> unique ending, he cuts the throat of the petrified corpse in the empty Roundtable Hold and prolongs the Night. His goal is to protect his clan of undying warriors who you might remember from Elden Ring as Those Who Live in Death. In Elden Ring's timeline, Those Who Live in Death are hunted by the followers of the Erdtree. The Ironeye's decision saves them from this outcome, but dooms the world as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Recluse's ending is the second most hopeful one you can get. Her remembrance reveals that she once had a child who she abandoned, leaving it to succumb to an endless hunger and start to devour everything in sight, including her own sister. After defeating Heolstor, the Recluse can find the Night-touched baby in the Roundtable Hold and embrace it. Her love calms the infant and seemingly prevents a new Nightlord from forming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaining Nightfarers don't have special endings associated with them. Their stories follow the events of the default ending and they likely disappear along with everything else when it's erased. But Nightreign's story isn't completely over: FromSoftware will eventually release new Nightfarers as DLC and they could provide even more insight into the nature of this sad world— possibly through their own alternate endings.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/gex-trilogy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156800/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><em>Note. Gex Trilogy isn't playable on Switch 2 via backwards compatibility at the time of writing, although a patch has been submitted to Nintendo for review, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/clock-tower-rewind-to-receive-switch-2-exclusive-features-says-limited-run">according to Limited Run</a>. We'll update this note when we hear more.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Dimitris Giannakis’s Carbon Engine is back on behalf of Limited Run Games, and, despite some previously reported bugs, it fairly accurately brings vintage games to new hardware.</p>
<p>Speaking of bugs, Gex the gecko thrives on them. That and gnarly '90s flair. Combining all three titles released on Sony’s original PlayStation, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/gex_trilogy">Gex Trilogy</a> is a slice of a very colourful era, when <strong>Jackass</strong> was king, <strong>Beavis and Butthead</strong> were generational voices, britpop ruled the airwaves, and it seemed like people would do anything to get on TV. And, as it happens, TV is the theme when it comes to Gex, because, you know, like, <em>everyone</em> was watching TV in the '90s, man.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156801/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While the initial <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/3do/gex">Gex</a> was released for the 3DO in 1995, a pack-in system seller that often went hand-in-hand with the console’s marketing, it was on the PlayStation that Crystal Dynamics’ series found a groove. And, since this trilogy reworks the games into a widescreen format, the PlayStation version is the more practical choice.</p>
<p>Gex is a gecko chilling in his Maui mansion when, while looking for a good show on the tube, his telescopic tongue whips a roaming fly down his gullet. This fly is actually a miniature robotic spy sent by Rez, king of the Media Dimension, that sucks Gex into his TV set. Gex then needs to work his way through a hub world, entering themed zones and stages, to recover remote controls that allow him to enter subsequent stages and ultimately return home. It’s wacky, and that’s largely the idea.</p>
<p>A 2D side-scrolling platformer, the first <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/gex">Gex</a> is mostly ok. Its primary novelty is that you can scale walls as a gecko can, and this allows you to navigate stages in an alternative manner, often leading to bonus warps and those elusive TV remotes.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156802/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gex can swat enemies with his tail and use his tongue to lap up various power-ups, affording him different temporary properties or health increases. It’s neither aged considerably well nor poorly, but the patience of the gamer base may have moved on.</p>
<p>The graphics have a real pre-rendered multimedia 3DO smack, that, on the plus side, retroactively suit the game and its '90s-ness well, but are also kind of ugly in places. It gets more interesting in locales like Sumo City, which frankly looks and sounds totally like China but with Sumo enemies; and elsewhere you get to do stuff that breaks the mould like riding rockets and jungle swings.</p>
<p>The controls are a tad stiff and that makes certain clinches, especially boss battles, frustrating at times. There are points where you’re forced to make jumps into the unknown that could drown you (odd for a gecko), land you on a bed of spikes or down a bottomless pit. But the main test of patience is being forced to find those remotes.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156804/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Stages are non-linear and searching is required. Get killed and it’s back to the start or a checkpoint, meaning there’s some backtracking to be done, and you spend a lot of time searching and revisiting stages. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Mario World</a>, and much of its ilk, also had special coin collecting, but it was optional. Here, you won’t be able to access new stages until you’ve recovered enough remotes to do so, keeping you from progression. It can be frustrating, but if you're steeled for the fairly lengthy journey, there’s some enjoyment to be had.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/gex_enter_the_gecko">Gex 2: Enter the Gecko</a> (1998) goes full 3D, with the camera now forgivingly assigned to the second thumb stick as opposed to just the shoulder buttons. Again, Gex is whipped into the Media Dimension to defeat Rez, but here it’s all gloriously polygonal. And it holds up fairly well, considering, with stages that offer more engagement than its predecessor. Again, you need to find remotes to progress and expand the hub world, and now there are even more objects to collect, including gold remotes that can net you a special ending.</p>
<p>Gex 2 is a lot more interactive and the stage design is pretty clever in places, allowing you to spring from your tail to reach higher points. The vertical crawling is here, but it isn’t used as a main structural device as it was in the original, with only certain walls being climbable.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156806/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the whole, it’s a solid evolution for the series, and although the early PS1 3D can be visually confusing at times and difficult to control, it can be fun if you apply yourself to its fetch tasks and inherently wacky nature. For those who aren’t so into searching down numerous items, however, it can feel a bit of a slog by the halfway point.</p>
<p>The third and final game, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/gex_3_deep_cover_gecko">Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko</a> (1999), capped the series after plans for a PlayStation 2 sequel were abandoned. It’s a big technological step up from the previous entry despite only appearing a year later, and incorporates many of Crystal Dynamic's previously unrealised ideas.</p>
<p>Gex starts here in a Wayne Manor-like hub world, with a tortoise butler. Seeing his love interest Agent Xtra (Playmate of the month and <strong>Baywatch</strong>'s Marliece Andrada) kidnapped by Rez, Gex finds himself back in the wacky media land of TV, where the camera is much improved and the scale is altogether broader. Stages are more open and freeform, encompassing tons of interactive objects, swimming, and platforms that work around weight and inertia.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156799/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Your tail whipping action, too, is complemented by costume changes and power-ups that transform you into Egyptian Pharoes and mecha robots. Traversing the playfields is varied, incorporating snowboarding, giant enemies, and a fair few layout puzzles to solve. The music remains great, and the whole thing feels smoother and more accomplished. Objectively and not sentimentally, it’s the superior of the three.</p>
<p>While the control and visual improvements are welcome, as are all the little bonuses like art galleries, music players, rewind and save functions, the main appeal with Gex Trilogy is just how '90s it is. In some ways, this makes it more enjoyable to return to than it would be if it wasn’t so undeniably a product of its time. Dana Gould, who appears in interviews in the bonus features, is an American comedian who voiced the intrepid Gecko. He did a great job of stuffing the game full of one-liners that now recall the exuberant decade and its all-pervasive, kid-appealing, gross-out edginess.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156803/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>One major downside is that this trilogy doesn’t offer alternate soundtracks, since Gould was actually replaced by different comics in the PAL market, including Leslie Phillips and <strong>Red Dwarf</strong>’s Danny John-Jules for the third game. It would have been nice to have had the regional options in this respect. And, since the original games had a single file that contained each region's audio files — meaning it's easily flipped between — we're not sure why the accuracy of the Carbon Engine didn't rise to the occasion.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Gex Trilogy is a happy throwback. The first game is a little clunky and occasionally laborious, but its sequels do better in their 3D expansion of its themes and idea. The main point of appeal is its connection to the period in which they were made. It’s full of comic quirks, zinging dialogue, and visual gags that scream MTV Generation. Across all three entries, the media hook and its tropes — from horror to Christmas to 1930s prohibition gangsters — work well to keep things fresh, fun and engaging.</p>
<p>That said, while there's a simplicity to the games themselves, the yesteryear technology and the sensibilities of many gamers may have moved on, making their baked-in fetch quests trying at times. Gex Trilogy’s value is bumped up by its invention and still very playable design aspects, but whether or not you can pit yourself through them really comes down to how much your nostalgic mileage varies, dude.</p></section>

While it remains a pain in <em>Wilds</em>, there some best options to follow to start snagging some of your own. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Nothing feels worse than seeing an available Sinister Cloth that you can’t trade for.</p><hr><p><br><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Pik-Sen Lim death" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/03392d0c0bc67/pik-sen-lim-death.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>Pik-Sen Lim, the Penang-born British actress who most of us gamers will know immediately as the legendary narrator of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> series, has passed away at the age of 80.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/showbiz/2025/06/13/malaysian-born-actress-pik-sen-lim-known-for-roles-in-mind-your-language-doctor-who-and-johnny-english-reborn-dies-at-80/180215#google_vignette">the Malay Mail</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/dark-souls/dark-souls-narrator-and-prolific-actor-pik-sen-lim-has-died/">PC Gamer</a>), the actress, who moved to the UK to pursue a hugely successful stage and screen acting career in 1961, passed away on Monday 9th June. Lim was a big star during the '70s and '80s on both British and Malaysian TV, with her credits including <strong>Dr Who</strong>, <strong>Coronation Street</strong>, <strong>The Bill</strong>, and her most prominent role in the sitcom <strong>Mind Your Language</strong>, which aired in the UK during the late 1970s.</p><p><figure data-videoid="A1xI46KxTIU" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A1xI46KxTIU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1xI46KxTIU"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1xI46KxTIU">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Of course, without Lim, the Souls games just wouldn't feel the same, would they? The opening narration to Dark Souls, in particular, is just one of those video game moments that sticks in your brain forever after. It's delivered with such artistry that it immediately signals a game you're about to get lost in big time. And oh boy, did we.</p>
<p>As a first sample of FromSoftware's world, and the vibe the developer wished to convey, it's hard to imagine anyone could have rocked it as hard as Pik-Sen Lim did. In fact, let's check it out more more time in her honour...</p>

<p>What a performance. Rest in peace.</p>

			<p>Nintendo has announced a new Direct presentation for this week, a Donkey Kong Bananza Direct that'll premiere this&nbsp;<strong>Wednesday, June 18, at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT</strong>. It'll be a 15-minute-long presentation and will likely feature a bunch of new gameplay clips we've not seen before, ahead of the game's<a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-launches-this-july-on-nintendo-switch-2/"> July 17, 2025</a>, release date.</p>
<p>The news first came through the Nintendo Today app, and is the latest sign that Nintendo will be using the app to deliver its big announcements before turning to <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1934596827900178721">its social media accounts</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza Direct 6.18.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVUidGTR8xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em><span>Tune in at 6 a.m. PT on June 18 for a livestreamed</span> Donkey Kong Bananza <span>Direct presentation, featuring roughly 15 minutes of information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game</span></em><span>," Nintendo said in its announcement.</span></p>
<p>It'll be good to see more of Donkey Kong Bananza on Wednesday, since there's still plenty about this game we don't yet know. <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Nathan Birch was able to preview the game</a> more than two months ago now, and at the time, while he didn't love everything about it, the game's core mechanic of being able to destroy the environment and how malleable the world is, makes for strong potential.</p>
<p>"<em>I spent most of my time with Donkey Kong Bananza thinking about the possibilities presented by its mechanics. The tools are certainly there for puzzles that would require you to, say, mould the terrain in specific ways using your fists, explosives, and other tools to reach a goal. There’s a lot of potential here, and it seems likely the demo I played only showed a portion of DK’s full bunch of abilities.</em>"</p>
<p>Hopefully, on Wednesday, we'll see a little more of what's to come in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/two-killer-soulslikes-we-saw-at-summer-game-fest-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Very few Soulslikes land for me, outside of ones developed by FromSoftware themselves. Still, there's always potential for a hit, as was the case with last year's <em>Black Myth: Wukong. </em>For 2025 and beyond, I'm actually optimistic about the future of the genre, especially after seeing a few potential bangers at&nbsp;Summer Game Fest 2025.</p>

<p>I'm talking about&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers.&nbsp;</em>In the case of&nbsp;the latter, I had a chance to play through the opening hour, though it didn't feel nearly enough to fully grasp what it had to offer.&nbsp;For&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>, we were given a presentation that left me optimistic about this exciting sequel.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Code Vein II</em> - Bigger, and With a Motorcycle!</h2>

<p>Darn, this is one I really wanted to get my hands on. Unfortunately, I only have words and hands-<em>off </em>gameplay to go off of here, but let me tell you why I'm so excited for&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The first&nbsp;<em>Code Vein</em>&nbsp;was probably the first Soulslike -- again, outside of FromSoftware's own games -- to click with me. The slick anime aesthetic and faster pace of combat resonated with me, and when I was speculating what game this might be based on my SGF appointment's vague description, I hoped it was&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II.</em></p>

<p>And here we are, a sequel! Well, kind of. It's a sequel in name, but Bandai Namco also describes it as a reimagining. Expect some familiar elements, but&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>is very much its own game. The lore behind this sequel is actually quite exciting, too.</p>



<p>Essentially, we'll be traveling between past and present timelines with the help of our player's companion, Lou MagMell. Hopping between timelines, 100 years to the past and then back to the present, is a daunting narrative challenge but one I am excited to see the developer tackle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Players can befriend various legendary Revenants -- essentially, the vampire-like beings from&nbsp;<em>Code Vein --&nbsp;</em>in both past and present. You are, of course, the hero of your own story. <em>Code Vein</em> was known&nbsp;for its robust character creator, so you'll be happy to know it's expanded to be better than ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We only got a taste of actual combat in&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>. Footage is fast-paced and more akin to a traditional hack-and-slash action game than a Souls-like, at least at first glance. I doubt it will deviate much from its Soulsy roots, but there's potential for&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>&nbsp;to grow more into its own thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One returning mechanic are blood codes, which essentially dictate the class of the player and the weight of its stats. As this is a sequel, no doubt we'll see new Blood Codes in this one. We have some new mechanics called Jails and Formae, both of which essentially boil down to providing more abilities and techniques to utilize during combat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's also a motorcycle. This seems to be a focal point in&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>, because the Bandai Namco booth at SGF had a prop motorcycle that was&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;cool. This is used to traverse the world, which will be much bigger this time around. I'm not going to say it's on&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s scale, but having to use a mount in a Soulslike game has me thinking big.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> - Wuxia Souls</h2>

<p>I also had an hour to play&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, but darn it all, I wish I had more. One, because it's a mechanically rich Soulslike game, but also because it was quite enjoyable!&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>&nbsp;is, no doubt, one of the least clunky games I've played in the genre, which is a pitfall far too many fall into.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This demo takes place right at the start of&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers.&nbsp;</em>There's some emphasis on story here, and essentially, you're afflicted with an ailment called Feathering. It looks exactly as it sounds, but Wuchang, the eponymous protagonist of this game, uses it to her advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wuchang is extremely capable with all form of weapons, and there were various styles I could try out in this demo. I landed on using the base longsword, as it felt like it catered to my playstyle of slightly heavier, longer weapons wielded with two hands. There are faster and slower styles players can use, of course.</p>

<p>The core mechanic to&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>&nbsp;revolves around Skyborn Might. As I understand it, perfectly dodging attacks and other actions grant you more power, so combat puts an emphasis on player skill. If you like to cheese your bosses, it's probably possible, but I feel like it's not quite that simple in this one.</p>



<p>Our character, Wuchang, has plenty of abilities at her disposal. Charging up your heavy attack and hitting the back of certain enemies stuns them and allows you to pull off a powerful attack. We can also cast spells, so if an enemy is pressuring you, take a step back, cast a spell, and do some decent damage on them.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other mechanics that are at play here, but I was still in the midst of getting these explained to me by the time my demo ended.

What will Nintendo show off that couldn’t have just as easily been a random morning trailer drop? We’ll see. <em>Bananza </em>is Donkey Kong’s first 3D sandbox adventure in decades and features a new deformation mechanic where he can destroy the levels around him <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>-style.

And whether Link’s first truly open-world game is calling to you for the first time, or you’re a returning veteran looking to re-explore Hyrule once again (with improved visuals and performance)there’s a substantial amount of content here. If you want to put a number to things, though, that’s going to be a bit complicated.

As such, the amount of time spent exploring this version of Hyrule will vary from person to person based on how much of the game’s optional content they wish to see. But that variation may be significantly more extreme than you’d expect.</p><p>With a playthrough focused solely on beating the main campaign, <strong>players can expect to see the credits roll after 25-35 hours</strong>. And while there’s no right or wrong way to play the game, skipping so much of what it has to offer leaves a lot of wonderful experiences on the table.</p><p>Many players may find they want to engage with a significant portion of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>’s optional content, such as completing most side-quests, finishing every shrine, and exploring unique areas within the open world. Doing so can <strong>stretch the game’s length to a staggering 150-200 hours</strong>. Yeah, it’s a lot. But there’s more.</p><p>If you want to complete literally everything in <strong><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, you can reach beyond 300 hours of total playtime</strong>. This is obviously a task best reserved for the franchise’s most dedicated fans, as it requires an immense amount of work. But for those looking to truly absorb every morsel of <em>Zelda </em>goodness, there are months of fun to be had here.</p><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> is available now for Nintendo Switch. A Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade for the game is also available at an additional cost, providing upgraded visuals and performance.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
