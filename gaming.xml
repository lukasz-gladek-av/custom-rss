<p>The rollercoaster ride of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> releases is continuing at breakneck pace, as TPC has revealed that the next Themed Booster Expansion will arrive next week on <strong>28th August</strong>.</p>
<p>The 'Secluded Springs' expansion is another Gen II-focused set, with legendaries Raikou, Entei, and Suicune taking centre stage. A bunch of other Johto and Hoenn 'mon will be tagging along for the ride, and the new teaser trailer showcases some sweet full-arts for the likes of Milotic and our beloved Phanpy.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at a handful of the cards shown in the trailer:</p>


<p>It feels like just yesterday that we first set eyes on the Ho-Oh and Lugia Wisdom of Sea and Sky set, and our Pack Hourglasses are still flagging because of it. As a reminder, the last set came bundled with a sizeable slice of drama after TPC was hit with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-tcg-pocket-updates-card-art-following-plagiarism-allegations">plagiarism accusations</a> following the release of the two central legendary full-art cards. TPC quickly released a statement in which it "deeply apologize[d]" for the error, pulled the card art in question, and replaced it a week later.</p>
<p>In other TCG Pocket news, TPC closed out this year's World Championships with a tease that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-expansion-introduces-a-mega-mix-up">Mega Evolutions</a> will be coming to the app at some point "this fall".</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-peer-to-peer-support-confirmed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-peer-to-peer-support-confirmed-after-sequel-returns-to-beta.1278234/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced that peer-to-peer support is coming to&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>, allowing you to continue playing the game online even after the central servers are shut down.</p>

<p>Back in July, 1047 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-beta-layoffs" rel="nofollow">announced</a> that in order to focus on rebuilding&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>(which is returning to beta following negative feedback for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date" rel="nofollow">initial release</a>), servers for the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will be closed down, but at the time, the devs said they would consider either offline play or peer-to-peer support.</p>

<p>Now, in a news post on the official&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>website, 1047 confirms that the direction it's chosen to go down is peer-to-peer play, which means you'll still be able to play with others online, although you'll do so via direct connection and not through a central server.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-peer-to-peer-servers-shooting.jpg?itok=HlgMDqex 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-peer-to-peer-servers-shooting.jpg?itok=gOsRvXZq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>, fear not; it'll still be playable after next week.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as introducing peer-to-peer play, 1047 says it's made "previously unreleased, stockpiled, or work-in-progress" content for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>playable, including 14 new maps for you to gallivant around.</p>

<p>In essence, peer-to-peer play means that certain players will act as hosts, so the stability of the game will depend on how strong their connection is. You'll be able to view in-progress&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>games from the server browser.</p>

<p>You'll also be granted all in-game cosmetics to enjoy, and all of your previous progression will remain intact as well, so everything you've unlocked over the course of your time with&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>will still be accessible.</p>

<p>PC and console play will still be supported, as will cross-play, so you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>alongside players on other platforms. Anticheat, however, will not be enabled, so there's a chance you may come across more nefarious behavior than before.</p>




<p>You can read the full FAQ for how peer-to-peer play will work in&nbsp;<em>Splitgate&nbsp;</em>via the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/splitgate-1-lives-on-through-peer-to-peer-support" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a>, and you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/677620/Splitgate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/splitgate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate/9P4S1BPJLPHZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

            <p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> beta is officially a Thing That Happened, and now comes the terrible ordeal of Learning From The Experience. Here is what developers DICE, Criterion, Motive and Ripple Effect have learned from the experience: you are all playing the game far too much like Call Of Duty. Goodness me, it's like 2007 never ended.</p>
<p>Doing headshots in midair? That's an updatin'. Doing a parkour while carrying a light machinegun? That's an updatin'. Bunny-hopping with prejudice? You'd best believe that's an updatin'. Never mind that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-full-multiplayer-reveal-sees-ea-trying-to-rebottle-the-lightning-of-battlefield-3-and-4">those multiplayer reveal montages</a> emphasised footloose quickdraw almost as much as they incited a murderous contempt for helicopters. It's time to play Battlefield the way Battlefield should be played: lying in a hole praying that one of your team-mates spawns on you before a tank rolls over your head.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
This, at least, is my addled Friday afternoon summary of EA's just-announced post-beta plans, via <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1958544678409642329">Mecha-Hitler.com</a>. Let's squeeze into our thinking caps and break it all down.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, the developers are doing a "general pass on recoil and tap-fire characteristics across all weapons", to make them feel more unique, especially in terms of range. They're also making changes to encourage more controlled tap and burst-firing. In particular, the M87A1 shotgun has been defanged, and they're "investigating the Time-to-Kill and Time-to-Death experiences", with news of changes to follow.
</p><p>
As for movement, they want it to feel more "balanced and traditional" in the final version of Battlefield 6. There will be less carry-over of momentum and particularly horizontal speed from a slide to a jump. Jump height will also be lowered during consecutive jumps, and you'll be less accurate while jumping or sliding.</p>
<p>"These changes are designed to make sliding and jumping more situational, so they are no longer ideal options for engaging in gunfights, and will contribute to a gameplay pace that rewards skillful movement without becoming too fast or unpredictable," the devs comment. You won't get as much acceleration when opening a parachute, either, "for more controlled aerial movement". I hate being in control of my aerial movement. In practice, it just makes it easier for people on the ground to shoot me.
</p>
<p>
The game's smaller maps are being tweaked to stop naughty people getting onto rooftops and venturing out of bounds. "This gameplay is not intended for these maps, and the upcoming ladder for the Assault class is also not designed to access these areas," the devs sternly explain. Bad ladder! Down!</p>
<p>They'll be testing two more maps in Battlefield Labs before release, a remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-3">Battlefield 3</a>'s Operation Firestorm and another map set in Mirak Valley, both of which offer "the full complement of vehicles" and "a more vast combat space". Vaster, EA, vaster! How am I supposed to trust you to fine-tune parachute physics when you can't even optimise your sentences. Yes, I realise I have just held up a red cape to all the amateur copyeditors in the comments.
</p><p>
Modes? Well, they've found that Rush gets a bit smeary when there are too many players involved. Apparently, "when a player tries to arm the M-COM while more than 20 opponents are defending, the intended gameplay becomes less tangible", presumably because the attacking player's head and torso also become less tangible. As such, they're lowering the player count for Rush "to improve the flow of combat and restore the tactical, methodical experience that defines the mode". 
</p>
<p>
Anticipating pushback on this front, the post points out that people can mess with the count as they please when playing Rush via the Portal editor. Breakthrough, meanwhile, will receive "map-by-map balance adjustments towards our goal of 50/50 win ratio for both Attackers and Defenders".
</p>
<p>
In general, EA are taking an ad hoc approach to player counts based on the individual map and mode. "For example, at launch, some Breakthrough layouts will support 48 players, while others will have 64," the post comments. "It's the one of many factors we adjust to create the right balance and feel for each scenario. In Breakthrough higher player counts work well on open, dynamic maps, while smaller player-groups offer a more focused experience on denser maps." They've found that "8v8 provides a solid starting point for small-scale, fast-paced modes like Team Death Match, Squad Death Match, Domination, and [King of the Hill]". Again, you can jimmy the workings in Portal if you wish.
</p>
<p>
Some final bits: open and closed weapon playlists will continue to be available in Battlefield 6, "and we are looking for ways to keep them easily accessible". I'm not sure why that would be difficult? They're also trying to fix matchmaking so that you won't have too much difficulty finding games in which to complete the Challenge of capturing sectors in Breakthrough or Rush.
</p><p>
Expect some of these improvements to materialise in forthcoming Battlefield Labs playtests. The game launches on 10th October. Our hardware editor James attended a preview event recently and came away with the verdict that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">"looks like a Battlefield game"</a>, thereby demonstrating the granular insight that got him promoted to CPU Wrangler First Class.</p>
<p>Even more granularistically, James noted that "there are also reasons to be optimistic that this is a series getting itself back on track, from its renewed emphasis on breaking shit to the replacement of show-off specialists with that old unspoken rule of 'Stick with your squad or perish.'" Did you play the beta? How did you find it?

              <p><span>After almost 30 years of monster catching and battling, there are dozens of unsolved mysteries in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-balls-monster-catchin-musical-professor-oak-2000617768"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>universe. One that has literally haunted fans for over a decade now is the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nobody-knows-what-the-deal-is-with-the-ghost-girl-in-po-1458254184"><span>“Ghost Girl”</span></a><span> who appears in the 3DS games </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. This mysterious Hex Maniac character shows up in Lumiose City, says some ominous stuff to the player, and slides off-screen without an actual walking animation. This odd occurrence has never been explained, and when </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/almost-a-year-later-pokemon-x-ys-ghost-girl-is-still-1646738916"><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>asked</span></a> <i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>producer Junichi Masuda about it back in 2014, he was playfully evasive.

It’s not just Pokémon hiding out here, however. At about the one-minute mark, you can see what looks like a girl dressed in a dark purple outfit hiding outside a window.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>This looks pretty similar to what appears to be the new Hex Maniac design in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A, </span></i><span>seen in the game’s </span><a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1895120741802352840"><span>official art</span></a><span>, leading fans to theorize that this could be a nod to the ghost girl from </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, or maybe even a hint that we might finally learn more about this enigmatic trainer after a decade of theorycrafting. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>takes place entirely in Lumiose City, where the ghost girl appeared in the 3DS games. So, if Game Freak wanted to finally provide some answers to fans’ long-running questions, this would be the game to do it.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000619525" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619525"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619525">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>All that said, this could just be nothing more than an easter egg for fans to spot in the trailer, and it could go nowhere.

Well, we’ll find out for sure when </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>comes to the Switch consoles on October 16.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game.1278225/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has had one of the first chances to get hands-on with the second installment in the Hell Let Loose series, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose has always been one of my go-to World War 2 games since it released in early access in 2019 following its successful Kickstarter campaign (which I backed!). Its huge scale, impressive visuals, and its high-stakes one-shot kill gameplay have made the game one of the most immersive World War 2 multiplayer games that I don’t think anyone has been able to match.</p>



<p>So when the publisher behind Hell Let Loose, Team 17, announced that there was going to be a new installment in the series, but this time set in Vietnam, I had to jump on the chance to get some hands-on.</p>



<h2 id="h-familiar-but-entirely-different">Familiar, But Entirely Different</h2>



<p>To start the match, I made my way to the action as a gunner in a helicopter, ready to rain down bullets on any Vietnamese fighters we came across. After a short one-minute flight over the rivers and the jungle, we landed at our objective on a swampy riverbank.</p>



<p>Almost instantly, enemy mortar fire started to rain down on our location as we made our way to our objective, which was a Vietnamese village already crawling with enemy soldiers. Bamboo bridges provided fast but risky navigation from building to building, and we were under attack from green tracer rounds, suppressing our position from the jungle tree line.</p>



<p>After a couple of minutes of taking down a few enemies, we secured the objective and made our way to the next one, which meant crossing a large river. For those familiar with Hell Let Loose, you know that this would often provide a challenge of trying to find an uncontested bridge or a canal boat pile-up to get across, but in Hell Let Loose Vietnam, we were able to swim across. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, our squad’s time was short-lived as we were all killed, but the moment made for one of those classic Hell Let Loose cinematic moments that never get old, as the treeline facing us was suppressed by an artillery strike. Sadly, it didn’t hit the enemy that lit up our squad with an AK-47, but hey, what can you do?</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-massive-improvements-across-the-board">Massive Improvements Across The Board</h2>



<p>For those who adore Hell Let Loose, this game feels really familiar, with plenty of improvements across the board that I hope will bleed over into the original game. But importantly, the game feels refreshing in the grand scheme of things. The developers have managed to maintain that immersive feeling that Hell Let Loose is known for, all while making sure the game feels different enough that it warrents an entirely new title. </p>



<p>One of the biggest concerned I had I when heared about the series heading into Vietnam was the lack of enemy visibility, which sometimes is a problem in the first game. However, the improved lighting overhaul with the game upgrading to Unreveal Engine 4 from its predessessor to Unreal Engine 5 has seemingly made a massive difference to the games overall colour pallet. While you’re certainly going to be shot from weird places from to time, those concerns are now firmly squashed. The audio overall has also made a tremendous difference in the game, allowing the player to rely on their ears as well as their eyes to pinpoint enemy locations. </p>



<p>Overall, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is going to be an unforgettable entry into the Hell Let Loose franchise, giving players a fresh and immersive gaming experience that is often overlooked in the first-person shooter scene.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam currently has a vague release date of 2026 for the PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

A title that means the world to us and represents the greatest effort of the entire Aeternum Game Studios team.</p><p>Our initial plan was to launch it this September, but after the announcement of [<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>], we are fully aware that our game wouldn’t have the visibility it deserves. Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team’s effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions.</p><p>In addition, we still don’t have all the necessary development kits to ensure a simultaneous release on all next-generation platforms. To be transparent, we believe the best decision for everyone is to step back and bring you <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> at the right time.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>That’s why we’ve made the difficult but necessary choice to delay the release to 2026.</p><p>The game is already finished, and we will use this additional time to keep polishing it, refining every detail, and making sure it delivers the perfect experience our community deserves. We know this change disrupts many of our strategies, but we are confident that with your support we can overcome this major challenge.</p><p>We also want to take this opportunity to thank <a title="Companies > Team Cherry [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/team-cherry">Team Cherry</a>. There’s no need to wish them luck-we know <em>Silksong</em> will be a success and a masterpiece.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Keeper - Official Announce Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>Development on Keeper is being led by Double Fine's Lee Petty, and this allowed Schafer to focus his efforts on these new projects. That doesn't mean that we'll <em>never </em>see a Psychonauts threequel--after all, the game between the first and second games was 16 years--or another Brutal Legend game, but for now, the developer is interested in creating brand-new games instead. Back in June, Schafer also commented on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psychonauts-3-isnt-in-development-right-now-double-fine-confirms/1100-6515614/">how he was developing new games instead of Psychonauts 3</a>.</p><p>While Brutal Legend 2 looks unlikely for now, the game did experience a surge in activity recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/double-fine-paid-tribute-to-ozzy-osbourne-by-giving-away-brutal-legend-for-666-minutes/1100-6533408/">as Double Fine gave the game away for a devilish 666 minutes</a> to honor the passing of the Guardian of Metal, Black Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne.</p><p>Double Fine's Keeper will launch on October 17 for PC and Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/keeper-official-announce-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2025/2300-6466106/">and in case you missed the reveal trailer</a>, the game revolves around a a long-forgotten lighthouse and a plucky seabird embarking on a grand adventure.</p>

Below, we revisit the user-generated-content features of the game that were ahead of their time.</em></p><p>The rain drenched my infantryman's helmet as he marched forward. He could barely make out the jagged silhouettes of the grey buildings 100 feet ahead, but it would only be a moment until he reached them. Or so he thought--until the ambush fell. Tanks, recon trucks, and bazooka-wielding foot soldiers poured out of the fog and into my trenches, cutting through my defenses before I could even get my bearings.</p><p>For me, Advance Wars: Dual Strike was a grid-based chess match where every piece could explode, but the single-player campaign felt like squaring off against a row of toddlers still figuring out how pawns worked. The missions were charming, but I wanted something sharper. Dual Strike's other modes, especially Versus, were where the real battlefields waited, ready for me to customize my way into intense engagements--including horrific defeats like the one I just described. This mode was both a canvas for my tactical creativity and an early sign of where the game industry would go in the future.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553937-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553937" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553937-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553937"></a><figcaption>Advance Wars: Dual Strike</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553937-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_06.jpg"></figure><p>I was barely 12 years old when I first shoved the Dual Strike cartridge into my Nintendo DS. Even then, I knew I wanted strategy, not just spectacle. I'd already poured dozens of hours into Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones, carefully ensuring every character survived the campaign. I liked the pressure, the mental math of predicting enemy movements three turns ahead. I was also more than familiar with the bright battlefields and deceptively complicated tactics of earlier Advance Wars games.</p><p>But those early missions across Omega Land? They didn't exactly test my mettle. Even at higher difficulty settings, I could route the Black Hole Army without much of a plan. The introduction of CO skills--special powers like giving units a second turn or buffing their attacks--was fun at first, but it felt like cheating. Omega Land would always be safe as long as Max and I stood watch. I craved scenarios where I wasn't the unstoppable force.</p><p>That's when I spent time with Dual Strike's other modes, including the War Room and, most importantly, Versus mode. Versus was my laboratory. Here, I could disable Max's abilities, strip away my enemy's usual restraints, and see what I was really made of. I'd set the weather to a downpour, throw in dense fog so I couldn't see beyond a few tiles, and pit myself against my most respected rival--Hawke--on a map that demanded mastery of all three battlefronts: air, land, and sea.</p><p>Once the match began, there was no hand-holding. It was pure tactics. Every turn was a test: What units should I build? Where should I send them? Which front should I reinforce, and which should I risk leaving vulnerable? Sometimes the game settled into a tense stalemate, each of us probing for weaknesses while building up our forces. Other times, it became a frantic race to outmaneuver the other before the tide of battle turned. And yes--more times than I'd like to admit, my entire army was steamrolled into the dirt.</p><p>It wasn't unlike Garry Kasparov's famous chess matches against IBM's Deep Blue in the 1990s--me, the human mind, versus an unflinching machine that never made an emotional move. Except in this match, Deep Blue could churn out an endless supply of bomb-dropping bishops.</p><p>What kept me coming back wasn't just winning. It was the process of working through each scenario's puzzle. Defending a capture point against an overwhelming air assault. Outmaneuvering infantry hidden in dense forests. Timing a naval invasion to coincide with an armored push on the opposite flank. The game rewarded patience and punished arrogance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553938-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553938" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553938-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553938"></a><figcaption>Advance Wars: Dual Strike</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553938-wiiuvc_advancewarsdualstrike_05.jpg"></figure><p>And when I got bored of the game's prebuilt challenges? I made my own. Dual Strike's map editor was a treasure trove. I'd design elaborate island chains where naval control decided the war, or create resource-starved wastelands that forced both sides to make desperate, high-stakes gambles. Sometimes I'd stack the deck against myself on purpose--giving the AI extra funds, advantageous terrain, or even a head start in unit production--just to see if I could claw my way back from the brink.</p><p>There was a special satisfaction in winning those battles. Not because the game told me I was good, but because I knew I had beaten something I built to be unfair. It was like crafting my own tortuous obstacle course and then daring myself to survive it.</p><p>The War Room offered its own brand of joy. These standalone missions were more polished than my homemade ones but still gave me freedom in how to approach them. I'd replay certain maps over and over to test new CO pairings and figure out the absolute most efficient way to dismantle the enemy's plan.</p><p>Looking back, I realize Dual Strike made me comfortable with failure--because I failed a lot--and it made the eventual victories that much sweeter. It also planted the seed of creativity in my mind. This edition of Advance Wars was one of the few games, and one for DS no less, that offered user-generated content tools decades before they would shape the future of gaming. That early experience is part of why creation tools--like Fortnite Creative or Battlefield Portal--have become a central focus of my career. One of the greatest ways to empower players is to give them the tools to build the experiences they want.</p><p>Even now, I gravitate toward that same custom-built chaos when I revisit Advance Wars: Dual Strike. The campaigns are fun for nostalgia's sake, but I'm happiest when I'm staring down a near-impossible map I've cobbled together, wondering if I've created a monster I can't beat. The rain is still falling. The fog is still thick. Hawke is still somewhere out there in the mist. And he's probably going to beat me.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company and DeNA have announced a brand new themed booster pack expansion for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's bringing a ton of new cards for you to collect next week.</p>

<p>Arriving on August 28th,&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs</em>, like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove" rel="nofollow">Eevee Grove</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansion-shining-revelry" rel="nofollow">Shining Revelry</a>&nbsp;</em>before it, is a themed booster pack rather than a mainline expansion (like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow"><em>Wisdom of Sea and Sky</em></a>), which effectively means that it's bringing fewer cards and no seismic gameplay changes to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean you can't expect lots of new cards, though, and true to form,&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs&nbsp;</em>will bring brand new digital goodies for you, including a gorgeous new Suicune ex card, a new full-art Milotic, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-secluded-springs-suicune.jpg?itok=8Mj89KIM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-secluded-springs-suicune.jpg?itok=taH36410 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new Suicune ex card is just one of the cards that awaits you in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs&nbsp;</em>expansion.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also look forward to new cards depicting the likes of Entei and Raikou, as well as Mantyke, Slowking, and other 'mons you might find around a hot spring area. By the looks of the art that's been shown for the expansion so far, it's all lovely high-quality stuff, too.</p>

<p>Of course, there's no guarantee that the art for these cards won't turn out to have been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-production-issue-plagiarism" rel="nofollow">inadvertently stolen from fanart pieces</a>, but at least we can probably expect The Pokemon Company to act quickly if that does turn out to be the case.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, it's a mobile version of the popular&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>card game that simplifies combat rules and renders your collection digitally rather than physically.</p>

<p>It's got plenty of cards from the main game to collect, as well as a number of unique art pieces you can only find within&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>itself, and hey, it's free to play, so you may as well check it out, right?</p>




<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is available to play now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>, and its&nbsp;<em>Secluded Springs&nbsp;</em>themed booster pack launches on August 28th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher Battlestate Games has announced that the game's 1.0 release finally has a release date, and it's just around the corner.</p>

<p>In a new trailer titled "Prepare for Escape" (which is pretty brief and doesn't feature too much in the way of gameplay footage), a man can be seen typing code on a screen, interspersed with footage of soldiers in camo gear engaging in firefights.</p>

<p>Eventually, amidst blaring alarms, the man types a single date on the screen: November 15th. Technically speaking, the trailer doesn't specifically say that this is&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>'s 1.0 release date, but it's hard to imagine what else could warrant this kind of fanfare.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/escape-from-tarkov-1.0-release-date-snow.jpg?itok=VubJzyJu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/escape-from-tarkov-1.0-release-date-snow.jpg?itok=jTBCsqBa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>is finally getting a 1.0 release later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Battlestate first teased a 1.0 release for&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>this year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-10-2025-steam-confirmed" rel="nofollow">back in April</a>, and the studio confirmed that the game will be coming to Steam then as well, although whether that'll happen alongside the 1.0 launch remains to be seen.</p>

<p><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>was first released in closed beta back in 2017, and since then, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-0-16-0-0" rel="nofollow">undergone</a> a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-01400-brings-new-location-for-beginners-achievements-weapons" rel="nofollow">changes</a> thanks to consistent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-patch-0135" rel="nofollow">updates</a> (and progress wipes to go along with them, of course).</p>

<p>The game has also spawned a spinoff in the form of <i>Escape from Tarkov: Arena</i>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-arena-shows-its-fps-gameplay-in-new-trailer" rel="nofollow">more traditional FPS</a> that forgoes&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>'s wide-open areas and PvPvE gameplay for more straightforward player-versus-player deathmatch engagements.</p>

<p>If you wish, you can check out the new Preapre for Escape trailer right here. It doesn't give too much away other than the date, but it's a fun little creation on Battlestate's part regardless.</p>




<p><em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>is, as far as we know, due to launch in full on November 15th this year. If you want to check it out ahead of that date, you can <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pick up its beta right now on PC</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hollow Knight has hit a new peak player count on Steam more than eight years after being released. This super-surge in popularity has come about after the Hollow Knight: Silksong release date was <strong>finally revealed </strong>after years of anticipation. </p>



<p>As I write this, the game peaked at 22,260 users on Steam <strong>three minutes ago</strong>. It’s trending upwards, so we can expect that number to climb as more people jump onto Hollow Knight to experience it before Silksong’s release date comes around.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-silksong-release">When is the Silksong Release?</h2>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong is set to be released on September 4, 2025. </strong>It’s closer than we expected, but it was a date that many thousands of players had to be patient for, especially given that the last game hit the market almost a decade ago.</p>



<p>During the recent Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom, Team Cherry unveiled an all-new trailer for Silksong, which included the ultimate drop of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/">game’s release date</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s the new Silksong release trailer, which has racked up more than 3 million views in under a day:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>The original Hollow Knight title has skyrocketed in popularity since the trailer dropped during Opening Night Live. In recent minutes (at the time of publishing), a new peak was achieved by Hollow Knight on Steam. Before today, the last peak was 20,300 players in May 2022, but I can’t say for sure what caused that surge.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight is one of the best-reviewed games ever made, boasting an ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’ rating on Steam that’s represented by 97% positivity across a whopping 136,000+ reviews.</p>



<p>It’s easy to see why the anticipation is so high for the follow-up game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="8BitDo Arcade Controller 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bac924760d933/8bitdo-arcade-controller-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re into fighting games, chances are you’ve probably seen – or maybe even used – a bunch of leverless arcade controllers. They’re taking the fighting scene by storm, and now 8BitDo, one of the most consistent accessory manufacturers in the business, has launched its own <strong>Arcade Controller</strong> for the Switch, Switch 2, and PC, priced at <strong>$89.99</strong>.</p>
<p>But what the heck is a leverless arcade controller? Well, some folks call them Hit Box controllers, but <a href="https://www.hitboxarcade.com/">Hit Box</a> is actually just one of many branded products released over the years, so it’s kinda like calling a games console ‘a Nintendo’. In reality, they’re largely referred to as ‘leverless’ thanks to the obvious lack of a joystick / lever in favour of an all-button setup. If you’re dead set on a more traditional setup, 8BitDo also has its own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/01/hardware_8bitdos_arcade_stick_grants_that_coin-op_feel_to_your_switch">Arcade Stick</a> available for purchase.</p><div><figure data-videoid="myrpG5TN7_Q" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed53c808qvuypj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myrpG5TN7_Q" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>So let’s take a closer look at the buttons on this thing, starting with the standard circular inputs (we’ll come back to those bean-shaped ones shortly). These are your basic inputs, and their positioning on the controller is such that your fingers can rest comfortably across the majority of them. The black buttons represent your movement, with ‘left’, ‘right’, and ‘down’ grouped together, and ‘up’ situated down toward the bottom. The red buttons, meanwhile, are a mixture of the face buttons and shoulder buttons on a standard Switch Joy-Con or Pro Controller.</p>
<p>What’s particularly nice about this is that the Arcade Controller boasts a dynamic button layout depending on whether you’re playing on Switch or PC. The dial in the top left corner of the controller lets you flick between the two modes, and internal lights will indicate how each of the red buttons function, changing automatically when switching from one mode to the other.</p>

<p>So in other words, the light indicators are a lovely way of easing you into the experience of using a leverless controller, since a lot of brands don’t include them at all. I won’t lie, getting started with a leverless controller can be daunting at first, even if you’re used to a regular arcade stick. Any muscle memory you might have accumulated over the years goes out the window, and you’ll probably find yourself making all kinds of wild mistakes when you start trying to string combos together in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive-</a> or pulling off a Drive Reversal in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>. Trust me when I say, however, that it’s well worth the time investment.</p>
<p>Going back to the buttons, those four extra bean-shaped inputs are essentially programmable to your liking. So for example, if you’re really not keen on having ‘up’ be near the bottom of the device, you can map this to the bean situated just above the ‘down’ button, making your directional inputs more akin to the familiar WASD setup on a keyboard. To map them, you simply hold down the button you want to map to along with the target input, then press the yellow star button at the top of the device. Alternatively, if you’re <em>really</em> not keen on them, the Arcade Controller also includes four replaceable lock caps to render them completely unusable.</p>
<p>As for the button quality, you’re looking at <a href="https://www.lofree.co/products/lofree-wizard">low-profile Kailh Wizard mechanical switches</a>, and they feel incredibly satisfying to press. They’re clicky and tactile, and the clicking noise can really help beginners understand when they’ve completed an input to help with those essential combos. That said, they're a little <em>too</em> loud at times, and the noise can be pretty distracting when playing either docked or in tabletop mode. Thankfully, like most leverless controllers, the button caps and switches can be modded with replacements, so feel free to experiment to see what suits you.</p>
<figure><a title="8BitDo Arcade Controller 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/056c2f877143e/8bitdo-arcade-controller-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In an effort to be tournament ready (granted, you won't find many tournaments utilising the Switch or Switch 2, but still...), the 8BitDo Arcade Controller also comes with a lock switch at the top left of the device, along with SOCD cleaning. The former can be switched on to prevent any accidental presses of the start button, the blue home button, or whatever else might get you disqualified from a tournament.</p>
<p>But what is SOCD? It stands for Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions, and refers to the simultaneous input of directions that, on a single analogue stick or d-pad wouldn’t be possible, but with separate directional buttons <em>is</em> possible. For example, pressing ‘up’ and ‘down’ or ‘left’ and ‘right’ at the same time would sometimes result in unwanted in-game behaviour, but SOCD cleaning alleviates this entirely. Here, pressing opposing directions at the same time will simply yield a neutral stance in fighting games by default. Jolly good.</p>
<p>Like most 8BitDo products, you can also link up the Arcade Controller with the Ultimate Software V2 app on Windows. There is a version of the app available on Mac, but as of right now, the Arcade Controller will not link up there at all – only Windows. You’ll want to link the controller to the app as soon as possible in order to update it to the latest firmware (v1.04 at the time of writing) and make it Switch 2 compatible. So if you’re only on Mac, you’ll want to borrow a friend’s Windows PC or simply wait until the controller is compatible with the version on Mac.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the app will also let you create controller profiles and remap the buttons as you see fit. You can completely rearrange the layout of the inputs to your desire, or even set macros for special attacks; a good option for those extra bean-shaped buttons. It’s worth noting that you can only map single buttons to the programmable beans via the controller itself, while macros are only possible in the app. Once you’re all set up, however, you simply press the yellow star button on the controller to swap between profiles – easy. If you wish, you can also alter SOCD rules; so for example, rather than two opposing inputs rendering a neutral stance, you can make it so the first button pressed takes priority.</p>

<p>Aesthetically, 8BitDo’s Arcade Controller is absolutely stunning. Like its previous Arcade Stick, it looks to pay homage to the NES with the black, red, and light grey colour combination. Boasting a frosted tempered glass surface on top which, yes, might pick up a few minor fingerprints over time, this look is far preferable to a completely glossy surface, in my eyes. Meanwhile, over on the back, you’ve got a non-slip silicon cover that’s enhanced with a beautiful, consistent pattern of fighting combo patterns; seriously, it needs to be seen in person to really appreciate how cool this is.</p>
<p>You’ll also find a couple of other notable features on the back of the device. First up is the USB dongle, and this is magnetic, so holding the dongle close will cause it to snap into place, and believe me, it’s surprisingly satisfying in practice.</p>
<p>On the topic of the USB dongle, by the way, you can connect the Arcade Stick to your Switch or Switch 2 either via Bluetooth, the dongle, or the USB-A to USB-C cable, and all of them are completely viable with minimal latency from my experience. Linking via Bluetooth for the first time is simply a case of holding the green sync button while in the ‘Change Grip/Order’ section of the controller settings. Again, make sure you’ve updated the controller before attempting this on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Finally, there are switches on either side of the silicon cover which you can flip to add a slight bump to the device's angle when set upon a flat surface. It’s a minor change, but it does make a nice difference if you’re playing on a desk. Alternatively, the Arcade Controller is just as comfortable when used on your lap on the couch. If you opt to go wireless, then you can be safe in the knowledge that you'll get about 15-20 hours out of the battery life, which is incredibly generous.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>8BitDo's Arcade Controller is a fantastic piece of kit whether you're a leverless veteran or a complete newcomer to the fighting scene. Heck, it's even a great option for retro 2D platformers too, if you wish. At less than $100, it's a remarkably affordable device for those looking to dip their toes into the world of leverless controllers, and like the vast majority of 8BitDo's products, the quality far outweighs the cost.</p>
<p>The only major downside is the noise of the stock buttons, which can prove quite distracting in practice. Thankfully, however, you can completely replace the switches for something a little more kind on those auditory nerves. Otherwise, it's hard to fault. Leverless controllers definitely take a bit of getting used to, but they can really help to give you a competitive edge once you're comfortable with the setup. Crucially, however, it's just a lot more fun and satisfying than a bog-standard controller. 8BitDo has done it again.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-controversial-267-pve-mode-will-at-least-be-given-for-free-to-edge-of-darkness-owners/">Battlestate</a> has announced a release date for the 1.0 version of Escape from Tarkov, which will escape its early access shackles this coming November 15, 2025. </p>



<p>The news was announced with an intense live-action trailer on the studio's official YouTube channel, where the release date first shown on the watch of a downed soldier, and then more prominently displayed on a computer screen as the final shot of the trailer.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ahead of its launch, players in attendance at any of the following events will be able to check out the 1.0 build for Escape from Tarkov, with the final event in South Korea overlapping with the game's 1.0 launch.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Battlestate</figcaption></figure>



<p>When Escape from Tarkov arrives this coming November, it will have spent a little more than nine years in early access before its 1.0 launch. At the time of this writing, it's not completely clear what changes are coming and what specifically will be included in the 1.0 version, but with the coming build appearing at the above four global events, hopefully, we'll start to hear more about the new version soon.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Battlestate just recently released a new patch for the game, with <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/351">update 0.16.9.0</a> now live, bringing a slew of balance changes and tweaks. </p>

              <p>Ubisoft’s long-promised animated series&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em> has finally been given a longer trailer and a release date. Due October 14, the Liev Schreiber-fronted anime also stars comedian Janet Varney as Anna “Grim” Grímsdóttir, and has been in the works for about four-hundred-thousand years.</p> <p>OK, five years, but it really has dragged on. In the meantime we learned an entire <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-splinter-cell-movie-tom-hardy-1851700151"><em>Splinter Cell</em> movie starring Tom Hardy was canned</a>, while there’s been no word on other announced Ubisoft TV and movie projects like <em>Watch_Dogs</em>,&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Division</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>Riders Republic</em>, a <em>Rabbids</em> feature, and even a <em>Just Dance&nbsp;</em>movie. So honestly, the fact that anything at all is coming to screens feels fairly miraculous.</p> <p>The trailer, however, is…not what I was expecting. In 2024, Michael Ironside—who voiced title character Sam Fisher in the games—<a href="https://screenrant.com/splinter-cell-anime-cast-update-liev-schreiber-sam-fisher/">said that he was “too old” to play the part</a> at 75, with the role handed over to 57-year-old Liev Schreiber for the anime. So it’s something of a surprise to see Sam appearing in the trailer looking like a 75-year-old man.</p>

 <p>There’s still no clear idea what the show will actually be&nbsp;<em>about</em>, beyond it being personal to Fisher, following the death of someone called Douglas Shetland. What we do see is a lot of guns being fired, and Sam mistaking a fair few people for knife racks. Oh, and while it’s weirdly tossed away in the middle of the short teaser, at least the three-light googles appear at one point. I mean, I’m not in charge of Netflix marketing, but given most of the trailer looks like Sam Fisher: The Retirement Home Years, I’d perhaps have ended on the iconic headwear and maybe&nbsp;<em>something</em> that suggested some sort of intrigue.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Splinter Cell: Deathwatch | Official Teaser | Netflix" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LAM63Dj3XBQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The better news is the team behind the show. The creator is Derek Kolstad, responsible for Bob Odenkirk’s reinvention as an action hero in&nbsp;<em>Nobody</em>, and the writer of the first three&nbsp;<em>John Wick</em> movies. That’s some caliber, although I struggle not to imagine the scripts for <em>John Wick</em> are mostly “John punches a man, and then another man and then he shoots three guys, and then he gets shot in the leg but shakes it off and punches four other guys and throws knives at a guy.” Along with Kolstad is a writing team that features scribes from <em>Shooter</em>, and some fresh faces too.</p> <p>It’s an oddly witless and plotless teaser, although given Kolstad is head writer, it seems implausible the show itself could fall that way. Right? Please? As for Fisher’s age, perhaps the show is canon to the games, given the last one—<em>Splinter Cell: Blacklist</em>—came out an extraordinary 12 years ago. Maybe it’s to make the people who remember playing the games feel seen.</p>

Although we still don't really understand what this will involve, exactly, there are already some surprisingly mixed reactions coming from the community, with some players upset about the timing, suggesting it's an all-too-convenient <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-is-getting-a-stardew-valley-collab-in-september-but-not-everyone-is-happy-about-it"><u>distraction from the recent controversy around leakers</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There have been a few collaborations between Stardew Valley and other games over the years," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1958574815495037251" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted</u></a> on X/Twitter yesterday. "To be clear, I never receive any money from these collabs. I've only done them because I was a fan of the other games, or because I genuinely thought the players would like it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Infinity Nikki responded directly to Barone from its official X/Twitter account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We really appreciate you sharing your feelings on this. Any unintended stress was the last thing we wanted. It was our way of saying thanks — a free love letter to Stardew Valley from our team and for the community," the message <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1958609280535519445" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Working on it felt like we were all tending a little farm together. The care and detail you pour into your world is exactly why we want to make cozy games too. We're still learning from you every day."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, it feels as though the fallout from the Stardew Valley collab is just a matter of bad timing here. The Infinity Nikki community has been unhappy ever since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-players-threaten-to-uninstall-the-game-as-dev-introduces-controversial-changes-with-update-15"><u>update 1.5</u></a> added some controversial changes to the game, such as retconning Infinity Nikki's story, and ramping up the money and time investments required to collect full outfits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not that Barone does this all that often, either. Stardew Valley has only ever worked with a handful of other games, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/balatro"><u>Balatro</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terraria"><u>Terraria</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in May, Barone admitted that he "didn't want to just be the Stardew Valley guy," explaining that was why he's currently working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/syberia-remastered-launches-on-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-meta-quest-3-this-november.1278132/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microids has finally announced a release date for Syberia Remastered, a "<em>fully modernized</em>" version of the classic title that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/syberia-remastered-unveiled-for-q4-2025-launch/">first revealed earlier this year</a>. As expected, it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and it'll be out on November 6, 2025. What wasn't expected was that it's also making the jump to VR, and will launch on <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/syberia/6794327920669318/?srsltid=AfmBOoryYxnvWd-oUHWGBdjHWbRYZHo7vAEtjwAE69Dtc_vGvS0-jbac">Meta Quest 3</a> headsets a week after its PC and console launch, on November 13, 2025.</p>



<p>Alongside the news of the confirmed release date and the coming VR version, Microids debuted a 'Before/After' trailer that shows off the visual improvements fans of the original can enjoy in this new remaster. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Syberia Remastered – ESRB Before/After" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aMyKwVlDs_A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Fans looking to keep a piece of this remaster for themselves will also be able to pick up a physical version of the game on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, though it's unfortunately only being released physically in the UK.</p>



<p>The story of Syberia follows Kate Walker, a lawyer from New York who sets out to remote parts of the French Alps alongside her companion Oscar to find Hans Voralberg, an inventor obsessed with making a discovery thought to be impossible, to find the last remaining living mammoths on a mythical island, Syberia.</p>



<p>The trailer revealed today focuses on the visual improvements, but fans of the original are likely more interested in seeing what Microids has done regarding the redesigned puzzles, and to see how the quality of life improvements coming in the remaster smooth out the entire Syberia experience.</p>



<p>Now, thankfully, those fans have a date to look forward to that will satisfy their curiosity.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-pete-parsons-steps-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-steps-down-after-over-20-years.1278129/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons has announced he's stepping down after over 20 years with the company, and he'll be handing his responsibilities over to another long-time Bungie staffer.</p>

<p>In an announcement on the official Bungie <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Parsons says he's "decided to pass the torch" and that now is the "right time for a new beginning", but he doesn't elaborate on his reasons for leaving any further than that.</p>

<p>Parsons will be handing his CEO role over to Justin Truman, who previously served as&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s General Manager and the chief development officer of Bungie as a whole. It sounds as though the transition will be instantaneous, since no other date is given.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-pete-parsons-stepping-down.jpg?itok=XO3gZ-KA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-bungie-pete-parsons-stepping-down.jpg?itok=cEHOpJW5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons is vacating his role after over 20 years with the studio.</figcaption></figure><p>Truman begins his own message by reminding fans of his credentials; he worked as a coder for the original&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>and served as a designer on&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, crafting many systems for the game (including the endgame mechanisms, which he says he got "terribly wrong" at launch).</p>

<p>He's also been helping Bungie to develop&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, so it's fair to say he's been across everything the studio has worked on for the last ten years or so. It's easy to see why Parsons picked Truman for a successor.</p>

<p>Truman inherits a Bungie that is, to put it charitably, struggling somewhat.&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s rollout isn't exactly going smoothly; the game was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">due to launch in September</a>, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed to an unspecified point in the future</a> following lackluster feedback from the first closed alpha test.</p>

<p>The extraction shooter also found itself in hot water back in May, when it was revealed that artwork used in the game had been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">taken from an online artist</a> without permission or compensation (which, incidentally, is <a href="https://x.com/elementj21/status/1671281580831297536" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">not the first time</a> Bungie has been caught doing something like this).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marathon-bungie-pete-parsons-stepping-down.jpg?itok=YzZcmiRr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marathon-bungie-pete-parsons-stepping-down.jpg?itok=icAyTbcK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>has an uphill battle ahead of it.</figcaption></figure><p>That's all in addition to the fact that the latest&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>expansion,&nbsp;<em>The Edge of Fate</em>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3186490/Destiny_2_The_Edge_of_Fate/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hasn't exactly been rapturously received</a>, so it looks like Truman has his work cut out if he wants to turn Bungie's fortunes around. We'll have to wait and see whether he achieves that goal.</p>

            <p>The Rogue Prince of Persia celebrated its 1.0 release yesterday with a remarkably honest behind-the-scenes video from developers Evil Empire, detailing the ups and downs of a year-long Early Access period, including the decision to completely overhaul the game's art style and redesign its purple-skinned protagonist.</p>
<p>The video opens with the admission that this Roguelike take on the wall-jumping, time-rewinding Prince suffered multiple blows upon its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-a-new-roguelite-that-combines-wall-running-with-arkham-style-agile-combat">Early Access release</a> in May 2024. The first of these was the surprise drop of heavyweight <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, which also launched in May and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-cells-devs-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-dodges-hades-2-with-a-release-date-delay">stole most of the Prince's limelight</a>. The second was the negative player response to both the game's lack of content and its colourful visual style, which was inspired by Persian miniature paintings and the artwork of Mœbius/Jean Giraud.</p>

<p>Notably, the decision to give the titular Prince and all NPCs a purple skintone was met with confusion. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKOM1f9KCWQ">developer diary</a> from 2024, it was revealed that this was intended as a direct ode to the PC CGA port of Prince of Persia from 1990, which featured neon skin for all due to a limited 4-colour palette. Unfortunately, this homage went over the heads of most players.</p><p>"During a brainstorming session about skins, our art director had raised a seemingly innocent question," says Evil Empire Marketing Manager Matthew Houghton in the video. "Are we sure that making the Prince purple won't be a problem? At the time, everyone told him no. He was overthinking it; colours are cool, they're stylish, it adds a bit of fantasy! Well...now we all know how that turned out."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The rest of the footage details how Evil Empire not only packed The Rogue Prince of Persia with additional content, but also revamped the art style - a decision that is now conveyed in more detailed levels and a decidedly less-purple Prince adorning everything from the game's key art to the album cover of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nE-Q-EmpvPc2YArqWRhFOd60vkNP8WYR4">impressive soundtrack</a> by Persian American musician ASADI. Alas, even this visual update faced unexpected friction in the form of a bizarre Steam issue which required the devs to use a Spanish phone number to get their own product updated.</p>
<p>"Through all those problems and roadblocks," Houghton continues, "we've had a great community giving us a helping hand the whole way. Even when it was clear we had a tonne of work to do, they've been there giving us support, feedback and encouragement. So a special shoutout to you guys for sticking with us on our crazy journey."</p><p>Despite these nice words, Houghton acknowledges that the game has faced a low player count during its Early Access. The 1.0 release is now considered final, and throughout the video there does seem to be a slight feeling of "well, we sure hope more folks play this, or else we'll never make a sequel." Which would be a shame, considering that last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> was a superb effort that Ubisoft sent out to die with poor promotion before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">disbanding</a> the team behind it.</p>
<p>I intend on giving the Rogue Prince of Persia a proper go this weekend and am looking forward to it. I also liked the purple Prince look, because I can't help but admire unorthodox art design decisions, especially when they're an ultra-niche homage to computer colour schemes that existed when I was a kid. But I can see how his grape skin along with the game's more cartoony and dreamy original visuals failed to latch onto players, and it does feel as if the final result is actually a tad more reminiscent of the Persian miniature inspiration.</p>
<p>Most of all, however, I'm sticken by the frankness of Evil Empire in this video. Despite taking over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> DLC from Motion Twin, Houghton consistently acknowledges that the team was inexperienced in certain regards, and that this was their first fully-fledged project. It's rare to see admissions of setbacks that aren't couched in corporate industry speak (particularly for a gaming brand owned by Ubisoft). I only hope that the Rogue Prince of Persia manages to catch a few more eyes because of it.</p>

Your body is counting.)</em></p><p><em>When Patrick decided to travel to Paris for long enough to feel like he'd lived there, it turns out that also means his body wanted to stay there when he came back, too. Outside of aging, traveling is one of the rare ways to completely upend the way your body senses the world. </em></p><p><em>Rob and Patrick decided to reflect on the ways their bodies' rhythms have changed over time. Learn how Rob was almost run over by forklift!</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> So Rob, when we traveled to London, jet lag wasn’t a thing. Everyone overslept the first few days, sure, but broadly we transitioned over without skipping a beat, thanks to everyone catching a critical few hours of sleep during the overnight flight. It was awesome, and made me optimistic we could make a similar transition coming home. The results are in: absolutely not!</p><p>Handwaving an awful 24-hour stomach bug that made me deeply uncomfortable on the flight home and feeling weirdly feverish overnight, the big problem is that <em>we keep waiting up so early.</em></p><p>The first few days, it didn’t matter when I went to bed. Early. Late. In-between. I’d wake up around 5am. The kids were on the same cycle, too. It’s a seven-hour difference between Chicago and Paris, so apparently our bodies were simply saying “hey, I’d like some lunch.”</p><p>Am I a morning person? Well. I’m not <em>not</em> a morning person—but I really, really enjoy my sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m also not a person who usually has trouble falling back asleep after briefly stirring awake?</p><p>But there was no going back to sleep during these moments, so instead of being frustrated, I woke up and got on with it. The consequences of lacking sleep were a problem for a future version of Patrick. It was in these early hours, as the sun slowly peered out, that I found a lot of enjoyable solace in—excuse the grindset term—”attacking” the day. I surfed through a series of indie games—<em>Sword of the Sea, Herdling</em>—because of the extra quiet time I had in these hours.</p><p>Honestly, the biggest problem was pumping the breaks on my coffee intake. I’m used to taking down two cups of coffee in the day’s opening hours—one while prepping the kids for the day, another slowly sipped while heading towards lunch—and I’d downed both of ‘em before 8am.</p><p>I can feel my normal routine slipping back into place, though. Days ago, I couldn’t make it past 9pm. Last night, I caught up on episodes of <em>Alien: Earth </em>until nearly midnight. I slept until nearly 7am this morning. My brief moment of hacking the universe and getting 2x grindset morning returns appears to be fading. Of course, I could just set an alarm and get up earlier. But that would require making a conscious effort to get up early, not respond to my body demanding it.</p><p>Are there moments in your life where your daily routine, whether it’s when you wake up or otherwise, suddenly shifted? I found this shift, however temporary, to be very pleasant. I’m not sure I’m prepared to sleep early enough to make it happen, but I very much get the appeal of it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@joyceromero?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Joyce Romero</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Probably the most intense version of this I had to deal with was when I worked at a factory where your crew rotated through shifts. You’d have a week of day shift, a week of swing shift, and then a week of night shift. It made it a lot easier to work the night shift but at the cost of just making time itself seem blurry. You’d wrap work at midnight and suddenly you’re hanging with friends until two or three in the morning like it’s nothing. Then the next thing you know you’re going on a date at five in the afternoon, going into work at 11:30, and coming home to have breakfast with your family before you go to bed. There were times it was kind of liberating to be completely divorced from any kind of normal daily routine, to just be doing whatever you wanted or needed to do whenever you had the chance outside work hours.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, I don’t think I ever felt like I was fully rested and healthy while I was doing that, and a <em>lot </em>of people I worked with were taking drugs to sand off the edges of exhaustion or overstimulation. I remember one forklift driver kept having accidents because she was jacked-up all the time, and we busted ass trying to conceal how bad and dangerous the situation had gotten. She’d nearly run you over with a shipping pallet, then she’d scatter the whole load a second later trying to take a turn too fast and we’d swarm her trying to get everything cleaned-up before the foreman could notice. Nobody liked her that much: you can only have someone come inches from inflicting grievous bodily harm so many times before you get righteously pissed about it… but nobody wanted her to get fired. And I think everyone was aware that if management got concerned about the stimulants people were taking as a matter of course, it would cause a <em>lot </em>of problems beyond one forklift operator.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the last few weeks, I’ve been rinsing the Borderlands series, which prepared me quite nicely for an extended demo of Borderlands 4 at  Gamescom. However, my preparation was rendered mostly insignificant when I discovered just <strong>how much of an evolution Borderlands 4 is </strong>over Borderlands 3 (and the rest of the series).</p>



<p>As I explored the seamless and sumptuous open world of Kairos with Harlowe, the ‘Gravitar’ Vault Hunter, I found myself marvelling at the sheer level of differences that set Borderlands 4 apart from everything that came before, while still managing to retain most of what makes Borderlands <em>Borderlands</em>.</p>



<p>Read on to scope out my full Borderlands 4 preview, pieced together from an exclusive, never-before-seen demo at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Before you dive in, here are 35 minutes of Borderlands 4 gameplay, featuring Harlowe:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="35 Minutes of Borderlands 4 Gameplay | Exclusive First Look at Harlowe" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XK2qNsnKLqc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-less-border-more-lands">Less Border, More Lands</h2>







<p>Borderlands 4 has a stunning open world that’s the biggest single environment Gearbox has created in the 20-year history of the franchise. It’s a hugely ambitious undertaking that reflects nothing but the sharpest quality. The classic cartoon visuals of Borderlands 4 are more detailed than ever before, allowing players to study the most minute elements of this enormous map.</p>



<p>To accommodate the size and scale of Kairos, Gearbox has created a Borderlands game that has more traversal options than you can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-will-feature-30-billion-guns/">shake 30 billion guns at</a>. From grapple hooks and gliders to double-jump mechanics and multiple customizable vehicles, there’s no shortage of ways to get around this vast map.</p>



<p>Those elements feed into the game’s combat sequences, too. I found myself flying around the battlefield as Harlowe, employing powerful gadgets to hold enemies in stasis or blast them with an incredible launcher that corroded them from the inside out. It’s easy to never stop moving in Borderlands 4, which is great, as you’ll be digging through the map for <strong>many, many hours</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-humor-but-different">Humor, But Different</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a pre-demo presentation, I learned from Gearbox that the traditional humorous elements of Borderlands are still present in Borderlands 4, but they’ve been toned down a little to reflect the tone of the game. I still had a chuckle at some of the more entertaining character introductions and dialogue choices, though.</p>



<p>The core gameplay loop around the campaign has also been altered, going from a mostly linear path to a truly flexible, sandbox-based RPG. You’re free to do what you want, when you want, where you want, and that suits me down to the ground. It has been revealed by Randy Pitchford that Borderlands 4 has immensely tough bosses, so you’ll want to grind and level up before challenging them.</p>



<p>From a technical perspective, I played Borderlands 4 on both controller and with a keyboard and mouse, and both inputs were accessible, enjoyable, and familiar. I didn’t experience a single bug in an hour, the game rendered and ran beautifully, and the weapon variation and abilities popped nicely.</p>



<p>The same old weapons manufacturers are present, but new ones have been added to the mix, and cross-licensing now happens, bringing one brand’s parts and abilities to other weapons – at a cost. Vehicles can be deployed from anywhere, the skill paths are varied and support multiple styles, and customization has been improved.</p>



<p>Like I said, it feels like an entirely new game, but it still takes a few key elements from the older titles. </p>



<h2 id="h-officially-a-contender">Officially a Contender</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>I’d say that Borderlands 4 is a contender for Game of the Year. Given how strong the year has been for me thus far, that’s not a light statement. I was overwhelmingly impressed by Borderlands 4 during my preview at Gamescom, and one hour of gameplay wasn’t enough for me.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">love that Randy Pitchford</a> has for this game is so clear and tangible, which also fills me with faith for the road ahead.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum">Insider Gaming forum</a> what you think about Borderlands 4 and whether you’ll be getting it on day one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Crimson Desert HANDS-ON PREVIEW: A Little Refining Is Needed, But It Has Promise]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/crimson-desert-hands-on-preview-a-little-refining-is-needed-but-has-promise/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crimson-desert-hands-on-preview-a-little-refining-is-needed-but-it-has-promise.1278114/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The wait for Crimson Desert keeps getting longer, and players have been patient since 2019 to finally see the game in action. As we wait, Insider Gaming had the chance to play the preview build for Crimson Desert at Gamescom 2025, and here are our early thoughts on it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those unaware, Crimson Desert is an upcoming open-world action adventure set on the continent of Pywel. Players take on the role of Kliff, the leader of the Greymanes, as they explore this beautiful yet brutal landscape, defending Pywel from all types of foes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-complicated-yet-exciting-combat">Complicated Yet Exciting Combat</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Crimson Desert preview build was around 50 minutes long, which was easily one of the longest demos at the event. During this time, players received a comprehensive tutorial on combat and movement, experienced a war sequence, and engaged in a proper boss fight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right from the get-go, youre introduced to a variety of moves and skills, and that’s just with one weapon. You can get in all types of different combos and special moves by using different button combinations. However, this game is not a button masher, and repeating the same moves might get you through the minions, but you really need to know your skillset when taking on the bosses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players were only able to face one faction during the preview, which featured several enemy times. Some were small and quick, inflicting relatively minor damage at once but causing more damage over time. The other type was big and slow, but could unleash some hefty blows at the same time. </p>



<p>The boss is an entirely different matter—a true monster who could eliminate you in an instant if you found yourself cornered. There’s a specific system in place, and if you’re not adhering to it, you’ll find yourself in a challenging situation.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-great-blend-of-magic-and-brute-force-nbsp">A Great Blend of Magic and Brute Force&nbsp;</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Combat heavily relies on melee combat, but it’s blended with several magic-based skills. You were able to access three different types of elements in the preview build: Fire, Freeze, and Thunder, which can be used to enchant your weapons and deal some mighty blows to the enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We had access to two different types of arrows, too, for ranged attacks. One of the other weapons could be imbued with one of your chosen elements to inflict damage as well as a status effect on the enemies. The other arrow called for a barrage of raining fire arrows from the sky, damaging masses of enemies at once.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It took me some time to get used to all the attacks and abilities they had to offer, but once things started going, I was having a whole lot of fun. I was slashing one enemy, stabbing another; I think I even pulled off a WWE move once, smacking the enemy straight down into the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-visual-treat-nbsp">A Visual Treat&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The graphics and performance of Crimson Desert were brilliant, at least for a preview build. <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pearl Abyss</a> brings players to an intriguing fantasy world, which is filled with all types of flora and fauna. The world feels massive, although I was only able to explore a tiny part of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With such a massive world, you need to have different ways to traverse, and the game offers several. Of course, like most games, you can jump and sprint wherever you need to go, and there are plenty of climbable surfaces. On top of that, the main character has a floating/gliding ability, which can be used to cover a lot of distance when dropping from heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You also have a trusty steed, like most fantasy games. However, the horse’s movement felt very clunky and slow; it needs a bit of work. Sprinting was almost always faster to get to a location.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Crimson Desert has excellent potential and has a lot going for it. It will be the perfect title for players who are looking to sink their teeth into a new fantasy adventure. Combat is extensive and complex. It can be unforgiving at times, especially with the bosses, if you don’t know your way around it.&nbsp;It isn’t a Soulslike game, but it will require some effort from casual gamers.</p>



<p>However, there was not a lot to explore in Crimson Desert’s open world, so it’s hard to tell how it’s shaping up or if it feels lived in. At the same time, if the developers have put in the same amount of attention to detail with the world design as they have with combat, then players have a solid experience waiting for them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In other news, Crimson Desert has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed to Q1 2026</a> due to “longer than expected timelines”.

With trustworthy allies and various in-game events, Proxies will get to delve deeper into the power struggles in New Eridu and uncover the past of the familiar yet fresh faction, the Obol Squad.</p><p>The Defense Force’s intervention—spearheaded by Major General Lorenz and commanded by Colonel Isolde—throws Waifei Peninsula’s power struggles into even more turbulent waters. Beyond eliminating the Exaltists’ remnants, the Obol Squad will also uncover long-buried truths and reveal the hidden stories behind team member Seed’s mysterious past and inner world.</p><p>As a genius mechanic, the S-Rank Electric Attack Agent Seed has transformed the Seed Sr. mecha into a formidable partner with overwhelming firepower and suppression capabilities. Seed excels in synergizing with other Attack agents to enhance the team’s sustained damage output. Orphie &amp; Magus, the S-Rank Fire Attack Agent and Obol Squad’s captain, excels in coordinated team combat using powerful lasers. Through EX Special Attack that assists allies, Orphie can accumulate Bottled Heat, and place all squad members into the Zeroed In state upon hitting enemies, boosting Attack and allowing Aftershocks to ignore a portion of the enemy’s Defense. Joining the stellar lineup is Mercury, the outstanding S-Rank Bangboo who operates a tank as combat support on the battlefield. S-Rank Electric Stun Agent Trigger and S-Rank Fire Attack Agent Evelyn will return in Version 2.2. Additionally, Soldier 0 – Anby is currently undergoing intensive training, and Proxies can expect her to return even stronger with her activated potential in future versions.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_987402"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As for events, the Bangboo tower defense event Band of Brave Bangboo will come with new maps, enemies, and mechanics, including bushes and Miasmic environment. Successfully clearing stages will reward Proxies with the A-Rank Excaliboo. This Bangboo will attempt to draw his holy sword before attacking—success results in powerful sword strikes, while failure leads to determined hammer attacks against opponents. For lighter entertainment, the Rhythm Rave event challenges Proxies to sync beats with classic tracks and earn abundant in-game rewards.</p><p>Continuous optimizations has also been implemented to further improve player experience. For example, Proxies can now choose between Belle or Wise before starting companion events such as Quality Time invites.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,226 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,789 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,070 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.2 special program below.

Associate creative director Miles Leslie said that the difficulty scale for Black Ops 7 is "baked in" as opposed to being something a player can choose.</p><p>The reason for this comes down to how Black Ops 7's campaign can be played in co-op.</p>

      </div>
<p>"We've built it for solo or four-player squads as well. You cannot pick a difficulty like past games. We've baked it in because you have to approach a co-op campaign differently, and we wanted to make sure the missions felt right for solo players," Leslie told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-does-not-have-difficulty-options-treyarch-explains-why" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.</p><p>For players who enjoy a solo experience, Leslie said, "We're not forgetting about you; we love you." However, Black Ops 7's campaign was designed to be a "social experience."</p><p>"We want to make sure it's fun, but the right amount of challenging for two, three, and four players as well," Leslie said.</p><p>Call of Duty's difficulty levels over the years have included things like Recruit, Regular, Hardened, and Veteran, along with a super-challenging Realism mode.</p><p>For Black Ops 7, the campaign difficulty <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-again-black-ops-7-does-plenty-to-avoid-feeling-like-dlc/1100-6534011/" data-ref-id="1100-6534011">will scale when playing co-op</a>, meaning partying up with friends doesn't necessarily make it easier, and teamwork is needed to get through missions.</p><p>Another thing that's new for Black Ops 7's campaign is how XP progression from the campaign is connected to multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. Additionally, Black Ops 7's campaign closes with a mission called "Avalon Endgame," which is described as a "brand-new, replayable experience where you and your squad will need to survive overwhelming odds, adapt under pressure, and break the rules of what you thought a Black Ops campaign could be."</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">multiplayer beta will be held in October. </a>The game is coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox, and PC, and it'll be included with Xbox Game Pass.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight’s reveal at Gamescom 2025 has ignited a wealth of excitement for the upcoming title from TT Games, and we’ve gathered everything we know about the release date.</p>



<p>Revealed as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next LEGO title from TT Games</a>, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight impressed us during a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a>, although some eyebrows have been raised with marketing stating that there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-will-feature-only-7-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only seven playable characters</a> in the game.</p>



<p>There’s still plenty to be revealed about LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, and, if you want to begin your countdown to release, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>

<p><strong>No, a precise release date for LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has not been shared by TT Games.</strong></p>



<p>After being revealed at Gamescom, it’s understandable that players are keen to know exactly when they will be able to get their hands on the title, but there’s going to be a bit of a wait before those details become available.</p>



<p>In fact, don’t expect a precise release date to be shared this year, given the release window that has been issued is pretty broad.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-window">What is The LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Release Window?</h2>



<p><strong>TT Games announced at Gamescom, following the reveal of LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, that the release window for the title is 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike many other games, no specific month or season for <a href="https://warnerbrosgames.com/article/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>‘s launch has been shared, resulting in a pretty broad window, but there are some trends that could be followed.</p>



<p>For example, Grand Theft Auto 6 is looming large in 2026 with a release date in May, and most, if not all, developers will want to avoid going head-to-head against the titan, giving it is expected to be one of the biggest gaming launches of all time.</p>



<p>Although LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga was released in April 2022, that was an outlier in TT Games’ history, as, traditionally, releases have come in May/June or September/October/November.</p>



<p>In 2018, LEGO: DC Super-Villains was released in October, while in 2017, LEGO: Marvel Superheroes 2 was released in November. Going back further, LEGO Dimensions was released in September 2015, and LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham was released in November 2014.</p>



<p>Though that doesn’t clear the release window up exactly, it does mean that TT Games’ previous schedule suggests we won’t see LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight in the first half of 2026.</p>

                <p>Battlestate Games has been developing its intense first-person tactical shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov/" data-ref-id="5000-673440">Escape From Tarkov</a> since 2012. Although the closed beta debuted in 2017, players had no idea when to expect the full release. Now, Battlestate Games has shared a new live-action Escape From Tarkov trailer that confirms its exit from early access this fall.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpeLk_OJ9-M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpeLk_OJ9-M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The November 15 release date was revealed in the closing seconds of the video above. Studio head Nikita Buyanov subsequently confirmed the date on his X account.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1958630353029275803" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">15.11.2025<br>1.0 release<br>Let’s gooooooo!</p>  — Nikita Buyanov (@nikgeneburn) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikgeneburn/status/1958630353029275803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Very little was shared about what will be included in Escape From Tarkov version 1.0. Presumably it will have some story content as well as refined maps, weapons, and quality-of-life improvements. But absent any firm details from Battlestate Games, we can only speculate.</p><p>Battlestate Games has kept a community of Escape From Tarkov players together for over eight years. However, there have been some issues that caused friction between the studio and its fans. After releasing a $150 Edge of Darkness limited edition that was said to include all future DLC, Battlestate Games released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov-arena/" data-ref-id="5000-450666">Escape From Tarkov: Arena</a> and the game’s PvE mode as a separate $250 purchase. That led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-escape-from-tarkov-edition-locks-pve-behind-250-paywall/1100-6522990/" data-ref-id="1100-6522990">a backlash against the studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-boss-didnt-expect-players-to-get-mad-about-paid-pve-content/1100-6523084/" data-ref-id="1100-6523084">a subsequent apology from Battlestate Games</a> came with a promise to let Edge of Darkness owners access the PvE mode as well.</p><p>Escape From Tarkov is only available to play on PC and can be found on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/escape-from-tarkov-arena-d3e23b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>
