            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-helldivers-2-update-stratagem-changes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>has received a huge update that contains a ton of stratagem balance changes, which, as chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt explains, are intended to add extra loadout variety opportunities.</p>
<p>Pilestedt, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-arrowhead-new-ceo">stepped down as developer Arrowhead's CEO</a> last month, says that this update is aiming to "buff up some of the weaker stratagems" and alter some for consistency.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/5998312279129319530" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam post</a> accompanying the new update's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4150709804553746157" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, Pilestedt goes into great detail regarding the changes made to each stratagem, with options like the Machine Gun Sentry, the HMG Emplacement, and the Anti-Personnel Minefield receiving buffs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-update-stratagem-turret.jpg?itok=2W1-EXgr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-update-stratagem-turret.jpg?itok=a-HiM1Kx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>has received a big update that brings huge changes to some of the game's stratagems.</figcaption></figure><p>The changes are extensive, so we won't list them all here, but highlights include an increase in durability across all Sentry emplacements in order to make them less vulnerable to "small arms fire".</p>
<p>If you're a user of the Orbital Precision Strike (which, according to Pilestedt, pretty much everyone is), you'll be pleased to know it's had its call-in time and cooldown reduced.</p>
<p>Two Eagle stratagems, the Rocket Pods and the Strafing Run, have also been buffed, with the Rocket Pods gaining changes to make them "more consistent" in dealing with heavily-armored enemies and the Strafing Run getting extra armor penetration.</p>
<p>It's not just stratagems, either; several special weapons have also received buffs, including the Grenade Launcher, the Heavy Machine Gun, and the standard Machine Gun.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-update-stratagem-crossbow.jpg?itok=gZY7jZYR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-update-stratagem-crossbow.jpg?itok=IHLJLiCO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>weapons, including the explosive crossbow, have received buffs in the new update.</figcaption></figure><p>Standard weapons like the Purifier, the Explosive Crossbow, and the Eruptor have also seen changes in this patch, so if you've been using any of those weapons regularly, you'll likely notice a change.</p>
<p>It seems that Pilestedt and Arrowhead are intent on bringing bigger and more meaningful changes to&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>. Last week, the developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond">announced a shakeup</a> to the way Warbonds would work, with less frequent and more impactful Warbonds planned for the future.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Flock Preview - Wholesome, Wonderful, Whimsy]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/flock-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/flock-preview-wholesome-wonderful-whimsy.900237/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/flock-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes we all need an injection of pure happiness in our lives, and <em>Flock </em>is here to envelope us all in its wholesome embrace. It's a simple, low-stakes game about cruising through the sky cataloguing funny little animals that can then join you flock and fly with you.</p>
<p>The premise of the game is simple. You're on to see your aunt Jane, who is studying the strange creatures you'll see in the world and needs help cataloguing them all. Of course, you agree to help and then you're off.</p>
<p>Flight is a simple joy. You don't need to worry about height, as the game will adjust that automatically for you. You can just zoom about where you'd like, sitting on perches or not littered throughout the world if you wish.</p>

<p>The simple movement that takes you to beautiful vistas combined with the calming, upbeat music create a meditative mood. Happily, I was lulled into a reverie that was utterly relaxing -- a welcome relief at the end of many appointments at Summer Game Fest.</p>
<p>What helps pull you in is the vibrancy of the world, which I would defy anyone to not be charmed thoroughly. The locales are popping with color, varied, and full&nbsp;of interestingly shaped flora and fauna at every turn.</p>
<p>That unique approach is applied to everything you come across, even with the interesting names of the creatures themselves. There are many different families of creatures you come across, each of which have fun names like gleebs, sprugs, burbots, and more.</p>
<p>When you do come across a new creature, you can observe its mannerisms and habits to try to learn a little about it. Once you're confident, you can prompt your aunt Jane that you've found a new creature to catalogue.</p>

<p>If its a new family of creature you've never seen, she'll reveal its kind to you. But, its up to you to find the specific type in that species. She'll give you a list with brief descriptions like, "Three vertical stripes" or "nose is a different color from the rest of its body."</p>
<p>Some of the descriptions are about their actions, too. If one zips and darts around, or always tries to fly into the brush or hide, that may be a clue for you to correctly identify what you've found.</p>
<p>After they're identified, and you have a whistle for that animal family, you can try to entice it to join your flock. That is simply done by following them and timing a call from your bird, who mimics the whistle, towards the creature. Do it correctly, or multiple times if needed, and it will fly around with you.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that is more or less <em>Flock</em>. There is a wide world to uncover full of interesting creatures and characters as you learn all about the region. It's simple, cozy fun. And one of the best parts is you can do it with a friend, as <em>Flock </em>will have a co-op mode if you wish.</p>
<p>If you're just wanting to sink into a meditative state and meet cute creatures, one of which you'll no doubt fall in love with, <em>Flock</em> is perfect for you.</p>
<hr><p>Flock <em>was previewed for about 30 minutes at Summer Game Fest Play Days. It releases July 16th, 2024 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</em></p>

This was enough for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/KaptainKOnYT/status/1801048608155799970&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/KaptainKOnYT/status/1801048608155799970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some fans obsessed with Japanese games</a></span> to develop a parasocial relationship with Midori, to the point where they were trying to calculate her age and asking her for her number. </p><p>“Thank you for friend requests,” Midori <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/clotifiles/status/1801046211832553915&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/clotifiles/status/1801046211832553915" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted last October</a></span>. “But I have a boyfriend, so I don’t want to date right now. You can date in <em>Persona</em> games, so you can do that instead. I hope you find cool girlfriend soon.” Adding to the mystery surrounding Midori, the character would frequently talk about getting out of video game leaking world altogether, before eventually coming back, most recently on Monday of this week. </p><p>“It is just stressful to continue because of conspiracies,” Midori <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1800328353716785542&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1800328353716785542" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> at the time. “So I am uncomfortable now.   I think it is good to stop here.” The timing also happened to coincide with several incorrect predictions around Square Enix games showing up at the Xbox showcase, as well as <em>Visions of Mana</em> not coming to PlayStation 4 (the publisher confirmed earlier today that it was). </p><p>Now it turns out the only real conspiracy was that Midori was a mysterious new female leaker from Japan, and not apparently a white male <em>Persona </em>leaker previously known as MysticDistance. “The rumors about my identity that have started to spread and will continue to spread recently are correct information,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1801044892300267796&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1801044892300267796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on June 13</a></span>. “It is only ironic that I am corroborating information that will almost assuredly end the long journey that has been had with this account.”</p><p>The confession was in response to an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://0bin.net/paste/duqx6e6R#owLSgKnxlfq90-tk0d1mxL91OM3sTlxmq0E33K97e6s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://0bin.net/paste/duqx6e6R#owLSgKnxlfq90-tk0d1mxL91OM3sTlxmq0E33K97e6s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anonymous document</a></span> going around accusing MysticDistance of faking their new identity and relying on old or incomplete sourcing to peddle new, unsubstantiated rumors. On social media, meanwhile, the leaker has been criticized for embracing racist caricatures to masquerade as someone they weren’t. </p><p>“The Midori persona as it is may not be a real person, but it is what I believe to be an accurate representation of a real person albeit in a particularly strange way that I wish I did not use,” MysticDistance wrote in response. “But it was never used to manipulate anyone or to appear more credible.” He denied that the leaks came from old presentations rather than current sources, and said the new account “liberated” him to embrace Sega and Atlus leaker fan culture in a way that his old reputation as MysticDistance did not. </p><p>“I won’t tell anyone what to feel or what I think they should do in this situation. That isn’t my place,” he wrote. “I know that there are people who are reading this post who feel betrayed. I will not invalidate your feelings or decision to walk away or voice your feelings.” MysticDistance also claimed that his existing leaks will still be proven accurate. “Over the coming months and years, more and more of the unannounced information I have posted will be revealed,” he continued. “Of course, some plans will probably change too.  I hope everyone is excited for what they can expect from Atlus and Sega going forward.”</p><p>Midori is just the latest episode in a video game leaking culture saga that feels increasingly off the rails. As gaming companies pull back even further from early trailers and reveals, and fandoms for the hottest games become even more desperate for crumbs of new information, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-leak-google-youtube-private-videos-employee-1851516110&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-leak-google-youtube-private-videos-employee-1851516110">various leakers have tried to fill the gap, with varying degrees of success</a></span>. In part that’s because business plans can be complex and constantly evolving. It might also have to do with a lot of supposed leakers getting one piece of good information, and then not being able to help themselves from trying to parlay it into an entire identity and Discord community. Midori did fly too close to the sun, and now his wings have melted, at least until another one of his older random predictions gets proven right again. </p><p>Midori, aka MysticDistance, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-update-loot-crates-cultist-jacket/</link>

<p>Battlestate Games has just added Patch 0.14.9.1 to Escape from Tarkov, introducing a few new elements and tweaking some existing aspects of the game. At the heart of this update sits loot crates – a new reward-based mechanic that ties Escape from Tarkov closer to Tarkov: Arena. With this new feature, players can unlock a series of loot crates in EFT for completing various tasks in Tarkov: Arena.</p>



<p>Also, that cool Cultist Jacket has been added, but it’s exclusively available for those with The Unheard Edition of the game… For now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tarkie-drip">Tarkie Drip</h2>



<p>Those who purchased The Unheard Edition – or who do so going forward – can secure the Cultist Jacket, a long, black coat that has a handy hood built in. The catch is you can’t wear a helmet if you want to equip the hood, but that’s okay. It’s worth it to look super cool. This was one of the items promised to players when The Unheard Edition was revealed several weeks ago, promptly causing a huge controversy and forcing Battlestate Games into something of a hole. </p>



<p>If the awesome Cultist Jacket isn’t enough to whet your appetite, how about soaking up some of the new loot crates that BSG has added? For completing daily and weekly tasks in Tarkov: Arena, you’ll now unlock in EFT:</p>



<ul>
<li>Equipment Crate</li>



<li>Weapon Crate</li>



<li>Supply Crate</li>



<li>Valuables Crate</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s something for every item category in the game, and it’s assumed that you can unlock some fairly juicy items in these loot crates. Otherwise, what would be the point in chasing them down? The only catch is that you’ll need Workbench LL2 in your Hideout to open them.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, BSG updated how ballistic plate colliders work and tweaked the maximum protection area of every plate. That means that a single plate now offers wider coverage. Also, the Mark of the Unheard device now only works in PvE mode (lol) and Edge of Darkness and The Unheard Edition players have unique dog tag appearances and a reduction in insurance return times.</p>



<p>That’s everything!</p>

                <p dir="ltr">In 2021, Amazon Games launched New World, a robust MMO that served as the publisher's first-ever release. After three years and a multitude of changes, Amazon is planning on continuing its maiden voyage into uncharted waters, as New World Aeternum will bring the full experience and more to consoles this fall. We had the chance to check out Aeternum during Summer Game Fest, and so far, Amazon's adaptation adventure is smooth sailing.</p><p dir="ltr">Our hands-on began with New World's robust character creation system, and we could have spent the entire session there. Dozens of options in multiple categories--face, hair style, scars, tattoos, and more--give plenty of agency over how your characters will look, and the virtual cursor system makes selecting each one easy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317960-nwa_announce_archetype_musketeer_v2_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317960" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317960-nwa_announce_archetype_musketeer_v2_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317960"></a><figcaption>Muskeeter archetype</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317960-nwa_announce_archetype_musketeer_v2_1920x1080.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317961-nwa_announce_archetype_musketeer_v2_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317962-nwa_announce_archetype_void_brightwood_v1_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317963-nwa_announce_archetypeacolyte_cutlass_v1_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317964-nwa_announce_duo_actionpose_azothtree_01_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317965-nwa_announce_magicswordsguns_a_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317966-nwa_announce_pvp_cutlasskeyspvparea_v1_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317967-nwa_announce_ranger_archetypes_pve_v1_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317961,1300-4317962,1300-4317963,1300-4317964,1300-4317965,1300-4317966,1300-4317967" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317961-nwa_announce_archetype_musketeer_v2_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317962-nwa_announce_archetype_void_brightwood_v1_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317963-nwa_announce_archetypeacolyte_cutlass_v1_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317964-nwa_announce_duo_actionpose_azothtree_01_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317965-nwa_announce_magicswordsguns_a_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317966-nwa_announce_pvp_cutlasskeyspvparea_v1_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317967-nwa_announce_ranger_archetypes_pve_v1_1920x1080.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317961-nwa_announce_archetype_musketeer_v2_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317962-nwa_announce_archetype_void_brightwood_v1_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317963-nwa_announce_archetypeacolyte_cutlass_v1_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317964-nwa_announce_duo_actionpose_azothtree_01_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317965-nwa_announce_magicswordsguns_a_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317966-nwa_announce_pvp_cutlasskeyspvparea_v1_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317967-nwa_announce_ranger_archetypes_pve_v1_1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of the major changes to character creation is the Archetype system, which condenses the class-creation system from dozens of broad classes to a more focused set of abilities and weapon proficiencies. The Swordbearer, for example, is a tank who excels in heavy weapons and starts with buffs to their cooking and fishing skills, while the Occultist uses elemental magic and begins with increased mining and jewelcrafting abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with GameSpot at Summer Game Fest, creative director Dave Verafaillie explained that Archetypes contributed to one of the team's main goals for Aeternum: Making the start-up experience as quick as possible for console players. "[Archetypes are] a great way to onboard people," Verafaillie said. "You don't have to worry about too much customization stuff; you can just choose your play style and get in and enjoy it."</p><p dir="ltr">After character creation, it's time to begin the game properly, and the first thing that sticks out is the game's control scheme. New World's combat and traversal translate very well to the standard console controller. Jumps, attacks, and basic movement are all found where you'd expect them in a standard action game rather than an MMO, but Aeternum's controls do have some interesting traits.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, normal attacks are mapped to R2/RT, and attacks vary on how long you hold the button down. Pressing normally will result in a standard attack, but holding the button down will result in a heavy attack which takes longer to execute but deals more damage on contact. This approach feels great in practice, as it allows you to be more deliberate with attacks while keeping execution simple, and the control scheme as a whole works incredibly well in translating New World to the console experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Controller support had been added to the current New World offering in the past, but Aeternum's layout, according to the dev team, is even more optimized. "One thing that gives us an advantage in adapting New World to consoles is that both our controls and our combat are navigation-locked," game director Scott Lang said. "A lot of traditional MMOs use tap-target, cooldown-, and icon-based systems. Because we have one main weapon, and our system focuses on direct combat and direct navigation, we can then have three abilities that map really nicely to a controller." Verafaillie adds that "target lock, controller remapping, aim assist, and more" will also be coming to the control scheme with Aeternum.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317950-nwa_announce_blacksmith_edendgrove_v3_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317950" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317950-nwa_announce_blacksmith_edendgrove_v3_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317950"></a><figcaption>Blacksmithing in New World Aeternum</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317950-nwa_announce_blacksmith_edendgrove_v3_1920x1080.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317951-nwa_announce_blacksmith_edendgrove_v3_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317952-nwa_announce_cooking_brimstone_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317953-nwa_announce_fishingsolo_v3_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317954-nwa_announce_fishing_reekwater_a_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317955-nwa_announce_logging_brightwood_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317956-nwa_announce_miningduos_v1_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317957-nwa_announce_miningsolo_shatteredmtn_v2_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317958-nwa_announce_pvp_elysianwilds_v2_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317951,1300-4317952,1300-4317953,1300-4317954,1300-4317955,1300-4317956,1300-4317957,1300-4317958" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317951-nwa_announce_blacksmith_edendgrove_v3_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317952-nwa_announce_cooking_brimstone_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317953-nwa_announce_fishingsolo_v3_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317954-nwa_announce_fishing_reekwater_a_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317955-nwa_announce_logging_brightwood_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317956-nwa_announce_miningduos_v1_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317957-nwa_announce_miningsolo_shatteredmtn_v2_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4317958-nwa_announce_pvp_elysianwilds_v2_1920x1080.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317951-nwa_announce_blacksmith_edendgrove_v3_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317952-nwa_announce_cooking_brimstone_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317953-nwa_announce_fishingsolo_v3_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317954-nwa_announce_fishing_reekwater_a_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317955-nwa_announce_logging_brightwood_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317956-nwa_announce_miningduos_v1_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317957-nwa_announce_miningsolo_shatteredmtn_v2_1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4317958-nwa_announce_pvp_elysianwilds_v2_1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While New World Aeternum is considered a "massively multiplayer online" game--and the existing game is already one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-mmorpgs/2900-5436/">best MMORPGs</a> out there--our demo was a solo experience. This was intentional; Aeternum has been designed so players can enjoy it either alone or with a group. "Another big focus for us was making Aeternum a single-player experience all the way through," Verafaillie said. "In other MMOs, you're sort of forced to do endgame raids with other players. We have endgame raids too that will require other players, but we've also added new repeatable solo trials that will let players continue to improve their gear if they prefer to go it alone."</p><p dir="ltr">New players were certainly a focus during Aeternum's development, but the team also had another set of players in mind: Those who played the game at launch but haven't done so since. According to the team, New World Aeternum will be completely different from the experience they'll remember from three years ago, and that starts with the story.</p><p dir="ltr">"If someone is coming in for the first time since launch, we've redone the entire main story quest line," senior producer Katy Kaczynski said. "The overarching story is still similar--Act 1 is still the Tempest, for example--but the way the story is told to you, the characters you meet along the way, all of that is different. This release brings even more immersion to the reworked story thanks to the enhanced dialogue system, so you can feel like you're part of the story instead of just watching it unfold."</p><p dir="ltr">The team understands the risk in making such a harsh adjustment, but according to Kaczynski, the team felt they had to do what was best for the game. "Feedback we got in the beginning of the game was that it was a really big grind, or that people didn't feel like they were brought into the story," Kaczynski explained, "so we wanted to take that and bring a more exciting and immersive experience."</p><p dir="ltr">Amazon Games is promising a lot to the MMO crowd as New World makes the jump to consoles with Aeternum, no matter if or when you played the game previously. A revamped story system, streamlined onboarding, and simplified controls will all provide an easy transition for experienced New World players, as well as a painless introduction to new adventurers. Based on our time playing the game and getting a feel for what it offers, the voyage seems to be sailing in the right direction.</p><p dir="ltr">New World Aeternum launches October 15 on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. An invite-only closed beta will run from July 11 to July 17 on both Xbox and PlayStation, and players can sign up for a chance for an invite at the <a href="https://www.newworld.com/forward-link?id=tester-sign-up" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game's official website</a>.</p>

        <p>But overall software, hardware and accessory sales are down once again</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Vampire survival game V Rising emerged from Early Access and swooped to the top of the charts in the UK during May.</p>
<p>The PC game received strong reviews upon release, with a PS5 version due in June 11.</p>
<p>However, it was a slow month for game sales overall, with 1.85 million games sold, a drop of 21% compared with May 2023. Last year, the games market was boosted by the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, plus the release of Hogwarts Legacy on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the previous month's No.1 Fallout 4 manages to remain in the Top Five at No.4. The 2015 game surged up the charts in April following the launch of the Amazon Prime TV show combined with some price discounting.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut jumps up the charts following the game's release on PC, landing at No.6. It is PlayStation Studios' second biggest PC release (behind Helldivers 2), and its biggest internally developed PC launch. After two weeks, it has narrowly sold more than 2022's Spider-Man: Remastered</p>
<p>The final new releases in the Top Ten is the remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door for Nintendo Switch (digital data missing). It's a decent debut for the game, with physical sales above both last year's Super Mario RPG and 2020's Paper Mario: The Origami King</p>
<p><strong>Console market continues to slip</strong></p>
<p>Just under 65,000 games consoles were sold in the UK over May (GfK panel data), a drop of 10% on the month before and nearly 33% down on may last year. PS5 was the No.1 format again, but saw sales down 13% over April.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the tough year-on-year comparison is actually Nintendo Switch, which posted impressive console sales in May 2023 following the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Switch sales are also down 9% over the month before.</p>
<p>Xbox Series S and X is in third spot, with sales also down 9% month-on-month.</p>
<p>Over in accessories, 475,429 products were sold in the UK during May, down 12.6% over April, by up 5% over May last year. The market was driven by the White (No.1) and Midnight Black (No.2) PS5 DualSense controllers, meanwhile the PlayStation Portal Remote Player has jumped back into the Top Ten at No.3.</p>
<p>Overall, game and console revenue has taken a sharp fall in the UK this year, but actually accessory sales are up 21% year-to-date.</p>
<p>"PC gaming accessories - driven by mice/keyboards/headsets - are up 8%, but console gaming accessories are up +26%," says GfK games boss Dorian Bloch.</p>
<p>"The main growth categories for console accessories are controllers, which is up 22% due to the PS5 joypads, namely DualSense, DualSense Edge and PlayStation Portal. But controllers are also slightly up within the Xbox space. For PlayStation this is due to first-party controllers, but for Xbox this is split between Microsoft, Acco and PDP.</p>
<p>"Console gaming headsets are up 17%, driven by PlayStation headsets and Sony’s existing Pulse 3D products, but most notably since Week eight with the introduction of Pulse 3D Elite, which is driving the Pulse range and increasing Sony’s overall revenue share.</p>
<p>"SteelSeries products for PlayStation have been driving things, too, most notably the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless, which even at around £300 remains a SteelSeries top volume seller."</p>

<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2</a></em> players have been singing their praises for The Call, a legendary Sidearm you get while playing <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s campaign, because it’s been dragging most of us through the new content by providing us with what feels like an incredibly unfair advantage. </p> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">I got The Call in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-exegesis-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third mission</a> in the campaign, and it carried me through the rest of that story and into every activity afterward. I thought I’d just gotten lucky, but now most players are sharing their stories about when they got the weapon and just how handy it was. Some are even admitting how they felt silly after trying it for the first time, long after picking it up and being filled with regret for having sat on it for so long. </p>
 <h2 id="h-destiny-2-players-love-the-call-for-helping-them-have-a-great-time-in-the-final-shape" data-injectable="false"><em>Destiny 2</em> players love The Call for helping them have a great time in <em>The Final Shape</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="723" data-injectable="true">A thread with hundreds of comments on the<em> </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dddus7/i_think_its_safe_to_say_the_callthe_new_strand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Destiny 2</em> subreddit</a> shows just how much players appreciate The Call as a weapon and getting it so early. Many are comparing the rolls they got, which only add to this weapon’s power. User tne2008 explained, “My first one was subsistence and hatchling. I don’t think I’ve ever reloaded it manually. I don’t know if hatchling is the ideal roll but I love it.”</p>
 <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">Even those who didn’t realize how good The Call is until much later have chimed in. User JeanBoy stated, “I slept on The Call until I started struggling on the final boss fight of the legendary campaign lol. Switched to it with Graviton Lance/Hammerhead and was able to beat it on my third try. It’s now my go-to loadout!”</p> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="761" data-injectable="true">Right now, players are discussing what the best roll for The Call might be so they can craft the perfect version. I’d say tne2008’s was pretty good, but really, whatever perks work for your play style will be the best for you. What makes this Sidearm so useful is its Rocket-Assisted Frame Trait. This makes it fire self-propelled rocket ammunition, with projectiles that explode on impact for high damage. </p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">In practice, this is a tiny rocket launcher with projectiles that’ll seek out enemies if you fire close enough to them. It one-shots red bar enemies and almost wipes out stronger foes too. This weapon is what I lean on right now, and it helped me clear <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-the-pale-heart-location-leans-into-strangeness-and-wouldnt-look-out-of-place-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pale Heart</a>‘s Overthrow activities the five times required to unlock the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-the-dual-destiny-exotic-quest-in-destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dual Destiny Quest</a> in about four hours flat. </p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="false">I regularly have The Call drop as a reward, and you likely will as well. If you’re not currently using it but are playing through<em> The Final Shape</em>‘s content, check your inventory and equip it because it will save your bacon every time you sit down to play. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/new-world-aeternum-preview-its-still-mmo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world-aeternum-preview-its-still-an-mmo.900207/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/new-world-aeternum-preview-its-still-mmo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/new-world"><em>New World: Aeternum</em></a> feels a bit bizarrely familiar. Amazon’s recently revealed title is an enhanced edition of <em>New World</em>, and it’s probably best to think of it like a big 2.0 update—a realm reborn, if you will.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a seemingly big focus on making it a viable solo experience, with voice-acted cutscenes and dialog options. That illusion is pretty quickly shattered though, as I entered a shared world with other players roaming around, much like the hub worlds in Destiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent nearly an hour with <em>New World: Aeternum</em> at Summer Game Fest, playing it via a controller thanks to its upcoming console release. Within that time, I hit level 5 and unlocked quite a few abilities for my weapons, and it felt just like any other MMO, for better and for worse.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Swashbucklin’ in a New <em>New World</em></h2>
<p>In the character creator, I picked the Musketeer archetype, which gave me access to a rapier, a musket, and the stats to start off on the right foot. There were six other archetypes to choose from, though you can also allocate your points however you wish to as you level up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In true MMO fashion, waypoints constantly directed me to my next objective, eliciting a sort of autopilot mentality. It’s zen, in a way, but it’s also a bit mindless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combat is easily approachable, with light and heavy melee attacks dealing with most foes. There’s a block and dodge, and I could quickly swap to my musket and take fire using the triggers.</p>

<p>The more you use a weapon type, the more you unlock skill points for them, which can be cashed in for passive and active abilities. For example, I could unleash a quick flurry with the rapier or shoot a fire shot that immolated enemies. There’s even a passive that let me do more damage to a burning target.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’ve played some RPGs, none of this is particularly surprising or new. But being new both is and isn’t the goal for <em>New World: Aeternum</em>. It’s both the next step in <em>New World</em>’s live-service journey and a reason for new players to hop on, if they’re interested.</p>

<h2>An Aeternity of Looting&nbsp;</h2>
<p>I was initially pulled in by the idea that this could be a completely solo experience. I find it hard to get into MMOs personally, but the storytelling and cutscenes made it seem like something I could partake in without having to worry about some social hoops like guilds and raids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The voice acting here is serviceable and fun, though it won’t win any awards. Grace O’Malley, a roguish pirate, is charming in her own way, and Aelstrom has a gruffness to him that reminds me of Braum from <em>League of Legends</em> or <em>Overwatch</em>’s Reinhardt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it all sort of fell apart for me when the words all led to the same early-game MMO tropes we all know. You wash up on the shores of Aeternum, the Eternal Island where no one truly dies. Aelstrom commends you for conquering death and being born again, complimenting your strong soul.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the first thing he asks you to do is hunt some boar for food. After that? Hunt down and kill a few mobs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything takes time, too—you’ll see that circular timer show up for nearly everything. Picking up mats takes half a second. Crafting takes a couple seconds. Looting takes a couple seconds. After a while, whenever that circular UI element shows up, I couldn’t help but check out a little bit mentally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can’t speak to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-moving-to-seasonal-model-expansion-coming-this-fall"><em>New World</em>’s endgame or expansions</a> across its nearly three years of service, but Aeternum is shaping up to be a fresh jumping-on point for lots of newcomers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s opening up to new audiences on Xbox and PlayStation, and all of Amazon’s marketing is pushing it as an action RPG, not quite an MMO. Solo play is more emphasized, but I’m not convinced it’ll be a great solo experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you can roll credits without playing a single raid or expedition with real players, I’m sure there’s a slew of other dedicated single-player action RPGs that might be more worth your time.</p>

            <p>Xbox has announced a release date for Ara: History Untold.</p>
<p>The upcoming turn-based historical strategy title is set to launch on 24th September. On its debut, it will be available for Windows PC and Steam. The Xbox published title will arrive on day one for PC Game Pass, as well.</p>
<p>In addition, president of developer Oxide Games Marc Meyer and Head of Ara for Xbox Game Studios Brian Stone have shared more about what players can expect on the game's release later this year.</p>

<p>The duo showcased the game during an episode of the Official Xbox Podcast with an accompanying <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/12/ara-history-untold-release-date-multiplayer-details/">blog post</a>, where they spoke about leaders and the game's "living" map. They also spoke more on the Ara: History Untold multiplayer, with Oxide describing its gameplay as "Simultaneous Turns".</p>
<p>"The way that works is you submit your actions, and everyone else in the world submits their actions at the same time, and then they all get resolved together," Meyer explained. "It's not a situation where if you go first, you get to get the claim; the person who goes second doesn't get the claim. In this model, everyone goes at the same time. So, in multiplayer you really have a fair chance at everything."</p>
<p>Meyer said the team wanted to make sure it "removed all the barriers for multiplayer", meaning players will be able to "jump in and out of as many games as [they] want".</p>
<p>Said Meyer: "You can take your turn when you have time and wait until it gets submitted. If your friend decides he doesn't want to play anymore, an AI can come in and take over for him, it doesn't mean the end of your entire world if you're playing online and you don't want to do that, you can stop, and you don't have to worry about destroying the game for everyone else who's playing."</p>
<p>You can check out the full podcast via the video below. Here, the hosts also spoke more on Age of Mythology: Retold, which was announced earlier this week.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-playstation-handheld-capable-of-running-ps4-games-natively-would-be-very-hard-to-achieve.900192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-handheld-ps4-games-natively/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A PlayStation handheld console capable of running PS4 games natively would be very hard to achieve, mostly due to power draw and memory bandwidth, among other reasons.</p>
<p>Replying to a fan question regarding the rumored handheld, which is said to be in the works, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R41x68m1GXc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how a portable console capable of running PlayStation 4 games natively would be very hard to achieve due to power draw and the massive memory bandwidth of the system, 176 GB/s. In addition, such a portable system would require the use of a Jaguar CPU for compatibility, and there's nothing in the mobile space capable of providing these specs to run PS4 games natively.</p>
<p>A PlayStation handheld based on modern AMD architectures, however, could definitely run PS4 games, but they would have to be ported, which would significantly make the game library smaller. Such a system, however, would have no trouble running scaled-back PlayStation 5 games, taking a page from the Steam Deck and another modern handheld system that can run current AAA games by dropping settings and resolution. Still, Digital Foundry found the idea of a new handheld system from Sony to be a very good one, considering how well the remote play-focused PlayStation Portal sold worldwide.</p>
<p><iframe title="Could Sony Make A PS4-Compatible Portable?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R41x68m1GXc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As already mentioned, a PlayStation handheld is said to be in <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-handheld-amd-18-cus-1-8-ghz-gpu/">early development</a> by Sony. Powered by a custom AMD APU, this handheld is currently in the High Level Design Phase, meaning it is at least two years from release and has yet to be greenlit. Specs have yet to be finalized a swell, but it is said the system will use 18 CUs, and its GPU will likely run at 1.8 GHz or slower due to the PlayStation 5's variable clock speeds.</p>
<p>Following the PlayStation Vita, which could have been much more successful with better support thanks to its great hardware at the time, Sony left the handheld market, only to return to it somewhat with the aforementioned PlayStation Portal. You can learn more about the system in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/">review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/todays-helldivers-2-patch-is-obscenely-large-and-fans-are-loving-it/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=todays-helldivers-2-patch-is-obscenely-large-and-fans-are-loving-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="472" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">To call the latest <em>Helldivers 2</em> patch big is an understatement. Even calling it chunky doesn’t feel apt enough, with the patch notes going into explicit detail on various balancing updates to weapons and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-stratagem-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stratagems</a>, bug fixes, and the supply lines between planets are actually visible now. While Patch 01.000.400 has only launched today, early responses from fans suggest Arrowhead is taking things in the right direction, with some calling it a big win for players.</p> <p data-characters="779" data-current-count="779" data-injectable="true">I’m not going to cover the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4150709804553746157?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full patch notes</a> because, again, there’s simply too much, but one of Arrowhead’s key goals was to better balance the Stratagems. As such, some of the weaker options have received buffs to make them more viable. For instance, the Orbital Precision Strike has had both its call time and cooldown reduced, making it easier to use against moving targets. A wide array of regular weapons have seen buff too, like the Heavy Machine Gun. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/5998312279129319530?l=english**" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a separate blog post</a> detailing the rationale behind all the Stratagem and weapon adjustments, chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt explains how the Heavy Machine Gun “failed to deliver on the fantasy,” which is why its rate of fire has been lowered and it deals more damage than before.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="811" data-injectable="true">Perhaps one of the most welcome changes is the inclusion of visible supply lines. Despite being an important mechanic that dictate which planets players can actually go to, you initially couldn’t see them. Arrowhead says this was to avoid the Galactic War map getting too cluttered, but “based on the feedback from our community we have made an implementation showing them on the map.

            <p>
Sonic Dream Team has received another update, adding additional levels and an endgame mission.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-3d-platformer-sonic-dream-team-announced-by-sega">Apple Arcade exclusive was released in December last year</a>, but developer Hardlight has continued to update the game ever since.
</p>
<p>
Previous updates added the Sweet Dreams Zones as a bonus for completing the main adventure. This new update adds two new Acts to the zone, with new level features and new takes on missions.

</figure>
<p>

Further, a new endgame mission has been added called Bittersweet Way, available for players who collect all Dream Orbs and Moons. It promises to be the most challenging level so far.
</p>
<p>
New achievements and competitive rankings have also been added alongside these new levels, plus collectible music tracks are unlocked via hidden musical notes across the game's levels.
</p>
<p>
Sonic fans should absolutely get on Sonic Dream Team, despite it being a mobile game. It comes highly recommended as a full 3D Sonic adventure with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-dream-team-puts-players-in-exhilarating-flow-state-says-studio-head">great skatepark-esque level design</a> and a brilliant soundtrack.
</p>
<p>
It's playable across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Vision Pro.

            <p>
Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Konami's forthcoming remake, will have a visual filter to recreate the look of the original game.
</p>
<p>
On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDCppzRLwpw&amp;rco=1">Xbox podcast</a>, producer Noriaka Okamura discussed more about the game and confirmed the Legacy control style "applies a visual filter to more faithfully recreate the screen look of the original game".
</p>
<p>
Konami has since confirmed to Eurogamer this visual filter can be applied to either control style, meaning players can use modernised controls with the classic filter. More information is expected soon.

<p>

As Metal Gear Solid fan account Perfect Stealth noted on X, this visual filter was hinted at on the Konami website with a short clip for the Legacy Style controls.

<p>
While the development team at Konami is using Unreal Engine 5 for high-fidelity graphics (as discussed on the Xbox podcast), fans have criticised the visuals for lacking the same colour palette and tone as the original.
</p>
<p>
One thread on X uses gifs to directly compare the remake with the original to see the difference.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
But is a visual filter enough? While it certainly adds a certain warmth to the graphics, it's unclear if other visual effects used as an artistic choice will be included.
</p>
<p>
In a video from Konami this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-leaks-as-producer-wants-fans-to-hold-team-to-account">Okamura asked fans to hold the team to account</a>.

</p>
<p>
"We want the players to be able to judge for themselves whether this new team is right for the job of keeping Metal Gear going," he said. "So please, keep watching, and keep us honest."
</p>
<p>
The visual filter is certainly a welcome addition, but I've no doubt passionate fans will continue to share their thoughts.

The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> lets you and up to three great mates fill the ectoplasm-stained tactical boots worn by members of the ‘paranormal SWAT’, where you’ll explore large maps and try to contain strange goings on.

<p>The game looks to be stuffed with creepy pasta and conspiracy theory-esque paranormal shenanigans. Back when the game was called Hornet, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-cyberpunk-and-bioshock-devs-reveal-eerie-post-apocalyptic-open-world-shooter-hornet">Edwin wrote</a> about its ARG marketing campaign, which included a ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/LJ15D9r_awQ">found footage</a>’ video and a <a href="https://www.anomaleaks.net/">mock conspiracy theory</a> website named AnomaLeaks. I must say, I do enjoy this sort of thing. Does anyone remember those choose your adventure books you’d get with audio tapes and other paraphernalia where you’d have to piece the story together? There was a semi-famous one with werewolves, I believe.</p>
<p>Phantom Line does not, at time of writing, appear to feature werewolves, and looks to be going more for slow build, exploration, horror-with-mates vibes. But what it lacks in big dogs, it makes up for in pedigree. The line-up at Antistatic include former Cyberpunk 2077 writer Lukasz Ludkowski and Kris Teper, former Bioshock series lead environment artist. I’ve also just noticed they’ve described the studio as "committed to…the immersive sim genre.” And now I’m suddenly extremely interested, mark for piling crates on top of each other that I am.</p>

			<p>According to The Coalition's Matt Searcy, the story of the upcoming Gears of War E-Day will best show the tech that the team has been working on.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement of E-Day</a> during the Xbox Showcase last week came as a surprise to many - most of us didn't see a prequel title coming following the events of Gears 5. The trailer that Microsoft and developer The Coalition debuted during the showcase was impressive, to say the least, and it was all in-game as well. Of course, we don't know whether the footage was shown running on PC or Xbox Series, but the trailer was, without a doubt, stunning. Interestingly enough, some months back, reputable insider Nate Najda, mostly known as shinobi602, already <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-6-might-appear-at-xbox-showcase-people-arent-ready-for-how-good-it-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that people would be impressed with what The Coalition would show off with the next Gears.</p>
<p>As said, many didn't expect a sequel from The Coalition, but according to the studio's Creative Director Matt Searcy, the tech that the team had been working on, will best come into its own via E-day's story. "Making games is really hard,” the Creative Director told Console Creatures in a recent interview. “There’s a lot of investment that you do. And when you find the idea that lit us up at this moment, even if you’re talking about your strategies and games and trilogies and what you could do or not do. You grab that lightning in a bottle. That’s the game everybody is hyped about. We’re gonna make that game.</p>
<p>He continued, "Because it’s gonna be the best fucking <em>Gears</em> game everybody’s ever played, if we make that one. We had this technology that we were working on. This is the story that’s gonna showcase it the best. I think it’s really, at the end of the day, it’s about, again, it’s not Nicole and I making this call. There’s a whole studio of people that are invested in this idea. And you go, “Hell yeah, let’s do that then."</p>
<p>Whether Gears of War E-Day will indeed turn out to be the best Gears game to date remains to be seen (after all, that's what developers always say about their upcoming titles), but going by the game's trailer, E-Day has great potential.</p>
<p>Gears of War: E-Day is coming to Xbox Series and PC on a yet-to-be-announced date.</p>

Will Arrowhead manage to walk the tightrope of shifting the game’s weapon, Strategem and enemy power around? Or will the community hate it merely for the fact that things have changed and the go-to loadouts aren’t quite as effective anymore?</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/">accompanying explainer post</a>, Arrowhead CCO Johan Pilestedt said, “First, I want to thank you, the community, for clearly voicing your opinions and concerns for the balance and fun of the game. […] With these balance changes we wanted to buff up some of the weaker stratagems to make them more viable and add more opportunity for variety in loadouts. We also changed a few to make them more consistent, but the goal was to keep a similar or higher power level.”</p>


<p>This means that various Sentry turrets are getting improvements to power and durability, orbital strikes are being made better for moving targets, while the Eruptor’s shrapnel removal is being compensated for with higher damage.</p>
<p>There’s also some functional changes, so supply lines and attack origins are now visible in the Galactic War, and you can create invite-only lobbies.</p>
<p>Here’s the full Helldivers 1.000.400 patch notes:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Updated Recoil stance modifiers:</strong> We made changes to the recoil stance modifiers to make them more consistent and also reward being prone more. Almost all of them will improve the recoil and only a two have been made worse (and only by 10%).<br>
See the blogpost for a more detailed description.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01J08E30YDPTR29HECYMT2QD96"><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Removed operation modifier AA-Defenses: Reducing the stratagem slots by 1
<ul>
<li>We want to look over the operation modifiers in the future. Right now there are too few of them which become repetitive and the ones we have do not create variety or promote different playstyles. For now, we removed this one because it only encourages the players to bring the best stratagems and does not promote variety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disabled the Retrieve Essential Personnel defend event mission for the time being
<ul>
<li>This is to give the mission the proper attention and care that it deserves as it is now deemed not fun enough or performing as we want it to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Super Samples
<ul>
<li>Super samples now spawn on difficulty 6. The reason for this change is that we feel that their existence only on difficulty 7+ forced some players to play the game on a harder difficulty than they wanted to comfortably play on. We do however still want a gating of them but a less punishing one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The SEAF Artillery stratagem is no longer blocked by stratagem jammers or Ion Storms, and is available after the mission timer ends and the destroyer leaves close orbit.</li>
<li>Enemies in melee range of the gates in the Evacuate High-Value Assets mission will now attack it more consistently.</li>
<li>Added the ability to chat from in-game menus and mission loading screen.</li>
<li>Updated some first person crosshairs to improve readability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Invite-Only lobbies are now supported</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Armors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New armor passive Peak Physique (+50% melee damage, +30% weapon ergonomics)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Planets &amp; Hazards</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spike Plant
<ul>
<li>The spike plant that appears on certain planets has been reworked.</li>
<li>No longer causes bleed or stamina drain if hit by the plant explosion or spikes.</li>
<li>Now “pops” three times sending spikes everywhere, dealing increased damage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fire Tornados
<ul>
<li>Fire tornados have had their behavior changed, they should no longer feel like they actively respond to player movement, and should move more randomly.</li>
<li>While a fire tornado storm takes place, enemy vision is reduced. Player vision is unaffected.
<ul>
<li>Fire tornados being more random should result in more variance in situations players find themselves in. Tornados are significantly less likely to pile up and overlap on extraction points or objectives, and will generally be a bit easier to deal with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tremors
<ul>
<li>Tremors have had their spawning tweaked to be slightly more random.</li>
<li>Tremors have had their epicenter size and effect range increased.
<ul>
<li>These changes should result in more situations where enemies away from the player get stunned, as well as reducing how consistently the player has a tremor occur next to them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Visibility
<ul>
<li>A lot of planets have had their fog amounts tweaked to be a bit less harsh and dense, to provide less fatigue from constantly fighting on planets with bad visibility. We still intend there to be foggy planets with worse visibility, but the balance was a bit off.
<ul>
<li>Desert planets such as Erata Prime, Chort Bay, Hellmire, and similar.</li>
<li>Highlands planets such as Varylia 5, Matar Bay, Oshaune, and similar.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Artificial light sources have had their intensity rebalanced and reduced across the board to fix situations of lights completely blinding the player.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unexploded Hellbomb
<ul>
<li>The unexploded malfunctioning hellbombs that can sometimes be found on planets will now explode immediately if hit with strong explosions or heavy weaponry. They will still have the same delay if hit by small arms fire or weaker attacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Vegetation
<ul>
<li>Vegetation that’s large enough to slow the player now has an extra function. When inside the vegetation helldivers will be harder to detect, reducing their detection range by enemies. This effect stacks with other detection reducing effects such as nighttime, being crouched or prone, or things such as the scout armor passive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ion Storms
<ul>
<li>Added additional VFX for Ion Storms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enemies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Acid effect
<ul>
<li>The acid effect applied by hunters, bug mines, etc. now allows you to sprint while under the effect and slows you by 30% instead of 50%. Duration has been increased from 3 to 4 seconds. These changes are intended to make it less punishing for players to be slowed while fighting the Terminids, This allows us to use it in more places without making the experience very punishing, for example the Bile Spewers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Armored enemy balance
<ul>
<li>We have toned down the amount of heavily armored enemies like Bile Titans, Chargers on higher difficulties and instead spawn more hordes of smaller enemies, the difference should be quite noticeable and the amount should be at least 30% less than before during bug breaches. We have also toned down slightly how many Hulks that spawn for the Automatons. Our intent is to ease up on the demand of anti-tank weapons and by having more of the other enemies give a better incentive for the group to bring stratagems and weapons that take care of hordes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Patrols
<ul>
<li>Patrol spawning is now back to how it worked before patch 01.000.300 with some slight tweaks so that the levels are less empty if you are far away from important locations with enemy presence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Stunning
<ul>
<li>Medium and large sized enemies now don’t get stunned as easily. This will not affect the stratagems that stun, and will mostly just affect how easily the Pummeler can stun larger enemies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Terminids</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bile Spewers &amp; Nursing Spewers
<ul>
<li>Spewers will now get slowed if they lose their legs.</li>
<li>Spewer puke now applies the acid effect.</li>
<li>Spewer puke now can only damage helldivers up to 4 times per second and the helldiver cannot take damage multiple times from the same projectile. This should reduce instances where you are instantly killed by it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bile Titan
<ul>
<li>The Bile Titan’s head is slightly less durable against weaker anti-tank weapons. It’s not a large change, and will mostly matter for weapons like the railgun.</li>
<li>The Bile Titan’s puke can now only damage the helldiver 4 times per second and the helldiver cannot take damage multiple times from the same projectile. The damage is still very deadly so running through their puke is not recommended. Their puke now also has a bigger spread.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Charger Behemoth
<ul>
<li>The Charger Behemoth is now joining the battle on higher difficulties, it can now also take more damage than before. This enables us to spawn fewer chargers but still retain the difficulty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Chargers
<ul>
<li>Will now only show bleedout effects from the body if the bleedout state has started. It can still show bleedout effects from the mouth without having started the bleedout state.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Automatons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hulk Scorcher
<ul>
<li>The Hulk’s flamethrower now does less damage and cannot damage helldivers more than 4 times per second. In addition, the helldiver cannot be damaged multiple times by the same flame projectile. This should reduce instances where you are instantly killed by it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Automaton Tanks
<ul>
<li>The Tank armor value on the front has been lowered to be the same as the non-vent sections on the rear of the tank. The intent was initially that it was supposed to be more armored in the front, but the visual language did not show that.</li>
<li>The vents on the back of the Tanks turret still has the same armor value as before, but will check for explosion directions correctly now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The damage of exploding automaton jump packs has been decreased by 50%, it will still set you on fire though.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Galactic War</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introducing Supply Lines &amp; Origin of Attacks:</strong></p>
<p>Supply lines were previously not shown on the Galactic War map to reduce clutter and improve readability. However based on the feedback from our community we have made an implementation showing them on the map. This solution tries to maintain the general readability while still exposing the system to players in game.</p>
<p>You will now also be able to see which planet an attack is originating from, potentially allowing for the community to stop the attack at its source.</p>
<p>We have also updated visuals in the sector and planet info pop-ups.</p>
<h2 id="h_01J08E30YDHXSCEXCWY0BE8K4Y"><strong>Fixes</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The FAF-14 Spear targeting has been reworked and should now function much better. However it has lost the ability to target Automaton spawners, this is not intended and will be fixed in the future.</li>
<li>Intense Heat and Extreme Cold environmental modifiers will now affect the Quasar Cannon’s reload speed and will show correctly in the HUD.
<ul>
<li>Reload speed on Cold planets -2.5 sec</li>
<li>Reload speed on Hot planets +2.5 sec</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The radar pulse that detects enemies on the mini-map is now visible.</li>
<li>Most of Automatons weapons have now gotten tighter limits to how much the projectile they shoot can deviate from its weapons muzzle angle. What this means is that situations where devastators shoot sideways and similar should be fixed.</li>
<li>The weapons of the Exosuits are now allowed small adjustments in the angle they fire their projectiles versus their muzzle angle. This should make their weapons more accurate.</li>
<li>Ballistic shield now collides with grenades.</li>
<li>The unblock button should no longer disappear from the social menu.</li>
<li>Blocked players can no longer join the blockers lobby through recent players.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where enemies killed, missions played, and missions completed stats would not be properly displayed in armory.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the player can throw an unlimited amount of grenades by pressing the “Quick grenade” button right after closing the Stratagem menu.
<ul>
<li>Helldiver now also switches to the last active weapon when out of grenades, fixing the issue where they would be holding a stratagem ball without the stratagem menu being open.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed some text overlap in various locations.</li>
<li>The burning effect applied to the player when a combat walker dies is now a normal burn. The intent is that you should be able to escape it alive. But you will be on fire so hit the ground!</li>
<li>The extraction shuttle can no longer take damage preventing extraction. New high grade materials directly from Super Earth R&amp;D have been utilized.</li>
<li>On PC you can now navigate the super credits menu with “WASD” keys</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where sample count in missions were incorrectly displayed</li>
<li>Levels no longer generate with blocked areas preventing player progression.</li>
<li>Your Ships bridge is no longer cast in perpetual shadow.</li>
<li>Reduced situations where blue stratagems would bounce when placed next to the detector tower.</li>
<li>The warbond menu now displays correct emote &amp; victory poses in the thumbnail.</li>
<li>War Medals cap is now displayed in the UI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Helldivers armor could appear invisible for other players.</li>
<li>Refined player reporting UI.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Helldivers could be launched into the air if close to a Bile Titan or Factory Strider corpse.</li>
<li>Fix for Factory Strider sometimes spawned an extra model after being destroyed.</li>
<li>Reduced situations where helldivers could spontaneously die while walking into seemingly walkable valleys on some planets.</li>
<li>Fixed rare issue on arctic planets where players could spontaneously die close to large bodies of water.</li>
<li>Fixed Pelican-1 sometimes leaving immediately after any player gets onboard.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where helldiver could get stuck in grenade idle state after throwing grenades</li>
<li>Fix Superior Packing Methodology not working for other peers.</li>
<li>Recent Players list will now include hot-joining players.</li>
<li>Relaxed disconnection policy for PC users.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where previous sessions’ player names might not be saved correctly when restarting.</li>
<li>Defend event attack origin now visualized when hovering the planet with the defend event or the attack origin planet.</li>
<li>Implemented outlines for previously poorly readable texts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crash Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>General crash fixes.</li>
<li>Fix for a crash that could occur when applying wounds to multiple enemies.</li>
<li>PlayStation Only: Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause a crash when switching between Quality and Performance mode.</li>
<li>Fix for a crash when a player leaves after all their railguns have exploded.</li>
<li>Fix for crash that could occur when rejoining a previous session</li>
<li>Fix for crash that occurred when trying to throw a snowball in ADS mode</li>
<li>Fix for potential crash when loadout is aborted during hotjoin.</li>
<li>Fix for rare crash linked to leaving a session while aiming a weapon.</li>
</ul>

            <p>
Fans of the 1993 film Jurassic Park will be able to revisit many locations from Isla Nublar on Jurassic Park: Survival's release, but also some previously unseen spots.
</p>
<p>
Jurassic Park: Survival was announced at last year's Game Awards. It's a single-player action-adventure coming from Saber Interactive in partnership with Universal, and will take place the day after the events of the film. 
</p>
<p>
The announcement trailer, which you can see for yourself below, showed us poor scientist Dr. Maya Joshi running from the now-destroyed visitor centre before coming face-to-face with a mighty T-Rex. Other than this brief tease, further details were quite sparse.

</figure>
<p>
Now, however, the Jurassic Park: Survival team has revealed a few more tit-bits about the upcoming game. Sharing details with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-fresh-jurassic-park-survival-details-revealed-including-new-locations-and-more">IGN</a>, Universal Products and Experiences executive producer John Melchior and Saber Interactive creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick said the team has been "working with all our stakeholders on what the island would have looked like after the events of the film".
</p>
<p>
Melchior said this will include locales such as the Visitor Centre, but also other areas the film didn't include. "Those on the island were supposed to be there overnight, so what does that mean? What would they have seen and where would they have stayed if everything went according to plan? That is where we are starting," he said. "One thing is certain - the island is as much a part of the story as the characters and dinosaurs."
</p>
<p>
Hollis-Leick said players will have to negotiate  "different types of terrain" on Isla Nublar, with many of them being quite challenging. "The player will need to use caution and planning in some cases, checking routes in advance," he said. 
</p>
<p>
"There will also be times when the player will need to move very carefully through an environment to avoid the attention of certain predators. Maya, the main character, is neither superhuman nor an action hero. There are real risks for her around every corner and the player will need to use a mixture of intelligence, grit and patience to survive the island's many challenges."
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, while we only saw Maya in the announcement trailer, the Jurassic Park: Survival developers said there will be other characters introduced on the game's release, as well as perhaps some new 'special' dinos. As Melchior noted: "Life finds a way..."
</p>
<p>
Jurassic Park: Survival does not have a release date yet, although we know it won't be out this year. When it does ultimately launch, it will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-your-flares-jurassic-park-survival-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc">coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.

            <p>
Mental Salvo describes itself as having an "infinite open world" in which you can do so many things, "they're impossible to list". Were this a game from a triple-A publisher, I'd be heading down to their compound with some powerful magnets and cannisters of highly concentrated acid to wipe out their ungodly creation before it replaces the fundamental particles of our universe with waypoints. But Mental Salvo is actually the work of new indie imaginini (yes, no capital-I), and is a "top down art adventure with light RPG elements" that is perhaps a bit ZANY but also, refreshingly playful in essentially being about poking a big white screen to see what tumbles out of it.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Here are some things that might tumble out of it: opinionated cats. A gun that shoots words. Unspecified things that depend upon the time of day. Concentric rings of doors. A trolley seemingly adapted from the widespread internet sketch of the trolley problem. A large... deer... thing? Some events or entities can't be seen, but will still respond to your presence. Your objective, amid all this, is to travel far enough away from spawn to find "something special". If the cats and trolleys grow overwhelming, you can always make your character's head explode to reset the simulation.
</p>
<p>
Mental Salvo is the first in a series of "Figmental" games from developer Pawel Pachniewski, whose other works include the Bennet Foddy-esque platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2164500/99_Fails/">99 Fails</a>, which I wrote about for little-known RPS offshoot PCGamer back in the day. It should be noted that Pachniewski has a research interest in modern generative AI software, but his interest appears to be more "we can do absurdist philosophical experiments with these tools" than "we can use these tools to optimise/reposition 10 percent of our art department into the gutter". Here's a cut from a <a href="https://x.com/pwlot/status/1794699445080088813">twittering</a> digging into Mental Salvo's origins:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
It's part hand-crafted and part procedural, but the procedural part is using very advanced AI (let's just say, that there is a meta-agent that inventso [sic] some of the procedures on the fly, but there's much more to it) which means not even I can predict what's in it. Semantically though and with respect to what I put in, it's a visceral, emotional, but also cerebral experience.. where you can endlessly explore topics and indulge in experiences...from my consciousness stream, work, from the world, and more. It's also part parody, part commentary,... on existence, meaning, the world, gaming, AI, consciousness.. and beyond. I'm really excited about it as I have prototyped and worked on several iterations and candidates of various games from this series since 2013(!), including a trip generator of sorts (probably next), but due to various life circumstances and other projects, I abandoned them. Not this time. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Mental Salvo is technically out in August, though I guess you could argue that being infinite, it has always existed. Questions of tense mean nothing to Mental Salvo. What we call 'spacetime' is but an outspoken feline scurrying across the grinning face of its quantum immensity. Anyway, if you dig the purgatorial whitespace aesthetics here but need a bit more structure, I heartily recommend <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sixty-four-is-a-very-elegant-abstract-factory-sim-with-sinister-depths">Sixty Four</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phantom-blade-zero-is-not-a-soulslike-game-demo-won%E2%80%99t-release-anytime-soon.900153/</guid>

			<p>Phantom Blade Zero, the impressive Unreal Engine 5-powered action RPG in development by S-Game recently showed off during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-trailer-summer-game-fest-2024/">Summer Game Fest 2024 show</a>, is not a Soulslike game, although the experience has been somewhat influenced by FromSoftware's series.</p>
<p>Game Director Soulframe provided a development update earlier this week on<a href="https://x.com/pbzero_official/status/1800646449690034320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1800646449690034320%7Ctwgr%5Ed78764866fc6c2aa52b4ce8eb3b7754840f196fd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmultiplayer.it%2Fnotizie%2Fphantom-blade-zero-non-sara-un-soulslike-e-altri-dettagli-dagli-sviluppatori.html"> X/Twitter</a>, revealing how, as those who had the chance to try out the SGF24 demo surely noticed, the game is not a Soulslike, as that was never the plan. The developer wanted to create "combo-driven, heart-pumping combat" that was hectic, rewarding, and exhilarating, which is exactly the opposite of the combat featured in games inspired by FromSoftware's games. The Soulslike inspiration for Phantom Blade Zero is limited to map design, as the game's locations will feature multiple paths, hidden nooks, and so on. The game will also feature difficulty options, and defeated enemies won't respawn after dying or interacting with checkpoints. Unfortunately, it will be a while until the vast majority of players will be able to try out this Phantom Blade Zero, as the demo available during Summer Game Fest 2024 is not ready for a wider release due to technical issues.</p>
<p>In the new update, the Phantom Blade Zero game director also reiterated how the game is not a PlayStation 5 exclusive, as the studio has no deal in place with Sony. As such, it will also be released on PC.</p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero launches on PlayStation 5 and PC on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date.

            <p>
FragPunk, the new hero shooter revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase earlier this week, will have a closed alpha test on Steam at the end of the month.
</p>
<p>
The five-versus-five free-to-play online shooter is vibrantly stylised with a card-based twist, where players include shard cards in their loadout to modify the rules of gameplay.
</p>
<p>
News of the alpha comes alongside an extended trailer you can watch below.
</p>

<p>
Developer Bad Guitar boasts FragPunk is "endlessly replayable" thanks to its selection of heroes, weapons and maps, but mainly its shard cards.
</p>
<p>
The alpha test will include 70 of the shard cards, which as per the trailer include flipping the world upside down, dragon's breath to power up weapons, adding an electrifying chain reaction to bullets, slicing projectiles as a blade master, sprouting long grass or strange plants, giving opponents a big head for easier kills, and more.
</p>
<p>
There will also be 10 playable heroes with unique abilities, four playable maps, and 15 weapons to wield in the alpha test.
</p>
<p>
The alpha test will run from 27th June until 1st July, with a focus on North America. Registration is open on the <a href="https://www.fragpunk.com/#/">game's website</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943650/FragPunk/">Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
FragPunk is set for full release in 2025 across Xbox Series X/S and PC, so this alpha test provides a very early look.

            <p>
Sony is rolling out the ability to join Discord calls from your PlayStation 5 without relying on the service's PC or mobile apps.
</p>
<p>
This means you can now use the Discord tab in the PS5 Control Center to access a Discord server or DM group directly, and from there pick from the available voice channels to join. 
</p>
<p>
You might not see the option available today - Sony says it is rolling out first in Japan, before Europe, Australia/New Zealand, the Middle East and finally the Americas in the coming weeks. See how it all looks in the video below:

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-voice-chat-now-available-on-playstation-5">PlayStation initially added Discord integration a year ago</a>, though until now it hasn't been a seamless process - requiring you to transfer calls over from the separate Discord app.</p>
<p>
One other new feature coming to PS5 from this week is the ability to share your PSN profile to quickly connect with others. You can generate a shareable link from your console or the PlayStation App and then send it to a friend via any other messaging service.
</p>
<p>
It's been a busy time for PlayStation, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-is-a-perfect-match-a-breezy-light-hearted-approach-the-series-has-perhaps-always-needed">recently shown off Lego Horizon Adventures for the first time</a> - a bold new take on its blockbuster franchise that's also coming to Nintendo Switch.

        <p>“We believe Valve Corporation has been unfairly shutting out competition for PC games”</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>In what is possibly the biggest scandal the UK has seen since the last time the price of Freddos went up, a digital rights campaigner is suing Valve for £656m in compensation, accusing the company of overcharging and anti-competitive behaviour. The accompanying <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/">website</a> describes the collective action claim as a “ground-breaking legal action,” which is very gamer of them. 16 times the litigation, etc.</p>

<p>“Valve Corporation faces a £656 million collective action claim for overcharging 14 million PC gamers and abusing its dominant position in the UK,” reads the website. “We believe Valve Corporation has been unfairly shutting out competition for PC games and in-game content, which has meant that UK customers have paid too much for these products,” it continues, also accusing the “gaming giant” of “charging an excessive commission – of up to 30% – to publishers.”</p>
<p>If the claim is successful, then you - yes, you! - could be eligible for up to £44 in compensation, if you’re based in the UK and have bought either a game or “add-on game content” since the 5th of June 2018. The total £656 million appears to come from the 14 million UK based PC gamers the website alleges “could” have been overcharged by Valve. Here’s a look at the ‘key stats’ on the site. Cowardly move not to go full hog and make it look like an RPG character sheet, honestly.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>steamyouoweus</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is all being headed up by digital-rights activist Vicki Shotbolt and legal firm Milberg London LLP. The firm were also involved in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-for-5bn-for-ripping-people-off-on-playstation-store">£5bn lawsuit against Sony</a> in 2022, who they alleged “ripped people off” by charging a 30% commission on PlayStation Store purchases. Valve themselves faced a similar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-lawsuit-accuses-valve-of-abusing-steam-market-power-to-prevent-price-competition">antitrust class action legal-me-doo</a> in 2021, though that appears to have gone nowhere.</p>
<p>As both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-for-5bn-for-ripping-people-off-on-playstation-store">Eurogamer</a> and the website’s FAQ point out, this current story could take years before anything more of note happens. Personally speaking, maybe there’s something in that 30% publisher commission being a touch high, but I’ve got no idea how much it realistically takes to keep something like Steam running.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-ps5-system-update-24-04-09-40-00-discord/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has started to deploy PS5 system update 24.04-09.40.00, allowing players to start or join Discord voice chat directly from their PS5 console.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/13/ps5-players-will-soon-be-able-to-join-discord-voice-chat-directly-from-their-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official blog post</a> on the PS Blog, the new firmware will be rolled out over the coming weeks, starting for PS5 owners in Japan and Asia, followed by those in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and the US. We can confirm, however, that the new system update has already been rolled out in Europe.</p>
<p>Support for Discord was already available on Sony's console, but this latest update makes it easier for players to access voice chat by allowing direct access to voice chat from the PS5 console. As such, players will no longer have to rely on using applications or Discord PC to start or join Discord voice chat.</p>
<h2><strong><em>How to join Discord voice chat on PS5</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>To start, select the Discord tab in Game Base within the PS5 Control Center and choose the Discord server or DM group you’d like to join. Then, select your preferred voice channel. This will reveal more details, such as who is already in the channel chatting. You’ll also receive a PS5 console notification when another Discord user calls you, allowing you to join right away.</em></p>
<p>In addition to making access to Discord easier, PS5 system update 24.04-09.40.00 also allows PS5 child accounts to link and add third-party services as well as apps for the PSN account. Also, the new firmware version includes improvements the device software for the PULSE Elite wireless headset, PULSE Explore wireless earbuds, and PlayStation Link USB adapter.</p>
<p>As always with Sony's system updates, this new one once again further improves the PS5's system software performance and stability. You can check out the full release notes <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for this new system update here</a>. Interestingly enough, Sony's official blog post mentions the option to share a PlayStation Network profile on any messaging or social app, but the official release notes don't mention this new option.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 is available worldwide now. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> last month, more than 59.2 million PS5 consoles have been sold globally since the console's launch back in November of 2020.</p>

			<p>A new Assassin’s Creed Valhalla AMD FSR 3.0 Frame Generation mod has been released online, bringing considerable performance improvements in a variety of scenarios.</p>
<p>The new mod, developed by well-known modder PureDark, brings considerably better performance, more than double in most benchmark scenarios, in conjunction with the FSR 3.0 Performance setting on a ROG Ally, as shown by the modder in a new test video. Unfortunately, the mod is not available for free right now and is only available for <a href="https://www.patreon.com/PureDark">Patreon supporters.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Valhalla FSR3 on ROG Ally" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnZXt02JjQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-nvidia-dlss-3-rtx/">Last month</a>, PureDark also released an Assassin’s Creed Valhalla NVIDIA DLSS 3, which supports both Super Resolution and Frame Generation, which work extremely well. NVIDIA Reflex support also ensures that input delay is kept as low as possible.</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is the latest main entry in the open-world series by Ubisoft. Released back in 2020, the game was later expanded with multiple expansions, although the base game is already a massive experience, as well as an enjoyable one, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-once-sent-from-the-golden-hall/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla is a definite step up for the series, thanks to the many tweaks made to the RPG mechanics that powered the previous two entries in the series, better storytelling, great atmosphere, and meaningful side-content. Even with the tweaks, however, Assassin's Creed Valhalla is still an Assassin's Creed game at heart, so those who are not into the Ubisoft open-world game design will hardly change their opinion with the game. Everyone else will probably love every second of Eivor's adventure, especially if they are into Vikings and ancient Norse culture.</em></p>

<p id="4Ial3w">Developers Niantic and Capcom have confirmed new weapon types will continue to be added to the game as seasons progress, so for those familiar with the main series, hopefully your favorites will roll out before too long.</p>

<p id="cnL5X3">To begin with, you’ll only have access to the Sword and Shield, albeit with multiple variations by forging together parts from slaying large <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23635999">monsters</a>.</p>
<p id="6LkBCI">To unlock new weapon types in <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, <strong>you must progress through the main story quest. </strong>In Chapter 2, you’ll first unlock three more weapons, and just a few steps later, you’ll get the remaining roster of weapons.</p>
<p id="wDSasH">Specifically, you need to reach the following points in the story:</p>
<ul>
<li id="MBNPmT">
<strong>To unlock the Great Sword, Dual Blades, and Lance,</strong> complete the first stage of “Chapter 2: Shimmering Swamp” in the main story.</li>
<li id="dvtNST">
<strong>To unlock the Bow, Hammer, Light Bowgun, and Long Sword, </strong>reach <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23635639">Hunter Rank 15</a>.</li>
<li id="st0AFM">
<strong>Finally, weapons added in seasons (Dual Blades, Lance, Charge Blade, Gunblade), </strong>will be available automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p id="t3bUId">These pre-requisites aren’t too far into your <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> journey — requiring just a few hours of play. Of course, that might be staggered out depending on how much you’re able to explore, with many story steps based on collecting resources, which will be limited if you are playing in just a single spot.</p>
<p id="WbFHQk">Meanwhile, though large monsters do spawn frequently on your stationary position, making use of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23632412">paintballs</a> for when you need to complete large monster steps quickly is advised.</p>
<hr id="0dnbjL">
<h2 id="ahiZBC"><strong>When will new weapon types arrive in Monster Hunter Now?</strong></h2>
<p id="aquF4D">New weapon types — alongside new monsters and story updates — will be coming to <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> as part of major quarterly updates.</p>
<p id="Kn6IO1">The first of these was “Fulminations in the Frost,” arriving Dec. 2023, which introduced the Dual Blades and Lance.</p>
<p id="04Xnzy">The iconic Charge Blade was added in March 2024 as part of the “The Vernal Invader” update, while the Gunblade was added in June 2024’s “Dancing in the Tempest”.</p>
<p id="AZNwEA">From here, expect more weapons to be rolled out in subsequent updates.</p>

<p>PlayStation has announced that Discord voice chat will finally make its way to the PlayStation 5 directly. </p>



<p>In its new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/13/ps5-players-will-soon-be-able-to-join-discord-voice-chat-directly-from-their-console/?sf273538206=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog update</a>, PlayStation has announced that players will soon be able to join Discord voice chat directly from the PS5 console, without relying on the Discord PC or mobile apps to initiate the connection. Previously, players had to manually transfer calls to their PlayStation 5 from their Discord app using a PS or mobile. </p>



<p>According to the blog, the update will roll out in the “coming weeks,” starting with players in Japan/Asia, followed by Europe, Australia/New Zealand, the Middle East, and finally, the Americas.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-join-discord-voice-chat-on-ps5">How to join Discord voice chat on PS5</h2>



<p>To start, select the Discord tab in Game Base within the PS5 Control Center and choose the Discord server or DM group you’d like to join. Then, select your preferred voice channel. This will reveal more details, such as who is already in the channel chatting. You’ll also receive a PS5 console notification when another Discord user calls you, allowing you to join right away.</p>



<p>This update will make it easier than ever to quickly hop into Discord conversations with other gamers. It will gradually roll out over the coming weeks, starting with players in Japan/Asia, followed by Europe, Australia/New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally the Americas.</p>



<p>Please note that you will need to&nbsp;update your console&nbsp;to the latest system software, and your accounts for PlayStation Network and Discord must be linked. If you haven’t yet linked accounts, you can learn how to do so&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playstation.com/support/subscriptions/link-psn-status-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>



<p>Will you be using Discord on your PlayStation 5? Let us know down in the comments below!</p>

<p data-characters="252" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The day has finally arrived. After three years of Epic Games Store exclusivity, the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series will make its debut on Steam later today, and Square Enix has handily shared exact launch times for when the games will be available for purchase.</p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">We already have <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-games-make-steam-debut-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a breakdown on exactly which <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> titles will be available</a> but, as a quick reminder, there will be seven games across three separate compilations (plus three movies), and you can purchase all of them as part of a <em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em> collection. As for when you can actually start playing them, below is a list of release times for every timezone <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1800513569290924305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as provided by Square Enix</a>:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true"> <li>Los Angeles—9am PDT June 13</li> <li>New York—12pm EDT June 13</li> <li>Brazil—1pm BRT June 13</li> <li>London—5pm BST June 13</li> <li>Berlin—6pm CEST June 13</li> <li>Tokyo—1am JST June 14</li> <li>Australia—2am AEST June 14</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="139" data-injectable="false">At the time of writing, no prices have been shared, but I have to imagine the games will cost about the same as they do on other platforms:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX</em>—$49.99/£39.99</li> <li><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em>—$59.99/£49.99</li> <li><em>Kingdom Hearts 3 + Re Mind</em>—$59.99/£49.99</li> <li><em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em>—$89.99/£79.99</li> </ul> <p data-characters="803" data-current-count="1102" data-injectable="true">While this is a meaty collection of games, and perfect for anyone looking to get into <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, it doesn’t include any of the mobile games. Said mobile games can’t be played anymore, but you can still download them to watch their cutscenes (or watch them on YouTube) if you crave extra lore and backstory. What’s more puzzling, though, is that this Steam line-up doesn’t include <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-kingdom-hearts-melody-of-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory</a></em>, a rhythm game spin-off released after <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-kingdom-hearts-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts 3</a></em>. It’s available on every other platform, including the Epic Games Store, and yet there’s been no mention of a Steam release. Hopefully, it’s only a matter of time since aside from being a very fun game in its own right, it has important plot details that help lead into <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">Speaking of <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, the game was sadly absent from Summer Game Fest, and while there have been rumours of it launching in 2025 or 2026, Square Enix has yet to share any official info. Given the publisher intends on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/expect-more-multiplatform-square-enix-games-as-company-pledges-itself-to-new-aggressive-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“aggressively pursuing” a multiplatform strategy</a> going forward, perhaps we’ll see <em>KH4</em> launch on consoles and PC at the same time, which would be ideal.</p>

		<p><span data-contrast="auto">We’re getting ever closer to that all-important release date of 2</span><span data-contrast="auto">nd</span><span data-contrast="auto"> July and our first visit to Tural, the supposed “New World” of Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail, and based on the trailer we’re in for another amazing experience. The sweeping vistas, local cultures, and – of course – the food all look enticing. It’s shaping up to be the holiday we (and the Warrior of Light) have been waiting for. In the meantime, if you want to take a short break in Eorzea (and beyond) and get your tan started or just relax while you wait, we’ve got you covered with our travel guide to the best places to visit in Final Fantasy XIV. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em>Warning: minor spoilers for Final Fantasy XIV ahead.&nbsp;</em></p>


<h3><strong>The Churning Mists</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s not the easiest place to get to, given that you must travel through Dravania to reach them, but those without a fear of heights will love the views from the floating islands of The Churning Mists. One for thrill seekers, regardless of vertigo, as you need to be constantly aware of the dragons that reside in the region and there aren’t any safety rails to be seen anywhere. The tourist bureau also advises that you keep a keen eye on your belongings as moogles are known to frequent the area.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>


<h3><strong>Tamamizu</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Nestled beneath the waves of the Ruby Sea, yes you read that right, is the beautiful town of Tamamizu. Inhabited by the industrious kojin, this underwater dome contains some of the most breathtaking sights in Eorzea, and you don’t even have to hold your breath to witness them. Once you’ve settled into the town, you can also pay a small fee for excursions to nearby sights like the Shisui of the Violet Tides, a resplendent palace between the waves. The only downside is having the lung capacity to get there!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><strong>Eulmore</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You deserve to treat yourself, and nowhere says decadence more than Eulmore. If you have a lot of money to spend, you can gorge yourself with some of the best food and drink in existence – we would recommend the meol – while surrounded by the upper crust of Kholusia. After nightfall, you can visit the Beehive; a nightclub with music, dancing performers and strong drinks that’s open all hours. We’ve heard reports of suspect news coming from the area, but these rumours are unsubstantiated.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Gridania</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Those seeking a return to a simpler life should visit the city of Gridania nestled in the Shroud. There’s no wi-fi, and the tomestone signal is poor, but surrounding the city are some of the best rambling routes you can find. You can wander to Bentbranch Meadows and meet the friendly chocobo farmers of the woods, stop to watch the soldiers of the Twin Adders in training, or those with a thirst for danger can even visit Sorrel Haven. This is the best option for those wanting to get away from modern life.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><strong>New Sharlayan</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Do you love places with a deep and rich history? Being surrounded by beautiful architecture? How about insular and elitist people? What about a stellar cup of coffee? Well, New Sharlayan has you covered. Explore the pseudo-Ancient Greek architecture, get in trouble exploring the gigantic (but restricted) libraries, or just wander the beautiful harbourside. Any seeker of knowledge and culture will find plenty to enjoy here, if you have the approval of the Forum to enjoy it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><strong>Mandeville Gold Saucer</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A mere airship ride from Ul’dah is the glittering and gaudy Gold Saucer. Staffed by girls in bunny outfits, suited cactuars and owned by a studly gentleman with an aversion to clothing, you can fritter away hours in palatial decadence. With card games, arcade machines, chocobo races, mahjong and other events every 20 minutes, you will always find something to do. The best part? The place operates on its own currency system, saving you from needing to dip into your gil coffers!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><strong>Costa del Sol</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Obviously, this was going to be top of the list. Just a short hike away from the towering Limsa Lominsa is a beautiful stretch of golden beaches. You can take a swim in the crystal blue waters, soak in the atmosphere at one of the beach-side bars or drop down onto the beaches to take on a myriad of creatures that patrol the coastline. The only points it loses are from the annual festival that sees a strange obstacle course take over the coast, but that’s a small price to pay for beaches like this.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177548/discord-ps5-integration-calls-from-console<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is improving its Discord integration on the PS5 so that you can join voice calls directly from the console. First <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23630228/sony-ps5-update-discord-1440p-vrr-support">launched last year</a>, Discord support on PS5 currently requires you to manually transfer a call to a console by using the Discord app on mobile or PC. Sony is now <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/13/ps5-players-will-soon-be-able-to-join-discord-voice-chat-directly-from-their-console/">rolling out an update</a> that integrates Discord directly into the PS5 dashboard so you can select the server or DM group you want to join.</p><p>The update is rolling out gradually over the coming weeks, starting with PS5 owners in Japan and Asia followed by Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and then finally the US and Canada. You’ll need to update your PS5 to the latest system software to get this new Discord integration, and a PlayStation Network account will need to be linked to your Discord account, too.</p><p>“To start, select the Discord tab in Game Base within the PS5 Control Center and choose the Discord server or DM group you’d like to join,” explains Sabrina Meditz, senior director of product management for the PlayStation platform experience. “Then, select your preferred voice channel. This will reveal more details, such as who is already in the channel chatting. You’ll also receive a PS5 console notification when another Discord user calls you, allowing you to join right away.”</p><p>This latest PS5 update puts the Discord experience nearly on par with what Microsoft offers on the Xbox. Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/20/23271170/discord-xbox-voice-calls-integration-hands-on">first offered Discord support on Xbox</a> in July 2022 for testers, before then rolling out an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/16/23460701/xbox-november-update-discord-voice-channels-deals-capture">improved experience</a> without the need for a phone in November 2022. Discord on Xbox was also updated to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/2/23816949/discord-xbox-stream-feature-testing-xbox-insiders">let you stream your gameplay</a> to friends last year.</p><p>Sony is also rolling out the ability to share your PlayStation Network profile on any messaging or social app, with a new share profile option in the PlayStation mobile app next week. The feature generates a shareable link or QR code so people can easily add you as a friend.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Claim accuses Steam maker of market dominance and overcharging consumers</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Steam is facing a £656 million collective action claim, brought forward by a digital rights campaigner who has accused Valve of using market dominance to overcharge 14 million UK consumers.</p>
<p>The claim was filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal on June 5, brought forward by Vicki Shotbolt.</p>
<p>"Valve is rigging the market and taking advantage of UK gamers," Shotbolt told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwwyj6v24xo">BBC News</a>.</p>
<p>She said the claim was filed "to stop this unlawful conduct and have people get back what they are owed."</p>
<p>The claim also accused Valve of "forcing" publishers to sign up to pricing restrictions, in addition to charging publishers commissions of up to 30%.</p>
<p>"We believe that Valve has been unfairly shutting out competition for PC games and in-game content, which has meant that UK customers have paid too much for these products," a statement read on an <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/the-claim/">accompanying website</a> for the claim.</p>
<p>Shotbolt is represented by Milberg London LLP, which represented consumer rights expert Alex Neill in bringing forth a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/legal-claim-filed-against-sony-over-30-store-cut">similar claim against Sony in 2022</a>, in which the firm was accused of overcharging players, developers, and publishers.</p>

<p data-characters="290" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following a short delay, it’s finally time to get our hands on <em>Fortnite</em>‘s v30.10 update, which brings a host of Metallica content including a concert and a new weapon, an updated Loot Island, and changes to <em>LEGO Fortnite</em> and <em>Rocket Racing</em>. Check out the full patch notes below. </p> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false"><em>Fortnite</em>‘s 30.10 patch was originally scheduled to drop on June 11, but after a two-day delay, it’s finally here. The headline addition, of course, is the Metallica collaboration, which is taking place across all of <em>Fortnite</em>‘s modes. </p> <h2 id="h-fortnite-v30-10-patch-notes" data-injectable="false"><em>Fortnite</em> v30.10 patch notes</h2>  <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="471" data-injectable="true">Fancy experiencing six of Metallica’s biggest songs as you’ve never experienced them before? Then get ready for Fuel. Fire. Fury, a six-song in-game concert that will take place over the weekend of June 22. </p>
 <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="198" data-injectable="false">Unsurprisingly, Metallica is headed for <em>Fortnite Festival</em>, where they’ll take part in a PvP Battle Stage where 16 players enter and one is left standing, kind of like a musical battle royale. </p> <figure data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>“Exit light! Enter night!” Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Of course, all four members are also available as skins too, included in the <em>Fortnite</em> Festival Season 4 Premium Reward Track. Players will unlock Lars Ulrich as soon as they purchase the track, with James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo unlocked by earning XP and ranking up. Special “Master of Puppets” versions will also be available to purchase in the in-game store.</p> <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true">There’s also a special Metallica-themed <em>Rocket Racing</em> track which plays Fuel in the background as you speed around, so there are plenty of ways for fans of the band to celebrate. </p>
  <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">As part of the crossover, a special Metallica-themed Loot Island is coming to Battle Royale! In the middle of every match, the floating island will appear from a rift, with a stage on top inspired by the one used on their M72 World Tour. </p> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">Epic Games says that if you “rock out to the holographic James, Lars, Kirk, and Robert,” you’ll be able to capture the POI, and the loot that comes with it. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>It’ll just appear in the sky. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-ride-the-lightning-guitars" data-injectable="false">Ride the Lightning guitars</h2> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true">Ride the Lightning guitars are one of two new additions to the loot pool, allowing players to create a lightning bolt in the sky that you and your teammates can ride on to rotate around the island. </p>
 <p data-characters="99" data-current-count="99" data-injectable="false">This Mythic item is available as both ground loot or from Chests, so grab one and take to the sky. </p> <figure data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>This thing looks awesome. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-tow-hook-cannon" data-injectable="false">Tow Hook Cannon</h2> <p data-characters="123" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">Epic has also added the Tow Hook Cannon, a new weapon that should help you combat all those <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-season-3-wrecked-slams-the-brakes-on-the-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pesky vehicles</a> driving around. </p>
 <p data-characters="103" data-current-count="103" data-injectable="false">Fire it at a car, and you’ll be able to slow it down, making it harder for them to run you over. </p> <figure data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Anything to slow down these vehicles is great for me. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-cozy-and-expert-mode-in-lego-fortnite" data-injectable="false">Cozy and Expert Mode in <em>LEGO Fortnite</em></h2> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">Epic has given us more ways to play <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-lego-fortnite-a-battle-royale-game-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Fortnite</a></em> by dropping two new difficulty levels. Cozy Mode makes enemies easier to fight, turns of Storm-Wild creatures entirely, removes hunger, temperature, and stamina, and lets you keep your inventory when you die. </p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="false">Expert, meanwhile, is for those who really want a challenge, as the Storm-Wild enemies deal more damage, have more health, and move faster than regular creatures. It’s also a hardcore mode, which means that when you die, that’s it. No more respawns unless you have a Totem of Return. </p>
