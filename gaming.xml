			<p>Yet another Microsoft studio has taken advantage of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/">labour neutrality agreement the company signed with the CWA (Communications Workers of America)</a> to get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard through, and this time it's DOOM developer id Software, with 165 developers at the Texas-based studio voting in favour of forming a wall-to-wall union.</p>



<p>Announced with <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-developers-texas-vote-form-latest-wall-wall-union-cwa">a press release from the CWA</a>, union members cited wanting to protect elements of their work, like being able to work remotely, ensuring "<em>responsible</em> <em>use of AI</em>," as lead services programmer at id Software and union member, Chris Hays, told <a href="https://aftermath.site/id-software-union-doom-microsoft-cwa/">Aftermath</a> in an interview.</p>



<p>"<em>The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it’s incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives</em>," said id Software producer and union organizer Andrew Willis in a press release. "<em>The union is a way for us, the developers, to take back control of the industry we love and to ensure that it delivers high-quality products from high-quality workers who have health benefits and longevity beyond quarterly profits.</em>"</p>



<p>This past August, <a href="https://wccftech.com/450-diablo-developers-vote-in-favor-unionizing-cwa/">450 developers working on the Diablo series at Blizzard voted in favour</a> of forming a union with the CWA, and in May 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">ZeniMax Workers United QA were able to reach a tentative deal with Microsoft</a> to finally ratify their union contract after two years of negotiating.</p>



<p>"<em>Remote work isn't a perk,</em>" Hays added in the CWA press release. "<em>It's a necessity for our health, our families,</em> <em>and our access needs. RTO policies should not be handed down from executives with no consideration for accessibility or our well-being.</em> <em>With a union, we will have the opportunity to make sure that everyone has a voice in the things that matter most to us</em>."</p>



<p>Now that the developers at id Software have voted in favour of the union, they will have to go through the process of getting a contract agreement and then getting that agreement ratified. It took the ZeniMax Workers United QA union two years and a strike to get their contract done, which doesn't bode well for the other unions under Microsoft currently trying to get a contract agreed on and signed. But voting for the union is still a major step towards better working conditions for the developers.</p>



<p>Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard has changed the video game industry in a myriad of ways, but perhaps one of the most significant ways will end up being how it allowed a labour movement within the video game industry to gain serious momentum. </p>



<p>"<em>I'm very proud to be a part of this effort to organize our studio, to have a voice in decisions that directly affect myself and my coworkers</em>," said organizing member and senior VFX artist at id Software, Caroline Pierrot. "<em>In an industry that has proven to be very unstable over the last few years, more unions means more power to the workers and a real shot at shaping the future of the industry for the better</em>."</p>

            <p>
How about that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-official-control-2-is-control-resonant-a-paranatural-melee-brawler-with-shapeshifting-hittin-sticks">Control Resonant</a>! What was previously referred to as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> now has its own name, and its own protagonist, Dylan Faden, the tongues-speaking brother of the first game's heroine Jesse. Gone is her shapeshifting gun too, replaced with a shapeshifting bit of metal instead. The horrors of the Oldest House have spilled out into New York City, Jesse is MIA, and Dylan must bash his way through it all to find her in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>-esque manner. Interesting enough a setup, but I am bothered by one thing: Remedy say you don't need to play the first game to play this one.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/control-resonant-brings-a-new-paranatural-crisis-to-ps5-out-2026/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that came with the official reveal last night, co-creative director at Remedy Mikael Kasurinen laid it out for us. "You don’t need to have played the first Control to experience Resonant," he wrote. "It’s a new story and a fresh entry point into Remedy’s world of the Federal Bureau of Control - though returning players will recognize familiar echoes of Jesse’s path and the mysteries binding these two siblings together."
</p>
<p>
This isn't a surprising thing in that by the time Control Resonant releases next year, if it does, it will have been seven years since the first one came out (the same amount of time that has passed in-world). It's just quite frustrating, because when the studio said <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-faq/">the same thing about Alan Wake 2</a>, it was only true on a technical level. Sure, it was easy enough to follow, but there really is so much to it that you'll need to have played the first one to fully appreciate it.
</p>
<p>
Seven years in-world is obviously a convenient amount of time to help justify the lack of a need to play a previous game. It is just a frustrating trend that has been born out of a desperation to, I assume, make certain sales figures. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> Rebirth's co-director even said <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1665705101196136448">you don't have to play Remake beforehand to enjoy it</a>, which is nonsense of the highest order.
</p><p>
Sequels are not an inherently bad thing, and if you can only make them in a fashion where you need to bring in new people, thusly potentially alienating what drew people in in the first place, I question why you're making a sequel at all. Hell, Remedy are trying to build a whole universe here - why not be brave and go the whole hog, try something actually new?
</p>
<p>
Mayhaps I am being a curmudgeon, I would like to note that I do think the actiony, whompy bits look Sick as Heck, and will be eager to check it out whenever it does end up releasing next year. But I won't pretend that I don't need to play Control.

            <title><![CDATA[Forget Govee, Philips Hue 65″ Smart TV Light Strip Is 56% Off and Now Even Cheaper Than the 55″ Version]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-govee-philips-hue-65-smart-tv-light-strip-is-56-off-and-now-even-cheaper-than-the-55-version-2000652694</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good lighting can really bring your entire gaming and entertainment setup together. If you’re looking to enjoy a more immersive visual experience with your screen, where the entire room lights up during action-packed scenes and settles into a calm vibe when something peaceful is playing, a smart lighting strip is what you need.</p>
<p>Depending on the features you’re after, these can cost a pretty penny, but that changes today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6368/">The 65-inch Philips Hue Play Gradient Smart TV light strip is currently going for just $130 at Amazon, after a whopping 56% or $167 discount.</a> It’s the lowest we have seen these lights drop to in a long, long while, and you’ll also enjoy free shipping with your purchase. These are sure to make holiday movie nights a lot more fun – just be sure to get your orders in before the price goes back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6368/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Millions of LED Multi-Color Lights</h2>
<p>The box comes with a one White and Color Ambiance 65-inch TV smart LED light strip with mounting brackets. It attaches to the back of your screen (just below the corners) safely using the brackets. This deal applies to the 65-inch version, but you can also get the 55-inch and 75-inch sizes, depending on the size of your TV. Both versions are discounted, going for $142 and $255, respectively. Note that the lighting strips need to be paired with a Hue bridge and sync box (both sold separately) to unlock their full potential. If you don’t have those already, now is a good time to snap them up, too, as several Philips Hue products are going for less at Amazon.</p>



<p>Once everything is up, the strip offers both warm-to-cool white and millions of LED multi-color lights to choose from. The colors blend perfectly into each other, while the 45-degree angle light projector casts the stunning gradient of light onto the wall behind your TV. Of course, syncing abilities are the highlight here, as they make the lights react to whatever’s happening on screen in real time, whether you’re watching a show, playing a game, or just listening to your favorite music. Watching a Stranger Things episode? Expect your living room to light up with some Eleven magic. Thrilling, action-packed games with a shooting sequence are going to put up a light show, while LoFi songs are going to fill the space with calm vibes. It’s great for both solo streaming sessions, movie nights with friends, plus fun New Year’s parties.</p>
<p>Voice control is supported, meaning you won’t always have to adjust settings or manage the lights manually via the dedicated app. It plays nicely with Alexa and Google Assistant, so you can say something like “Hey Alexa, turn the lights on”, or “Hey Alexa, increase the brightness”, and your command will be answered in seconds. The Hue Bridge brings even more convenience by letting you add motion sensors, set routines, create timers, and more. There’s a lot more to like about this smart lighting strip. It does more than adding lights to your setup; it creates a vibe. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6368/">The current deal lets you pick the 65-inch version for $130, after an impressive 56% discount.</a> Other sizes are discounted too, so there are options to choose from. Deals this good tend to wrap up soon, so it’s best to grab yours without wasting a lot of time.</p>

<p><iframe title="Decrepit World Premiere Trailer from The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H1AQq0MunWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

			<p>Marvel Rivals appearing at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a> might not have been the most surprising thing to happen at the show, but the reveal trailer NetEase Games brought with it matched the energy and the spectacle of the show appropriately, as it revealed that Deadpool would be joining the game's roster on January 16, 2026, with the launch of Season 6. Season 5.5, meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-adds-rogue-gambit-new-game-mode-new-map-and-more/">which adds Rogue to the roster after Gambit was added at the beginning of Season 5,</a> is available right now.</p>



<p>The cinematic trailer for Season 6 was one of the more animated trailers of the night, with Deadpool cracking jokes all the way through that fit his character, particularly all of his fourth-wall-breaking comments.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Deadpool is coming to Marvel Rivals on Jan 16 // Season 6: Night at the Museum Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aj53c2Uxrtc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>NetEase will reveal more details about Season 6: Night at the Museum and Deadpool closer to its arrival, though in the meantime, Season 5.5 is available right now for players to jump into, adding a new vanguard, the X-Men Rogue, to the roster.</p>



<p>Season 5.5 also sees the return of Jeff's Winter Splash Festival, this time with a new holiday-themed map,  Jeffland. It features a new three-way brawl and three unique Jeff builds that each have their own skill set. There are also plenty of winter and holiday-themed skins for players to grab to keep the holiday mood going through each match.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>And, as is the case with every seasonal update, there's plenty of tweaks, balances, and bug fixes included in today's Season 5.5 release, with this batch including improvements to the spectactor system, new emotes, fixes for player stats that weren't registering properly, and more, all of which you can find in the patch notes with the big highlights mentioned in NetEase's Dev Vision video below.</p>

            <p>Have you showered yet today? No? Then maybe treat yourself to a bath if you can. It might help prepare for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. Capcom formally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-confirm-leon-kennedys-return-in-resident-evil-requiem-with-new-trailer">confirmed last night</a> that, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leon-kennedys-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-cover-art-leak-confirms">leaked</a>, it contains Leon Kennedy. Some of their devs have now offered a bit more detail as to how it'll feel to play as both him and co-lead Grace Ashcroft.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/">Automaton</a>, Requiem director Akifumi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazawa revealed that the time number of sections you'll spend playing as one of the two protagonists are "almost equally split", likening the structure to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-revelations">Resident Evil Revelations</a>.</p>
<p>As for how it feels to jump back and forth between them, there's a dichotomy of more traditional horror/fighty bloke action going on. "I’ve said before that Leon isn’t well suited to horror," Nakanishi explained. "Since quiet sections where you cower before monsters don’t fit him, his chapters focus on intense, adrenaline-pumping action. Grace’s sections, on the other hand, are the scarier ones. We’re really emphasizing the difference in their experiences this time.</p>
<p>"It’s almost like having two games with completely different types of tension mixed together. Early on, we worried players might not be able to keep up, but now we feel that the contrast gives the game a unique rhythm, like jumping into a cold bath after sitting in a hot sauna."</p><p>Taking that metaphor forwards, I assume the monstery things the pair are up against are the dirt and dust we all accrue when we're out and about not playing a horror game. If any other familiar Resi faces show up, will they be filling the role of those little bits of cucumber which get put on the eyes of every person who's every been in an advert for places that boast baths and saunas?</p>
<p>Despite all the relaxing language, Nakanishi made clear that the actiony bits won't be a walk in the park. "The battle this time will probably push Leon to his limits more than ever before", the director said, later adding that the team have build on Kennedy's Resi 4 moveset to mirror how his skills and mindset have evolved since his last appearance. Altogether, Nakanishi reckons the juxtaposition of spooks and shoots will help Requiem deliver "a kind of exhilaration and satisfaction that past Resident Evil titles didn’t offer". </p>
<p>We'll see if that's the case when the Resi spa opens up on February 27th, 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-clears-out-elite-series-2-core-gaming-controllers-at-their-lowest-price-to-compete-with-playstation-and-switch-2000653005</link>
            <guid>1381807</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve already bought an Xbox for the holidays, there are a couple of small issues you thankfully still have time to address. One, it comes with one controller, so if you’re in a multi-player home, that’s going to be an issue. Two, that default controller is good — but it’s not&nbsp;<em>great</em>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM/?tag=kotaku01-20">The Xbox Elite Series 2 wireless controller that’s on sale for 33% off right now at Amazon?</a> Indisputably great, so you can get that second controller&nbsp;<em>and</em> a pro gaming experience at the same time by taking this $135 deal. The Elite 2 works with Xbox One, Series S, and Series X, and also works for PC gaming.</p>

 <h2>Premium Feel</h2> <p>The upgrade from the default Xbox controller to the Elite 2 is obvious from the second you take it out of the box. It’s slightly thicker and has a heavier feel, but just enough heft that it feels sturdy and well-built. The rubberized grips give you a feeling of secure control, and overall it’s ergonomically outstanding, designed for long sessions.</p>

 <p>The construction already sets the Elite 2 apart from the default Xbox controller and third-party versions, but where it really takes off into the stratosphere is when you get to customize it. The tension on the thumbsticks can be finely adjusted, and the triggers are shorter and faster for an edge in shooters and battle royals. The thumbsticks, d-pads and paddles are all swappable, so it’s as close to custom-designing a controller for yourself as you can find.</p>

 <p>Take the customization further by using the Xbox Accessories app on the console or on a PC to remap buttons, set up multiple profiles and custom stick curves, and even assign macros. The profiles can be stored on the Elite 2 itself so you can change them on the fly, which means you can set up different ones for different games.</p>

 <h2>Endurance Level Battery</h2> <p>Where the default Xbox controller is powered by AA batteries and also somewhat notorious for chewing through them at a rapid rate, the Elite 2 is rechargeable. You get up to 40 hours of gameplay on a single charge, and the USB-C charging dock is included. You can game all day and rest the Elite 2 on its dock by night to ensure you’ll have a full charge every time you fire up the console or PC.</p> <p>The upgrades from the default controller to the Elite 2 are staggering, so much so that it’ll entirely reshape how you play. Even if you’re not in need of a second controller, upgrading to the Elite 2 and keeping the default controller on hand as a backup is a smart move. Now’s the time to make the switch — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM/?tag=kotaku01-20">Amazon’s 33% off deal brings the Xbox Elite Series 2 wireless controller with its charger and swappable components down to a very reasonable $135.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[What Did You Think Of The Game Awards 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/what-did-you-think-of-the-game-awards-2025-2000653017</link>
            <guid>1381804</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Another Game Awards showcase <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">has come and gone</a>. What did you think? Did you stay up and watch or just skim the highlights on social media? Did the right games win in the right categories? Did any of the “world premier” trailer reveals make you feel like Geoff Keighley’s event earned its nearly four-hour runtime? Consider this an open thread to chat, joke, and share your thoughts.</p> <p>I’ll start. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">won more awards than any game in TGA history</a>. Personally, while I love the game and think it warrants the hype, that seems a bit overblown. Will it stand the test of time like formative winners including <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>? I suspect not, but maybe not reinventing the wheel shouldn’t be held against it. It’s the game of the moment and this is the awards show for 2025.</p>

 <p>At the very least, it <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">shouldn’t have won best indie game</a>. I blame the TGA jury for that one. If one of the goals of the show is to highlight as many of the year’s best games as possible, maybe one game shouldn’t be able to win “best game” across multiple categories. If you picked <em>Clair Obscur</em> for GOTY, it can’t also win “best RPG” or “best debut indie game.” It would prevent sweeps like this, which, even if deserved, end up being kind of boring and leave so many other amazing games underrepresented on the big stage.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Give it up in the chat for Miss Piggy and Rowlf the Dog! 👏👏<a href="https://twitter.com/TheMuppets?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TheMuppets</a> never let us down! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheGameAwards</a> <a href="https://t.co/XY6VxHLiYa">pic.twitter.com/XY6VxHLiYa</a></p> <p>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1999322500824445285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>And what about the reveals? Keighley tried to pull another <em>Okami 2</em>-style rabbit out of his hat with <a href="https://kotaku.com/mega-man-dual-override-trailer-capcom-2000652829"><em>Mega Man Dual Overdrive</em></a> (aka<em> Mega Man 12</em>). As someone who grew up on games in the NES-era, <em>Mega Man 3</em> gave me a daily ass-kicking for years, it sort of worked. That game isn’t coming until 2027 though, and didn’t look nearly as solid or revelatory in the gameplay and art than I’d expect for the Blue Bomber’s prodigal return. Insiders promise Capcom is cooking but they have their work cut out for them.</p>

 <p>The show also seemed light on some of those known quantities that bring a special X factor to a showcase like this. No Nintendo wasn’t surprising. Sony showed showed more<em> Saros</em> but that doesn’t quite pop has much as more <em>Wolverine</em> or a new <em>God of War</em> would have. Microsoft, Square Enix, Ubisoft, and the rest of the big publishers were absent too. The big show stoppers, a new&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> RPG from Larian Studios and a new <em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em> spin-off from ex-BioWare director Casey Hudson, are games I can’t wait to play but whose reveals were muted a bit by brief cinematic teasers that shared a vibe but not a story.</p> <p>In many ways, this might have been the smoothest and most slickly produced Game Awards yet. It also, for some reason, felt like one of the least memorable. Will see if that gut assessment holds up a couple years from now. What did you think?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When you think of modern-day online shooters, you have to consider Overwatch and Fortnite. It feels almost wrong that the two brands haven’t come together at some point. New leaks suggest the sought-after crossover between the two giants is happening—brace yourself.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-earn-lego-fortnite-ninjago-2025-twitch-drops-all-rewards-how-to-get/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> is still red-hot and untouchable in 2025, whereas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-patch-december-overhauls-competitive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch 2</a>‘s (and the brand as a whole) has dropped off a bit in recent times, but it’s still a bona fide behemoth in the shooter genre. The two franchises have never partnered up once over the years, but leaks suggest this could change.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-amp-overwatch-crossover-possible-according-to-leaks">Fortnite &amp; Overwatch Crossover Possible, According To Leaks</h2>



<p>Hypex (One of the world’s biggest sources for news and leaks) has shared new information—courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR"></a><a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Wensoing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wensoing</a>—of a potential collab. They stress that this is only a “POSSIBLE” collab, so take this information with a huge pinch of salt until we know more.</p>







<p><a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR"></a>SpushFNBR shared leaked assets on December 11, revealing a bunch of LEGO heads and pieces. One headpiece that players were quick to jump on was a potential match for <strong>Hanzo</strong>, from Overwatch. It appears to only be for LEGO, though.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hypex explained about the Hanzo hair model: “It was used on an early version of a Fortnite LEGO skin, then removed, then re-added today again.”<a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR"></a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There’s not too much more to go on for now. Fortnite is lining up a bunch of collabs coming up, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-south-park-leak-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Park</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kim-kardashian-fortnite-guess-what-players-saying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim Kardashian</a>, and anything else Epic Games can get its hands on, it seems.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest surprises of 2025 was Microsoft's push to bring even more of its games to PlayStation, its longtime rival in the console gaming space. Not only have those ports been well received, but they've also been best-sellers, and next year will see the arrival of Halo and Forza Horizon on PlayStation. In a new interview, Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, spoke about the success of Xbox games on PS5 and the reaction to Halo's announcement for PS5.</p><p>"We had a bit of a moment earlier in the summer from end of April to end of June, where we had six of the top 10 games on PlayStation were our Xbox games," Booty said to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>. "I look at that as validation for the teams, but most importantly, it's an opportunity for more players to engage with our content, to come into our worlds."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Campaign Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Halo has long been considered the crown jewel of Xbox, and the next game in the franchise, a campaign-only remake of the original titled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, will launch simultaneously on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 in 2026. Booty said the announcement was well received and that Microsoft was really pleased with its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-on-ps5-is-a-win-for-the-future-of-halo-dev-says/1100-6535726/">efforts to bring its content to more people</a>.</p><p>Booty also touched on several other topics in the interview, like Microsoft's u-turn on charging $80 for new games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-reacts-to-dropping-plans-for-80-games/1100-6536931/">suggesting a more dynamic approach</a> to video game monetization in the future. The Xbox Game Studios boss also commented on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-were-significantly-down-from-black-ops-6-report/1100-6536893/">disappointing reception to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> and the challenges of releasing a new Call of Duty game every year.</p><p>Activision has also pledged <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">not to do back-to-back entries in the same Call of Duty sub-series like Modern Warfare or Black Ops</a>, and it aims to deliver "meaningful, not incremental" innovation going forward.</p>

                <p>One of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025s-biggest-gaming-news-banned-games-gta-6-delayed-price-hikes/2900-7312/" data-ref-id="2900-7312">biggest pieces of news in gaming this year</a> was EA's announcement that it was selling itself for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">$55 billion</a> to investors including Saudi Arabia. The announcement of the deal has sent shockwaves through the gaming world, and now Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty has commented on the deal, saying the price tag reflects how big video games have come in the global media landscape.</p><p>"Games have really become a foundational part of entertainment," <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Booty told Variety</a>. "And as such, I think we're seeing these valuations and transactions that really reflect their place in modern entertainment."</p><p>The price of the sale "reflects the value that exists in all of" the gaming IP that EA owns, including Madden, FC, and The Sims, Booty said.</p><p>"I'm certainly not [a mergers and acquisition] expert, but I would look at the value of the transaction really being about the forward-looking value of the IP and the stories and what they've created, even more so than necessarily, the static or rearward-looking value," he said.</p><p>Microsoft is no stranger to big buyouts, as the company purchased Mojang and Minecraft for $2.5 billion, ZeniMax for $7.5 billion, and Activision Blizzard for $75.4 billion.</p><p>The $55 billion would take EA private as part of the biggest Leveraged Buyout (LBO) in history. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/majority-control-of-ea-could-shift-to-saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-report/1100-6536660/" data-ref-id="1100-6536660">take more than 93% ownership of EA</a> if the deal closes, with Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners and Silver Lake taking the rest.</p><p>EA would also be responsible for coming up with $20 billion in the deal, and this has prompted concerns that EA will look to cut costs with layoffs, studio closures, and by selling off assets.</p><p>EA's sale has not been completed, but it's expected to close in 2026, pending regulatory approval and other closing conditions. A group of EA workers has criticized the sale, saying it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">unnecessary and harmful to workers.</a> People have expressed concerns that the PIF will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-acknowledges-risk-of-selling-to-saudi-arabia-claims-it-will-retain-creative-control/1100-6535894/">seek to avoid "the gay stuff" and politics</a> if the deal materializes. For its part, EA has acknowledged that its ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-acknowledges-risk-of-selling-to-saudi-arabia-claims-it-will-retain-creative-control/1100-6535894/" data-ref-id="1100-6535894">attract, retain, and motivate developers may be negatively affected</a> by the pending sale.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-55-billion-buys-everything-included-in-the-ea-acquisition/1100-6535111/" data-ref-id="1100-6535111">all the EA franchises that would be sold if the deal closes.</a></p>

            <guid>1381786</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Capcom released a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/leon-kennedy-takes-the-stage-in-resident-evil-requiem">new trailer for Resident Evil Requiem during The Game Awards 2025</a>, and it featured <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/09/resident-evil-requiem-storefronts-accidentally-leak-two-unannounced-characters">the return of Leon S. Kennedy to the series</a>, older and more grizzly than we've ever seen him. Following that trailer, Capcom spoke with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/"><em>Automaton</em></a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-reveal-how-much-well-play-as-leon-and-say-the-survival-horroraction-contrast-is-like-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna"><em>IGN</em></a>, to discuss this beloved character's return, how much we can expect of him in Requiem, and his fancy new Porsche.&nbsp;</p><p>Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi told <em>Automaton</em> that Leon and Grace will share the game's runtime equally. "In terms of gameplay, Grace and Leon's playable sections are almost equally split," Nakanishi said. "The structure is similar to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/resident_evil_revelations/b/pc/archive/2013/05/19/the-right-way-to-play-this-missing-chapter.aspx">Resident Evil Revelations</a>."&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/rVIIcLGGO7A" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rVIIcLGGO7A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Nakanishi added that Requiem is Leon's first return to Raccoon City since his time in Resident Evil 2, "so seeing how he responds to the 'place where it all began' now that he's older is another major point of interest." In terms of designing this more gruff Leon for Requiem, the director said, "Although he's a character who carries a lot on his shoulders, we took a lot of care in refining him to be an 'ikeoji' [a cool/attractive guy]," adding that the reaction to this new trailer made the development team happy.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview with <em>Automaton</em>, Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa detailed Leon's fancy new ride: a Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT. Kumazawa said, "We were looking for a car that fit Leon, and thankfully, Porsche kindly agreed, which led to a full collaboration." The Requiem producer says this Porsche is a custom-built Cayenne Turbo GT meant to fit the game's world, adding that "it's a one-of-a-kind car."&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Resident Evil Requiem's dual protagonists will represent two styles of gameplay, which its developers describe as like "jumping into a cold bath after a hot sauna".</p>
<p>At last night's The Game Awards, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprising-absolutely-no-one-leon-s-kennedy-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-in-new-gameplay-trailer">Capcom revealed Leon Kennedy will indeed be playable</a> in the next mainline entry of the horror series, after plenty of fan speculation and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-leak-confirms-leon-will-be-in-resident-evil-requiem-after-all">leak earlier in the week</a>. Since then, director Akifumi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazawa have shed more light on how the dual protagonists will differ.</p>
<p>"Grace is 'the biggest scaredy-cat in Resident Evil history'," Nakanishi told <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/">Automaton</a>, while "Leon is a seasoned veteran, so seeing how those personalities interact is part of the fun."</p>

<p>He also confirmed the two characters are "almost equally split", with a similar structure to 3DS game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-revelations">Resident Evil Revelations</a>.</p>
<p>"I've said before that Leon isn't well suited to horror," said Nakanishi. "Since quiet sections where you cower before monsters don't fit him, his chapters focus on intense, adrenaline-pumping action. Grace's sections, on the other hand, are the scarier ones. We're really emphasising the difference in their experiences this time."</p><p>He continued: "It's almost like having two games with completely different types of tension mixed together. Early on, we worried players might not be able to keep up, but now we feel that the contrast gives the game a unique rhythm, like jumping into a cold bath after sitting in a hot sauna. It was important to combine the slow and fast segments well, and Grace and Leon turned out to be the best combination for that. Leon also has lots of new actions, giving you a strong sense of release compared to Grace's sequences."</p>
<p>As such, Grace's sections resemble <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>, while Leon's will be closer to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>. After all, these are arguably the two most popular games in the series.</p>
<p>Confirmation of the two characters and their differing gameplay styles also speaks to the "tension and release throughout the game" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-requiems-director-explains-how-in-one-crucial-way-it-is-the-most-extreme-title-in-the-series-yet">Nakanishi previously told Eurogamer</a>. "That's something that I think Resident Evil is really unique with among horror games," he said. "We don't just scare you - we offer you a chance to release that tension by overcoming it all."</p>
<p>Nakanishi also spoke to Automaton of Leon's design, who's been refined into an 'ikeoji' - slang for a cool and attractive older man. "There are plenty of Leon fans inside the company too, after all," said Kumazawa.</p>
<p>Added Nakanishi: "Also, this is Leon's first return to Raccoon City since Resident Evil 2, so seeing how he responds to the 'place where it all began' now that he's older is another major point of interest."</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released next year on 27th February across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Steam. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">Resident Evil 7 and Village will also be coming to Nintendo's console</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a> had more than a few big announcements, and it also saw the return of one of the industry's most notable indie developers, with Braid and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-witness-review-life-puzzle/">The Witness developer</a> Jonathan Blow and his team at Thekla, Inc., announcing their next project, Order of the Sinking Star. </p>



<p>It's a narrative puzzle game set to arrive on PC sometime in 2026 that Blow calls "<em>the biggest game I've worked on</em>," and a quick look at the trailer will make you understand why he describes it that way. It's a puzzle game on a scale you don't normally see, as you mash together different worlds and solve over a thousand puzzles crafted by Thekla Inc.</p>



<p>"<em>Order of the Sinking Star is the biggest game I've worked on, and also the most collaborative</em>," Blow said in a press release. "<em>It's a kind of game design supercollider that brings together ideas from many designers to create a puzzle landscape that's much more intricate and vast than what has come before." </em></p>



<p>"<em>We've successfully pushed the limits of what is possible in a puzzle adventure. The game is just incredibly complex and deep, and I can't wait to show more as we move toward launch in 2026.</em> <em>The game showcases design contributions from Alan Hazelden (A Monster's Expedition), Sean Barrett (Promesst), Jonah Ostroff (Heroes of Sokoban), Zach Polansky (Enigmash), Patrick Traynor (Patrick's Parabox), Marc ten Bosch (Miegakure), and several others</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Announcing Order of the Sinking Star is a major moment for us, for Jonathan and his team,</em>" added Yoon Im, chief executive officer of Arc Games, the publisher behind Order of the Sinking Star, in a press release. "<em>It represents an exciting year ahead for all of us. It's an honour to support Jonathan to make his most ambitious project yet a reality, as we believe Order of the Sinking Star is set to be the premier and innovative puzzle adventure of this generation. This announcement today marks just the beginning of what we have planned for a game-changing year for us next year.</em>" </p>



<p>While Order of the Sinking Star is currently only set to arrive on PC, it will likely come to other platforms as the press release mentions that "<em>additional platforms and release timing for the game will be revealed at a later date</em>." So expect Order of the Sinking Star to be available on other platforms beyond PC, it just might not arrive on consoles at the same time.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>While the main show of The Game Awards featured some big reveals and cinematic extravaganzas, it was during the pre-show that the real star appeared. An action-platform game called <em>Bradley the Badger</em>, that looks to be four-dimensional folding layers of meta about gaming, with multiple jovial jabs taken at names like&nbsp;<em>The Last Of Us</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>.</p> <p>Beginning with the conceit that we’re already big, nostalgic fans of Bradley, a cheerfully-colored mascot platforming character who’d be right at home in the PS2 era, <em>Bradley the Badger</em>‘s trailer sees the titular character enthusiastically setting out on his latest adventure, to discover his house is now inside some sort of grimdark Soulslike. Walls are made of petrified hands, some holding blue-glowing lanterns, and then a title card drops in reading “Badgerborne.” But as Bradley to platform around in this unpleasant reality, he discovers that it’s very much not finished. Art assets are marked as “WAITING FOR REVIEW,” while sticky notes appear all over demanding fixes.</p>

 <p>This, Bradley discovers, means he can start manipulating these unfinished textures and placeholder blocks, such that he can drag and reshape his own platforms, or reprogram the properties of items. And there, there you’ve got a <em>brilliant</em> idea for a game.</p>

 <p>Except it keeps adding. Once Bradley’s in a&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> reality, he’s able to transform himself into untextured items in the world, becoming a trash bin that can roll up walls, or in a&nbsp;<em>The Last Of Us</em> spoof turn into both a pick-up truck and a size-changing apple. This all starts to look really incredible, the game not demanding players learn code (thank god), but rather just having toggles for various settings of each item, explosive or inert, big or small, magnetic or not. And just as you’re getting to grips with what this is all about, Bradley reaches the end of what’s been coded in the game. And wakes up. As a real person, FMV, with filthy human feet and hands, and a dirty, ill-fitting badger hat on his head. He’s in the development studios of Dreamwoods Games, the walls covered in Bradley posters and notes, and at that point I have no idea what this is.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4198090/Bradley_the_Badger/">game’s Steam page</a> makes things a bit clearer. This is, at heart, an action-platformer, but one where you have “game developer powers.” But on top of that, it’s a game about a beloved franchise becoming self-aware, realizing his fictional reality, and fighting against it to try to restore his normality. And then, yes, the story will include live-actions sections too. Which is glorious.</p>

 <p>Evan Peters, the&nbsp;<em>X-Men</em> movies’ Peter Maximoff, plays the real-world version and voice of Bradley, in the first game from Day 4 Night Studios, the first game from team of former AAA devs who have variously worked on games like <em>GTA: San Andreas</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dead Alliance</em>. One of the co-creators, Christian Cantamessa, calls&nbsp;<em>Bradley the Badger&nbsp;</em>“part love letter to video games and part satire of them.”</p> <p>The game is set for a Steam release in 2026, but will clearly be looking for console releases after its TGA appearance.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[HP Offloads Its 15.6″ Laptop at 72% Off, Margin Clearly Not the Goal on This Windows 11 Pro PC]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-offloads-its-15-6-laptop-at-72-off-margin-clearly-not-the-goal-on-this-windows-11-pro-pc-2000652643</link>
            <guid>1381747</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s no shortage of laptops on the market, but not all of them are worth your money. If you’ve been after a solid option for remote work or studies, the 15.6-inch HP Flagship touchscreen laptop is an excellent option to consider, and right now, you can treat yourself to it without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6366/">It’s typically priced at $1,900, but Amazon just took a whopping 72% off it, dropping the machine down to just $540.</a> You’re saving over $1,300 on an option that has enough muscle to handle all your everyday tasks. The retailer is also offering a bunch of freebies with your purchase for absolutely nothing, which adds even more value to the purchase. Grab it before the deal expires, or the stock runs out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packed With Useful Features</h2>
<p>This is a decent mid-range laptop that runs on an Intel i3-1315U processor, capable of clocking up to 4.5GHz with Intel Turbo Boost technology. It’s ideal for browsing, streaming your favorite shows, and regular office work, but might struggle to push through heavy gaming or demanding creative tasks. If you’re planning to use it for basic computing, it’s going to be a solid choice. Those looking to game and push creative limits should consider an i5 or i7.</p>
<p>There’s a modest 16 GB RAM to keep things running smoothly, which even lets you multitask on busy days with ease. Again, it’s not massive, but you’ll be able to use a couple of different programs and hop through a range of tabs without experiencing noticeable slowdowns. The 512GB SSD is spacious enough to house all your important media files and work documents, whether you’re looking to store high-resolution photos, videos, research files, or office projects. Additionally, since SSDs are much faster than traditional hard drives, you’ll also experience quicker boot and transfer times when launching the system or moving files around.</p>



<p>The display is a stunning 15.6-inch BrightView touch screen that is virtually borderless for a wide viewing experience. It pushes detailed, brilliant visuals for all that’s playing on the screen, from work presentations to movies and TV shows. Touch support means you won’t have to rely on just the trackpad or the mouse to get things done. Just use your fingers on the screen directly to scroll through pages, swipe images, zoom in on text, and even sign documents. It also comes in handy when two people are using the laptop; your friend won’t have to awkwardly reach for the trackpad/mouse to do something.</p>
<p>Ports include an AC smart pin, USB Type-A, USB Type-C, HDMI, and more. Best of all, Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, which means you’ll have instant access to a bunch of security and productivity features that Microsoft has designed keeping remote workers and professionals in mind. Copilot support lets you use AI to get help with tasks throughout the day. You can use it to find answers to random questions without opening a browser, get help with crafting replies, summarize documents, and even brainstorm ideas.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6366/">Other freebies include a DVD/CD drive, a Redragon mouse, a screen wipe, and a 256GB SD card.</a> This 5-in-1 bundle (including the pre-installed OS) is worth almost $200, but you’re getting it here at no extra cost. We highly recommend grabbing the discount while it’s still live – which might not be for long. You can treat yourself to the laptop, or pick it up as a gift for a loved one this holiday season!</p>

<p>With Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 up for a record number of nominations at The Game Awards 2025, there was every chance it would bring home many of those accolades. Sure enough, the RPG cleaned up at The Game Awards 2025.</p>



<p>It was a huge night for Sandfall Interactive and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The surprise news that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-major-free-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 DLC dropped through a free update</a> was fun, and it rounded off a successful night for the mega-popular role-playing game.</p>

<p>With many of the Sandfall Interactive crew in attendance at The Game Awards 2025 dressed up in striking French-inspired gear, there was an air of expectation that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 would do something very special.</p>







<p>Nearly four hours later, the 2025 GOTY took home <strong>nine of the 13 awards it was nominated for</strong>. This smashes the previous record of most awards accumulated in one night, set by <strong>The Last of Us Part 2’s seven awards</strong> at the 2020 show.</p>



<p>In other years, Forza Horizon 5 and It Takes Two claimed three awards each in 2021, God of War Ragnarok took home six in 2022, Baldur’s Gate 3 matched GOW’s feat in 2023, and Astro Bot was the recipient of four last year.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 won:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game of the Year</li>



<li>Best Game Direction</li>



<li>Best Narrative</li>



<li>Best Art Direction</li>



<li>Best Score and Music</li>



<li>Best Performance</li>



<li>Best Independent Game</li>



<li>Best Debut Indie Game</li>



<li>Best Role Playing Game</li>
</ul>



<p>Do you think Sandfall’s debut RPG release was worth the hype? Does it deserve the nine awards it claimed? Have any games been cruelly robbed of an award, such as Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 for Best RPG?

                <p>Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that it would start charging $80 for new games, beginning with The Outer Worlds 2. The company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">backtracked on those plans</a>, however, opting to sell the game for $70 and cancelling plans for other $80 games in the future. What happened here? And what does Microsoft think about pricing for its games going forward?</p><p>Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that the decision to roll back prices from $80 to $70 came about from listening to player feedback and trying to deliver "player value."</p><p>"We've reacted in the last year and I think for us, the real focus is going to be ... meeting people where they are. I think there's going to be less of a focus on what's that top line price of a game, as people start to engage in different ways with games," he said.</p><p>Thinking about a set price like $50, $60, $70, $80, or more is missing the point, Booty said. There is no one-size-fits-all approach for pricing, and Booty said the company will continue to monitor feedback as it looks to set prices for games in the future.</p><p>"From our point of view, monetization just happens in so many different ways right now. So we're going to continue to listen to the feedback from fans. We're going to continue, to balance that with needing to run the healthy business. But right now, on the content side, we don't have any pricing updates," he said.</p><p>While Microsoft didn't end up releasing any $80 games this year, the company did hike prices for Xbox fans in other ways. Microsoft jacked up Xbox console prices and increased the monthly cost of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate by a whopping 50%.</p><p>Outside of Xbox, Nintendo is charging $80 for Mario Kart World, and the company says the game has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/did-nintendo-justify-mario-kart-worlds-80-price/1100-6530956/" data-ref-id="1100-6530956">so much value that it justifies the higher cost</a>. The game is also available in a $500 hardware bundle, however.</p><p>Looking further out, many are wondering what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> will cost when it releases in November 2026. Some people think it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-warrants-a-100-price-tag-gta-5-actor-says/1100-6535876/" data-ref-id="1100-6535876">warrants a $100 price tag</a>, while others have said the game does not need to be $100 because its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">expected online mode could be the real money-maker</a>.</p>

            <p>UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has responded once again in the continuing war of words with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> developer Rockstar, this time describing the studio's latest statement, on its controversial firing of 34 employees, as an attempt to "reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals."</p>
<p>The IWGB's statement comes after several back-and-forth claims between the two parties. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstar-is-still-insisting-its-controversial-firing-of-employees-had-nothing-to-do-with-unions">Rockstar's own, most recent response</a>, issued yesterday, saw the studio claim the employees in question had "distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations," and that "claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading."</p>
<p>That in turn came<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests"> after a report from People Make Games in late November</a>, which claimed the workers were fired for conversations which took place on an invite-only Discord server for employees and IWGB union members. Most conversations held there were focused on salaries, bonuses, and other HR issues, the report said - topics protected by the Equality Act of 2010 and relevant to the union members.</p>
<p>The employees were initially fired for what Rockstar called "gross misconduct", before it was then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">accused of union busting</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">subjected to a lawsuit from the IWGB</a>.</p>
<p>The IWGB's latest full response reads:</p>
<blockquote>"Rockstar's latest statement is littered with falsehoods and disinformation - they have given multiple, conflicting reasons to explain why the workers were fired, as if attempting to reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals. Once again, they have chosen to mischaracterise workers speaking about their working conditions in a private forum as "leaking information". It is hard to understand this statement as anything but a desperate attempt to deflect from the global scrutiny they have come under over the last month. From the UK Prime Minister in the House of Commons, to the game developers across the world erupting in protest - all eyes are on Rockstar and their lawless attack on the people who make them their billions."</blockquote>
<p>The likely trigger for this statement from Rockstar - which had previously refused to comment on the People Make Games report - and the ensuing IWGB response is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstars-firing-of-union-staff-deeply-concerning-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer mentioning the situation in parliament</a> earlier this week. There, he called the firing of Rockstar's employees "deeply concerning" and promised MPs would look into it.</p><p>"Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union," Starmer said. It was the second time the issue had come up in UK parliament, after it was raised by Christine Jardine, Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Edinburgh West, back in November.</p>
<p>Notably, the UK's Labour government had made workers rights a key part of its election manifesto, and is currently aiming to push its flagship employment rights bill through the House of Lords. That context places an additional spotlight on Rockstar, while in the last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-workers-europe-fight-back-against-exploitation-ai-layoffs-historic-milestone-union-efforts">protests have taken place both in the UK and abroad in support of the fired Rockstar staff</a>.</p>

It’s very good at making you <em>want</em> to play Alexey Pajitnov’s iconic tetromino-stacking puzzler, just not on the watch because of frustrating touchscreen controls that require more focus than the game itself.</p><p>The included straps are colorfully <em>Tetris</em>-themed (you can swap them with standard watch straps if you want to tone it down), as is the collection of nine different faces. There are both digital and analog options with different themes and colors that display a mix of various metrics, including battery life and fitness stats. They all manage to work tetromino pieces and the <em>Tetris</em> logo into their designs, but there’s no customizability.</p><p>The watch’s interface is navigated using its touchscreen and a side crown dial that’s pressed or rotated to make selections or to scroll lists. There aren’t any other buttons, but you wouldn’t need them since the watch’s functionality is so limited.</p><p>From the main menu, you can play <em>Tetris</em> or use other features that include a stopwatch, timer, calendar, calculator, fitness tracker, and alarm. They’re all very basic. You can set multiple alarms, for example, but you can’t customize when they repeat or choose anything other than the main <em>Tetris</em> theme with gentle vibrations to alert you. Even the Game Boy version of <em>Tetris</em> that launched 36 years ago had alternate themes to choose from.</p><p>There’s a heart rate sensor that matched readings from my Apple Watch Series 9, but the other fitness tracking metrics are limited. There’s step counting with an adjustable daily goal and stride length options to improve accuracy, and an estimation of the calories you’ve burned that resets every night. There’s no history, no proactive health warnings, and no notifications at all because the watch lacks Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and doesn’t connect to your smartphone.</p><p>It’s an upgrade over a traditional digital watch and could be an option for someone who wants the look of a smartwatch without notifications. But anyone considering <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM9TYLT7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">spending $79.99 on it</a> is buying it to play <em>Tetris</em>. Unfortunately, it’s not a great implementation.</p><p>Previous versions of the My Play Watch used the crown dial to play retro games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24254312/space-invaders-my-play-watch-taito-kickstarter"><em>Space Invaders</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632077/atari-2600-my-play-watch-pong-centipede-missile-command-super-breakout"><em>Breakout</em></a>, but the<em> Tetris</em> version is played only via the touchscreen. When the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785725/tetris-my-play-watch-smartwatch">watch was announced in September, I was worried</a> that touch controls “could prove challenging on a small screen for those chasing high scores,” but it turns out the controls make even just quick play sessions frustrating.</p><p>You move pieces by dragging your finger across the screen from side to side, rotate them by tapping, increase their fall rate by tapping and holding, or immediately drop them onto the stack below with a downward swipe. The gestures are easy enough to learn, but I found the watch’s touchscreen would either regularly not detect them or misinterpret what I was doing. Short finger slides meant to reposition a piece by a few cells were frequently detected as a tap, resulting in an unwanted rotation. On more than one occasion, when I quickly tapped in a panic to rotate it back, the watch would interpret the gesture as a downward swipe and drop the piece where I didn’t want it.</p><p>There are options in the game’s settings that try to make the touch controls easier to use, including auto-rotate, which predicts the best orientation for a piece based on what’s below it. But accidental spins still happen and often mess up your game. Playing <em>Tetris</em> on the watch isn’t impossible, but because of the frustrating touch controls, I found myself focusing more on carefully executing taps and swipe gestures than any kind of stacking strategy. It increased the challenge, but not in the way any <em>Tetris</em> fan would want.</p><p>Equally disappointing is that the control issues I experienced can’t be remedied through software updates, since the watch isn’t capable of getting any. Even something simple, like limiting rotations to taps on the edges of the screen, would help, but it’s a change that can only be implemented in future versions of the watch.</p><p>Battery life isn’t great, either. I’m already used to charging my Apple Watch every night, but you need to limit your playtime to get a full day’s use from the <em>Tetris</em> watch. During my first day of testing, I maxed out the brightness and volume, and with less than 15 minutes of playing <em>Tetris</em>, the watch’s battery drained in 6.5 hours. Reducing the brightness to its lowest setting and halving the volume doubled its battery life to about 12 hours. The battery lost about 6 percent of its charge while playing <em>Tetris</em> for five minutes.</p><p>I like the idea of a wearable version of <em>Tetris</em> that I can quickly play without distracting notifications. It’s a game that relaxes my brain and is a nice stress reliever, but this version had the opposite effect. You may still be tempted to strap one on if you want the world to know how much you love the game. If you want fun, look elsewhere.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/842702/tetris-my-play-watch-smartwatch-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> studio id Software are now home to a "wall-to-wall" union according to the Communications Workers of America (CWA). The organisation have announced that a group of 165 id workers have just voted to unionise, adding to the ranks of the 300 ZeniMax quality assurance staff who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">unionised back in 2023</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the CWA's press release, Microsoft have already recognised this latest union - which is made up of "developers, artists, programmers, and more" - in accordance with the <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/">labour neutrality agreement</a> the two parties agreed in 2022.</p>
<p>"The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it’s incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives," said id Software producer and CWA organising committee member Andrew Willis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, id lead services programmer and CWA committee member Chris Hays specifically cited remote staff not being dragged into the office as a reason behind the push for representation. "Remote work isn’t a perk," he said. "It’s a necessity for our health, our families, and our access needs. RTO policies should not be handed down from executives with no consideration for accessibility or our well-being."</p><p>The CWA release also cited "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass industry layoffs</a>, sudden periods of crunch time, and unfair pay" as part of the impetus behind a wider push towards unionisation among devs across the industry this year, adding that the total of unionised workers across Microsoft's fiefdom is now "nearly 4,000" strong.</p>
<p>CWA president Ron Swaggerty added that the union "look forward to sitting across the table from Microsoft to negotiate a contract that reflects the skill, creativity, and dedication these workers bring to every project."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, members of the "industry-wide union" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-games-industry-is-broken-say-the-cwa-so-theyre-building-an-industry-wide-union">the CWA announced</a> earlier this year <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1999257505751532008">held a protest</a> outside of The Game Awards yesterday, with their aim being to "to acknowledge the video games and studios that have been closed and to also condemn the creativity that’s been crushed by corporate greed and studio executives".
</p>
<p>Solidarity to these id Software workers.</p>
