            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/19/rack-and-slay-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Roguelikes are a pretty diverse bunch, even if there’s a glut of action RPGs and deckbuilders in the form, but using billiards as inspiration stands out as particularly unique, introducing some entertaining ideas. In Rack and Slay, you navigate a dungeon as a billiard ball, encountering treasures, traps, enemies, and various power-ups along the way.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rack and Slay - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Un1CHEXAZnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s no deep storytelling in Rack and Slay, the game firmly set in the casual, pickup and play category. The controls will be familiar to anyone who has played a pool or snooker game before – you aim where you want the ball to go and then power up the shot, releasing the ball to hopefully do what you want – but this is not your standard game of billiards.</p>


<p>For one thing, pockets are located in random places, sometimes the traditional corners, and sometimes in the middle of the table, and they can be different sizes. For another, there’s other hazards to watch out for, with wall spikes, bombs, bear traps, and portals all posing a risk to your billiard ball. Your billiard ball has a health bar too, with any unwanted impact doing a point damage.</p>


<p>The aim is to pot all of the enemy balls within a set number of shots and without incurring too much damage. If you run out of shots, each of the remaining enemy balls does a point of damage to you. If you do not have enough health points, then your run is over. If you do survive this final attack, you will move onto the next dungeon with your reduced health.</p>
<p>Rack and Slay is a roguelike though, and with that comes upgrades and abilities. Between each dungeon you will be able to select random ability cards, as well as use any gold you have collected to recover health, increase your shot power, increase the number of shots you have per level, and add more abilities. These abilities include being able shoot out mini billiard balls when you launch the main ball, become invulnerable to traps, gain health and gold, and increase shot power. There are dozens of ability cards to unlock, and some also stack.</p>

<p>The main game has you rolling through a maximum of ten dungeons, at the end of which is a boss 8 ball that has to be pocketed last to be defeated. Once you beat the ten dungeons, an endless mode option is presented, challenging you to make as much progress as possible. There is even a warning that you could break the game as you can keep unlocking and stacking abilities on this run.</p>
<p>Speaking of challenges, Rack and Slay does have a challenge mode with specific modifiers enabled. For example, the Drunken Master challenge will sometimes see your ball go in the opposite direction than the one you intended, while Bouncyland makes level obstacles all bouncy. These challenges are fun to play through and, just like a normal run, you can enter an endless mode on these too.</p>
<p>There are different enemy billiard types present in Rack and Slay, and these are perhaps the most disappointing part of the game. Just like your ball, the majority cannot move unless they are hit, including bosses. There are a couple that can move of their own accord, but they won’t hit you the majority of the time. &nbsp;Some enemies can fire projectiles, but most of these won’t hit you either. The only enemy that stood out as giving a challenge is the blinding enemy. Hit this, and for the next turn you will not be able to see your aim trajectory. Enemy spawns can also be an issue, especially if they have gathered in a particular area that you cannot get to easily.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paramount-cancels-halo-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount has canceled the controversial&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>TV series after just two seasons, but it looks like the show's producers aren't giving up on it just yet.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-2-seasons-1235952581/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Hollywood Reporter</a> (which cites a statement from Paramount), the series' second and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/halo-tv-season-2-review-how-far-should-artistic-license-go">most recent season</a>, which aired in March, will be its last on the Paramount+ platform.</p>
<p>In the statement, Paramount says it's "extremely proud" of the series, which it calls "ambitious", and wishes the show's producers and cast "the best going forward". If the Hollywood Reporter is to be believed, there will be a "going forward" after all, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-tv-series-canceled-helmet.jpg?itok=zNwnD3zL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-tv-series-canceled-helmet.jpg?itok=z1lf7zls 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>TV series won't be appearing on Paramount+ anymore, but it may still have a future.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the Hollywood Reporter's sources, the producers of the show, which is to say Xbox, longtime&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>developer 343 Industries, and production company Amblin, will search for another platform for the show to call home.</p>
<p>343 Industries says it remains "committed to broadening the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>universe in different ways in the future", so even if this particular show doesn't stick around, another one may well take its place.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>TV series originally premiered in spring 2022 after its debut trailer was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-tv-show-premiering-first-trailer-at-game-awards">shown during the previous year's Game Awards</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its first season met with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/halo-tv-show-lore-universe">a polarized response</a> from fans, with some praising its action sequences and others decrying what they perceived as significant changes to the original games' lore and narrative elements.</p>

<p>The second season of&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>was met with a more positive reception by fans and critics alike, but it looks like the improvements it made weren't enough for Paramount to consider it a going concern.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>series will end up on a different streaming service in the future, but for now, it looks like you're going to have to wait a while to get more live-action Master Chief. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>.</p>

<p>"The Muckingham Files have returned in PowerWash Simulator's latest free content update," developer FuturLab teased as it marks PowerWash Simulator's second "Washer-Versary".</p>
<p>"As part of our Washer-Versary celebration this update brings you two brand new maps to clean, voted for by the community! Take a day trip to a filthy Aquarium, then deep clean a Submarine in Muckingham docks."</p>
<p>PowerWash Simulator's previous premium expansion fell down the rabbit hole for an adventure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulators-alices-adventures-dlc-gets-july-release-date">inspired by Lewis Caroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>.</p>
<p>"PowerWash Simulator may feel like a sleeper hit, but veteran UK developer FuturLab knew early on it had something special on its hands," Tom wrote in his fabulous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-powerwash-simulator-and-developer-futurlab">interview with FuturLab boss, James Marsden</a>.
</p>
<p>"A brilliant blend of compulsive yet cosy gameplay, PowerWash Simulator sounds an unlikely concept - and yet it has found a legion of fans who don't want to stop playing. Now, with the successful launch of its first paid DLC - based on SpongeBob SquarePants - safely tucked under its belt, I'm keen to find out what's next for the game, and for FuturLab itself."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ftc-files-complaint-against-microsoft-following-game-pass-price-hike.931731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-complaint-against-microsoft-following-game-pass-price-hike/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The US FTC (Federal Trade Commission) has <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453.121.0_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> a new complaint to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit against Microsoft following the recent Game Pass price hike, alleging that this is exactly the type of post-merger behavior they wanted to prevent by blocking the acquisition. Here's an excerpt from the complaint filed by FTC counsel Imad Abyad:</p>
<p><em>Product degradation—removing the most valuable games from Microsoft’s new service—combined with price increases for existing users, is exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged. </em><em>Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation—combined with Microsoft’s reduced </em><em>investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs—are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger.</em></p>
<p><em>Importantly, Microsoft’s actions are inconsistent with Microsoft’s representations below. Microsoft’s price increases coincide with adding “Call of Duty” (CoD) to Game Pass’s most expensive tier, and discontinuing the Console tier will happen shortly before releasing CoD’s newest game. Below, Microsoft promised that “the acquisition would benefit consumers by making [CoD] available on Microsoft’s Game Pass on the day it is released on console (with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition).” Microsoft’s post-merger actions thus vindicate the congressional design of preliminarily halting mergers to fully evaluate their likely competitive effects, and judicial skepticism of promises inconsistent with a firm’s economic incentives.</em></p>
<p>It is true that Microsoft lawyers <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-wont-increase-in-price-even-after-abk-merger-says-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> in their memorandum defense against the FTC's motion for a preliminary injunction to block the Activision Blizzard merger that there would be no Game Pass price increase. However, this promise was non-binding, and most consumers already expected a price increase following the addition of Activision Blizzard's prized portfolio to the subscription service. Diablo IV was added to Game Pass in late March, and rumors suggest <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-is-coming-to-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-activision-blizzard-games-are-reportedly-launching-on-game-pass-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other ABK games</a> might be joining soon. Besides, Microsoft's subscription service is hardly the only one to have raised its pricing plans recently. Ultimately, customers will decide whether the new price is too high.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the FTC is still waiting on its appeal against the Microsoft/Activision Blizzard merger lodged a while ago at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The chances of the Federal Trade Commission being able to unwind the acquisition seem slim at this point, but cannot be altogether discounted.</p>

            <p>
Devolver has announced Forestrike, a "tactical kung-fu fighter" from the developer of Olija.
</p>
<p>
Players will take the role of martial artist Yu who's blessed with the Foresight, which allows him to perceive battles in his mind ahead of time to find a winning sequence, before enacting the movements in reality.
</p>
<p>
Progression is through a roguelike game loop, providing unique encounters each run for players to perceive in advance.

<p>

Forestrike is set for release in 2025 for both Nintendo Switch and Steam. Attendees of Japan's BitSummit event this weekend can test out a demo.
</p>
<p>
The game is being developed by Japanese studio Skeleton Crew, who previously made Olija - also published by Devolver.
</p>
<p>
That was released in 2021 and received a Recommended badge in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olija-review-a-brisk-adventure-with-a-harpoon">Eurogamer Olija review</a>. It's a 2D pixel art adventure featuring a harpoon for both combat and traversal. "A brilliant central mechanic and a game of real craft and character," wrote Eurogamer's Christian Donlan.

Forestrike therefore aims to continue "the studio's unique artistic style, combat and fantasy-based storytelling", according to Devolver.

Last month at its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-drifter-developers-next-game-spearheads-devolver-direct">Devolver Direct event</a>, the publisher unveiled more games in its future, including Hyper Light Drifter developer Heart Machine's next game Possessor(s), Tenjutsu from the designer of Dead Cells, and "thirst-person shooter" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-crush-house-is-a-thirst-person-shooter-that-holds-a-mirror-to-reality-tv-production">The Crush House</a>.

            <p>Like many an addled follower of the games industry, I have recently fallen under the spell of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>, and especially, its jokers. The mechanics and overall presentation may be exquisite, but it’s the thrill of discovering another mutant jester modifier that has me lunging for the Steam Deck in my sleep. Well, now those jokers have competition: ducks. Step or rather waddle forward Placid Plastic Deck - A Quiet Quest, a quacked-up card battler which somehow takes inspiration from both the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon</a> series and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a>.</p>

<p>In A Quiet Quest you play Zoi, a pixelart lassie of the top-down RPG persuasion, who has recently fallen out with her best friend. Zoi’s method of mending the dispute? Assemble the ultimate deck of duck cards, a dueck if you will. These ducks ain’t just the usual mud-shuffling oafs who stink up my local park with their raucous cries and open-air breeding, mind you. They include Shark Ducks, Hypno Ducks, Bee Ducks and the quintessential Yellow Duck – the Mickey Mouse of the clutch. My favourite so far is the Marble Duck, an Ozymandian totem of mystique.</p>
<p>How exactly you’ll play cards with these adorable avians remains to be seen, but it seems to involve tiered, aqua-blue playing boards that tantalise and confuse with whirring cogwork and some kind of duck progression pond on the left.</p>
<p>All this unfolds in “a world of magical realism filled with both good and not-so-good, ordinarily weird characters”. The Inscryption parallels may not be so apparent in the announcement trailer above – they are rather more so in the previous teaser, which you can find on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510020/Placid_Plastic_Deck__A_Quiet_Quest/">the Steam page</a>. Friends, I fear these supposedly "placid" ducks may be lying to us in some way. I fear this quest may not be so quiet after all. There's no release date yet.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo has announced plans for a big September in-game event for Splatoon 3, accompanied by the launch of new amiibo figurines. 
</p>
<p>
Fans say this autumn's Grand Festival will likely mark the end of new content for the paint-based shooter threequel, akin to Splatoon 2's Final Fest - though the possibility of other, returning Splatfests remains.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo will launch four new amiibo figures on 4th September, divided into two specific packs: the Side Order Set featuring Pearl and Marina, as well as the Alterna Set featuring favourites Callie and Marie.

<p>
Splatoon 3's Grand Festival is set to run from 13th to 16th September, and feature a new hub area. The Squid Sisters, Off the Hook and Deep Cut will all feature, and the theme will be Past vs Present vs Future.

<p>
Which option will you pick? And how will the results play out in Splatoon's future? Fans of Nintendo's messy shooter and its inky inhabitants will just have to wait and see. 
</p>
<p>
A Splatoon 4 seems inevitable, though it may be some time before Nintendo is ready to make that announcement. The company has a final array of games for Switch scheduled to arrive over the rear of this year, before it turns its attention to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> in 2025.
</p>
<p>Fancy spending more on Switch 1 in the meantime? You can purchase a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/seven-years-after-switchs-launch-nintendo-unveils-joy-con-charging-stand">new Joy-Con charging stand</a> beginning in October.</p>

            <p>
Images showing Jack Black as Minecraft character Steve have leaked online, giving the internet an early look at how the upcoming Warner Bros-backed Minecraft movie plans to stylise Mojang's blocky world. 
</p>
<p>
The designs, which reportedly first surfaced via notorious webforum 4chan, are <a href="https://twitter.com/katsterlingfan/status/1814082541902856273">now</a> being <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshuaTookes/status/1814085730081071372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">pulled</a> from social media platform X by copyright claims, Eurogamer has noticed. The takedowns all but confirm the images' legitimacy. 
</p>
<p>
Photos show a bearded Jack Black wearing Steve's trademark blue shirt and jeans, holding a blocky pickaxe. Other images show a mossy-looking Creeper, cuboid bee and a rather cross-eyed pink sheep.

<p>
The images are accompanied by text identifying them as coming from a "packaging guide" document, put together by Mojang to provide advice for prospective marketing partners. 
</p>
<p>
This text also gives us a brief synopsis of the Minecraft film's plot, which will apparently see Jack Black's Steve captured by an evil entity known as Malgosha, and then needing to be rescued by "four fresh visitors" to the Minecraft world. 
</p>
<p>
Mojang and Warner Bros. have so far kept their Minecraft film project under-wraps, though reporting in the US film trades <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jack-black-reportedly-to-star-as-minecrafts-steve-in-upcoming-film">picked up Black's casting back in January</a>. Black acknowledged this at the time with a social media post showing him reading a Minecraft guidebook. 
</p>
<p>
Previous reporting has linked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jason-momoa-reportedly-joining-cast-of-minecraft-live-action-film">Aquaman star Jason Momoa to the movie</a>, which will also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-to-begin-filming-in-new-zealand-later-this-year">apparently feature the game's climactic Ender Dragon</a>.

<p>
The timing of this leak is interesting, coming just days after Jack Black hit the headlines for a comment made by his Tenacious D bandmate Kyle Gass regarding the attempted assassination of former President Trump, and the subsequent cancellation of the band's ongoing world tour. 
</p>
<p>
Black has faced criticism online for his handling of the matter - both from fans enraged at the tour's cancellation and others upset at Gass' original comment. For now, Tenacious D seems unlikely to tour again before the upcoming US election, amidst an increasingly fraught US political climate.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Warner Bros for comment.

            <p>Devolver have just announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forestrike">Forestrike</a>, a 2D kung-fu game where you're <em>not</em> smashing buttons in a beat 'em up format. Instead, you use your supernatural time-bending abilities to tactically dispatch goons in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> bash through increasingly difficult levels. It looks like a mixture of things: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katana-zero">Katana Zero</a>, Aesthetically Cool Stuff In General.</p>

<p>In Forestrike, you play as Yu, a martial artist who's trying to free the emperor from an evil admiral's influence. Presumably, pulling the admiral aside for a quick chat hasn't cut it. So Yu does what anyone would do: use his Foresight ability to mentally pre-roll fights over and over again, so he can plan and annihilate anyone and anything that stands in his way.</p>

<p>Each mission starts with Yu surrounded by mobs of lads who aren't happy to see you. What you'll do is use Foresight to experiment, free of consequence. This might involve, say, seeing what might happen if you dodge a thrown spear, then roundhouse the lad creeping up behind you. Once you've seen what happens, good or bad, you can rewind time and execute the right sequence of moves to finish the fight perfectly.</p>
<p>According to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2325920/Forestrike/">Steam page</a> and the trailer above, there's upgradeable and customisable movesets and a map, where you decide after each mission what you'd like to do. For instance, rest at an inn, fight more baddies, maybe learn some fearsome uppercut. It looks like there's a passive upgrade called "Wild Reflexes" that lets you grab thrown objects in mid-air, then fling whatever it is back into the chops of the assailant. Sold.</p>
<p>I'm curious to see how the devs Skeleton Crew Studio and Thomas Olsson balance Foresight so there's just the right amount of trial and error to its reactive, real-time kung-fu-ing. I'm sure Foresight will be a thing you can only activate a few times per fight, maybe even less on tougher difficulties. Heck, I can see there being a Foresight-less mode.</p>
<p>Forestrike is out sometime in 2025 and you can keep up with it over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2325920/Forestrike/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>
Sega has unveiled a first look at two new Shadow x Sonic Generations levels, delving into the Sonic nemesis' past.
</p>
<p>
As with the original Sonic Generations, the new separate Shadow campaign will reimagine stages from Shadow's past. So far we've seen the Space Colony level, inspired by Sonic Adventure 2's Final Chase.
</p>
<p>
Now, in a new teaser video comparing old and new, two more stages have been revealed based on zones from Sonic Heroes and 2006's Sonic the Hedgehog.
</p>

<p>

Sonic Heroes, released in 2003, has players controlling a trio of characters at once, but here it's stripped back to just Shadow. The stage is based on Rail Canyon, which has Shadow hopping between rails and avoiding trains through a rocky canyon. 
</p>
<p>
Then the trailer cuts to a level based on Sonic 06's Kingdom Valley, which features runways and rails around a giant stone castle. The original game was widely panned, so here's hoping Sonic x Shadow Generations can vastly improve this particular level.
</p>
<p>
The teaser provides a look at what we can expect from the Shadow campaign, both in gameplay terms and visuals. Needless to say, it all looks faster, sharper, and smoother compared to the original levels - see for yourself below.

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-the-best-of-00s-sonic-with-a-big-dash-of-nostalgia">Head of Sonic Team Takashi Iizuka told Eurogamer</a> the new Shadow levels would feature "a lot of iconic moments from Shadow's past in the new gameplay", and that certainly rings true from this new footage.
</p>
<p>
Still, we're yet to see the White Space level select area for Shadow, which Iizuka said expands upon the Open Zone gameplay from Sonic Frontiers.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-release-date-leaks-ahead-of-potential-summer-game-fest-reveal">Sonic x Shadow Generations is set for release on 25th October</a> across PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam).

Given Crowdstrike works with 25,000 businesses, and how integral Windows is to the running of so many of the world’s computers, this error has had monumental consequences.</p><p>American Airlines grounded all its flights this morning (although as of 6.30 a.m. says they’re beginning to run again), alongside many other airlines around the world. KLM reported that the circumstances made “flight handling impossible.” At the time of writing, Delta’s flights were still all paused.</p><p>In Australia and Europe, where the outages have had a greater effect due to their days starting hours earlier, hospitals have reported having to cancel operations, while in the UK almost all GP practices had to stop seeing all but the most urgent patients. </p><p>Grocery stores found they couldn’t take payments, DC’s Metro stopped running, entire TV networks were unable to broadcast, and in Alaska, 911 systems broke down.</p><p>In the last few minutes, Crowdstrike has confirmed that its software appears to be the cause, after many other major firms speculated that this was the case. The company released a statement saying that the “defect” had been found, and that “a fix has been deployed.” The firm also made clear that this wasn’t a cyberattack. Here’s the statement in full:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Crowdstrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts.</p><p>Mac and Linux hosts are not impacted. This is not a security incident or cyberattack.</p><p>The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed.</p><p>We refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website.</p><p>We further recommend organisations ensure they’re communicating with Crowdstrike representatives through official channels.</p><p>Our team is fully mobilised to ensure the security and stability of Crowdstrike customers.</p></blockquote><p>Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.today.com/video/crowdstrike-ceo-shares-what-spurred-global-outage-215232069726&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.today.com/video/crowdstrike-ceo-shares-what-spurred-global-outage-215232069726" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke to NBC’s <em>Today </em>this morning</a></span>, during which he apologized for the “impact that we caused to customers, travelers, to anyone affected by this.”</p><p>He added during the live interview, “It’s been a long night but we are rebooting systems. So, it could be some time for some systems, that just automatically won’t recover. Our mission is to...make sure every customer is fully recovered.”</p><p>The BBC in the UK is also reporting that it won’t be as simple as rolling out a patch. Given the issue is causing computers to BSOD, an enormous amount of the fix could involve hands-on rebooting of machines, and Crowdstrike is very widely used. The BBC’s correspondent reported, “It...appears to be not something that can be fixed with a central command from an IT administrator in a firm’s HQ. They will need to go and reboot each and every computer affected.”<br></p><p>Comparisons are being drawn with 2017's WannaCry cyberattacks in terms of the scale of the problems caused, however many places that were affected are reporting that services are resuming as the morning goes on.</p><p>This will lead to enormous questions in the coming days over how vulnerable the modern internet is to something as simple as a single software update. 2024's internet doesn’t represent that of twenty years ago, with three companies now running almost everything: Microsoft, Amazon and Google. When something affects just one of these three, the results are international and catastrophic, as we’ve seen today.</p><p>However, at least <em>Kotaku</em> is still running.</p><p><strong>Updated: 07/19/2024, 8:23 a.m. ET:</strong> Added information about Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz’s confirmation and apology.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ftc-criticizes-xbox-game-pass-price-hike-labeling-it-consumer-harm/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Microsoft<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-game-pass-prices-by-as-much-as-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> recently announced </a>that it would increase the prices of the Xbox Game Pass tiers and introduce a new ‘Standard’ tier into the lineup. However, this decision has caused some issues for the company, as the FTC lodged a letter with the US Court of Appeals, alleging that Microsoft’s action of raising the prices of the Xbox Game Pass tiers is harming consumers.</p>



<p>According to the FTC’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24852374-24-07-18-ftc-letter-re-microsoft-game-pass-price-increases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">letter</a>, Microsoft’s decision to exclude the most valuable games from their new service is a form of ‘consumer harm’ and ‘product degradation’. The absence of Day One releases in the new Standard tier is a key point of contention.</p>



<p>The FTC’s letter further suggests that these changes and “reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs” indicate “the firm exercising market power post-merger.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Game Pass - Discover It All" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-rUEWRG8hp8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The FTC additionally claimed that this hike for the Xbox Game Pass tiers will “coincide with” Microsoft adding Call Of Duty games to the most expensive tiers in their service and that “discontinuing the Console tier will happen shortly before releasing CoD’s newest game.”</p>



<p>FTC concluded that Microsoft had promised this acquisition would “benefit consumers” as they would provide Call of Duty titles on Game Pass the day they were released without increasing the price of the service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microsoft made history last year when it acquired Activision Blizzard for a record sum of $69 billion. However, several regulators accused the console manufacturer of being anti-competitive, and Microsoft had to overcome many obstacles before finalizing the deal. Although Microsoft managed to handle all the cases, the FTC wouldn’t let them off the hook so quickly.</p>



<p>FTC filed an appeal late last year to overrule the decision and recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ftc-microsoft-activision-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a notice </a>against Microsoft for the Activision Blizzard layoffs. Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-responds-to-ftc-claims-against-activision-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> to the previous claim and would likely respond to the one related to Xbox Game Pass price hikes, too.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Paramount has cancelled their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-tv-series">live-action adaptation of the Halo</a> video game series after a two season run on the Paramount+ streaming service.</p>
<p>“Paramount+ can confirm that ‘Halo’ will not move forward with a third season on the service,” the company said in a statement reported on by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-1236075994/">Variety</a>. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.”</p>


<p>Having been developed in 2013 with Steven Spielberg named as an executive producer and his Amblin production company having a key role alongside Showtime and 343 Industries, Halo eventually debuted in 2022 to a… mixed reaction. A number of key narrative decisions confounded fans, such as the decision to tell the story in an alternate ‘Silver’ universe, from having a face reveal for Master Chief actor Pablo Schrieber in the very first episode, to romantic plots and sex scenes, disliked original characters and more. However, there were some glimmers of what Halo could be, with a bombastic set piece battle in the middle of the series garnering praise.</p>
<p>Original showrunners Kyle Killen and Steven Kane were replaced for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/16/halo-tv-series-already-renewed-for-a-second-season/">Season 2</a> by David Wiener, and the second season in general had a much better reaction from critics, telling the story of the downfall of Reach and building up to the story of the original game that would have been told in Season 3.</p>

<p>Microsoft are reportedly trying to see if there’s interest from another broadcast partner, but given the middling reaction to Halo when stacked up alongside the huge plaudits and viewership of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/04/the-last-of-us-tv-show-official-trailer-is-out-now/">The Last of Us</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/11/fallout-season-1/">Fallout</a> TV shows, it doesn’t feel likely.</p>

The US Federal Trade Commission have slammed Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pc-and-xbox-game-pass-are-getting-a-worldwide-price-hike">recently announced Game Pass price hikes</a> as "exactly the sort of consumer harm" they claimed would result from the Xbox publisher's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">now-completed acquisition of Activision-Blizzard</a>.
</p>

<p>
Microsoft unveiled global price increases for their console and PC subscription business earlier this month. Amongst other jumps, the price of a PC Game Pass has risen from $9.99, €9.99 or £7.99 per month to $11.99, €11.99 and £9.99. They've also canned the Xbox Game Pass For Console package in favour of a new Standard tier for console users, which doesn't include day-one access to new games, such as the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>. The FTC argue that this latter move, in particular, is evidence of Microsoft using the ActiBlizz deal to strongarm their existing subscribers into paying more.
</p>
<p>
In a letter sent to the US Court of Appeals this week, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24852374-24-07-18-ftc-letter-re-microsoft-game-pass-price-increases">shared around online by Gamesfray</a>, FTC counsel Imad D. Abyad characterises the pricing changes as a straightforward exercise in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>.</p>
<p>The FTC argue that Game Pass Standard is a "degraded product", which essentially forces Console Game Pass users to upgrade to Ultimate to get access to the same games. "Product degradation - removing the most valuable games from Microsoft's new service - combined with price increases for existing users, is exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged," Abyad writes. The letter notes that "discontinuing the Console tier will happen shortly before releasing CoD's newest game" - existing Game Pass subscribers will have to change over to one of the new packages on 12th September 2024, with Black Ops 6 releasing on 25th October.
</p>
<p>
The letter also points out that the price jump is "inconsistent" with a statement Microsoft made last year that Game Pass wouldn't get more expensive after Activision-Blizzard's games joined the roster. Back then, Microsoft argued that "the acquisition would benefit consumers by making [Call of Duty] available on Microsoft's Game Pass on the day it is released on console (with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition), on Nintendo, and on other services that allow cloud streaming". 
</p>
<p>
As Kotaku <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-ftc-black-ops-6-appeal-1851599323">comments</a>, Microsoft could argue here that the price changes aren't connected to the $68.7 billion acquisition, but part of a larger product strategy. I think it's safe to say that Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/phil-spencer-hints-at-a-future-game-pass-price-hike">have been thinking about raising Game Pass prices for a while</a>. The timing is certainly rather convenient, however.
</p>
<p>
The FTC also present Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">recent enormous mass layoffs</a> in the wake of the deal as another example of the company's leadership using their vastly expanded market power to steer the fortunes of the whole industry, and make life worse for players. "Microsoft's price increases and product degradation - combined with Microsoft's reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs [...] are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger," Abyad argues.
</p>
<p>
The letter concludes that "Microsoft's post-merger actions thus vindicate the congressional design of preliminarily halting mergers to fully evaluate their likely competitive effects, and judicial skepticism of promises inconsistent with a firm's economic incentives." It's not clear when the court might respond to the letter, or what the outcome might be.

            <p>
The creators of the cult classic Chibi-Robo! series have announced a spiritual successor, koROBO.
</p>
<p>
Key members of Chibi-Robo!'s development team are working on the project together under the banner of Tiny Wonder Studios, following the closure of their previous studio Skip back in 2020. Founded in 2000, Skip worked closely with Nintendo on more than two dozen games, including Japan-only cult classics such as GameCube title GiFTPiA and bizarre Wii game Captain Rainbow.
</p>
<p>
As in Chibi-Robo!, Tiny Wonder Studios' koROBO features a tiny household robot embarking on an adventure across the bedroom of his 10-year-old owner and beyond. The little robot will clean up mess and solve various issues around the house, but with a limited battery must bathe in sunlight to recharge at regular intervals.

<p>
The story and setting features plenty of humour too: the family home koROBO cleans is in New Yock City, while the cast includes the suspicious figure of Garth Vader.
</p>
<p>
Tiny Wonder Studios has also hinted at time travel for koROBO, suggesting puzzle solving should ramp up in challenge.

<p>
The original Chibi-Robo! was developed by Skip and published by Nintendo for the GameCube in 2005. A number of sequels were developed for the Nintendo DS and 3DS, but were mostly popular in Japan. 
</p>
<p>
Tiny Wonder Studios is aiming for release across PC and modern consoles should enough funding be achieved, but it's launching crowdfunding next week to gather support from fans. You can support the developers via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tinywonderstudio/korobo">Kickstarter</a> from 22nd July.
</p>
<p>
"Our goal is to create a game that everyone can enjoy, so koROBO is intended to be a cosy and comfy game that we hope everyone will fall in love with," said director Kenichi Nishi. "The core of koROBO is all about bringing people together and working towards a better tomorrow and this campaign, combined with your support, is a wonderful opportunity to bring fans of video games together - something that would make our tiny hero proud!"

            <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has slammed Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass tier changes as a "degraded product", citing that by "removing the most valuable games from Microsoft's new service", Microsoft has delivered "exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged".</p>
<p>Microsoft confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">sweeping changes - including price increases - to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service</a> earlier this month. The changes come ahead of October's launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which will include the removal of day one releases for its overhauled basic tier.</p>

<p>The FTC's filing with the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals added that Microsoft's announcement shows why it's necessary to "halt mergers to fully evaluate their likely competitive effects", and is "inconsistent" with what Microsoft said when the FTC initially intervened to prevent its acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p>
<p>"Product degradation – removing the most valuable games from Microsoft's new service – combined with price increases for existing users, is exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged," the filing said.</p>
<p>"Microsoft's price increases and product degradation – combined with Microsoft's reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs – are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger.</p>
<p>"Microsoft promised that 'the acquisition would benefit consumers by making [Call of Duty] available on Microsoft's Game Pass on the day it is released on console (with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition)'."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-layoffs-contradict-what-was-said-in-activision-antitrust-trial-ftc-says">FTC claimed that its planned layoff of 1900 people across Xbox and Activision Blizzard went against what was said in court last year,</a> in regards to how Activision would remain structurally independent.</p>
<p>"In continuing its opposition to the deal, the FTC ignores the reality that the deal itself has substantially changed," a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to Eurogamer at the time.</p>
<p>"Since the FTC lost in court last July, Microsoft was required by the UK competition authority to restructure the acquisition globally and therefore did not acquire the cloud streaming rights to Activision Blizzard games in the United States. Additionally, Sony and Microsoft signed a binding agreement to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation on even better terms than Sony had before."</p>

			<p>The Halo TV show has been canceled by Paramount after two seasons, as confirmed in a statement released <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-2-seasons-1235952581/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p>
<p><em>We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work. We wish everyone the best going forward.</em></p>
<p>Franchise developer 343 Industries also shared a statement:</p>
<p><em>We deeply appreciate the millions of fans who propelled the Halo series to be a global success, and we remain committed to broadening the Halo universe in different ways in the future. We are grateful to Amblin and Paramount for their partnership in bringing our expansive sci-fi universe to viewers around the world.</em></p>
<p>While the first season of the Paramount show definitely had its ups and downs, the second season was a marked improvement, so this decision is a bit disappointing. Thankfully, it's not over yet, as producers at Amblin, Xbox, and 343 Industries are trying to find other channels/streaming partners, and Paramount is reportedly supportive of the endeavor. The Halo series may still continue elsewhere.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Fallout TV show has no such problems, following an <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-could-now-last-five-seasons-after-immensely-surprising-popularity-say-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent debut season</a> that just earned it 17 nominations for 16 Emmy awards, including the Outstanding Drama category. While it will be tough to beat the likes of Shogun and The Bear, the series will probably be able to grab a few prizes at least. Moreover, Amazon head of TV Vernon Sanders <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/fallout-season-2-red-white-and-royal-blue-sequel-amazon-tease-1236076344/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Variety</a> that season 2 of the Fallout TV show is actually ahead of schedule:</p>
<p><em>We’ve been fortunate because this was the vision all along. I think we’re ahead of schedule, in terms of being able to get Season 2 back. We don’t have an exact launch date yet, but we’ve already gotten scripts in hand, and I think the fans of Season 1 will really love where we’re going for Season 2.</em></p>

<p>In the opening fixtures of the ongoing Call of Duty League Championship, some huge upsets were landed across the board. While mostly predictable, one of the most stunning results came from LA Thieves, with the four-man squad punishing Toronto Ultra and booting the team into the elimination bracket. </p>



<p>Ultra, which historically has fallen short when it comes time to clutch up, will now need to fight tooth and nail in the lower bracket to make it to Championship Sunday.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-thieves-steal-a-win">Thieves Steal a Win</h2>



<p>It wasn’t an easy win by any means, but the LA Thieves managed to stay icy and secure the victory over Toronto Ultra, with Thieves’ Ghosty throwing a few choice words across the stage at Toronto’s Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst.</p>



<p>Following a dominant opening Hardpoint, Toronto Ultra responded by sweeping Thieves 6 – 0 in the round of Search. That’s where it went awry for Ultra, with the team succumbing to a loss in both the Control and second Hardpoint. Now, the LA Thieves will try and score against OpTic Texas, while Toronto has been sent down into the elimination bracket to fight an increasingly capable Los Angeles Guerrillas.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, COD Champs is unfolding as we expected, which makes securing those predictions much simpler. Atlanta FaZe beat the Miami Heretics, and the New York Subliners secured a close win over Seattle Surge, with both losing teams being catapulted into the lower bracket. </p>



<p>Today, we’ve got some stunning matches on the line:</p>



<ul>
<li>Miami Heretics vs. Seattle Surge (elimination)</li>



<li>Toronto Ultra vs. LA Guerrillas (elimination)</li>



<li>LA Thieves vs. OpTic Texas (winners)</li>



<li>Atlanta FaZe vs. New York Subliners (winners)</li>
</ul>



<p>Remember – there’s a whopping $2.3 million on the line, and the winner will receive $1.2 million, one of the largest single-team prizes in esports. There’s so much to play for this weekend.</p>

            <p>Over the past few weeks, my review schedule has involved kicking dudes, shooting dudes, war, eldritch busses, and diseased rats. I did not know  how utterly burnt out I was on violence and misery until I held one of pet <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> Bobo Bay’s sentient blob critters in my arms and lavished snacks upon it. When I close my eyes, I can still hear <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/conscript">Conscript</a>’s shells falling in the distance. But here and now, there are only Bobos, the races they take part in, and the idyllic bay in which they reside.</p>

<p>Despite not having played it myself, I gather that Bobo Bay is inspired by the Chao Gardens from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-adventure-2">Sonic Adventure</a>. My ambivalence towards said hedgehog has not prevented me locating meditative joy in gallivanting about Bobo Bay, stealing creatures from the nearby forest, and stuffing cakes in their faces. The snacks boost your Bobo’s stats, which help them crush the cuddly competition in a series of races. You don’t actually control these races, but they are very short, and also allow you to aid your entrant via a hype button. You can pet the Bobos. You can accessorise them with hats. You can mash them together to create new ones. It’s a nice place to be!</p>
<p>“There are thousands of combinations of Bobos you can make,” reads the Steam page, with justified enthusiasm. “Body color, eye color, body part shapes, patterns, sheens, stats, personality traits, etc will all change with each Bobo you find or mash! Distinct Bobo traits and moods will completely change how you interact and care for your Bobos. Don't forget to dress them up in a fancy little top hat as well.”</p>
<p>“Races are the main event in this Bobo world,” it continues. “Different companies and organizations from around the globe sponsor different competition series and award unique prizes! Bring your Bobos along to the BRAND NEW AND VERY CLEAN SPORTS COMPLEX to enter them into a competition.”</p>
<p>When the character you play as moves around the world, she occasionally sticks out her arms like an aeroplane. If you wish, you can pick the Bobos up, throw them long distances, then continue to run around like an aeroplane. This, to me, is kino. There’s a demo on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1889810/Bobo_Bay/">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Many moons ago, I remember having a chat with Brendy about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-exodus">Metro Exodus</a>’s choice to have characters frequently speak over each other in conversation. It’s something I always appreciate in films (Brendy mentioned Fleabag, I brought up Shane Meadows), and although the flow of many of Exodus’ scenes were quite awkward, it was still refreshing to see a game break away from the common, unnatural back-and-forth line delivery. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">Bioshock</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a>’s Ken Levine has a name for this - “turn-based dialogue.” According to Levine, it’s “one of the biggest problems” in the way games portray conversations.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“They often record actors separately,” Levine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyOLaw6LetM&amp;t=2443s">told Dan Allen Gaming</a> on YouTube. “then whoever is putting the dialogue together does this, what I call turn-based dialogue.” One actor says a line, there’s a fixed pause, another actor speaks. “That line plays. There's a half second buffer -  it's always the same level of buffer - the next line plays.”</p>

<p>Levine’s got a solution, too. His approach is to “edit them, you know, talking on top of each other. I really encourage the actors not to just read the perfect words as they're written, but to bring as much naturalism to even these fantastical characters as they can.” The result, Levine says, is a “more human read,” resulting in “way better sounding dialogue, even with the exact same writing, the exact same acting, just the editing process.”</p>
<p>“It's amazing how many games just have this pre-baked pause between each line,” he continues. “We really pay a lot of attention to the editing of the dialogue, even if they're recorded separately, so they feel a little more organic.”  In real conversation, says Levine, people interrupt each other and stumble over their words. “These are things that are hard sometimes to get [actors] to do, because they want to do a good job, and they don't want to mess up your lines. But I'd rather have my lines have a little bit of dirt and grit on them.”</p>
<p>I’m all for imperfections! The sterilisation of the human experience in the pursuit of an inoffensive, impersonalised glossiness is, hot take, bad for art and also culture, and anything that scrubs away at its calcification deserves a nice biscuit. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-did-a-medieval-peasants-raw-sour-breath-sound-like-manor-lords-composers-tell-us">I spoke to the composers</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-tips-and-tricks">Manor Lords</a> recently, and they told me how developer Greg Styczeń frequently opted for their less polished, bedroom mic takes over the studio edits.</p>
<p>So, I appreciate Levine’s approach here, even if he does admit in the interview that it’s his senior role and resources that allow him the luxury to focus on these things. In 2022, Bloomberg put out a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-03/bioshock-creator-s-next-game-and-its-narrative-legos-in-turmoil">report in which</a> former employees at Ghost Story Games alleged erratic mismanagement on Levine’s part, with one employee calling Levine “a very hard person to work for.”</p>
<p>Judas, Ghost Story Games’s upcoming project, is slated for release in March of next year. Levine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-has-roguelike-elements-organic-powers-and-non-linear-storytelling">spilled many details</a> earlier this year, including the presence of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/judas-has-reactive-difficulty-evil-dentist-chairs-and-a-giant-robot-dog-for-fast-travel">a giant robot dog for fast travel</a>. Fortunately, Alice Bell (RPS in peace) has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pre-emptive-backlash-to-backlash-to-positive-reviews-for-judas">preemptively speedran the entire discourse cycle</a>.</p>

<p>Fortnite could be getting boosted to a monumental level with 200-player lobbies soon, according to comments made by Epic Games CEO, Tim Sweeney. In a recent interview, Sweeney suggested that Fortnite and the infrastructure that supports the legendary battle royale game now has the ability to support 200-player lobbies, the likes of which have never been seen before.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-would-that-be-too-much">Would That Be Too Much?</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/sweeneystephenson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an interview with Matthew Ball</a>, Tim Sweeney spoke about all things Epic Games and Fortnite. The most interesting tidbit to come away from the discussion was the suggestion that Fortnite can technically support 200-player lobbies. </p>



<p>Here’s what Sweeney said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Why is <em>Fortnite: Battle Royale</em> 100 players? Well, because at the time we launched it we couldn’t make 200 players work on a server. Computers in the data center were just too slow.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Talking in the past tense is an indication that while Fortnite couldn’t support 200-player lobbies at launch, it <strong>can now</strong>. Sweeney went on to talk about the huge leaps the team is making in networking, server management, and player mapping. </p>



<p>Players have been quick to discuss the concept of a 200-player lobby, with some stressing that it would be a nightmarish scenario. Others have put forward a claim that it would only work in a Zero Build environment, as 200 unique players trying to build at the same time would be seriously taxing on the average server.</p>



<p>Would you like to play Fortnite with 199 other players?</p>

<p>In a recent financial update published by Ubisoft, it was revealed that the highly anticipated mobile games, The Division Resurgence and Rainbow Six Mobile, have been quietly pushed out of FY25 and into FY26. That means that they’ll be released in April 2025 at the earliest. This is particularly tough for The Division Resurgence, which was supposed to be released almost a year ago.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Ubisoft reported stellar financial results so far this year, aided massively by the arrival of XDefiant, which has exceeded expectations.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-delayed-again">Delayed Again</h2>



<p>In a statement made up as part of the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/3J1aM8p3bRqk3oSBRQPkFY/e2642b7dafe168b5c4ebb4acc9006f5f/Ubisoft_FY25_Q1_Sales_EN_vFinal.pdf?_gl=1*1df1573*_gcl_au*MTQ4NzMzNjg2MC4xNzE4NjkxMzU1*_ga*MTc1MDA4NTE1NC4xNzE4NjkxMzU2*_ga_C4N5020N2R*MTcyMTM0MjYzNS4yMC4wLjE3MjEzNDI2MzUuNjAuMC4w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent financial report</a>, Ubisoft wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The line-up for the rest of FY25 includes Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws. Rainbow Six® Mobile and The Division® Resurgence are no longer expected in FY25 as the teams are taking the necessary time to ensure that these experiences deliver on expectations with optimized KPIs in the context of a demanding yet very large market.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans have been waiting for the native mobile representations of The Division and Rainbow Six for quite some time. There are expectations that Rainbow Six Mobile will open up a new esports-focused avenue for the franchise, given that mobile esports are dramatically popular right now. The Division Resurgence is also expected to attract countless customers based on a free-to-play operating model.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is eager to get into the mobile market, which by numbers is the most lucrative market in gaming. In Q1 2024 – 2025, it was revealed that just 10% of net bookings were linked to mobile gaming at the firm.</p>



<p>Despite these pushbacks, Ubisoft is doing very well for itself, per the report. In May, XDefiant was released, and despite it also being free-to-play, various transactions written into the game have proven to be a success with the player base.</p>

<p>The Minecraft movie has been in production for quite a while, and thanks to a string of leaks and interviews, we know various things about it, such as the cast and some of the expected details of the story. Recently, an alleged style board from the production was leaked, showcasing the movie’s aesthetic and revealing how various elements of the film, such as the iconic ‘Creeper’, will look.</p>



<p>It’s kind of creepy – they’re pushing for a semi-realistic feel that kind of makes you feel uncomfortable.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-steve-has-a-beard-for-now">Steve Has a Beard… For Now</h2>



<p>In the rumoured images, we see Jack Black posing as Steve with a pixellated pickaxe, and he’s wearing Steve’s recognisable outfit – but aside from that, it’s just Jack Black. He even has his trademark bushy beard, which as we know, doesn’t gel with Steve as we know him. In the spiel that accompanies the images, we get the lowdown on Steve’s role in the movie:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Steve, played by Jack Black, has been resident in the Overworld for long enough that he crafted a blocky life for himself and made a best friend – his pet wolf, Dennis. But then the evil Malgosha captured him, now his freedom lies in the hands of four fresh visitors to his world…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also see shots of a pink sheep, a bumblebee, and of course, the instantly recognisable Creeper, which has a different colour palette compared to the game and appears to be made from grass. There are some tips on the images of how these characters should be marketed and presented on promotional materials, but that’s about it.</p>



<p>Here’s the content:</p>

<p>Is this what you were expecting, or did you have visions of something a little less bizarre?</p>



<p>Minecraft is set to be released on April 4, 2025 – it was supposed to be released several years ago in 2019 but has been subjected to several delays.</p>
