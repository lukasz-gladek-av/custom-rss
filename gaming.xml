		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a> is set to launch on 19th May 2026, arriving first for Xbox Series X|S, PC and Xbox Game Pass with an eventual PlayStation 5 release coming at a later point this year, Microsoft has announced alongside a deep dive into the gameplay by Playground games during the Developer Direct stream.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forza Horizon 6 - Official Gameplay Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pWw-UENvdTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Forza Horizon 6 looks to take the familiar arcade racing format of the series to the next level, thanks in no small part to being fully on this generation, when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> was a cross-gen release. The game still takes liberties with reality to create a landmark-filled approximation of Japan, which includes Mount Fuji, Tokyo City, and more rural areas, but the team at Playground Games has brought in consultants to ensure that it’s authentic and not just “postcard tourism” – things like picking 78 as the building number for your first home base, which is lucky in Japanese culture.</p>
<p>Once again the Horizon Festival is at the centre of all the racing that you’re taking on. The journey through the game starts as a tourist to Japan, having to first qualify for the Festival, earning wristbands and taking challenges to prove you’re worthy for the next stage and series of events. There’s a new event here with Horizon Rush, tasking you with weaving through obstacle courses to prove your skills. At the end of the road is&nbsp;Legend Island, an exclusive region of the world that only the pinnacle are able to visit.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K] Developer_Direct 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXn6bvU1Kh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Seasons will also make a return to Forza Horizon 6, and should be as impactful for the Japanese weather as they were for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-4">Forza Horizon 4</a> and its wildly different British seasons. Cherry blossoms in the spring are going to be delightful to see, and they’ll respond realistically to passing cars. It’s built around a ton of photogrammetric data capture of the world, providing the foundation for the world – within that, Tokyo City is five times larger than any urban city before, featuring multiple distinct and visually different districts, but there’s also a broad countryside too.</p>

<p>The team has overhauled the car roster to be better balanced, with the hundreds of cars that have new Forza body kits, liveries that extend to the wind screen, but there’s also some unique creations to collect. Oh, and there’s also authentic tyre wear. The Forza Horizon 6 cover star is the Toyota Gazoo Racing GR GT. It’ll sound great, thanks to new environmental audio processing, hours of ambient sound capture from different seasons.</p>
<p>The shared open world returns with thematic open car meets, where you can turn up and show off your car, and even then just buy copies of the cars that you see. That then bleeds into driving and racing together.</p>
<p>Online multiplayer, they promise, will be easier to get into than ever, and more extensive with full collaborative multiplayer world building tools that you can dive into.</p>
<p>The game’s accessibility suite is pushing on with features like proximity radar for competitive racing, auto drive for when you just want to kick back, and a&nbsp;customisable high contrast mode to aid visually.</p>
<p>The key thing that we’ll have to wait and see is how much this game feels like a new step for the series. There was criticism for Forza Horizon 5 that is was often very similar to Horizon 4, in terms of the cars on offer, the overarching progression and the feel, despite having leapt across from Britain to Mexico. We do expect Horizon 6 to still be an evolution of the formula instead of a wholesale reinvention, but hopefully there’s some more distinguishing touches.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio recently released a new demo for<em> Yakuza 3 Kiwami,</em> an upcoming remake of the original PS3-era <em>Yakuza 3.</em> And a single alleyway in the demo has become the center of an online debate about whether<em> Yakuza 3 Kiwami</em> is a visual downgrade when compared to the OG game.</p> <p>On January 21, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3948220/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties_Demo/">Sega released a demo for <em>Yakuza 3 Kiwami</em> for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC.</a> It didn’t take long after the demo’s launch for people to start complaining about the remake. Some aren’t happy that, like in the OG game, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qj4cdi/damn_kiwami_3_is_crazy_faithful_to_yakuza_3/">every character you fight is an expert at blocking.</a> Others claim that the remake’s map is smaller than the original’s and are unhappy about it. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/yakuza-3-remake-backlash-blows-up-again-as-actor-guilty-of-sexual-harassment-stars-in-new-trailer">There’s also the crappy decision by RGG to recast a character with actor Teruyuki Kagawa</a>, a man who has been accused of sexual assault against a hostess in 2019. While he apologized in 2022, people are still upset that he’s included in the remake. But the newest and biggest controversy surrounding <em>Kiwami 3</em> involves an alleyway found in the demo.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/wj9u8chpW5">pic.twitter.com/wj9u8chpW5</a></p> <p>— Yakuza Spain 🐉 (@SpainYakuza) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpainYakuza/status/2014115748491252142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On January 21, a user on Twitter shared a post comparing an alley in the OG <em>Yakuza 3</em> on PS3 with how it looks in the remake’s demo. While the original looks realistic and inviting, the remake’s version looks garish and ugly. However, the original account claimed that the rest of the demo looked better and was on par with recent RGG games. Another user pointed out that the alleyway looks fine when you aren’t inside of it, and <a href="https://x.com/Kami_No_Okami/status/2014382700677706178">someone else suggested it was tied to a technical issue involving the game’s lighting</a>. This is a problem that has plagued past <em>Yakuza/Like a Dragon</em> games, including <em>Pirates in Hawaii.&nbsp;</em></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yakuza Kiwami 3 lighting issues are an auto-exposure bug.</p> <p>When in a dark area, the game brightens to make things easier to see, which overexposes bright areas and makes things look fullbright.</p> <p>The fix is as easy as disabling this, but Pirates in Hawaii had the same issue. <a href="https://t.co/hVu5OaUYzw">pic.twitter.com/hVu5OaUYzw</a></p> <p>— MeovvCAT (@osu_MeovvCAT) <a href="https://twitter.com/osu_MeovvCAT/status/2014364282725474705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>That information didn’t stop the original post comparing the old and new game from going viral online, <a href="https://x.com/kitsuneredFES/status/2014250516977492350">leading to more people sharing footage</a> and <a href="https://x.com/exblackwater/status/2014149801554633074">screenshots of the ugly alleyway</a> on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kano01.bsky.social/post/3mcyuyh2ylk25">social media sites like Twitter and BlueSky</a> as well as Reddit.</p>

 <p>Thankfully, the playerbase is already fixing the ugly lighting issues in <em>Yakuza 3 Kiwami</em>. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/yakuzakiwami3/mods/16">There’s already a mod</a> for the demo online that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qjuwsf/a_quick_original_filter_vs_no_filter_comparison/">apparently removes a visual filter RGG has implemented in the game and in other recent <em>Yakuza</em> titles.</a> And yeah, seeing the game both with and without the filter makes it clear that this isn’t an ugly game. Instead, it seems that the filter, as well as some shading issues, are causing it to look worse than the OG <em>Yakuza 3</em> in some specific circumstances. Hopefully the devs add a toggle to remove the filter, but considering they are shipping <em>Kiwami 3</em> with an actor who allegedly sexually assaulted a woman, I’m not going to hold my breath.</p>

<p>Everyone knew Forza Horizon 6 was finally getting its first gameplay reveal at the Xbox Developer Direct 2026. It’s fair to say expectations were high, as should be with such a class series—but Playground Games might have outdone themselves with FH6.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-setting-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6’s location</a> was revealed, it made sense. A ludicrously beautiful country with rich culture and a storied heritage. It’s a match made in heaven. Forza was always going to be the main highlight of the Xbox Developer Direct 2026, but its first gameplay footage went up another gear.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-confirmed-has-4-day-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6 Release Date was confirmed</a> hours before the 2026 Xbox Developer Direct. But that quickly became an afterthought once gameplay sped onto the screen.</p>







<p>On one hand, it looks like Forza Horizon, it’s Forza Horizon 5, baby! The visuals are out of this world, and there’s a ton of new modes, cars, and features being added.</p>



<p>You can check out the trailer for yourself.</p>

<p>The tease in question was shared to Nintendo of America and LEGO socials, and sees <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/new-18plus-lego-mario-kart-set-is-a-better-build-than-we-expected">last year's Mario Kart set</a> geared up and ready to go before a mysterious figure emerges on the right side of the screen. It's far from a detailed look at the set, but the green cap, arm, and accompanying caption, "Racing runs in the family," all but confirm it.</p>

<p>Neither Nintendo nor LEGO has revealed any pricing information or a release date for the Luigi Mario Kart set just yet, but for reference, the Mario counterpart went up for £149.99 / $169.99 last year, so we'd be surprised if it's <em>much</em> more than that.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for more information down the line, but gosh, what a year to be a LEGO / Nintendo fan — and what a bad year to be money conscious...</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anime-goth-egirl-meme-alt-right-visual-novel-2000662271</link>
            <guid>1413397</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pathways</span></i><span>, a “bespoke interactive learning” game developed in collaboration with the “political literacy” platform Shout Out UK and funded by the British government, has inadvertently spawned a “cute goth e-girl” meme. The game was meant to fight anti-immigrant extremism, but now its character has been turned into a pro-right-wing symbol.</span></p> <p><span>Developed by the Hull and East Riding of Yorkshire council in collaboration with Shout Out UK, </span><i><span>Pathways </span></i><span>is a barebones visual novel web game that puts you in the shoes of Charlie, a college-aged boy or girl who has a terrible habit of running into bizarre political radicalization scenarios. It’s </span><a href="https://www.shoutoutuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/pathways-teachers-guide-extremism-youth-radicalisation.pdf"><span>being touted</span></a><span> as a tool that teachers can use to combat the “promotion or advancement of an ideology based on violence, hatred or intolerance.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The "worst" ending btw <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Amelia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Amelia</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pathways?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Pathways</a> <a href="https://t.co/v7kZ3N9oMi">pic.twitter.com/v7kZ3N9oMi</a></p> <p>— Bee CrayZee (@Bee_CrayZee) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bee_CrayZee/status/2010603633826750834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The level-headed critique of </span><i><span>Pathways </span></i><span>is that its content and choices are sparse. The idea that a minute-long PowerPoint slideshow-style narrative could fully address extremism and radicalization is laughable, but the railroaded, overly domineering choices will doubtlessly also come off as ham-fisted to the same people it’s meant to reach.</span></p> <p><span>Instead, it’s the online right that’s propelled </span><i><span>Pathways </span></i><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/amelia-pathways/"><span>into memedom</span></a><span>. The result has been the sudden influx of AI-generated “cute goth e-girl” fan-art (if you can call it “art”) in some corners of the internet, based on Amelia, </span><i><span>Pathways’ </span></i><span>racist, yet alternatively-styled, antagonist.</span></p>

   <p><span>She’s exploded in popularity on alt-right leaning subreddits like r/Asmongold, who immediately saw a vision of </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalCompassMemes/comments/1qff3jv/authright_be_like/"><span>their perfect woman</span></a><span> in Amelia. As a result, the meme spread to X. Since then, users have been making </span><a href="https://searchlightmagazine.com/2026/01/how-purple-haired-cartoon-amelia-became-a-far-right-icon/"><span>Grok work overtime</span></a><span>, generating hundreds of Amelia images for the platform’s far-right crowd to enjoy.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the blame here lies with whoever designed </span><i><span>Pathways’ </span></i><span>artwork. Making a goth-adjacent female racist be the only character in your game with a distinctive design, and then having them become more attached to the protagonist if they choose to support anti-immigration ideas and policies, was certainly a choice. I can’t help but feel that whoever designed Amelia has clearly never met a teenager before. That being said, the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Chainsawfolk/comments/1qfhs8y/british_government_isnt_even_trying_bro/"><span>Reze/Amelia meme</span></a><span> on the r/Chainsawfolk subreddit is very, very funny.</span></p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/finally-a-new-controller-that-solves-the-switch-2s-flat-joy-con-problem/</link>
            <guid>1413394</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/nintendo-switch-2-the-ars-technica-review/">reviewed the Switch 2 back in June</a>, I noted that the lack of any sort of extended grip on the extremely thin Joy-Con 2 controllers made them relatively awkward to hold, both when connected to the system and when cradled in separate hands. At the time, I said that “my Switch 2 will probably need something like <a href="https://nyxigame.com/products/nyxi-hyperion-pro-purple-style-wireless-joy-pad-for-switch-switch-oled?sv1=affiliate&amp;sv_campaign_id=78888&amp;sscid=95943_1769092363_1038034ce8587237102389cdbd188388&amp;awc=95943_1769092363_1038034ce8587237102389cdbd188388">the Nyxi Hyperion Pro</a>, which I’ve come to rely on to make portable play on the original Switch much more comfortable.”</p>
<p>Over half a year later, Nyxi is once again addressing my Switch controller-related comfort concerns with the <a href="https://nyxigame.com/products/nyxi-hyperion-3-wireless-joypad-for-switch-2">Hyperion 3</a>, which was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NYXIGameOFFICIAL/videos/25434137766281969/">made available for preorder earlier this week</a> ahead of planned March 1 shipments. Unfortunately, it looks like players will have to pay a relatively high price for a potentially more ergonomic Switch 2 experience.</p>
<p>While there are <a href="https://www.powera.com/p/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2/controllers/wireless/advantage-wireless-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-black-nsgp0545-01/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=pmax&amp;utm_campaign=gpmax-2025_Jun_6_gpmax-nsw2_smart_paid_sales_all_product&amp;gad_source=1">plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/next-wireless-rechargeable-pro-controller-for-switch-2-switch-midnight/J3R4V77RLK/sku/6601305?utm_source=feed&amp;extStoreId=1129&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=20510845600&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=20510847514">third-party controllers</a> for the Switch 2, none of the current options mimic the official Joy-Cons’ ability to connect magnetically to the console tablet itself (controllers designed to slide into the grooves on the original Switch tablet also can’t hook to the successor console). The Hyperion 3 is the first Switch 2 controller to offer this magnetic connection, making it uniquely suited for handheld play on the system.</p>
<p>And although I haven’t held the Hyperion 3 in my hands yet, my experience with the similar Hyperion 2 on the original Switch suggests that the ergonomic design here will be a welcome upgrade from the relatively small buttons and cramp-inducing flat back of the official Switch 2 Joy-Cons (“Say Goodbye to Tendonitis,” as Nyxi claims in its marketing materials). The controller can also connect wirelessly via Bluetooth 5.0 for when you want to switch to docked play, unlike some Switch Joy-Con replacements that only work in portable mode.</p>

Developer Spiders announced today that its follow-up will launch on March 12.</p><p>Set three years before the original GreedFall, The Dying World is a choice-driven action RPG where players control a native of the island of Teer Fradee, the primary setting of the last game. The protagonist is a guardian of knowledge and nature; unfortunately, this status attracts the attention of colonists from the old continent of Gacane, which is being ravaged by the Malichor plague. The invaders capture the player and bring them to Gacane to be experimented on, so players must find a way to escape and return home. Along the way, they’ll get roped up in a grander conspiracy that may endanger everyone on Teer Fradee.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ggjI-RnrnQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ggjI-RnrnQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Dialogue choices steer the game’s plot, as players can talk their way in and out of situations as well as build alliances, including assembling a party of companions. When diplomacy isn’t an option, you can cut down threats in the tactical battles. You can pause the action to carefully coordinate actions with companions or focus on your player while allies act independently.</p><p>GreedFall: The Dying World is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 12.

			<p>Before <strong>Hytale</strong> became the standalone MMO we know it to be today, it began its life as a <strong>Minecraft </strong>mod called <strong>Hypixel</strong>. Since breaking off to become Hytale, with the studio behind it taking the name Hypixel, the MMO has been on a massive journey, <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/">one that <strong>saw the studio get acquired</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">subsequently shut down</a></strong>, only <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-january-2026/">to be revived again</a></strong>, and as of last week, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/long-awaited-minecraft-like-mmo-hytale-launches-early-access/">off to a stellar start in early access</a></strong>. Now, the game's latest storybook moment in a long line of storybook moments brings it back to its origins, as some truly impressive modding work adds <strong>crossplay support between Hytale and Minecraft</strong>.</p>



<p>Yes, you read that correctly. Two separate (though admittedly very similar) games, not the same game on different platforms, but two separate, standalone games, can support crossplay with one another thanks to the work of modder <strong>iamcxv7</strong>.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-and-minecraft-get-crossplay-capability-thanks-to-intrepid-modder">IGN</a>, modder iamcxv7 explains their work as just "<em>Packet Trickery,</em>" but that seems to be a humble cover for what is an amazingly impressive feat. Even though the mod itself isn't publicly available yet, and iamcxv7 admits that there's still a lot of work to be done, the fact that they've proven it to be possible is an incredible full-circle, storybook moment for both Hytale and Minecraft.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>"<em>It's all just Packet Trickery</em>," explains iamcxv7. "<em>You could say I am running a Minecraft Server in the Hytale JVM which uses the Coordinate System of the Hytale World (As its the same) As well as takes a Snapshot of the Hytale World and reconstructs it and then send it to to the Client via Packets</em>."</p>

</div></figure>



<p>It's a Hytale mod, so when it does go live, you won't need to add the mod to Minecraft to play with your friends on Hytale. You'll just add it to Hytale and play alongside your friends in Minecraft that way. It's all still early days for this mod as iamcxv7 admits that they only started working on it earlier this week, but even just as a proof of concept, this is an amazing effort.</p>

            <guid>1413376</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">As <em>Frosthaven</em>'s Digital Edition continues to move through the early access lifecycle, its latest update, Legacy of the Algox, brings with it three new heroes, an Algox storyline, a new pet, and all kinds of quality-of-life improvements. TechRaptor sat down with Snapshot Games' Game Director Hristo Petkov to discuss the update, see gameplay from the new expansion, and discuss how they've been reacting to fan-based feedback during the early access period.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Contents of the <em>Frosthaven </em>Update</h2><p dir="ltr">Jumping straight into the update, Petkov briefly highlighted each of the enhancements coming to the game. "What we're introducing in this patch is three new heroes; <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/frosthaven-all-advanced-classes-guide" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1fe9e70e-c0f4-441c-8fae-695d76f43e05" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the total in the board game is 17</a>, and with this update, we'll be at 14."</p><p dir="ltr">Petkov also explained that with the three main branches of the <em>Frosthaven </em>story, "we're introducing the second. The third brand will be in the next update, which will be sometime in April, and the final chapter will be in the final release."</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">What won't be releasing with the update, but shortly after, is an overhaul of the networking solution for <em>Frosthaven</em>. With a variety of tests, the team has created a more stable online experience using Epic Online Services.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Legacy of the Algox</em></h2><p dir="ltr">The Legacy of the Algox story will follow the culture of the Algox and the warring between the two different clans of yeti-like creatures, the Snowspeakers and Icespeakers. "Both of these clans have their problems with each other, and you need to help them resolve these issues.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's decision-making from the side of the player on how to approach these problems. We used this to create replayability, as there are generally three ways to solve the problem, each with its own missions"</p><p dir="ltr">One of these decisions comes after Scenario 4 of the new campaign content, when you need to make a decision on which tribe you're siding with; whichever one you side with, you'll unlock that class as a playable one. The spoiler-free names for these classes are Snowflake and Fist.</p><p dir="ltr">For anyone worried about missing out on a character, Petkov immediately followed up to explain, "At the end of this campaign, you unlock the other class."</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of campaign content, this update is also bringing with it "a lot of new stuff. New side scenarios, items, and so on."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Frosthaven's </em>Infuser Is Powerful But Has A Learning Curve</h2><p dir="ltr">Getting to see one of the new classes getting added to the game, we jumped into a scenario with the Infuser as one of our party members. "The Infuser has persistent effects that stay for the whole battle. When she plays an infusion, it has a persistent effect and a trigger effect.</p><p dir="ltr">"The trigger effect triggers when you play it for the first time, but triggers every time you play a new infusion. If you play one of these effects, for example, 'Attack for 3,' but you play a second infusion that heals it, it also triggers the attack of the previous one. If you play a third infusion, it will activate itself and the previous two."</p><p dir="ltr">The important part of playing this class is learning the different combo effects that you can begin to chain together, and how to best layer those effects over one another.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr">Player Feedback for Better or Worse</h2><p dir="ltr">Throughout our discussion, one of the topics that continued to be highlighted was just how much the team at Snapshot Games was paying attention to their fanbase. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/frosthavens-video-game-adaptation-creates-no-fuss-experience-at-sgf-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d7063e8-3c90-48be-a660-2a7afffa5e50" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">From playing it last year at SGF to today</a>, I could see how much added polish there was in the game. Petkov also highlighted a number of UI changes that had been made, and that there were still hundreds of icon improvements they had yet to implement.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">A constant theme of our discussion was all of the little ways that the game had been shaped with the input of the community. I was interested to learn how the team balances those community requests alongside the standard development roadmap, and when the community might be asking too much.</p><p dir="ltr">Petkov explained that they thought about these in a few categories. The first of which is when something is technically broken, or the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frosthaven-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9f351387-1805-4afa-833a-e32039d2d562" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">mechanic doesn't work as it does in the board game</a>. In this case, "the community is right, they are the board game fans. They do want things to happen similarly, so the tricky part is to implement what they want without making the game extremely tedious."</p><p dir="ltr">Some examples of tedium that he brought up were players who want more control over the game, being allowed to move the enemies or calculate their AI, "but if we do that, the game will interrupt you all the time. Especially in multiplayer, this would be terrible."</p><p dir="ltr">An example of UI optimization that the team is working on for a future patch is how to reduce UI pop-ups when returning to the outpost and how to make sure what's contained on the screen is the distilled information necessary to the player.</p><p dir="ltr">"In some cases, our answer is obviously no."</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I explained it multiple times to multiple players, but it's still getting asked."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">What's important from the team at Snapshot Games is that they're communicative about their decisions as the game is continuing to be developed to make sure, even if the community might disagree at times, that they understand why.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I nodded in agreement with their desire for clear communication. "If the community is made aware, then they would understand and not make a big deal out of it."&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">There was a momentary pause before Petkov responded, "Ahhh, yeah, but that's not always happening."</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the bigger problems we're having, and I have no solution for it, is people playing the board game wrong. Playing digitally, they think the game is bugged when it's not. Recently, we had a negative review, a person said they would change their review to be positive if you fix&nbsp;this card," Petkov said.</p><p dir="ltr">"The card is actually absolutely correctly implemented. It's a problematic card, and people playing the board game don't understand how it works, but we implemented it correctly, according to Isaac Childres and everyone, but we got downvoted because people don't know the rules."</p><p dir="ltr">Petkov took a moment to thank the active members of the community who are helping them convey corrections in these kinds of situations.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">The Puzzle Book Will Keep You On Track</h2><p dir="ltr">In the board game, Petkov advised that "the Puzzle Book is very polarizing because it's interesting as a side thing, but in the board game, it's locking you out of game progression. What we did is we kept a lot of the story it has and the requirements, but we made it in the form of a main quest."</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"The Puzzle Book is now leading your way, instead of locking your way."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">As you progress through the Puzzle Book, for each page you reach, you'll get a checklist of scenarios to complete to gather the relevant information to solve the puzzle. If you're ever not sure what to do next, you can use the Puzzle Book as a way to prompt yourself forward.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, a Solve button has also been added for each of the Puzzle Book's pages. The team understands that if you're invested in the gameplay, the puzzles available in the Puzzle Book might not be your thing.</p><h2 dir="ltr">All Kinds Of Future Expansion Ideas Are Brewing</h2><p dir="ltr">Continuing the idea that people might play the game differently at home, the team at Snapshot Games is also looking at ways to implement different house rules, like being able to pool resources.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a variety of other game mode alterations that have been getting tested internally to appeal to a different kind of player. It's not entirely certain whether these will officially see the light of day, but I was fascinated to hear of the different testing going on.</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1" data-list-item-id="ece340c588e691efd54abcceb0920b6a3">For new players, a mode was tested where two cards are selected for you automatically. This limits player options, but also lets players focus on a smaller number of cards when they're starting, which should speed up their entry into the game.</li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1" data-list-item-id="ee2def30d192d0b679404d100e4ab5d7f">For players who enjoy the strategy game, but not so much the resource management and city building segments, a mode has been investigated where the city will automatically get built in an efficient manner, leaving the player to not have to worry.</li></ul><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Frosthaven </em>Progress From Table To Screen</h2><p dir="ltr">The most exciting idea that I heard about from Petkov was that they're investigating making a save game creator. This wouldn't just be a way to give yourself access to all of the resources you need or unlock characters early, but instead would be a way that you could 'convert' your physical game status to the digital game.</p><p dir="ltr">An example was given of a group of players who live further apart, so can only play in person once a month. If they could 'import' their physical save into the game, then they could play remotely at different times, and then when they get back together to play physically, they can 'export' their progress back to their dining room table.</p><p dir="ltr">"A lot of the players are playing this board game for a couple of years, and they haven't finished it. They don't want to spoil themselves with the board game, but if they could do both, then that would be amazing.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is something we'll definitely do for the final release."</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Frosthaven's Legacy Of The Algox</em> update will be launching on Steam and the Epic Game Store on January 22. With the next update expected in April, it won't be too much longer until the game is fully released.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/frosthavens-new-expansion-brings-playable-characters-missions-and-fan-suggested]]></content:encoded>

Out today in early access, Turnbound is a tile and turn-based autobattler about mythical heroes trapped in a haunted boardgame, where the starting player is chosen by flipping a coin bearing a picture of a cat’s anus. It’s saying a lot for Turnbound’s mellow, fairytale ambience and rich, rosy tile designs that I consider the cat’s anus a positive – a touch of whimsy, rather than just, well, that feeling you get when you’ve been flashbanged by a picture of a cat’s anus. Rare indeed are the videogames that contain a cat’s anus, and rarer still are the videogames in which the cat’s anus isn’t grounds for a refund.

<p>
Look, shut up about the cat’s anus already. You’re obsessed with the cat’s anus. There’s so much more to Turnbound than this. To start afresh: the story is that you’ve been trapped in a haunted boardgame. To get out, you must choose a hero – the current choices are Robin Hood, Sun Wukong the Monkey King, and Lewis Caroll’s Alice - and surround them with tiles that perform attacks, confer protection, or synergise with other tiles. Then you autobattle other players and heroes over 10 rounds. The twist is that some/all of these opposing boards are the work of other players, snuck into your game via Ye Olde Asynchronous Online (or a build code, if you prefer). 
</p>
<p>
Between rounds, there’s a shop screen where you can buy new tiles, level them up, and unlock squares on your board. At fixed points in each run, you’ll get opportunities to upgrade your hero and equip trinkets, which gives the proceedings some additional structure. The Steam page summarises it as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/backpack-battles">Backpack Battles</a> meets <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> Battlegrounds meets the age-old practice of ‘inventory Tetris’. I think that’s a fair breakdown, after half an hour with the early access version.
</p><p>
During battles, tiles attack or activate according to placement and what they’re adjacent to. There are ‘taunt’ tiles to absorb the enemy’s best tricks, accessory tiles that confer status effects, reactive tiles that heal or generate coins when they’re meddled with, and much else besides. Heroes have different capacities. To give a hasty summary, Sun Wukong is good at chain attacks, Alice puts people to sleep while buffing herself through curious and curioser means, and Robin Hood is a counterpuncher.
</p>
<p>
It’s too early for me to seriously gauge the tactical depth, here, but it feels like this could have legs. In the short term, what elevates Turnbound is the presentation. True, the art is broadly the kind of medium-spice anime-fantasy malarkey you’ve encountered in any number of mobile fantasy games, but it doesn’t want for charisma. Run the cursor over tiles in the shop screen and they tinkle lovingly. Spare tiles pile up in a bag that is subject to real-time physics. And yes, there is the coin with the cat’s anus. Again, the cat’s anus is a plus. I was going to say I’m giving it a thumbs-up, but no, that would be bad.
</p>
<p>
The full game will offer “more characters, more skins, and hundreds more Items and Abilities”. Developers 1TK aren’t committing to a 1.0 launch date, but are giving a rough timeline of “4-6 months”. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3802470/Turnbound/">Read more on Steam</a>.

            <p>The second post-release update to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> is currently set to rock up this weekend, but the notes outlining what it'll include have rocked up a couple of days early. As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-first-major-update-adds-in-dinosaurs-stops-skeletons-drowning-and-lets-you-have-an-early-night">last week's first update</a> to the early access sandbox, this is another pretty beefy one, and especially noteworthy if raising the dead's your jam or you share Indiana Jones' main fear.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Posting out update two's notes, Hypixel boss Simon Collins-Laflamme made clear that a third update's also in the works and will be subject to "a longer pre-release period to give modders and servers time to catch up and update". Sticking with update two for now, its new additions include a necromancy system which'll let you summon up to five skeletal minions after picking up a grimoire from a skeleton praetorian. This is one of the things Hypixel's devs shared they were working on in mod form prior to release, so I imagine battles with your gang of undead will <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010372558198018181">look like this</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that, builders'll be keen to know that the speed at which you mine now scales with your pickaxe's quality, karters'll be keen to know that the rail kart is faster, and fighters'll be keen to know that both polar bears and skeletons have been buffed. Oh, and folks who're afraid of snakes will likely be fans of the optional ophidiophobia accessibility mode the update's delivering.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hytale Update 2 – Patch Notes (Pre-Release)<br>Enable via Launcher → Settings → Pre-Release</p><p>Cosmetics &amp; Customization<br>• New mask face accessories (available for all editions)<br>• Armor slot visibility toggle (host-enforced for PvP/immersion)<br>• New mouth variants: Vampire, Cute,…</p></div>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2014200175401574576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>It's also interesting to see Hypixel already working on the game's world generation tech. The swankier version two of Hytale's world generator - that being the one <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-devs-hope-to-redefine-the-block-game-genre-with-their-world-generation-and-theyve-now-explained-how-it-works">the team are hoping to switch over to in the long-term</a> - is set to be "prepared for public documentation" to faciliate mod support. The update also includes a "major ore placement refactor in all zones" and some dungeon environment tweaks.</p><p>Right, I've been yacking for a bit now, and you're probably wondering about the headline. Update two will make some more additions to Hytale's character creator. There are new masks, cape animations I'm sure are sufficiently swooshy, and the berserker haircut has had its "tiling fixed". I didn't know a haircut could need bathroom maintenance, but there you go. Finally, there are three new mouth options - vampire, cute, and orc. There you go. Please tell me in the comments that reveal was worth the wait. Or tell me what you had for lunch. Anything really (within the usual guidelines). Go nuts.</p>
<p>Also here are some handy Hytale guides to the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-how-to-play-multiplayer-dedicated-server-hosting">setting up a server</a>, getting it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-hytale-on-steam-deck">running on the Steam Deck</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-how-to-get-cobalt">hunting down key materials</a>.</p>

              <p><span>The difference between having to use one launcher or another to boot up a PC game might feel like a trivial thing to some, but a game launching only on something like the Epic Games Store as opposed to the more ubiquitous Steam can affect its reach. Tim Sweeney, Epic CEO and guy who posts too much for as much money as he has, seemed to forget this as he preached the virtues of capitalism and competition, saying that developers and gamers alike win when they have options.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Epic and Steam compete for each customer and each sale. On some transactions, Epic wins. On more, Steam wins. But one thing is constant on every transaction: gamers and developers win by having more options and better deals. <a href="https://t.co/RzU0twrmbr">https://t.co/RzU0twrmbr</a></p> <p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2013717881431769340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Michael Douse, Larian Studios’ publishing director, </span><a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2013963017197691329?s=20"><span>responded</span></a><span> to Sweeney’s comments by stating that some of Epic’s publishing deals had seemed antithetical to Sweeney’s seeming belief in the value of “options” for developers and players. He specifically calledout the fact that </span><i><span>Alan Wake 2</span></i><span>, Remedy Entertainment’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/goty-best-games-2023-totk-baldurs-gate-3-alan-wake-2-1851109182"><span>award-winning horror sequel</span></a><span>, is only available on the Epic Games Store, rather than Steam. Remedy has said in recent financial reports that it has been </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-arent-satisfied-with-our-recent-financial-performance-remedy-says-it-will-return-to-profitability-by-delivering-hits-again/"><span>operating at a significant loss</span></a><span> in recent years, primarily due to its co-op shooter </span><i><span>FBC Firebreak</span></i> <a href="https://kotaku.com/morning-checkpoint-fbc-remedy-ceo-mortal-kombat-star-wars-2000638199"><span>flopping last year</span></a><span>, but in general, the studio seems to be dealing with financial troubles. Douse argues that the company is losing out on “potentially hundreds of millions in lost revenue” by sequestering </span><i><span>Alan Wake 2</span></i><span> on a less popular storefront.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Not that they need the money but a [percentage] take to Epic could’ve recouped dev costs [and] more,” Douse wrote. “Competition is good, and important, but it is difficult to buy the message when there are demonstrable cases of games underperforming as a result of the tactic. Ultimately, the viability of the store sits on their ability to convert hundreds of millions of </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> players into mid-hardcore premium gamers, and I don’t see the </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> brand attempting to do that.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Realistically I think if you want to be consistent in dev positive messaging you just take an easy PR W by amending the contract to allow them to drop the game on Steam now everyone has made their money and the drop-off in UA has made that angle negligible <a href="https://t.co/v5rAo6XUR3">https://t.co/v5rAo6XUR3</a></p> <p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/2014033787378635220?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>For whatever it’s worth, there is some evidence that suggests </span><i><span>Alan Wake 2 </span></i><span>might finally be making its way to Steam after almost three years. Just earlier this week, an </span><i><span>Alan Wake</span></i><span> “franchise” Steam bundle including the original game and the </span><i><span>American Nightmare </span></i><span>spin-off was </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/15407/"><span>renamed “Origins,”</span></a><span> implying that this collection of the early games may no longer encompass the entirety of the “franchise” as it exists on Steam. If so, maybe Remedy will get a nice bump in </span><i><span>Alan Wake 2 </span></i><span>sales, but it is important to point out that for all Sweeney’s touting competition and options as something we should all support, if the deals studios have to make to work with Epic leave studios at a disadvantage with potentially catastrophic consequences, it’s all just posturing.</span></p>

 <p><strong><b data-stringify-type="bold">Update: 1/22/26, 12:03 p.m. ET: </b></strong>Remedy has weighed in on the situation <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/2014375181507047630">with a statement of its own</a>, saying that while yes, there are some publishing deals that don’t work in a developer’s favor, the one it agreed to with Epic was “fair” to the studio.</p> <blockquote><p>Hi. There would be no <em>Alan Wake 2</em> without Epic Publishing. The publishing deal with Epic was very fair to Remedy. While these complex deals can often take even a year to reach their conclusion, and may not always be fair to the developer, this one was. And it only took months to get done. Epic Games was, and is, an excellent partner to us. Steam or no Steam.</p></blockquote>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/life-is-strange-reunion-fans/</link>
            <guid>1413355</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>With the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9TLeraDVLs&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>announcement</u></a> of <em>Life is Strange: Reunion</em>, fans of the series will see cultured bisexual wunderkind Max Caufield reconnect with sardonic sex-mess Chloe Price. It’s a reunion long coming, bringing two <a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/EXPERIENCE-THE-EMOTIONAL-CONCLUSION-OF-THE-MAX-AND-CHLOE-SAGA-IN-LIFE-?ref=aftermath.site"><u>“iconic”</u></a> characters face to face again. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Marketed</u></a> as “by and for fans of the original,” and promising to “give Max and Chloe the ending they deserve,” <em>Reunion </em>is sure to please many players, but there’s an important question contained in all the promotion: What do fans <em>deserve</em> and what, if anything, do characters deserve as well?</p><p>I’m not judging anyone excited to see these characters share the screen again, and I’m not judging any developer on the game who is enthused to breathe fresh life into this couple. <em>Life is Strange: Reunion</em> could nail all of this and offer a rich, complex story of two messy people. But the current media moment is awash in attempts to please fans and create works “by and for” them, turning games back on themselves in twisted rearrangements of stories and experiences we already played back in the 2010s. </p><p><em>Life is Strange: Reunion</em> is simply the latest to join this trend. The original episodic series released in 2015, doggedly carving a niche for itself in spite of (or maybe because of) remarkably awkward dialogue and story-telling. A strange mix of wallflower hipster chic with the dark crimes of <em>Twin Peaks</em>, it made for a unique flavor of <em>Telltale</em>-esque adventure game. And at the core was a messy love story between two incredibly short-sighted teens.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9TLeraDVLs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Life is Strange: Reunion – Announce Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>Max was a bookish and artsy bleeding heart and Chloe was a wild, dyed-hair rebel. Their friendship was an odd mix; Max’s mellow nature balanced Chloe’s recklessness even if Chloe’s tendency to fight the people around her strained her relationships. An odd twist to this was Max’s ability to rewind time and jump into alternate possibilities. Her constant use of this power led to a compelling final choice in the narrative: choose to travel back in time and allow Chloe to die or let Chloe live and watch her hometown of Arcadia Bay get consumed in a massive storm seemingly caused by her mucking in the timestream. What a big decision!</p><p>Fans loved it. They called it “Bae or Bay” and people still argue about what the “right” choice was. That’s a testament to how electric a couple these two are. Their tortured, time-traveling lesbian romp woke up countless players to all kinds of feelings. <em>Life is Strange</em> was a true lightning in the bottle fandom success.&nbsp;</p><p>The core question of what choice Max made was left mostly to linger all the way until 2024’s <em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em>. This game saw Max return, allowing fans to select what choice she made, but shockingly neither path led to a terribly happy life. This was particularly true if players chose that Chloe was alive. Yes, she and Max had a stretch of life together. Yes, they got to love and care for each other. But then they broke up because if you’re gonna be true to Chloe’s character, that inevitably means that she’d push away even the person she loved most in the world.</p><p>In many ways this is a bold choice not only for the decision to not allow for a “clean” path for fans to follow, but because it keeps true to the fiction even though that highlighted how flawed these two people were. It had the confidence to accept that even the most passionate of people are not guaranteed a perfect ending. People are complex, messy, and make mistakes even after the story is “over.” Life goes on, and there are no promises that can’t unravel.</p><p>A plot point of <em>Double Exposure</em> is Max’s ability to leap between two timelines. Near the climax of <em>Double Exposure</em> these timelines are merged, and this paves the path for <em>Reunion</em>, allowing all players to bring Max and Chloe together in a story that the marketing claims gives them “the ending they deserve.”</p><p>What do characters deserve? To say that they deserve anything creates a strange value judgment, which positions characters as <em>the</em> force of a story. On face value that makes sense–of course a story revolves around characters! But to say they “deserve” certain things starts to limit the stories you can tell. In real life, people deserve plenty of things. They deserve health and a roof over their head, they deserve dignity. In a story? That’s messier. We tell all kinds of stories, sometimes not always bearing the perfect ending, because they help us understand the world.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Life Is Strange: Reunion (Deck Nine)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To give Max and Chloe the ending they deserve means playing a multiversal long con across several games, all of which is targeted at upturning one of the most talked about endings of the last decade of games. To give them the story they deserve means potentially bending over backwards in many directions to please fans and risk the developers not telling the story they actually wanted to tell. To suggest these characters deserve more is to imply their story was not complete by itself. It implies prior work, perhaps even the work of people not at the studio anymore, was flawed and faulty. To say that this game is the one for fans paints the other games as somehow not being for fans because they didn’t give what folks “deserved.”</p><p>Characters don’t deserve anything, and I don’t think fans do either. The goal of a story cannot simply be to satiate the hunger of fanatics or to smooth out the ripples of a world. Even the most indulgent self-insert fan fiction arguably operates on higher goals than this; the writer crafts the silly tale in order to address something in their soul. You don’t write to <em>fix</em> a story; it ideally addresses something inside us. You don’t write because fictional characters need it. You write because you need it. You do it because there’s something in you that needs to be said.</p><p>Maybe that’s happening with <em>Reunion</em>. Maybe solving the story of Max and Chloe addresses some yearning on the part of the storytellers; I don’t know their hearts. What I do know is that many people create art to make life more bearable, safely explore dangerous situations, or maybe to give themselves the voice that the various injustices and pressures of the real world have robbed from them. Even the most crass and selfish writing, and even the most mature fiction, must do something <em>more </em>than exist for its own sake. The line is blurry in this case. What are we doing? Are we making something true or something marketable? Said another way: if you’re making something with the intention to market it far and wide, does that make it harder—impossible even—to still write something soul-soothing and true?</p><p>When I see marketing about <em>Reunion</em> talk about giving characters what they deserve and being for fans by fans, I cannot help but brace for something terrible. Even if, as the game’s <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Xbox Wire post</u></a> states, “their reunion could be no quick fix,” I cannot help focus on that final word: fix.We must fix this. We must fix our stories. We must save our characters. We must please our fans. We must protect our bottom line. We must take it all back. We must smooth all friction.</p><p>It’s easy to see how we reached this point. The world is a mess potentially on the brink of war and certainly in the throes of ecological collapse. The games industry itself is imploding with jobs lost by the thousands and studios fizzling away into the ether. Through all this, people want stability. They want known quantities. They crave a return to a time when things were not so scary. And executives at big companies with popular franchises want to find ways to sell their games and keep things out of the red. Do it right and you’ll even snag a good Metacritic score alongside all those big sales numbers.</p><p>You can see it in many “franchises” in the AAA space. Having blown up their playerbase with the disastrous <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, Electronic Arts fashioned <a href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions/"><em><u>Battlefield 6</u></em></a> into the familiar well-trod modern warfare of past successes. After spending two main entries and almost a decade with new settings and characters (ignoring various remakes), <em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>returns players to Raccoon City and brings back grizzled veteran Leon Kennedy for some zombie smashing.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Resident Evil Requiem (Capcom)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In some cases, studios can resell old stories at a higher price. When <em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em> releases next month, the old remaster will be delisted and unavailable for individual purchase. Instead of paying twenty dollars on Steam, you pay sixty dollars to enjoy a story that was originally released in 2009. And some people will pay because it reminds them of old times. </p><p>It is hard to not imagine Chloe Price being glass that read “Break In Case Of Emergency.” At a time when the prevailing desire is to return to a more innocent time and during a period when fandom pressure seems to overwhelm developers as studios struggle to stay alive, I am not entirely sure the story promised in <em>Reunion</em>’s marketing is the one that wants to be told and not the one which is simply crowd-pleasing. While Xbox Wire writes that <em>Reunion </em>is “a full circle moment for both developers and fans,” there were possibly other voices in the room: voices from marketing or publishing departments, mandates from people with higher paychecks. It might be this is really where the makers of <em>Life is Strange </em>or <em>Resident Evil</em> or any other game that promises something “by and for” fans want to go next, but I’m also certain that people in the marketing and publishing departments of each respective studio are relieved that they don’t need to pitch players quite so hard to buy their games.&nbsp;</p><p>And maybe there were voices from the world outside too: a false promise of simplicity, that mess can be overwritten. Be it from real fans or imagined, there might have been a pressure to please above all other things. The marketing tells players that stories are here to cater to them, that they <em>deserve</em> those stories. And while this could be a story that really grapples with those old choices and mistakes, it could also be one that says that what fans and characters deserve are no loose ends and gives them a way to make everything “okay.”&nbsp;</p><p>To wind back the clock on Chloe Price betrays a certain kind of anxiety and suggests, at least through marketing language, that the games after <em>Life Is Strange</em> lack a kind of legitimacy. Those were not you, dear fans. We’d never betray you like that. We’ll always give you what you deserve. Let us return together to a simpler time before we made hard choices.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a lie and a dangerous one. It is a poison dropped into the well by the forces of capital. Art is a gift from one person to another; it is a message crafted to express the truths we cannot adequately state through simple conversation. Characters don’t deserve anything, and players don’t deserve anything but what is true. And stories born of financial anxiety, stories which upturn progress and shift back to the comfortable, are not telling us the truth.</p>

<p>It's the Obstagoon Parade!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company is back with the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Trading Card Game Pocket</a> expansion of 2026, and it's a <em>fantastical</em> one.</p>
<p>The 'Fantastical Parade' set launches on <strong>28th January</strong> at <strong>5pm PST / 1am GMT (29th) / 2am CET (29th)</strong>, featuring none other than Gardevoir on the cover. This one throws in a couple of new Mega ex cards for Gardevoir, Mawile and Teal Mask Ogerpon, as well as a particularly fetching full art card of Falinks.</p>
<p>The above trailer provides a pretty decent overview of what we can expect from the expansion, but here's a closer look at a handful of the new cards:</p>


<p>Fantastical Parade will also see the introduction of Stadium cards into TCG Pocket, which, much like the regular card game, can apply effects over the entire battle.</p>
<p>With just one week until this one arrives, it might be a good time to start saving your Pack Hourglasses.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-goes-full-liquidation-on-docking-stations-its-14-port-160w-dock-crashes-to-an-all-time-low-2000661988</link>
            <guid>1413325</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s not uncommon for workstations and gaming setups to get cluttered fast. Most of us rely on multiple devices to get through our days, and managing each of them can be a hassle. If you’re looking to reduce the cable mess on your desk and want something that can power/charge all your essentials at once, we recommend checking the 14-port Anker Prime docking station out, especially at its current price.</p>
<p>This 14-in-1 solution is great for charging, transferring data, and even managing dual displays. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">It normally retails for a not-so-friendly price of $270, but you can grab it today for just $170 at Amazon. That’s after a massive 37% limited time discount</a>. It’s a straightforward offer, meaning you don’t have to worry about using any coupon codes or following complicated checkout processes to score the drop. Delivery is free too, which brings the overall cost down even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Manage All Your Essentials In a Single Place</h2>
<p>You’re getting 14 ports in total, which lets you manage a ton of gadgets simultaneously. At the front, you’ll find USB-C and USB-A for fast data transfers and charging, plus an audio jack for headphones or earbuds. The back features HDMI ports for a multi-monitor setup, as well as an Ethernet port, additional USB-A ports, and a USB-C upstream connection for your laptop.</p>
<p>A 160W of total output is capable of fast charging up to four devices at the same time using three USB-C ports at 100W max each and one USB-A port at 12W max. Moving files across will take seconds, too, thanks to speedy transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps. Translation? With this at hand, you can connect all your important peripherals in one place. Think topping up your phone up as you finish a work deadline, plus offloading heavy files from your PC to a secondary storage device in just a couple of minutes.</p>



<p>Those who prefer a larger, more productive setup will appreciate how the dual HDMI ports offer crystal-clear streaming or mirroring across two displays at up to 2K@60Hz with a DP 1.4 laptop or 1080p@60Hz with a DP 1.2 laptop. With Windows, you can use the setup to keep meetings on the secondary display while working on the main one, or even use a third display for reference material. It works a bit differently on macOS, however, as both external displays will mirror the same content.</p>
<p>Compatibility-wise, the dock supports USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt connections, plus plays nicely with Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, and laptops that support DP Alt Mode and Power Delivery. What’s even better is that it comes with an efficient airflow system, and the ActiveShield technology monitors the temperature over 3,000,000 times per day to maintain optimal performance, even when things get a bit intense. You won’t have to worry about the system overheating and negatively impacting the connected devices.</p>
<p>Included in the box is the 14-in-1 Anker dock itself, a USB-C cable for the upstream port (3.3 ft, 100W, 10Gbps), and a safety sheet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">The dock is now available for just $170 at Amazon, down from $270. It’s not every day you get to save a nice $100 on an efficient solution such as this one</a>. Additionally, the offer is likely going to expire soon, so it’s best to grab it fast.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s time to be directed by Xbox once again. The fourth annual Xbox Developer Direct is here for 2026, and with Microsoft celebrating the 25th anniversary of Xbox, it’s certain to be a big show to kick off the year. </p>



<p>Xbox Developer Direct 2026 starts at 1pm ET/6pm GMT and airs on all official Xbox channels. This year’s event has three games advertised so far. </p>







<p>Players will get their first look at gameplay for Forza Horizon 6, a deeper dive into Fable, and new details for Game Freak’s—yes, <em>that </em>Game Freak—Beast of Reincarnation. There are also rumors of a surprise game or two making the rounds, but fans will just have to tune in and see if those turn out to be true. </p>



<p>To stop you from having to go elsewhere, though, you can watch it, in full, in the video below. And don’t forget to leave your thoughts on everything down in the comments and join the discussion with other games in the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p><strong>This story will begin updating shortly after 1pm EST.</strong> Be sure to bookmark this page and refresh to get all of the latest updates from the Xbox Developer Direct.</p>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</h3>



<p>The showcase began with the first look at Forza Horizon 6, which takes the series to Japan for the first time. Players start out as a tourist in Japan, racing to prove themselves throughout their career. The developers spoke about the decision to take the game to Japan as well as new features and events.</p>



<p>The game will feature over 550 cars at launch, including aftermarket cars that can be found parked throughout the world. It was also made official that Forza Horizon 6 will release on May 19, 2026. Those who pre-order the Deluxe Edition of the game can start playing on May 15. The game will launch on PlayStation 5 later in 2026. </p>
