              <p><span>The Pokémon Company seems likely t</span><span>o reveal the upcoming Generation X games in February on the series’ 30th anniversary, but if leakers have anything to say about it, Game Freak might not have much new information to give us by the time that showcase arrives. On December 24, a series of new leaks about the games, allegedly titled </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i></a><span>, began spreading online. We’ve gotten a few waves (sorry) of information since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-wind-wave-pikachu-leak-generation-10-redesign-2000635674"><span>the massive Teraleak</span></a><span> in October, but now we know a little bit more about the games’ map, battle gimmick, and have even our first look at the new region’s professor.</span></p> <p><span>The latest info was posted on X early today by self-described <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2003786462651932797">Pokémon detective Moot Monthly</a>. All of these new images, animations, and illustrations are reportedly from this existing leak, so it’s entirely possible they aren’t indicative of the final games that will eventually ship on Switch 2. But they do give us some interesting insight into what Game Freak has been working on for the next mainline entries.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Christmas came early, heres ur pokemon gen 10 leaks </p> <p>&gt;Gen 10 map<br>&gt;Majin Pikachu<br>&gt;professor<br>&gt;gameplay</p> <p>Join gaiachads discord for a q&amp;a when i wake up link in bio <a href="https://t.co/QmIuuTqgTi">pic.twitter.com/QmIuuTqgTi</a></p> <p>— Moot /ムート (@Mootmonthly) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mootmonthly/status/2003786462651932797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>First, we have a new look at the beta versions of the male and female protagonists, and their previously reported Rotom scooter that they’ll ride around on. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>really popped off with its fashion, so hopefully we’ll be able to customize our characters’ fits in </span><i><span>Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i><span>.</span></p>

Apparently, the professor will ride around in a car and appear in multiple locations in the games’ archipelago setting. Right now, all we know is that he appears to be an older man with thick eyebrows and a beard.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="de" dir="ltr">Pokémon Gen 10 leak: the new Professor (he drives around in a car!) and how the new Pokémon Centers will look <a href="https://t.co/erGuj76bUM">https://t.co/erGuj76bUM</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2003838143943094555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Speaking of the archipelago, we also have a new illustration of the Gen X region. Its beta map shows several islands that the player will be able to explore. Early reports say they will be procedurally generated, so it’s unclear if the map is a sort of presumed “default” shape for these islands or if the terrain is what changes for each player, rather than the shape of the landmass.&nbsp;</span></p>

What we can see for now is that this phenomenon will seemingly distort a Pokémon’s physical shape and then create some kind of cloud to obscure them. Looking at what this shit does to Pikachu in the leaked animation, I’m not immediately onboard. But hey, it’s leaked in-development footage from a hack. We’ll see how it actually changes up battles when the games are eventually revealed.</span></p>

For now, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is keeping me busy, so I’m not starving for something new right now.</span></p>

      <p>It is once again, depending on who you ask, the most wonderful time of the year. Presents are under trees, lights are looking downright strewn, and snow is on the ground where climate change still permits that to happen. To celebrate the occasion, we got ourselves a little gift: two weeks of blissful (mostly) rest.&nbsp;</p><p>From now until January 4 or so, things are going to be a little quieter than usual around here. We’ll still be running the odd blog, but it’s been a long – and for Aftermath, <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-relaunch-announcement/"><u>eventful</u></a>! – year, and we’re planning to recharge so we can come out swinging in 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you to everyone reading for making all of this possible! We literally could not be here without you, nor would we want to. We had no idea what to expect when we kicked off this experiment what feels like two eternities ago, but against all odds in an era of layoffs and site closures, our little slice of internet persists – and continues to grow! This year we brought on two regular contributors, <a href="https://aftermath.site/author/isaiahcolbert/"><u>Isaiah</u></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/author/nicolecarpenter/"><u>Nicole</u></a>, and in the coming weeks we’ll be welcoming a regular columnist into our ranks as well. We even threw a party! <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-aftermath-party-was-good/"><u>It ruled</u></a>. We’ve published numerous stories of which we are immensely proud – which you enabled by subscribing, thereby ensuring that we were significantly less subject to the fickle whims of SEO and algorithms than others.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of, here’s some reading material to keep you vaguely conscious while you digest an entire gingerbread village and all its residents:</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/game-awards-2025-protest-future-class-uvw/"><u>‘Lay Off CEOs Instead’: Game Awards Protesters Fed Up With The Show And The State Of The Industry</u></a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/queer-cartoons-elon-musk-libsoftiktok-dogs-in-space-netflix/"><u>The Rise And Fall of Queer Cartoons</u></a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/digita-audio-player-snowsky-echo-mini-fiio-hyby/"><u>A Digital Audio Player Renewed My Love Of Music</u></a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-indie-game-banned-steam-epic-review-impressions-santa-ragione/"><u>Horses Is Tame</u></a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/kensuke-ushio-chainsaw-man-the-movie-reze-arc-score-soundtrack-interview/"><u>Kensuke Ushio Dove Deep Creating The Emotionally Devastating Score For Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</u></a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-interview-twitch-stream-chicago-congress-indictment/"><u>Instead Of Relying On Wealthy Donors, Congressional Candidate Kat Abughazaleh Is Using A Twitch Stream To Raise Money – And Fight A Federal Indictment</u></a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-fired/"><u>Two Months After Firing Over Charlie Kirk Comments, Ghost Of Yotei Dev Blames Harassment Campaign, Not ‘Bad Joke’</u></a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/cyberpunk-urban-design/"><u>What Cyberpunk 2077 Can Teach Real-World Cities</u></a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2/"><u>The Art Of Playing The Damn Video Game</u></a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-friday-connoreatspants-interview-gavin-newsom/"><u>How Fortnite Friday Grew From A Bit Into An Institution That Could Pull Gavin Newsom</u></a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-is-the-ultimate-forced-meme/"><u>AI Is The Ultimate "Forced Meme"</u></a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/nike-playstation-ridge-racer-kaz-hirai/"><u>Check Out This Pair Of 'Ridge Racer' Sneakers, Reportedly Made To Commemorate Kaz Hirai's Famous E3 2006 Presentation</u></a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending/"><u>Hades 2's Story Doesn't Change The Status Quo</u></a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/samuel-deats-anime-animation-horses-kiss-scene/"><u>What’s Harder To Draw: Horses Or Kisses?

            <link>https://wccftech.com/steam-currently-down-no-word-from-valve/</link>

			<p><strong>Update 24/12/2025 3:36 pm EST - </strong>The Steam store and website are back online. Altogether, the store was only offline for a little over an hour. You can go back to redeeming those gift cards and squeezing every cent out of them during the Winter Sale.</p>



<p>That said, we may not be entirely out of the woods yet, so if you're still having issues, maybe just give it a little more time.</p>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>If you're sat at home trying to peruse the Steam Winter Sale, but can't get anything beyond a black screen on the Steam app or an Error message on the website, fret not - it's not your family home's poor WiFi. <strong>Steam is currently down,</strong> and it's unclear as to when it'll be back online.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, there's been no notice from Valve as to what is causing the issue, as Steam and the website have been down for the past hour. Thousands of reports have been flooding <a href="https://downdetector.ca/status/steam/">DownDetector</a> since the issues started, and the <a href="https://steamstat.us/">unofficial status on SteamDB</a> shows that over 250K people have visited the site to see what's happening with Steam.</p>



<p>It's an unfortunate time for the digital storefront to be offline, as surely there are millions of players around the world excited to redeem their gift cards for the digital storefront and see what they can knock off their wishlist at a supreme discount.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thankfully, the Winter Sale doesn't end until January 5, 2026, by which time you can expect Valve to have fixed whatever is causing the issue. In the meantime, if you haven't already, you can head over to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-free-on-epic-games-store/">the Epic Games Store to redeem today's free game, The Callisto Protocol</a>. </p>



<p>And once you're done that, you can continue waiting for Steam to be back online, since, <a href="https://wccftech.com/egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-home-developer-explains-why-pc-users-attached-valves-platform/">as <strong>Adrian Chmielarz</strong> explained in a recent interview,</a> the Epic Games Store isn't a home for PC players, but Steam is.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>People are not, basically, using EGS as their home, it’s not home to them. I don’t know if it’s deliberate or not, but EGS doesn’t have written reviews. They don’t have the forums. There’s nothing to do there but to buy. So that will always lose to a shop that is also emotional and you can basically engage with the shop</em>. <em>EGS is a shop, and Steam is a community.</em>"</p>



<p>We'll update this article if Valve provides any notice as to why the store is down and how long it may take them to fix the problem, or if the store just magically starts working again.</p>

            <guid>1391854</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When it comes to single-player games, 2025 offered no shortage of memorable experiences. Big sequels, ambitious new IPs, and long-anticipated releases all took turns dominating the conversation, making it one of the more competitive years in recent memory. With so many strong options on the table, the Insider Gaming community had plenty to consider when casting their votes.</p>



<p>In the end, one game stood above the rest. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been voted the Insider Gaming community’s Best Single Player Game of 2025.</p>







<p>In a poll hosted on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>, Clair Obscur finished first with 22.6% percent of the votes. Sandfall Interactive’s RPG edged out a packed field that included Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and Dispatch.</p>



<p>The result also lines up with the game’s wider reception. Clair Obscur has been universally acclaimed by fans and holds a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">9.6 user score</a> on Metacritic.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-the-votes-shook-out">How The Votes Shook Out</h2>



<p>As mentioned, the poll was filled with worthy recipients. Dispatch finished second with 14.8% of the vote, while Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 followed at 12.2%. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Death Stranding 2 each earned 11.3%, highlighting just how divided the community was among several games.</p>



<p>What ultimately pushed Clair Obscur ahead was how strongly it resonated with players. Rather than leaning on spectacle or familiar franchise beats, the game delivered a focused, self-contained experience that trusted its atmosphere and presentation to do the heavy lifting. Its distinct visual style and deliberate pacing helped it stand out in a year crowded with massive releases.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As tradition, the PSN January Sale has kicked off before Christmas so it can tempt you to spend those PSN Gift cards straight away.&nbsp; Also as tradition, the savings depend on where you are in the world so there’s no easy way to collate them all but hopefully this should give you an idea of what’s on offer.</p>
<p>The final tradition is that the banner adverts on the store lie, you can actually save up to 90%, not 75%.</p>


<p>There are some really good offers this time, especially if you are picking up older games. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-ultimate-edition/">Control: Ultimate Edition</a> is cheaper than a pint and under £6 so if you have not played that, then you really should grab it, and I can also recommend <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/still-wakes-the-deep/">Still Wakes The Deep: The Complete Edition</a>, which is a few pennies over £13. You are also completely mad if you don’t pick up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/limbo/">Limbo</a> AND Inside for £2.19.</p>
<p>A word of warning, the store is still packed full of rubbish shovelware, but if you really want to jack up your Platinum trophy count then Beanball is on sale for seven pence – yes, 7p – and you can get the Plat in 5 mins.</p>
<p>More recent games with savings include <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-f/">Silent Hill f</a>, <span><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a>, and ARC Raiders. I think I am going to grab <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dispatch/">Dispatch.</a></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We recently sat down with Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, creator of Escape from Tarkov. Amongst other things, we took a dive into the concept of Escape from Tarkov coming to consoles, which is something that the developer teased at the recent Tokyo Game Show event.</p>



<p>In his own words, Nikita has stressed that an Escape from Tarkov console port wouldn’t be made ‘easier’. In fact, it would be ‘the same frustrating experience’ that players have been experiencing on PC for many years, retaining that hardcore, unwelcoming vibe.</p>



<p>It’s his mission to make players break controllers.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-would-escape-from-tarkov-on-console-look-like">What Would Escape from Tarkov on Console Look Like?</h2>



<p>Many have surmised that Escape from Tarkov on PlayStation or Xbox would represent a slimmed-down, ‘lite’ version of the tough-as-nails extraction shooter. But after catching up with Nikita Buyanov on the most recent episode of Insider Gaming’s Access Granted, we have gathered a different picture entirely.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure that it would be a ‘lite’ version of EFT. The main goal is to create the same experience for the consoles, so there won’t be any kind of aim assist, any simplifiying of the gaming features.</p>



<p>I really want to get the same frustrating experience for the consoles, to bring on this hardcore feeling to a wider audience.</p>



<p>We don’t plan to conquer something, we just want to create something new for the consoles, something new, a new experience, because they’ve never had that before, I mean the true hardcore experience that will break their controllers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Nikita made the ‘frustrating experience’ comment with a chuckle! </p>



<p>Nikita explained what the challenges are. It’s a discussion mostly centered around the complexity of Escape from Tarkov, which features inventory and health management, survival mechanics, and most importantly, <strong>stacks </strong>of keybinds that only a keyboard and mouse player can realistically handle.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It won’t be something simplified or a casual version of EFT. It will be the same EFT, but of course it needs to be optimized for the current-gen consoles.</p>



<p>The main challenge will be to put in all the controls. It will be the main challenge for us, but in general, I think it will be pretty interesting to do.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Given that Escape from Tarkov only hit ‘full release’ in November, it might be ambitious to believe that Battlestate Games will muster up a console version any time soon. The only thing to go on is Nikita’s mention of ‘current-gen consoles’ for any kind of a timeline.</p>



<p>If you want to check out the full interview with Nikita, you can do so on the Insider Gaming app, available now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.insidergaming.app">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/insider-gaming/id6753984648">iOS</a>.

But TL;DR, <strong>Story of Seasons</strong> is the OG – the original farming game series that sparked thousands of copycats hoping to carve out a slice of that cosy game pie.</p>
<p>And who can blame them? The farming game genre is a fantastic, strange little thing, and for a long time, Story of Seasons was the absolute King. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_the_river_king"><em>River</em> King</a>, if you will. That's just a fun little Harvest Moon joke for the fans.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly... they weren't. After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> kicked down the door in 2016 and began eating original developer Marvelous' lunch, it was suddenly open season for farming game developers, and everyone was grabbing guns. Everyone, that is, except Marvelous.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ylLGp-DIVlY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytylLGp-DIVlY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed601436ihtxqz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>While other studios were riffing on the formula with dinosaurs, corpses, slimes, witches, and queer relationships, Marvelous faltered, releasing mid-tier <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doraemon_story_of_seasons">Doraemon</a> tie-ins, remakes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_friends_of_mineral_town">Friends of Mineral Town</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_a_wonderful_life">A Wonderful Life</a> (which were admittedly good, but a little geriatric compared to modern farming games), and the only original release, the empty grind-fest that was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_pioneers_of_olive_town">Pioneers of Olive Town</a>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3aceb35044bde"><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3aceb35044bde/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It was starting to seem like the glory days of Story of Seasons games were long behind us. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/story_of_seasons_trio_of_towns">Trio of Towns</a>, the last SoS game made in a pre-Stardew world, was one of their best. It seemed like Marvelous was spooked by their competition, and worse, like they were trying to <em>copy</em> it – Pioneers of Olive Town cribbed heavily and clumsily from Stardew's homework rather than remembering what made them the genre trailblazer in the first place. Even Natsume's <strong>Harvest Moon</strong> spinoffs started getting better than Story of Seasons, which is like watching a pug with three legs outrun a greyhound.</p>
<p>So by the time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_grand_bazaar">Grand Bazaar</a> was announced – another remake, this time of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/harvest_moon_ds_grand_bazaar">much less popular Story of Seasons game</a> (albeit one with a cult following) – I had already grown jaded. It would probably be <em>fine</em>. It couldn't possibly be worse than Pioneers of Olive Town's deserted towns and dull mines.</p>
<p>But they did it! They actually did it! Marvelous dug deep, went back to the drawing board, found an ember of their old magic hidden at the back of a cupboard, and nurtured it into a roaring flame.</p>

<p>Grand Bazaar's remake is deep, detailed, <em>gorgeous</em>, and as a delightful surprise, fully voiced. No longer is Marvelous looking over its shoulder at the other farming games on the market. No longer are they trying to keep up with the cool kids. Instead, Story of Seasons is finally getting back in touch with its roots, focusing on characters, a sense of community, and that signature supernatural silliness that brought us things like Vinnie the talking plant and the Harvest Sprites.</p>
<p>Even better, I feel like you can tell that the developers themselves are happier. Pioneers of Olive Town felt like a game that struggled to find its identity – often the result of over-iterating on the design with no clear vision, or more simply, just not having a ton of money or time – whereas Grand Bazaar practically <em>glows</em> with personality. There are small touches of care and detail everywhere, from the flags and window shutters flapping in the wind to the post-game addition of the Happy Bingo system, just to give players more to do.</p>
<p>There are tons of additions to the original game, including new characters, villager requests, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>-inspired gliding system, voiced dialogue, character customisation, and the all-important same-gender romance – all of which show a great deal of knowledge about what the farming game community likes to see in these sorts of games.</p>
<figure data-uuid="735fdb0231920"><a title="Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/735fdb0231920/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And then there's the Bazaar itself. I never played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/harvest_moon_ds_grand_bazaar">the original</a>, but from what I understand, it was a much simpler thing, which has been entirely reworked and expanded, with deeper systems. It also does away with some of the frustrations of its predecessor, like customer questions. It's an insightful way to bring the game up to modern tastes without losing the flavour that made those old games successful in the first place, and I can't wait to see them channel these learnings into a new, original game.</p>
<p>We probably won't get any insight into what it was like to develop Grand Bazaar, but I wouldn't be surprised if Marvelous did some drastic reshaping of the studio and its development processes to make Grand Bazaar as good as it is. It's not just pretty – because Friends of Mineral Town and A Wonderful Life were pretty – it's a game that finally stands up to others in the competitive farming game genre. I just hope that it's not a fluke.</p>
<p>I really, really want to see Marvelous continue to prove why they've been around for so long, and Grand Bazaar is, at last, a step in the right direction.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has revealed the design for Da Red Gobbo 2025 miniature. The tabletop studio continues its tradition of making a Christmas-themed miniature for <em>Warhammer</em>. This year's miniature brings good cheer and a robot suit to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a>.</p><h2>Da Red Gobbo 2025 Miniature Announcement</h2><p>In a recent <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/qskksauw/grotmas-calendar-day-24-da-red-gobbos-big-heist/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop announced Da Red Gobbo 2025 miniature. Much like past Christmas-themed gobbos, this year's miniature is packed with <em>Warhammer's</em> distinct visual excess. In this case, a goblin in a Santa outfit in a freshly stolen experimental suit of armor.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The miniature includes a free battleplan to use in your game. Your army either helps or hinders the jolly goblin from escaping the workshop of Niklozzar of the Ashen Beard. The "nice" player will get a defense boost while protecting Da Red Gobbo. The "naughty" player gets weapon buffs to help them shoot the little guy down.</p><p>As for the gobbo himself, his behavior on the battlefield is random. The reason? He doesn't know how the suit works. This means every turn, he pushes random buttons on the suit, causing different effects. Units might turn invisible. Hit and wound rolls might get re-rolled. Who knows? Certainly not the guy working the suit.</p><p>Da Red Gobbo 2025 is the latest announcement as part of Games Workshop's Grotmas Calendar event. This Advent Calendar-style string of holiday announcements has encompassed all of the studio's popular series, including <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, and the grimdark world of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>.</p><p>The overall quality of these announcements has been mixed at best. They range from short fiction, seasonal painting tutorials, the introductions of the Helsmiths of Hashut faction to <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, new army detachments,, and new missions.</p><p>Nevertheless, Da Red Gobbo 2025 is a great reminder that, for all of the excessive violence, authoritarian nightmares, and existentially terrifying cosmic horrors that live in the <em>Warhammer</em> franchise, Games Workshop knows how to keep things light and fun during the holiday season.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you thought the Fallout television show wasn’t enough and you wanted more live-action adaptations, you won’t have to wait too long. It has just been claimed that Prime is assembling a new reality show (‘MrBeast style’) that will plant contestants in a live-action representation of <strong>Fallout Shelter</strong>.</p>



<p>It has been reported that production will start in 2026, and that those taking part in the show will need to build and manage their own vault, keeping their vault dwellers ‘alive’.</p>



<h2 id="h-mixed-responses-surface-about-the-fallout-shelter-show">Mixed Responses Surface About the Fallout Shelter Show</h2>



<p>In an exclusive report from <a href="https://www.theinsneider.com/p/fallout-reality-competition-series-amazon-prime-video-jonathan-nolan-lisa-joy-apply-2026-production" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jeff Sneider</a>, it was claimed that Prime is working on a Fallout Shelter reality show produced by Jonathan Nolan, executive producer on the core Fallout show.</p>



<p>Last year, Fallout emerged in live-action form with an all-new television series tied into the game’s central universe. With an original story, Bethesda Game Studios, Prime Video, and Kilter concocted an authentic representation of the post-apocalyptic world that millions of fans know and love.</p>



<p>It seems that the teams involved aren’t content with just that show, as another one is claimed to be in the works.</p>



<p>Working with a ‘Squid Game’ or ‘MrBeast’ operating model, it seems that Prime Video is eager to assemble a Fallout Shelter adaptation. The purported show will see contestants build and run their own vaults, which are pivotal to the story in the Fallout franchise.</p>



<p>In these vaults, survivors live underground and outlast the nuclear annihilation of the world above, but it’s unlikely Amazon will green-light the destruction of the planet to accommodate a Fallout Shelter show.</p>



<p>Let’s hope not, anyway.</p>



<p>Fallout’s second season is unravelling as we speak, with the second episode having dropped yesterday, December 23. It’s an award-winning series with a brilliant cast, and it’s well worth a watch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Insider Gaming’s Best Indie Game of the Year 2025]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Indie games are more important than ever. With the AAA market experiencing a mix of results and more layoffs than ever, it may be safer to lean toward indie development. It’s worked out for many of the world’s best titles, and Insider Gaming’s 2025 Indie Game of the Year highlights why.</p>



<p>The lines between an Indie game and AA or even AAA titles are becoming more blurred by the second. Some releases appear to have been created by a single person—which is often the case, as seen with LocalThunk’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-balatro-seeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro</a>—whereas others seem like premium, high-priced packages. From Schedule 1 to Ball X Pit, this list has picked out the best Indie games of 2025, and there’s one winner.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-indie-game-of-2025-winner-hollow-knight-silksong">Best Indie Game Of 2025 Winner—Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p>It would be remiss if Insider Gaming didn’t clarify two things: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <em>hasn’t </em>made this list, as the budget and development team (which is obviously more than the originally claimed 30 people) does not classify to IG as ‘indie,’ and the other point being that this award could’ve gone to one of two games, quite easily.</p>



<p>That being said, Hornet gets to wear the silky crown! Team Cherry’s Silksong never quite hit the ridiculous GTA 6 levels of hype, but there’s probably no indie game in history that garnered as much attention, anticipation, wishlists, and topped virtually any other metric for an upcoming indie title. Hollow Knight: Silksong had to be as good, if not surpass, than the immense legacy of the original Hollow Knight.</p>



<p>Siliksong is a technical and entertainment masterpiece from start to finish. It still edges out Ori for the most incredible environmental design, and the combat and exploration mechanics have gone up a notch. Boss battles are electric, and there’s an ever-present danger wherever you go. The almost shameless ceiling of difficulty is never masked at any point, but you’re rewarded for your perseverance and persistence with secret areas, enchanting NPCs, and side quests.</p>



<p>With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow-dlc-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sea of Sorrow DLC</a> on the way, enhancing an already criminally low price point, Silksong is a sumptuous banquet of indie excellence.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-indie-game-of-2025-nominations">Best Indie Game of 2025 Nominations</h2>



<h3 id="h-hades-2">Hades 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Launch time. Image via Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>We said this award could’ve gone either way, and Hades 2 will be many people’s pick for Indie GOTY, and rightly so. Supergiant Games already has a GOTY award in the trophy cabinet thanks to the original Hades. This put a burden on the sequel’s shoulders that even Zeus might struggle to shoulder. Thanks to early access (which played a small part in this decision), Hades 2 has taken an already solid foundation, updated it, and tweaked it into a Herculean-looking work of art.</p>



<p>You might not be able to go back to Hades 1 after playing the follow-up! With the added diversity of going above ground as well as slaying below it, and more Boons and combat systems to consider, Hades 2 is a more than worthy successor, and rightly took its place alongside Silksong in the overall <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/6-biggest-announcements-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> GOTY nominees.</p>







<h3 id="h-ball-x-pit">Ball X Pit</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Kenny Sun</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’ve not heard of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-trophy-list-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ball X Pit</a>, you need to; if you have played it, it’s SO good, isn’t it? Ball X Pit doesn’t require inch-perfect timing, lightning-quick reflexes, and its skill ceiling isn’t outrageous. This is easily one of the most chill games of 2025, and it’s another roguelike. You can comfortably sit back and relax for most of your runs, and all you need to do is just move the left analog stick around. But your progress is determined by your on-the-fly decision-making when it comes to Balls and Passive Abilities.</p>



<p>Ball X Pit might not seem skillful at first, but it can take a few in-game hours to understand the nuances of the gameplay: How to angle your shots, where to concentrate your attacks, which synergies are superior, and how to make the game’s most broken combinations. It has one of the best soundtracks of 2025, and you’ll have a <em>ball </em>playing it.</p>



<h3 id="h-blue-prince">Blue Prince</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>In terms of methodical pacing, nothing comes close to Blue Prince. Every move and decision you make is taken one room at a time as you seek to find Room 46—if it even exists. This is the third of four roguelikes on this list—is the industry trying to tell us something? You have a limited amount of time to map out a route in your inherited house to find Room 46.</p>



<p>Along the way are key items that you can use on subsequent runs to make more progress, discover, and solve more mysteries. The idea is to repeat this process repeatedly, as it all helps you to eventually find Room 46. Its masterful environmental storytelling and intrinsic gameplay and teachings make this an easy-to-pick-up and play game. Wonderfully atmospheric and ever-intriguing, the punny-named Blue Prince (Blueprints?) has earned its place.</p>

              <p>It’s certainly true that&nbsp;<em>Strange Jigsaws</em> came out as long ago as August, and it’s also very much the case that the game has a blistering <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702170/Strange_Jigsaws/">“Overwhelmingly Positive” rating on Steam</a> with a remarkable 99 percent of player reviews giving the game a thumbs-up. But somehow, this stunning follow-up to 2024’s lovely <em>20 Small Mazes</em> has not received <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/strange-jigsaws/">a single published review</a>, and has gone forgotten in end-of-year lists. What a peculiar situation. Let’s address that a little bit by talking about why <i>Strange Jigsaws </i>is such a wonderful game, and how it’s a brilliant choice to play during your winter holidays.</p> <p>2024’s&nbsp;<em>20 Small Mazes</em> was a free game created by FLEB that was so much more than its title suggested. I mean, it&nbsp;<em>was</em> literally 20 small mazes, but it was also <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2024/02/20-small-mazes/">an extremely clever collection of puzzles</a>, each presented as if it were a simple maze but in actuality loaded with completely lovely ideas. It was bonkers that it was free, but perhaps it was something of a runway for <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>, a spiritual sequel that at first looks like it employs a similar conceit, but quickly reveals a whole new realm of intricacy.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655426"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655426">© FLEB / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This time out, there are 50 “jigsaws” to solve, and I use quotes here because it’s so often more involved than that. As with <em>Mazes</em>, none is straightforward, each possessing a unique twist or original way of being solved. Even the main menu is part of its elaborate mystery of interconnecting elements that defy the laws of physics. Or rely on them, in one case.</p>

 <p>I love that it seems, on reflection, as if <em>20 Small Mazes</em> might have been part of this project, a deliberate effort to create expectations that&nbsp;<em>Strange Jigsaws</em> constantly defies. “Yeah, you thought this was another cute little bunch of novel ideas? Well, now figure out how this factory game spoof fits in to the creation of a lifeform you inadvertently engineered. Oh, here’s a puzzle that’s arrived from the future, locked behind a code and labelled ‘THE PAST.’ (It’s near the puzzle that’s on fire.) Once you’ve solved it, you can enter the infinite zoom!” Oh my goodness, I’m not sure gaming has offered anything else as clever as <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>‘&nbsp;infinite zoom this year.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655429" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655429"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655429">© FLEB / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is a masterful creation, and it’s rather mystifying why no one (including me!) reviewed it. It’s not too late, of course. And right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702170/Strange_Jigsaws/">you can get it for yourself for just $4</a>! That’s madness. Do that, for goodness sakes. Then buy another one for a friend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With 2025 coming to a close, the team at Insider Gaming wants to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a happy and healthy New Year. </p>



<p>Our team is taking a well-deserved break to end the year, and will return in full on Monday, January 5. In the meantime, there is plenty of content coming to the site over the next couple of weeks ranging from the results of the Insider Gaming Community Awards to year-in-review features and more.</p>



<p>Of course, should anything major break that needs coverage, we will bring it to you with the same speed and quality that Insider Gaming has become known for. </p>



<h2 id="h-a-sincere-thank-you">A Sincere Thank You</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As we wind down 2025, we want to leave you with our sincerest thanks. Insider Gaming has only been around since 2022, and this year has been far and away our best year yet. And that’s all thanks to you, our dedicated readers.</p>



<p>Your support has made us one of the fastest-growing independent gaming media outlets. Whether it’s been reading our stories, watching our shows, participating in our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community Discord</a>, and even <a href="https://forms.gle/yMkn9VMdSLwXEJn87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking our surveys</a> to help shape our future, everything you’ve done has helped turn Insider Gaming into what it is today. </p>



<p>And we can’t forget to talk about the biggest accomplishment of the year, the release of the Insider Gaming App. Since our launch, an app was one of the of the most requested things in our yearly reader surveys. You wanted a way to get your information in a quick and clean matter, and that’s what we brought you this year.</p>



<p>The free Insider Gaming App’s launch on <a href="https://insider-gaming.net/visit/insider-gaming-app-ios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.net/visit/insider-gaming-app-android/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android</a> has been nothing short of mind blowing. We had our goals of where we wanted to be with it by the end of the year, and you blew that out of the water. Again, thank you!</p>



<p>And lastly, to our Insider Gaming Premium and Premium Plus members. Running an independent gaming outlet in this era is hard of closures and consolidations is hard. To be honest, we were nervous about launching any sort of premium plan. But you all showed up and showed your support in a way that we couldn’t even have imagined. We can’t overstate just how much it means to us that you would support a small editorial team like ours in the way you have. </p>



<p>You are allowing us to do what we love to do, which is tell stories about the gaming industry and bring you the latest news, exclusive information, and reviews that you need to know about. And because of your support, we’ve been able to plan out even more features and content for Premium and Premium Plus subscribers. More details on that will be coming shortly after the start of the new year!</p>



<p>Thank you again to everyone who’s visited the site, downloaded the app, shared our work, and joined our discussions. </p>



<p>Here’s to an even better 2026!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Merry Christmas Eve, The Callisto Protocol Is Free Today on the Epic Games Store]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-free-on-epic-games-store/</link>
            <guid>1391740</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Games Store is continuing its annual tradition of giving away one game each day over the holiday period, and on the night before Christmas, it's Striking Distance Studio's maligned spiritual successor to Dead Space: <strong>The Callisto Protocol</strong>.</p>



<p>Epic kicked off this year's barrage of free games <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/">with Hogwarts Legacy</a> the night of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025,</a> which was free from the night of the show, December 11, until December 18. Following that, on December 18, Epic began giving away one free game a day. So far, the store has given away:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy (Dec. 11-18)</li>



<li>Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel (Dec. 18)</li>



<li>Eternights (Dec. 19)</li>



<li>Blood West (Dec. 20)</li>



<li>Sorry We're Closed (Dec. 21)</li>



<li>Paradise Killer (Dec. 22) </li>



<li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (Dec. 23)</li>



<li>The Callisto Protocol (Dec. 24)</li>
</ul>



<p>The Callisto Protocol is arguably the biggest game to be given away since Hogwarts Legacy kicked things off, though, as a Christmas Eve giveaway, it is a tad disappointing considering it has previously been a free giveaway game on the Epic Games Store.</p>



<p>Tomorrow's giveaway for Christmas Day, and the final game that will be given away on January 1, 2026, are usually the bigger titles compared to everything else, with previous years gifting players games like Death Stranding Director's Cut.</p>



<p>If you've never played The Callisto Protocol, then you can't really go wrong with picking it up for free. Yes, it did so poorly that <a href="https://wccftech.com/glen-schofield-dead-space-the-callisto-protocol-directed-his-last-game/">it may go down as Glen Schofield's final game</a>, its <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocols-metacritic-score-caused-publisher-kraftons-stock-to-go-down/">Metacritic score may have been the cause for Krafton's stock to take a dip</a>, and yes, even <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">Schofield admitted that it was pushed out the door too early</a>.</p>



<p>But for all its faults and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/">resulting consequences</a>, if you're a fan of horror games, then it's worth your time to give The Callisto Protocol a try. It definitely doesn't reach the heights of Dead Space, but it's focus on melee combat over ranged cranks up the tension, and if you have the hardware for it (<a href="https://wccftech.com/new-the-callisto-protocol-patch-5-03-addresses-pc-ray-tracing-crashes-and-further-improves-performance/">now that its biggest issues have been patched out</a>), it is a stunning visual treat of a game.</p>



<p>As Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/">highlighted in his review back in 2022</a>, "<em>One area that The Callisto Protocol absolutely excels in, however, is in the overall presentation and graphical design. There's nary a single square inch of Callisto and Black Iron Prison that doesn't capture that derelict, abandoned spaceship vibes, complete with ambient sounds of creaking pipes or rustling footsteps in the far distance.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>More on the<em> Clair Obscur</em> AI drama, a new Arc Raiders bug that’s the perfect excuse for dying, and the French <em>Final Fantasy 9</em> cartoon is still in the works. Welcome to a special Christmas Eve edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Why am I sitting here at my desk click-clacking away on my keyboard instead of watching my kids play <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>? Because of you, dear readers. The words written mean nothing without the people on the other end. From all of us here at <em>Kotaku</em>, we wish you a happy holiday and a restful winter break.</p> <h2>No AI in <em>Clair Obscur 2</em></h2> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="11 minutes, 54 seconds and how do you plan to use it in the future?&quot;&nbsp; Guillaume , yeah, we're aware of what's been going&nbsp;&nbsp;">Director Guillaume Broche was asked about the controversy surrounding the game and the tech in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MSRfVKC-Tc">a recent Q&amp;A with YouTuber Sushi</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-admits-sandfall-tried-ai-during-the-jrpgs-development-but-didnt-like-it-and-everything-in-the-game-is-human-made/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a>). “Yeah, we’re aware of what’s been going&nbsp; on with that, but I can say everything in the&nbsp; game is human-made,” he said. “When AI first really came out in 2022, we’d already started on the game. It was&nbsp; just a new tool.”</p> <p>He continued, “We tried it and we didn’t like it at all. It just felt wrong. We had originally&nbsp; used it as a placeholder for textures we missed, but we took it out as soon as we saw it. But&nbsp; yeah, the concept art, voice actors, everything is humanmade. It’s pretty hard to predict what&nbsp; the future of the industry will look like, but everything will be made by humans from us.”</p>

 <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="11 minutes, 54 seconds and how do you plan to use it in the future?&quot;&nbsp; Guillaume , yeah, we're aware of what's been going&nbsp;&nbsp;"><em>Clair Obscur</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-loses-indie-game-awards-after-being-accused-of-lying-about-ai-use-2000655119">was recently stripped</a> of its Indie Game Awards wins over AI-generated textures that were in part of the game at launch but quickly removed. But the devil is in the details. Everything in a finished game being made by humans isn’t quite the same as saying no gen AI tools will be used <em>at some point</em> in the process, though it sounds like so far at least, Sandfall Interactive doesn’t think they’re worth the trouble moving forward.</p>

 <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em> players are dealing with a bugged guns</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">There appears to be an ARC Raiders bug not allowing players to pull their gun out</p> <p>Happened to both Ninja and Nadeshot <a href="https://t.co/I5OHM5yUHr">pic.twitter.com/I5OHM5yUHr</a></p> <p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/2003533565330677918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A clip making the rounds online shows Richard Tyler ‘Ninja’ Blevins explaining that he died in a fight because he wasn’t able to take out his gun. Other players in the comments have reported similar incidents where they’re unable to pull out a second firearm. It’s unclear how widespread the issue is but feel free to tell your friends this the next time you’re the first one down.</p>

 <h2>This might be the most painful way to try and pay <em>Silksong</em></h2> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hollow-knight-silksong-player-discovers-hornets-taunt-does-damage-proceeds-to-spend-hours-trying-to-beat-every-boss-with-it-this-is-like-watching-sisyphus-push-the-boulder-and-win/"><em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a> that YouTube user <a href="https://youtu.be/x6WZygkPqVc" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://youtu.be/x6WZygkPqVc" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://youtu.be/x6WZygkPqVc">Bloblumordthe3rd</a> is trying to beat <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> using only taunts. It’s going about as slowly as you’d expect. According to them, Hornet’s&nbsp;<em>garama&nbsp;</em>does a total of six damage with the Hunter’s Crest on, or about as much damage as the starting attack. “This is like watching Sisyphus push the boulder and win,” wrote one commenter.</p>

 <h2>A big voice protests Evo over the Saudi deal</h2> <p>Fighting game commentator Stephen&nbsp;“Sajam” Lyon will not be <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">participating in Evo 2026</a>, he said on a recent stream (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/its-a-pretty-big-deal-for-me-as-a-human-one-of-the-fgcs-most-popular-commentators-is-stepping-away-from-future-evo-events-following-its-saudi-buyout/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>). “You know, I’ve been going to EVO since 2014 and I’m not going now because of the buyout,” he said. “And before you type anything, I’m like ‘Yeah man, if the US Army bought EVO I would also not go.'”</p>

 <p>He explained his thinking future. “Evil corporations purchasing or owning the things you like always sucks. But the difference, I think, for most people here is the purpose of the ownership and then what exactly they’re doing with it. It’s not just ‘The Saudi government owns EVO’, it’s like ‘The Saudi government owns EVO and lots of other things with the express intention of using these as a vehicle to promote tourism and sportwash.'”</p>

 <h2>A <em>Final Fantasy 9</em> remake is MIA but an animated adaptation is still in the works</h2> <p>French magazine <a href="https://ecran-total.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Écran Total</a> reports (via R<a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/19263-final-fantasy-ix-animated-serieseemingly-back-in-production-at-new-french-studio-with-2028-release-target">PG Site</a>) that the <em>FF9</em> cartoon in production at now defunct Cyber Studios Group will continue on under Euro Visual. The show will be aimed at kids and have 13 episodes running about 22 minutes each.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>While 2025 didn't have some of the standout DLC/expansion releases that 2024 did with Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, that's not to say 2025 presented little to no reason to return to older titles.</p>



<p>There were several expansions and DLC releases this year that offered compelling returns to already great games, and Wccftech has selected five of this year's releases as our Best DLC/Expansions of 2025</p>



<p><em>Other Best Games of 2025 per Category: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2025-old-and-new-challengers/">Fighting Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-best-sports-and-racing-games-2025/">Sports &amp; Racing Games,</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/">Role-Playing Games</a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2025-a-year-of-frights/">Horror Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2025-jumping-and-smashing-to-victory/">Platformers</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2025-the-year-of-the-indie/">Indie Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/">Action</a></em></p>



<h2 id="h-lies-of-p-overture-8-10">Lies of P: Overture (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/lies-of-p-overture-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Lies of P: Overture. Image credit: Neowiz</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It's no Shadow of the Erdtree, but Lies of P: Overture is easily one of 2025's best DLC/expansions of the year. Neowiz and Round8 Studio return to their Bloodborne-like Pinnochio game with a prequel that sets up the events of the main game and takes the series protagonist to a snow-covered Krat.</p>



<p>It doesn't try to change or fix what wasn't broken about Lies of P, adding to the main game without taking anything away from the experience of playing through it. It steps up the difficulty in a big way, and adds to the already inventive lineup of weapons that players have available to them in the base game, and presents some impressive boss fights.</p>



<p>As Francesco De Meo wrote in his review, "<em>While it doesn't add anything substantially new to the experience, Lies of P: Overture expansion is a more than worthy expansion, delivering an engaging story delving deeper into the base game's lore, featuring some of the best bosses in the entire game, and adding new weapons that can significantly shake up combat. Its lack of innovation and unfair difficulty may turn off a few players, but all those who loved every second of the base game will have no trouble falling in love again with one of the best Soulslikes of the past few years</em>."</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-mysteria-ecclesiae">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Mysteria Ecclesiae</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/KCD2-DLC3-16x9_Unbranded.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Mysteria Ecclesiae. Image credit: Warhorse Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is a bit of a mixed entry, since we're including the other Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 DLCs in one entry, though we're also specifically highlighting the third and final DLC, Mysteria Ecclesiae. All three DLCs are worth your time and worth checking out, especially considering the fact that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is already one of the year's best games.</p>



<p>It was already an impressive game for Warhorse Studios to deliver at the top of the year, and even more impressive for the team to deliver three DLC expansions before the game had even hit its one-year anniversary. Mysteria Ecclesiae is a stunning culmination of the three DLCs, with a fun detective story that takes its foot off the gas in terms of combat and challenges players to use their investigative skills.</p>



<p>Legacy of the Forge and Brushes with Death are both fine DLC releases as well, but Mysteria Ecclesiae is the one that stands above the rest.</p>



<h2 id="h-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star Crossed World</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kirby-and-the-Forgotten-Land-Star-Crossed-World.png"></a><figcaption><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Kirby and the Forgotten Land <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/">was a remarkable outing for Kirby back in 2022</a>, so it was exciting to learn that we'd get to return to the game this year with more than just a graphical update to look forward to as part of the arrival of the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>Star-Crossed World has players revisit stages from the base game, but it's not just a walk down memory lane. Newly introduced 'Starryflowers' open up entirely new versions of levels and add a sense of excitement to revisiting every level for all of the remixed 'Starry Stages.'</p>



<p>As Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-star-crossed-world-hands-on/">wrote in their impressions of Star-Crossed World</a>, "<em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World is the first Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrade I can fully, unequivocally recommend. The game's technical update wows and the new Star-Crossed World content is inventive, fun, and easily worth the $20 premium on its own. Between this Switch 2 update and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, fans of Nintendo's pink puffball are eating hearty this year.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-super-mario-party-jamboree-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/16x9-SMPJ-NS2EditionJamboreeTV.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Another addition to the list that comes from the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 prompting Nintendo to go through the lineup of Switch games and make additions, Super Mario Party Jamoboree + Jamboree TV adds a little more to what <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-party-jamboree/">was already a fairly solid entry in the Mario Party franchise</a>.</p>



<p>Minigames like the new Carnival Coaster mode are standouts across the entire game, and it's a solid showcase of the new features that come with a Nintendo Switch 2, like the Joy-Con 2's mouse controls. That said, other minigames that try to take advantage of other new Switch 2 features, like the camera and the mic, are less successful, but still have their charm.</p>



<p>As Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-hands-on/">wrote in his impressions of Jamboree TV</a>, "<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV is an interesting showcase of Nintendo’s latest hardware features, for better or worse. The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera feels like a late-to-the-party retread of a style of gameplay that went out of fashion a decade ago, but pretty much any mode and minigame that relies on Joy-Con 2 mouse controls works out quite well. Nintendo’s asking price may be hard to justify for some, but if you’re looking for a single product that shows off all of the Switch 2’s unique abilities, this multi-talented upgrade may be worth an invite.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-sea-of-stars-throes-of-the-watchmaker">Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sea-of-Stars-Throes-of-the-Watchmaker.png"></a><figcaption><em>Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker. Image credit: Sabotage Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Sometimes, an expansion is a chance for developers to change or tweak things from the base game that perhaps didn't gel with players the first time. That's not necessarily the case with Throes of the Watchmaker, the free DLC for 2023's Sea of Stars. If you weren't already into Sea of Stars, it's not likely that this DLC will turn you into a fan of the game.</p>



<p>But there's really nothing wrong with that, as Throes of the Watchmaker leans into the best elements of Sea of Stars and adds a little more nuance to the characters and to the game's combat system. It's also another stunning display of the pixel art Sabotage Studios is capable of, and on top of all of that, it feels necessary to mention once again that this expansion is free for all players.</p>



<p>It's an easy pick as one of 2025's best DLCs, and if you already loved Sea of Stars, Throes of the Watchmaker is an absolute must-play.</p>

	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>So far, in the renaissance of film and TV adaptations of video games, on the film side, the clear winners have been the Sonic film franchise and the Super Mario Bros movie, with the latter <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/">grossing over $1.3 billion at the box office</a>. On the TV side, the standouts have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-breaks-hbo-records/">HBO's The Last of Us </a>and <strong>Amazon's Fallout</strong> series, and the momentum started by Season 1 of Fallout is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/">already being carried forward with Season 2</a>.</p>



<p>In fact, it seems that Amazon is so enamoured with the success it has seen from its Fallout series that not only is Fallout <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-renewed-for-third-season-second-season-gets-december-release-window-and-first-teaser/">getting a Season 3</a>, but a new report from film and TV insider <a href="https://www.theinsneider.com/p/fallout-reality-competition-series-amazon-prime-video-jonathan-nolan-lisa-joy-apply-2026-production?utm_source=www.theinsneider.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=exclusive-amazon-s-fallout-franchise-expanding-with-reality-competition-series-from-jonathan-nolan-lisa-joy&amp;_bhlid=f33fad6d96aa0bf16984bec469b07f4defb8438a">Jeff Sneider</a> (spotted by <a href="https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/new-fallout-show-in-the-works-but-its-not-based-on-the-game-youre-expecting/">ComicBook</a>) claims that Amazon is working on a totally new Fallout TV show based on a different game in the franchise: <strong>Fallout Shelter</strong>.</p>



<p>Yes, you read that right. The hit mobile and tabletop game that <a href="http://wccftech.com/fallout-shelter-now-available-pc-gets-update-1-6-biggest-one-yet/">eventually made its way to consoles and PC</a> is apparently the foundation for the next adaptation of Fallout, and it's not going to be another fictional story with new characters in Bethesda's nuclear dystopian future. It's going to be a reality competition show, according to the report, with competitors vying to keep vault dwellers alive and provide them with the necessary resources like food, water, and keeping their vault shelter safe.</p>



<p>The report adds that we could see the show take place across multiple Vaults, or potentially just one large one. It's unclear at the moment, though hopefully, as we get into 2026 and once the current season of Amazon's already-running Fallout series has concluded, we'll hear more about this Fallout Shelter spin-off.</p>



<p>While it'll be some time before we know for sure if this reality competition adaptation is in the works, we do know that Bethesda has already been weaving in references to the TV show Amazon already has running in the mobile game.</p>



<p>Alongside the premiere of season 2, Bethesda introduced a Viva New Vegas Season in Fallout Shelter, which features limited-time vaults separate from your main vaults and features three main characters from the TV show: Lucy, Maximus and The Ghoul.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Fallout-Shelter-Viva-New-Vegas.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It's clear that Bethesda is doing whatever it can to create connections between every game in the Fallout franchise and the hit TV show on Amazon. There's even <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-now-live-adding-the-ghoul-from-the-show/">a new season of Fallout 76 inspired by the show</a>. It doesn't confirm anything, or even lean towards Sneider's claim being correct, but these connections do at least suggest that Bethesda wants to do everything it can to take advantage of the show's success.</p>



<p>A reality competition show, based on one of the more obscure games in the Fallout lineup, is definitely one way of trying to do that.</p>



<p>After all, it'll be years before we even see any hint of Fallout 5, with The Elder Scrolls VI on deck to be Bethesda's next major game. It'll be a lot easier for Bethesda to have a successful return for the series if it can keep it top of mind for players while we all wait for a new mainline game. They can only <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/">re-release Fallout 4 so many times before people stop caring</a>, after all. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-clears-out-cpu-liquid-cooler-at-its-lowest-price-with-pre-installed-argb-fans-and-aura-lighting-2000655544</link>
            <guid>1391701</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you frequently work with resource-intensive, creative tasks that push your CPU to its limits, liquid cooling can help you enjoy optimal performance while also improving the aesthetics of your workstation. Now is a great time to pick one, thanks to Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6583/">Right now, you can pick the Asus Prime LC 360 ARGB all-in-one CPU liquid cooler for just $100 at the retailer, after a sweet $25 discount</a>. That brings the cooler down to its lowest price this year. The offer is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but the deal is selling out fast. We highly recommend snapping it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6583/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ensures Optimal Performance</h2>
<p>This liquid cooler features a specially designed CPU contact area that’s larger than most options in this range. The bigger size allows for quicker, more efficient heat transfer from the CPU to the cooler. It keeps thermal throttling or performance degradation at bay, even when things get intense. Translation? Consistent performance across all your tasks. It’s especially great for creative, heavier workloads where you can’t afford interruptions caused by heat.</p>
<p>Looks are taken just as seriously. The customizable infinity mirror lenses flaunt a reflective surface with a layered design that produces a mesmerizing illusion with ARGB lighting for a more premium, visually appealing look. Installation couldn’t be simpler. Flexibility (plus durability) comes from the 400 mm tubing, which makes cleaner routing in larger cases possible. You can use a single two-header cable to link both the ARGB lighting and the fans together. The integrated fan design keeps things clean and minimal, while still offering exceptional airflow to improve the overall cooling of your system.</p>



<p>Compatibility-wise, the Prime LC 360 ARGB plays nicely with a wide range of Intel and AMD motherboard platforms, so whether you’ve got a mid-range processor or something a bit on the muscular side, it covers it all. It can be added to a variety of builds without requiring a workaround, which is also helpful when you’re upgrading.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6583/">On a regular day, you’d pay around $125 to enjoy these features, but you can do it for just $100 today.</a> This 20% discount is one of the best we’ve seen this year, so it’s best to grab it quickly. That said, there are plenty of other tech deals available at the retailer too, which makes it a great time to stock up on some accessories (keyboard, mouse, stylus pen), as well as grab some high-ticket items like laptops and mini PCs without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6583/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Holiday Season is almost here, and what better gifts to buy for your loved ones than new games? The most difficult people to buy gifts for are hardcore gamers, as the usual stuff just doesn’t cut it for them. You really need to give them games that let them sink their teeth in and present a real challenge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Insider Gaming guide will highlight some of the best game gifts you can purchase for hardcore gamers. The list includes some of the most challenging titles in recent times, which will really test players’ mettle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do check out&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Holiday 2025 hub</a> for the best deals on games, hardware, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring">Elden Ring</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Let’s start with the big one itself, Elden Ring, the game of the year for 2022. FromSoftware has done wonders with this title, blending its unmatched Soulslike formula with a vast, expansive open world. Elden Ring also features Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, which gives you a lot more hours with new locations, bosses, and weapons.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-bloodborne">Bloodborne</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Blooborne is a title for true soulslike players looking to take on one of the biggest challenges yet. However, it is exclusive to PlayStation 4, so players will not be able to play it on other platforms and will be restricted to the resolution and performance of previous-gen consoles when playing it on the PS5. At the same time, the fun a hardcore gamer will have with this title is unmatched.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-cuphead">Cuphead</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cuphead is a classic run-and-gun action game, with a focus on platforming and boss battles. It is inspired by the cartoons of the 1930s. It features visuals and audio created with the same techniques of that era: traditional hand-drawn cel animation, watercolor backgrounds, and original jazz recordings. The game presents a real challenge for even hardcore gamers, and if it becomes too difficult, they can have a friend join them in local co-op.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-sifu">Sifu</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sifu is a third-person brawler that has intricate, kung-fu-based combat mechanics. There’s another innovative mechanic in the title, where the player ages every time they die, learning more in the process, but becoming weaker as well as time goes on. In this quest for revenge, players will have no allies, just countless enemies to battle across various environments, with only a mysterious amulet to save their lives (only for some time).&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-super-meat-boy">Super Meat Boy</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Super Meat Boy is an excellent pick for a holiday gift for gamers, as it features a lot of content that players can enjoy, and it is tough as nails. It features the old-school difficulty of classic NES titles like Mega Man 2, Ghosts’ n Goblins, and Super Mario Bros. 2 (the Japanese one). It also has over 300 levels across more than five chapters, with some struggle-worthy boss fights.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is the most recent game in the list and also an excellent purchase for hardcore gamers. It’s a soulslike metroidvania title where players indulge in lethal acrobatic combat. The game will put forth a real challenge with over 200 ferocious beasts to fight and more than 40 legendary bosses to take down. The game also includes a Steel Soul mode, which offers an even greater challenge.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you know anything about the soulslike genre, then you might have heard of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and if the player hasn’t played this title, then there are few better games for hardcore gamers to take on. It is the game of the year for 2019, where you play as a one-armed wolf and dwell in cut-throat sword-based combat. The game takes place during 1500s Sengoku Japan, and players will have to use deadly prosthetic tools and powerful ninja abilities to blend stealth, vertical traversal, and visceral head-to-head combat.&nbsp;</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Lies of P is one of the newer soulslike games from Neowiz, but it is still a top choice for a gift for hardcore gamers. It also features the ‘Overture’ DLC, which has already won ‘Best Game Expansion’ at the Golden Joystick Awards 2025. The game is a reinterpretation of the classic tale of Pinocchio, where you play as a puppet created by Geppetto in the Belle Epoque era.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-dark-souls-remastered">Dark Souls Remastered</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>This 2018 title lets players experience the genre-defining game that started it all for soulslike titles. It features the 2011 game with upgraded visuals and 60 fps performance, making gameplay feel much smoother. It features a dark, deep universe where each ending becomes a new beginning, and the difficulty of this game is no joke.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-demon-s-souls">Demon’s Souls</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Demon’s Souls is another PlayStation exclusive available only on the PS5, but it is still a solid gift for a hardcore gamer. The 2003 game for the PS3 has been entirely rebuilt from the ground up and masterfully enhanced for the current-gen consoles. This game will not only test the player’s reflexes but also their strategic decision-making.&nbsp;</p>

This discount is especially great if you planned to go big with Sony’s PS5 Pro, the company’s priciest, most powerful console yet.

Some games simply look better or run faster on the Pro than the base-model PS5, while others look better <em>and</em> run faster. That said, it’s worth noting that PS5 Pro lacks a disc drive and is thus limited to digital titles, though you can buy <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Disc-Drive-For-PS5-Digital-Slim-Console%2F5113175921" rel="sponsored">an optional drive</a> for $80 if you want to attach one later.</p><p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has a bigger GPU than any other PS5 model, with twice as much internal storage as the current slim models (2TB versus 1TB). Another notable feature exclusive to the Pro is PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution), which uses AI to upscale graphics in supported games to produce a better-looking image. The difference in performance between the Pro and the base PS5 is easy to notice in several games, although it’s safe to say that there hasn’t yet been a title that makes upgrading to one a no-brainer. But if a lower price is all the encouragement you needed to upgrade, now is a good time to get one.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/684281/sony-playstation-5-ps5-pro-christmas-deal-sale-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[RIP The Art Of The Old Christmas Time Video Game Commercial]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/remembering-christmas-time-video-game-commercials-1840545976</link>
            <guid>1391677</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Christmas is almost here and so this is a time when many of us gather around and do certain things we feel are traditions. Maybe you watch a particular film or bake some sweet cookies. Personally, I like to get in the Christmas spirit by watching old video game commercials from the 70s, 80s, and 90s.</p> <p>These days I don’t really encounter commercials anymore. I mostly watch Hulu, YouTube, and Netflix. (And I pay to remove ads whenever possible.) But there is certain joy and happiness that pops into my head when I go back and watch these ads.</p>

 <p><em>Just a heads up, some of these uploads are low quality. You might need to turn your volume way up and squint a bit. </em></p>  <p>I remember seeing (some of) these ads on TV and getting excited about video games. (The ones from the 80s and before are a bit before my time.) Not even excited about the particular game that was being advertised, just excited to see video games on TV.</p>

  <p>Today it might be hard to remember a time when games weren’t everywhere. But in the 90s and early 2000s games were still a somewhat niche thing. We didn’t all have phones with console-quality games on them or giant eSport competitions getting millions of views on streaming sites. So seeing a commercial for a console or games pop up on my TV was exciting.</p>

  <p>And during the holidays the excitement was even higher. Maybe some of these games would be under my Christmas tree or maybe my friends would get some. Soon I too will get to play that cool looking game!</p>

  <p>Looking back today, a lot of these commercials are cheesy and silly. But then again, most ads, even in 2019, are cheesy and silly. But watching these brings me back to a time when gaming seemed small and scrappy. It also reminds me of the great holidays I spent playing games with my brother or finding that perfect game under the tree.</p>

 <p>What gaming commercials from around the holidays do you remember?</p> <p><em>This story was originally published on Dec 22, 2019. We’re re-upping it today for the holiday.&nbsp;</em></p>
