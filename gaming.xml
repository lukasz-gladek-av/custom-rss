The 256GB model that normally sells for $399.99 is $319.20 through October 6th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. I, for one, thank Valve for dropping this deal now instead of when the servers inevitably hiccup at the start of the game sale.</p><p>For anyone out there deciding between the Steam Deck LCD, the pricier OLED, and perhaps other handhelds, it’s tough to beat the value of this discounted model. The Deck will be four years old in February, but it’s still a contender when it comes to good, reliable performance in PC games, especially considering how power-efficient it is. Another perk: it runs SteamOS, not Windows 11.</p><p>Also, game compatibility across Steam is generally great (more and more developers are building games with the Steam Deck’s specs in mind ahead of launch), and Valve has patched the Steam Deck frequently throughout the years with new features. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review">It didn’t start out great</a>, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">it eventually got there</a>.</p><p>Sure, the $549 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> boasts some nice perks that some will be willing to pay extra for, like a bigger battery, a 90Hz refresh rate OLED, faster Wi-Fi 6E.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-steam-deck-just-went-on-sale-and-is-killing-the-competition-on-price.1304721/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite a trade war and rising inflation, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">three-year-old Steam Deck</a> hasn’t gone up in price yet. In fact, it just got a pretty major discount. The $400 LCD model will be 20 percent off for the 2025 fall Steam sale. That makes it significantly cheaper than just about every other current-gen gaming device on the market right now, including the 8-year-old Nintendo Switch. It also puts some needed pressure on new PC gaming handhelds launching this holiday.</p> <p>The Steam Deck 256GB LCD model will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">$320 starting September 22</a>. That’s essentially what the refurbished model, currently out of stock, usually costs. The 512GB OLED model is still $550 and the 1TB OLED is still $650 (they come with slightly bigger screens, a higher refresh rate, and better battery life). This week-long discount leads into the Steam Autumn Sale which will kick off next week on September 29 and run until October 6.</p> <p>It’s not a bad deal at all for one of the most versatile gaming handhelds around. It might just be Valve clearing out old inventory as it phases out the older LCD models entirely, but it comes as every other platform squeezes players more and more at the checkout line. The Xbox Series X/S just got its second price hike this year, the PS5 all-digital is now $100 more than it was at launch, and even the original Switch recently went from $300 to $330. At this rate, it’s hard not to feel like the $450 Switch 2 might not be far behind.</p> <p>Then there’s the Steam Deck’s competition in the PC gaming handheld race. We still don’t know how much the new <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-price-pc-gaming-handheld-asus-pre-order-2000622751">Xbox Ally Rog</a> will be, even though it’s less than a month away from launch. And the Legion Go 2, which costs <a href="https://kotaku.com/legion-go-2-price-specs-madden-curse-eagles-2000623447">up to $1350 at the high end</a> ($1,479 for the 2TB model), is both incredibly expensive and incredibly hard-to-get. Lenovo took so many pre-orders <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nl3vxj/now_there_cancelling_preorders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it’s already canceling some</a>. That all might be great for “<a href="https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/2045631.html">enthusiast gamers</a>” but it’s not likely to actually help grow the overall market for PC gaming or handhelds. There’s only an estimated <a href="https://substack.com/redirect/d49e77d2-93bb-48ce-b01b-168e092a9257?j=eyJ1IjoiN293Z2UifQ.yUVZMKoNk2BqBF9tq3iEKEd7X3capQ_E9zpEziCzGhc">5 to 7 million Steam Decks</a> out there in the world right now, and it’s by far the best-selling portable not made by Nintendo.</p>

As detailed in a Fatshark <a href="https://www.playdarktide.com/news/bound-by-duty-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog</a>, the bulk of the new content is for Mortis Trials, Darktide's wave-based roguelike mode. There will be a new arena, the Theatre of Rectitude, where players can test their mettle, as well as new Indulgence archetypes that will offer new combat styles for players to experiment with. Additional Memory Echoes added to the mode will expand on NPC backstories to reveal more about the game's cast of characters and the history of the ship that serves as the game's hub, the Mourningstar.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpOvbThhZe0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GpOvbThhZe0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While the Mortis Trial additions make up a large chunk of the update, there's plenty new for players who prefer the game's mission-based gameplay. A new weapon for the Veteran, the Power Falchion, will work similarly to the Zealot's Relic Blade, allowing players to empower the weapon until it overheats. There will also be new Mark variants of the Bolt Pistol and Boltgun, both of which emphasize explosive damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Those new weapons will be put to the test against a new enemy type, the Scab Plasma Gunner. Wielding a powerful Plasma weapon that deals high damage, players will want to focus on these enemies whenever possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Fatshark completely <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-darktide-getting-revamped-class-system-with-skill-trees-and-new-abilities/1100-6517003/" data-ref-id="1100-6517003">revamped Darktide's classes in 2023</a>, adding greatly expanded talent trees and new abilities for each of the game's four (now five with the addition of the DLC Arbites) classes. In Bound by Duty, Fatshark takes another swing at balancing the talent trees. The Veteran, Zealot, and Psyker trees have been reworked to be more open and allow for "more flexibility and player agency," according to Fatshark, while the Ogryn and Arbites talents have also seen a "light touch-up."</p><p dir="ltr">Rounding out the update is the addition of a dodge counter that informs players of how many dodge charges they have remaining, as well as a new event called Smuggled Munitions that will see players taking on squads of the game's new Plasma Gun enemies while in low visibility conditions. For those looking to snag some free cosmetics, Twitch Drops for Darktide will be live from September 23 through October 13.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Warhammer 40K game news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-is-getting-a-new-long-awaited-class-next-year/1100-6534355/" data-ref-id="1100-6534355">Space Marine 2 will receive a long-awaited class next year</a> in a free update.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-warhammer-40000-crux-terminatus-battleforce-box-brings-back-assault-terminators</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-warhammer-40-000-crux-terminatus-battleforce-box-brings-new-assault-terminators.1304682/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new battleforce box has been announced for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>. Games Workshop is putting the spotlight on the enforcers of the Imperium of Man, the Space Marines, in their new <em>Warhammer 40,000 Crux Terminatus Battleforce</em> box, bringing new takes on a certain brutal unit.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/wr9feecy/assault-terminators-are-an-unstoppable-force-and-an-immovable-object-in-one-indomitable-package/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop provided a sneak peek at what the <em>Warhammer 40,000 Crux Terminatus</em> Battleforce box contains. The post opens by discussing the direct power of the Assault Terminators units of the Space Marines. Bolters and Melta guns are great, but sometimes just crushing the enemies of the God Emperor with thunder hammers and shields works just as well.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-crux-terminatus-battleforce-assault-terminator-miniatures.jpg?itok=yWSGmm8e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-crux-terminatus-battleforce-assault-terminator-miniatures.jpg?itok=00Nu4kXI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That straightforward style is on full display in this new battleforce box. Units either sport devastating thunder hammers and a shield, providing them with an additional Wound. Alternatively, other units sport a pair of lightning claws, helping them cut through waves or Orks, Tyranids, or Chaos Daemons.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer 40,000 Crux Terminatus</em> Battleforce box contains custom options for your miniatures. Each squad of five minatures includes six unhelmeted heads, five helmets, five tilting plates, and 15 different accessories. In addition, the box will contain 500 decals representing the Ultramarines, Imperial Fists, Salamanders, White Scars, and Raven Guard chapters, respectively.</p>

<p>The battlebox will contain the following units:</p>

<ul><li>10 Assault Terminators</li>
	<li>5 Regular Terminators</li>
	<li>1 Ancient in Terminator Armor</li>
	<li>1 Chaplain in Terminator Armor</li>
	<li>1 Captain in Terminator Armor</li>
</ul><p>Overall, this Battleforce box appears to be a solid start for anyone's First Company or for veteran Space Marine players who want to get up close and personal against xenos and heretics alike. Given the Drukhari's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-warhammer-40000-drukhari-codex-brings-long-awaited-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">long-awaited codex</a> is on the horizon, this extra firepower may be warranted.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer 40,000 Crux Terminatus Battleforce</em> box will be available for pre-orders soon. Individual new kit releases will arrive shortly afterwards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sometimes, in this line of work, a game’s name will pass over your feeds multiple times before you ever actually see a frame of footage from it. That is what happened to me with </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span>, Papergames’ 2024 dating sim, which apparently has over </span><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/virtual-romance-real-money-why-some-sporeans-spend-up-to-4-figures-to-find-love-in-deepspace"><span>50 million players worldwide</span></a><span>. The otome game has always been a massive success, but with each update, another wave of buckwild clips starts spreading around the internet. Finally, this morning, I had my first run-in with </span><a href="https://x.com/micheogyal21/status/1969965447274717448"><span>a </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>scene</span></a><span> so confounding and horny that I had to look into it further.</span></p> <p><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span> has a surprisingly complex science fiction story in which the main character, a woman named and customized by the player, is a “deepspace hunter” who fights creatures called Wanderers, but she also, unbeknownst to her, has been reincarnated multiple times. In all these previous lives, she has met the game’s five love interests, and unlocking memories from those past iterations is one of the biggest draws of the game because they not only delve into the game’s broader mysteries, but they’re also, well, interactive.</span></p>  <p><span>Just taking a cursory look at some of the romance scenes, it’s easy to see why </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>has taken off the way it has. It’s angsty, sexy (if a bit awkward), and it has the same tendency toward melodrama that you might find in a soap opera or a romance novel. People love to date digital men who fulfill an otherworldly fantasy that real men can’t. It’s why </span><i><span>Twilight </span></i><span>still has the cultural cache it does, despite having been out of the limelight for over a decade. That being said, even as a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-romance-sex-scene-bear-shadowheart-gale-1850771533"><span>well-documented lover of digital men</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-sex-romance-scene-neve-taash-1851696476"><span>romance</span></a><span>, I don’t think I have the patience for some of </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span>’s gacha nonsense, which seems even more convoluted than that in your average gacha game. But even if I’m not playing it, I can still go snooping around YouTube and TikTok to see what all 50 million people who are playing this game are fawning over. Specifically, I needed to find out what the hell was up with this sex scene in which one of the lover boys, Zayne, says, “Feel this and remember what I’m giving you” as he’s on top of the player character.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FEEL THIS POWER OF ANNIHILATION HE SAID, ANNIHILATE MA KITTY [zayne new myth god of annihilation] <a href="https://t.co/ATSKlGpwaY">pic.twitter.com/ATSKlGpwaY</a></p> <p>— 𝒔𝒖𝒛𝒖 (@pinkcrispss) <a href="https://twitter.com/pinkcrispss/status/1969964067986268598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The scene is from a new trailer for the “Edge of Continuum” event that will begin on September 25. Edge of Continuum features new scenes with a “God of Annihilation” version of Zayne, depicting one of the protagonist’s many lives alongside him. And damn, the trailer is enough to get someone hot and bothered.</span></p>  <p><span>I’m surprised at how much story the trailer gives away, but nobody in the comments seems to be that mad about it, considering what they also get to see, which is basically the beginnings of a fantasy-themed softcore porn starring Zayne. Happy for y’all, and I have nothing but respect for those of you who can fight your way through the gacha nonsense to reach these scenes. Hopefully, I’ve done enough research for writing this that the algorithm starts showing me more of this shit so I can enjoy the fruits of your labor.</span></p>

"I've never played a video game, so I feel absolutely nothing," he continued.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think someone said yesterday at one point, 'You should play GTA 5,'" Ogg continued. "I said, 'Why?' They said, 'Because it's so great.' And I said, 'Well one day you should read Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment' and he went completely blank."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Do you know Dostoevsky? [Who] Fyodor Dostoevsky is?" Ogg continued, turning from interviewee to interviewer, as he attempted to discover HarrisonShippp's knowledge of world literature. (Alas, HarrisonShippp did not know who Dostoevsky was.) "So there you go," Ogg continued, pressing the alleged equivalence. "'Why don't you read that? Are you excited about that book coming out?' See? It's the same thing. Books are my thing."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Celebrity in GTA 5 and GTA Online</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While not a gamer himself, Ogg has previously discussed his work on GTA in detail — including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-5-had-trevor-dlc-before-rockstar-scrapped-it-voice-actor-steven-ogg-says">Rockstar's canceled Trevor-centric story DLC</a> that was ditched in favor of more GTA Online content.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-looter-shooter-games-ranked.1304655/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being one of the more recognisable sub-genres in gaming, you may be surprised by just how precious few looter shooters there actually are. Putting together a list of the best of them revealed how rare a truly brilliant one is, presumably a result of how incredibly hard they are to make,  and their unfortunate tendency to go the way of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/anthem">Anthem</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a> – cut short after failing to grab an audience. But what they lack in quantity, they more than make up for in just how many hours you can lose to them, and over the past nearly two decades I’ve spent more time with this genre than I’d care to admit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what qualifies as a looter shooter for the purposes of this list? Well, as the name implies they’ve got to have shooting (either first or third-person) as the primary way you interact with the world, and all those shell casings and/or laser bolts need to reward loot (almost always including randomized drops) that keeps you playing and lures you into a hard-to-resist endgame. Ongoing games like Destiny and more traditional, non-live-service games like Outriders are both eligible, so long as there’s some kind of ongoing endgame or hook to keep you playing. In essence, we’re looking for games that, one way or another, adhere to the original premise of the looter shooter genre: what if we took an ARPG like Diablo and turned it into a shooter?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If, like me, you can’t seem to get enough of shooting monsters in the face to claim glorious gear, here are our top 14 looter shooter recommendations.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">14. Crab Champions</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/crab-champions-1756909970204.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the weirder looter shooters you can play right now is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crab-champions">Crab Champions</a>, a roguelike where you play as a gun-toting crab facing off against fellow crustaceans and mean-looking floating heads, claiming badass loot in the process. The fast-paced, over-the-top combat might not be as technically advanced as its peers, but what it lacks in bells and whistles it more than makes up for in pure dopey charm. Plus, it's missing the usual add-ons and microtransactions you often find in other looter shooters, and thus comes as a complete package with no hidden costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This one is still in active development and currently available through Steam’s early access program, but at just $10 it’s absolutely worth checking out, especially since it’s such an obvious breath of fresh air from the usual looter shooter aesthetic. I’m a sucker for goofy takes on genres I love and you’d be hard-pressed to find a sillier option out there than this one. It’s also developed by a single person, which is pretty impressive given how much fun I’ve managed to squeeze out of this one in the past year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">13. Shadow Warrior 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/shadow-warrior-2-1756910027001.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the more underrated shooters I’ve played is the Shadow Warrior series, specifically the reboot that kicked off in 2013, which continues to experiment and reinvent itself (for better or worse) with each iteration. While the first and third games are linear, story-focused adventures, the second game in the trilogy took a detour into the world of looter shooters, with semi-open-world, procedurally generated areas and an emphasis on randomized loot that puts it squarely in the same category as Borderlands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/shadow-warrior-2">Shadow Warrior 2</a> is very tongue-in-cheek, despite the fact that you spend most of your time tearing demons into pink chunks like something out of Doom, and my friends and I spent over a hundred hours giggling as we grinded for loot and enjoyed the series’ unique brand of lowbrow humor. Gunplay is nothing to write home about and the buildcrafting is definitely on the more simplistic side that makes it feel like less of an RPG than many of its peers, but it’s still quite a good time, and one of my favorite turn-you-brain-off games when I just want to whale on some ugly looking monsters.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">12. Borderlands 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/borderlands-3-1756910090091.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> did a whole lot to improve the Borderlands series’ gunplay and graphics when it launched in 2019, it also exists in a very weird spot in the franchise’s history, where it felt like developer Gearbox had allowed itself to be left in the dust in a genre it itself pioneered. The gunplay was solid, but easily outclassed by games like Destiny, and the loot was awesome, but buildcrafting among its peers had already evolved beyond Borderlands 3’s somewhat shallow options. Throw in some pretty questionable decisions where comedy writing and antagonists are concerned, and you’ve got what I consider to be the weakest entry in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, this is still a Borderlands game and that means even on a bad day it’s damn fun to play. With a really neat interplanetary campaign and an irresponsible number of weapons to hunt, I spent quite a few evenings playing this one. And thanks to that improved gunplay, if you’re looking for the Borderlands game that feels better than most of the others (excepting Borderlands 4), then this is your port of call.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Outriders</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/outriders-1756910151315.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">People Can Fly’s foray into the looter shooter space may not have been the most original iteration, notably taking quite a few queues from the likes of The Division, but it remains one of the more memorable looter shooters on this list. As supernaturally powered warriors, you’ll run around turning raiders into gobs of meat while claiming loads of loot. One thing that sets <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/outriders">Outriders</a> apart from the rest of the pack is just how great its buildcrafting is, especially with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/outriders-worldslayer-review">Worldslayer expansion</a> upping its game pretty significantly. I spent a ton of time optimizing my various characters’ builds for the procedurally generated raid activity, and geeking out over various stat numbers. Looter shooters aren’t always the best at embracing the RPG side of their mechanics, but Outriders really excels in this area – it rules.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also a big fan of the fact that the developers decided not to make Outriders a live-service game, instead supporting it with a single (and pretty awesome) expansion. Don’t get me wrong: I’m quite a big fan of games-as-a-service projects, but not every looter shooter needs to go down that path, and Outriders never made me feel the pressure to play more than I ever wanted to play – I got in, had a great time, and then moved on to the next game. I really appreciated that. For that reason, this is an excellent option to play with your friend group if you’re looking for more good times in the genre, but you don’t want to get wrapped up in hundreds of hours of content that threatens to devour your life.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/borderlands-the-pre-sequel-1756910207457.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, Borderlands’ detour to the moon after the phenomenal Borderlands 2 was mostly an excuse to secure more screentime for everyone’s favorite baddie, Handsome Jack, and keep the franchise warm while we waited for a proper sequel, but it’s also a very solid shooter with a surprising amount of meat on its bones where story is concerned. The unique setting of Pandora’s moon and the low-gravity, oxygen-juggling implications of that choice are certainly controversial, but I for one never stopped loving those glorious buttslams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Really, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-the-pre-sequel">The Pre-Sequel</a>’s biggest sin is that it does almost nothing to evolve the series, instead feeling more like an elaborate expansion of Borderlands 2 with low-gravity environments. But more Borderlands 2 really isn’t such a bad thing, and this one still holds up to this day.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-1756910264733.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A spinoff of the Borderlands series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</a> is the only (sorta, kinda) fantasy game on a list that’s dominated by sci-fi games. Taking place within a D&amp;D-like tabletop RPG called Bunkers &amp; Badasses (which has since become <a href="https://tinytinagames.com/products/bunkers-badasses-science-fantasy-role-playing-game-system-sourcebook" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an actual tabletop RPG</a>,) this deeply inappropriate shooter is basically Borderlands dressed in wizard robes, featuring many of the iconic characters and mechanics for which Gearbox’s looter shooter series is known. It takes a few risks here and there with things like the overworld map that helps your journey feel a bit more like a proper tabletop adventure, but otherwise plays it extremely close to the blueprint established by the mainline series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-review-pc-xbox-playstation">I really enjoyed my time with Tiny Tina’s Wonderland</a>, but it ultimately sits quite a bit below the best entries of the original series just based on how much it borrows, as well as the fact that it fails to live up to the comedy chops of the likes of Borderlands 2 (more on that later). Still, if you’re looking to sink a ton of time into a wonderfully silly shooter that sets itself apart from the rest of the pack with a unique fantasy skin, this one’s very easy to enthusiastically recommend.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Destiny</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/destiny-1756910382690.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Say what you want about the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny">Destiny</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/fireteamchat" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">God knows I have</a>), but it changed the looter shooter genre in too many ways to count. That might irk those who aren’t a fan of live-service games, but the idea that looter shooters were going to be big-budget, ongoing adventures that spanned years was a massive step forward for the genre. With beautiful worlds to explore, one of the best game soundtracks of all time, and first-person action that still eclipses most of its peers this one deserves its kudos, even if it’s no longer receiving new content. It also introduced World of Warcraft-like raids that have since become the gold standard for its peers, inspiring those that followed, like The Division or Outriders, to do the same. On top of all that, it’s got some fantastic PvP modes that I’ve lost thousands of hours to over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yeah, you’ve got to deal with one of the most convoluted, almost nonsensical stories in the world, plus some really questionable grinds that nearly drove me to madness of more than one occasion, but Bungie makes all that worth it with some of the best gunplay looter shooters have ever had.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Borderlands</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/borderlands-1756910461839.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the progenitor for many of the ideas that came after, the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands">Borderlands</a> game deserves its roses for being the first of its kind (or at least the first massively successful one). Now over 15 years old, it definitely has its rough edges where gameplay, environment diversity, and other bells and whistles are concerned, but Gearbox managed to pull off what no one had before: turning a first-person shooter into a Diablo-like ARPG that was actually fun to play. The four vault hunters are iconic (having passed into legend at this point) and are a lot of fun to build into, and their quaint adventure through the deserts of Pandora is one I’ll always remember fondly despite its hilariously bad ending.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And though Borderlands definitely felt like a prototype of better games to come, it also had some surprisingly good comedy writing and DLC support that kept me playing with friends years after its debut. In 2009, when expansions of this kind were rare and the looter shooter genre didn’t exist, Borderlands paved the way for everything that came after.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Tom Clancy's The Division 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/the-division-2-1756910519899.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we’re getting to the real heavy hitters, starting off with one of the greats of the live-service shooter. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2">The Division 2</a> is one of the best experiences to be had in this space. With tons of great loot, some of the toughest raid activities ever devised, awesome buildcrafting, and the absolutely stellar “dark zone” mechanics that add a mini extraction shooter right in the middle of your co-op game, The Division 2 built on just about everything its predecessor did well and then some.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also fills a niche of more realistic looter shooters with its dark, post-apocalyptic world where you’re fighting other humans instead of aliens or monsters. Sometimes this results in odd things, like a guy in a hoodie surviving a dozen shotgun blasts to the head, but if you’re able to put aside just how weird that is, you’re in for a good time. Best of all, both the games in this series have a whole lot of content to dive into, much of which still has an active playerbase to engage with.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Destiny 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/destiny-2-1756910584724.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After its predecessor pioneered the live-service model, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> expanded on those ideas and is fast approaching a decade of content. It hasn’t always been consistent in being a fun game to play, and swings wildly from incredibly compelling expansions to absolute duds that make me want to put my head through a stained glass window. That’s bound to happen when you’re developing a game for this long and putting out thousands upon thousands of hours of content though, and when Destiny 2 pulls it off it’s without question one of the best looter shooters out there by a country mile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s due in no small part to its absolutely fantastic gunplay, which has kept me playing even through the numerous dark times and content droughts. Campaigns like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-review">The Witch Queen</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review">The Final Shape</a> are some of the better stories looter shooters have told, the abilities and buildcrafting options have been built up over the course of years to the point where they feel quite good and have a ton of options to choose from. Best of all, it just has so much dang content that you could play every day for a year straight and still not run out of compelling things to do. It hasn’t always excelled in its loot, is often painfully grindy (including with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-review">its most recent expansion</a>), and is incredibly inconsistent in the quality of its storytelling, but man, you’ve gotta hand it to Bungie for keeping this game relevant for as long as they have. The industry simply wouldn’t be the same without it!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Warframe</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/warframe-1756910633727.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, okay, technically <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> is more of a looter slasher than a shooter, but it would feel downright weird to not include it in this list given its influence on the genre and incredible amount of overlap. Taking on the role of a space ninja that’s absolutely dripping with swagger, Warframe has eaten up a ton of my time over the years with its never-ending grind and good times with friends. It also manages to pull off the free-to-play model quite well (or at least has a fairly consistent record), which makes it a pretty easy sell to your frugal co-op teammates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also impressive just how long this thing has been going on – it actually predates even Destiny –  with the caveat that to this very day Warframe’s developers still claim the game remains in open beta (yes, really). I don’t play Warframe consistently, but every time I’ve logged on in the past decade it’s had mechanics added to it that make it feel like a completely different animal, including space combat, roguelike zones, and even a time-traveling DLC with motorcycle riding and romance mechanics. I dunno, man. This game is just…insanely good.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Borderlands 4</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/borderlands-4-1756910697289.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you haven’t yet heard the news, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is out now and is one of my favorite looter shooters of all time. Even this early into its lifespan, with plenty of bugs, performance issues, and general wonkiness going on, this massive, open-world reimagining of the series represents a massive leap forward from Borderlands 3 that takes some interesting risks that overwhelmingly pay off, like a more grounded story and an entirely new setting in Kairos that steps quite far away from the familiarity and nostalgia of Pandora. It also makes some pretty stellar improvements to gunplay, specifically where mobility is concerned, and gliding and grapple hooking around with friends as you blow things up with the most ridiculous arsenal imaginable has been (and likely will continue to be) one of my favorite experiences in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 might very well go on to be even higher on this list, possibly even taking the top slot once various patches and content drops address some of my nitpicks with it, but even now it’s already stolen my heart and over 60 hours of my time. The future for the Borderlands series is looking quite bright – especially considering there’s already a whole roadmap charting out the next six months of content, which includes a new playable vault hunter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Remnant 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/remnant-2-1756910761610.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Often described as “Dark Souls with guns,” the Remnant series has an incredibly unique take by combining a smattering of soulslike mechanics and roguelike features with looter shooter goodness, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/remnant-ii">Remnant 2</a> absolutely nails combining the ideas of all three. I should caveat this by saying that me categorizing Remnant 2 as a looter shooter will be controversial, primarily because this is the only game on this list that doesn’t have randomized loot or a grind that requires completing the same activities a bunch of times – both hallmarks of what makes the genre what it is. Instead, you take on significantly challenging activities and once you manage to beat them once, you get guaranteed loot that removes any need to replay it again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it takes so many other cues from looter shooters, from gameplay, to buildcrafting, to working together with a co-op team to take down some horrifying boss to get that piece of equipment or weapon you’ve been dying to add to your build, plus has plenty of reasons to keep playing long after you’ve beaten the campaign. The fact that it bucks some of the trends found in most other looter shooters, specifically the need to grind, might actually be one of the reasons this one ranks so highly for me (Remnant 2 was one of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remnant-2-review">my favorite games of 2023</a>, after all). If you haven’t played it yet and you’re a fan of looter shooters, I cannot recommend it enough.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Borderlands 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/03/borderlands-2-1756910828347.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As much as I adore the hot, newness of Borderlands 4, it’s quite hard to contend with the series’ magnum opus: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-2">Borderlands 2</a>. It is still hands down the best looter shooter we’ve got. With an almost unbelievable number of weapons, some of the best comedy writing in gaming history (tip of the hat to good ol’ Handsome Jack), and a story that’s surprisingly emotional right when you expect it to be silly and shallow, I spent more than a thousand hours in Borderlands 2 back when that wasn’t really a thing people ever did with games that didn’t have competitive multiplayer matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously this game is over a decade old and so doesn’t quite hold up in certain areas like gunplay, movement, or buildcrafting, but after replaying it fairly recently I was shocked to see how well it still holds up. And where the original Borderlands game was the one that spawned all the looter shooters to come, Borderlands 2 was arguably even more influential in its impact on the genre, refining the concepts from the original and implementing new ideas that would later be iterated on by its peers, like how its endgame treadmill went on to inspire Destiny, Warframe, Outriders, and others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there you have it! Those are our top 14 looter shooters you can play right now. Which is your favorite? Any good ones we missed?

                <p>This past weekend saw the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s new battle royale mode, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-chaotic-delulu-mode-what-you-need-to-know-about-proximity-chat-battle-royale/1100-6534895/" data-ref-id="1100-6534895">Delulu</a>. A take on Fortnite's familiar formula, the catch here is that you can talk to anyone--whether squaded up or not--thanks to the new proximity chat. While this adds a nice layer of sociality to the game, it's also resulted in an increase in discrimination and harassment, which led to developer Epic Games banning "thousands" of accounts before the weekend closed out.</p><p>Delulu is exactly what you think it would be if you're familiar with both Fortnite and internet slang. Cutesy shorthand for "delusional," this new mode sees you potentially team up with--and likely betray, as there can only be one winner--anyone you see thanks to proximity chat. As you near another player, you can form a sort of temporary group chat to strategize as you play. This seems like it could be a fabulous idea, particularly for players who tend to play solo but still want to coordinate.</p>

			<p>Xbox Game Pass has been a hot topic since its launch in 2017, sometimes for positive reasons, though increasingly for negative or, at the very least, mixed reasons. Through all its trials and tribulations, though, Microsoft and Xbox put itself on the Game Pass path, and have shown no signs of wanting to pivot. In fact, according to ID@Xbox, in 2025, Microsoft and Xbox are putting more behind Game Pass than ever before.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation">Eurogamer</a>, head of Xbox's ID@Xbox program, Chris Charla, spoke about how Xbox is investing more in Game Pass in 2025 than it ever has.</p>



<p>"<em>The majority of partners who've had a game in Game Pass want to bring their future titles to the service,</em>" Charla said. "<em>As a result, we've signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalogue. We continue to engage with hundreds of partners each year to review upcoming titles.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Last year, we worked with over 50 teams to sign their first Game Pass deal. This year marks our largest investment in Game Pass to date, and we remain focused on delivering the most exciting and diverse catalogue in gaming.</em>"</p>



<p>All things considered, it's not surprising to see Microsoft continuing to double down on Xbox Game Pass. Despite numerous comments from <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-unsustainable-harmful-industry-arkane-founder/">multiple</a> former<a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-arent-rewarding-content-makers/"> Xbox Studios developers</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/">analyst reports</a>, and examples we've seen of just <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-spends-50k-50m-to-get-games-onto-xbox-game-pass/">how much Xbox is putting into every game it brings to the service</a>, the latest financial reports from Microsoft show that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/">Xbox revenue is growing</a>. Game Pass brings in $5 billion a year, according to Microsoft.</p>



<p>It may have deeper ramifications for the industry and the games on the service, as has <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/">been pointed out several times</a>, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a time when Microsoft was more concerned with the deeper cultural ramifications of an area of its business than how well that business was performing on its bank sheet.</p>



<p>The future of the Xbox platform has been tied to Xbox Game Pass since 2017, and at least in the near future, it doesn't look like that's going to change.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Embark Studios announced the release date of its third-person extraction shooter game ARC Raiders. The game will be available on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arc-raiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 30. To prepare for the full launch, the studio will conduct a final public test titled 'Server Slam' between Friday, October 17, and Sunday, October 19. The featured map will be Dam Battlegrounds; participants in the event will receive an exclusive Backpack cosmetic reward, unlocked at launch with a full game purchase.</p>



<p>Aleksander Grøndal, Executive Producer at Embark Studios, said:</p>



<p><em>We’re excited to welcome Raiders to the Server Slam — this is where we’ll really put ARC Raiders through its paces ahead of full launch. Our goal is simple: make sure that on October 30, when the servers go live, every player experiences the game exactly as we’ve intended — polished, balanced, and ready for action. Thanks for joining us — let's prepare to go topside.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>ARC Raiders is also available for pre-order now. The Standard Edition is priced $39.99 and comes with the Lucky Duck Bundle pre-order bonus (Backpack: Hatchling, Backpack Charm: Golden Rubber Duck). The Deluxe Edition is priced $59.99 and adds an extra pre-order bonus, the Astro Bundle, which comes with a Legendary Outfit (G-Suit + color variants), a Backpack (Salvager), and a Backpack Attachment (Spaceship Souvenir). It also includes the following exclusive content:</p>



<ul>
<li>Legendary Outfit: Valente Legendary + color variants</li>



<li>Backpack: Pathfinder</li>



<li>Backpack Attachment: Blanket Roll</li>



<li>Face Cosmetic: Lip Scar</li>



<li>Skin: Cowboy Scrappy</li>



<li>Emote: Finger Gun: Rapid Fire</li>



<li>2,400 Raider Tokens</li>
</ul>



<p>ARC Raiders was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2021 as a free-to-play cooperative shooter. It was also meant to be their debut title, but the arena shooter The Finals passed it in that regard. Meanwhile, ARC Raiders was delayed and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repurposed into a PvPvE extraction shooter</a>. It'll face stiff competition in a very saturated genre, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-tech-test-hands-on-promising-extractions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our early test</a> suggests it may just have the right cards to succeed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ready or Not developer VOID Interactive has fired its long-time Community Manager, nicknamed 'Kaminsky', over their comments on Charlie Kirk's murder.</p>



<p>When asked about adding Charlie Kirk to the official Ready or Not Discord channel's filtered words, Kaminsky replied:</p>



<p><em>I just did Charlie. Funny you mention that because me and my roommate are literally just talking about him getting shot. All I have to say is: Nothing of value was lost.</em></p>



<p>Following an outpour of outraged comments at the response, VOID Interactive <a href="https://x.com/VOIDInteractive/status/1969054077737668689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> this message to the community:</p>



<p><em>We are aware of comments made by our community manager about a recent tragic event. These statements do not reflect our values or represent our company. We have ended our relationship with this individual and reminded our team of the responsibility we all share when communicating on public platforms. Our focus remains on fostering a respectful and professional community around Ready or Not.</em></p>



<p>This isn't the first controversy VOID Interactive has faced. In 2021, the studio announced a partnership with Team17 to publish the game, but the deal was called off only a few months later. Speculation ran rampant that it was due to a school shooting level that the developers had teased via Reddit, but VOID Interactive always denied that there was any kind of link.</p>



<p>On June 16, 2022, Ready or Not was suddenly delisted from Steam due to a takedown request for trademark infringement related to a nightclub level. This was likely due to the in-game name of the nightclub, Pryzm, being the same as an actual chain of nightclubs in the United Kingdom. The game returned to Valve's store two days later.</p>



<p>More recently, the first-person tactical shooter game Ready or Not was featured in the news for its successful console launch. In less than eight weeks, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpassed-3-million-units-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> over three million units on consoles. Between PC and consoles, the total amount of copies sold is thirteen million units.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Established wisdom used to be that buying a game console at launch was a bad idea. It was the worst-possible version of the experience: launch consoles cost more and had fewer games, and often these consoles got not only cheaper but better over time, through revisions that made them smaller or added features. For the current generation, though, those who bought at launch look like geniuses — video game consoles just keep getting more expensive. And it couldn’t come at a worse time for the industry.</p><div><p>The most recent example comes from Microsoft, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">which just raised the price of its current Xbox lineup</a> so that the more expensive model now costs $150 more than it did at launch. Last week’s price bumps saw the Xbox Series X reach $649.99, while its smaller sibling is now $399.99. Part of what makes these hikes sting so much is that they aren’t the first; both Xbox consoles had their prices increased <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659430/microsoft-xbox-console-controller-game-price-increases-worldwide">this May</a>, and in 2023 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768400/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-increase">the Series X got a bump in many countries outside the US</a>. To put that in perspective, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428714/xbox-series-x-price-release-date-preorder-all-access">when it launched in 2020, the Series X cost $499</a>. That now seems like a steal.</p></div><div><p>Microsoft isn’t the only one, of course. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">Sony jacked up the price of all PS5 models by $50 in August</a>, and in the same month <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">Nintendo raised the price of the original Switch</a> — yes, the one that came out in 2017 — by $40. Accessories have also gotten more expensive, and we’re now in a time of $80 games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p></div><p>The main reason for these increases isn’t a secret, even if companies like to obfuscate it behind phrases like “changes in the macroeconomic environment” or “market conditions.” The reason is tariffs, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/607947/donald-trump-tariffs-china-mexico-canada-explainer">which are of course impacting basically everything</a>, not just video games. But video game consoles feel particularly sensitive to these increases.</p><p>For one, it goes against the natural order as we’ve come to expect it. Historically consoles steadily get less expensive over time. In 2016 both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12748176/sony-ps4-slim-announced-price-specs-release-date">Sony</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348212/microsoft-xbox-one-s-review">Microsoft</a> released smaller and cheaper versions of their consoles, and a few years later Nintendo did something similar with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date">the handheld-only Switch Lite</a>.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Even before tariffs began wreaking havoc, this cycle was in jeopardy, likely due to a combination of increased competition and steadily rising development costs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">When Sony introduced a slimmer PS5 in 2023</a>, it wasn’t a new inexpensive model; it simply replaced the launch model and sold at the same price. This means that the calculus has changed, and the best time to buy a new game console now seems to be “as soon as you can,” because these things are no longer getting cheaper.</p><p>That sucks for everyone who missed out on those launch-day prices. The bigger issue, though, is that this is a very bad time for consoles to become even more inaccessible than they already are. The entire game console paradigm has been shifting for years, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/column/781303/microsoft-sony-playstation-xbox-future-of-gaming-console">the supposed “console wars” waning</a>: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661814/xbox-best-selling-games-ps5-oblivion-minecraft">Xbox games are bestsellers on PlayStation</a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770311/playstation-game-helldivers-2-best-selling-game-on-xbox">and vice versa</a>), everyone is releasing former exclusives on PC, and subscriptions like Game Pass are further muddying the waters.</p><p>There’s less and less of a reason to buy one box over the other, and options like the Steam Deck mean that maybe you choose neither. Add to this an entire generation of players raised on multiplatform experiences like <em>Minecraft</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, and Roblox, and the idea of buying $80 games for your $700 console feels increasingly antiquated.</p><p>I’m not saying that consoles are dead, or that tariffs are the final nail in the proverbial coffin. But these price hikes are likely to speed up a process that was already in motion, where traditional consoles are increasingly becoming a niche, luxury good and not the dominant way to play video games. It’s going to be harder than ever for these platforms to increase their scale without the injection of fresh players that comes with a mid-cycle refresh and price cut.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/782532/game-console-price-hikes-xbox-ps5-switch#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/782532/game-console-price-hikes-xbox-ps5-switch]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Techland's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dying-light-the-beast">Dying Light: The Beast</a> launched last week and is, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dying-light-the-beast-review">sources say</a>, "a good Dying Light game, and a fine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open-world</a> zombie game in general, full of crunchy combat and simple but satisfying number-go-up loops". Being a new videogame, it also has some bugs. The most dramatic of these appear to be problems with its day/night cycle and weather system. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
On the one hand, you've got rain falling inside buildings. I quite like this one, myself. I grew up with 3D first-person games that had slightly magic precipitation. I used to enjoy wobbling back and forth in entrances, trying to coax the weather into following me in-doors. I actually feel slightly dissatisfied when I play one of those fancy modern shooters in which water bounces off corrugated metal roofing as it should.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Techland say they've identified some problems with the day-night cycle, inasmuch as it sometimes stops cycling. This seems more urgent, because Dying Light: The Beast is a very different game in the dark. You'll have to worry about Volatile zombos who are both resilient and inconveniently athletic, capable of chasing you all over the scenery while making frightful gargling noises in your ear. A few Redditors <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dyinglight/comments/1nmpd80/hotfix_121_update_indoor_rain_daynight_cycle/">report</a> encountering Volatiles in blazing sunlight. Others say they can't seem to progress their worlds beyond mid-morning, which doesn't seem quite as harrowing.
</p>
<p>
Techland are working on a PC hotfix for these things, but say they need to take their time testing the patch, because these particular issues aren't that frequent and they don't want to screw up anything else. "We already have a fix prepared, but because this bug only appears in rare situations, it takes a lot of extra testing," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3008130/view/543368994111883033?l=english">a post on Steam from yesterday</a>. "We'll continue these tests over the weekend and most of Monday, and if no new occurrences of this issue appear, we'll release the hotfix to players right away on PC. This is our goal.
</p><p>
"If, however, we still spot any occurrences of the bug, we might need to go back, adjust the fix, and then re-test it again," the developers caution. "Thank you for your patience. We know these issues are frustrating to those who experience them, and we're doing everything we can to deliver a stable solution as soon as possible."
</p>
<p>
As is tradition, Techland's promises have met with an avalanche of comments telling them that they're prioritising the wrong fixes. Some people are mad about the frame rate, others complain about getting stuck in falling animations and quests not progressing. It doesn't seem like there are any catastrophic problems with the current PC build, but I'm keen to hear your thoughts, as ever. As for myself, I've played about three hours of Dying Light: The Beast, including 30 minutes of preview time, and I think that's probably enough for me. I like scampering over roofs but I just can't be arsed re-killing zombies any more.
</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-months-without-a-discount-asus%E2%80%99s-15-6%E2%80%9D-portable-monitor-drops-again-ahead-of-prime-big-deal-days.1304574/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Having a work-from-home job doesn’t necessarily mean you need to always be working&nbsp;<em>from home</em>. You feasibly have the power to work from anywhere in the world so long has you have stable Wi-Fi. The thing that used to get in the way of me getting out more often with my laptop is that I don’t like working off just my laptop screen. At my desk, I have spoiled myself with three large monitors and can see everything I’m working on at once. On my laptop, I’m caught flipping through endless tabs and apps, losing track of what I’m looking at constantly. But now, I have gotten myself a portable monitor. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4222/">You can too as this one from ASUS just dropped on Amazon from $209 to just $169. That 19% discount will save you a solid $40.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4222/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Get Out More</h2>
<p>For the worker that wants to get out and about more, ASUS’ portable monitor is perfect at it’s 15.6-inch display size. If you decide to head over to your local coffee shop or maybe get some work done in your hotel room while traveling, you can simulate your desktop experience, being able to view more of what you want to have access to at once. You can have the spreadsheet your building out on one display while you have your email or Slack opened up on the second as not to miss any pings coming your way. Or instead you can mute any incoming notifications and use your second monitor to watch the latest episode of&nbsp;<em>Peacemaker</em> while putting slides together for your next presentation on the first one.</p>
<p>The ASUS monitor has a built-in kickstand, making it easy to prop up. It can be setup in either landscape or portrait mode. I’m a big champion of the vertical display. Having your email or slack set up vertically just makes more sense than landscape. You can see more of your messages at once and be able to read more of those longwinded emails before you need to scroll down again.</p>



<p>The monitor supports a hybrid-signal, meaning the USB-C allows for the transmission of both video and power. This is wonderful because it means you’ll have less cables running across your workspace. It just needs the one USB-C cable connected from your laptop and that’s enough to turn on the portable ASUS monitor and send the video feed to it.</p>

              <p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> was one of 2022’s break-out indie successes, a crudely animated 2D auto-shooter in which you moved your&nbsp;<em>Castlevania-</em>inspired character around screens filled with kerbillions of enemies, gaining new automatically triggered attacks and defenses by picking up the diamond-shaped gems dropped by fallen enemies. The more you played, the more characters you unlocked and the more skills would became available as you leveled up. Now meet <em>Megabonk</em>, a 2025 indie success, a crudely animated 3D auto-shooter in which you move your character around screens filled with kerbillions of enemies, gaining new automatically triggered attacks and defenses by picking up the diamond-shaped gems dropped by fallen enemies. The more you play, the more characters you unlock and the more skills become available as you level up.</p> <p>The absolutely blatant way in which <em>Megabonk</em> takes inspiration from <em>Vampire Survivors </em>doesn’t seem to be doing it any harm. Then again, the most played games in the world <a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824">are <em>Roblox-</em>made knock-offs</a>, so no big surprises there. Oh, and quite importantly,&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em> is a ton of fun to play. I mean, a 3D&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em> sounds like it would be, right? Also, to be scrupulously fair, this game from first-time developer vedinad does have some of its own original ideas…if you look hard enough.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000627600" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627600"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627600">© vedinad</figcaption></figure> <p>In <em>Megabonk</em>, you move your chosen character (at the start you can choose between a nimble fox with a starting fireball and a clunky armored knight with a swingy sword) around the PS2-like 3D space, with enemies pinging into existence all around you. Much like in <em>VS</em>, you then learn how to move around in a way that’s appropriate for your attacks while trying to shepherd the crowd of enemies chasing you such that you can loop around and pick up the gems dropped by those you’ve killed. Gather enough of these and you’ll level up, and be able to pick from three randomly selected upgrades; a mix of new attacks, improvements for current ones, and various “tomes” that improve your defensive skills.</p>

 <p>Scattered around the land are vases to break for extra coins and gems, treasure chests that can be opened by spending coins and which then grant you a randomly selected bonus item), and stone pillars that, when stood near for long enough, will improve something like health regen, knockback efficacy, spawning times for elite enemies, that sort of thing. It’s about trying to maintain your health bar for as long as you can, before losing everything and returning to the main screen. Here, if you’ve managed to gather enough silver coins or reached certain milestones (killed 1,000 skeletons, say), you can unlock new characters, weapons and tomes.</p>

 <p>Which, yes, pretty much entirely describes&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>. But here you can jump! And glide!</p> <p>For all I mock, I’m having a good time with it. It’s difficult enough from the start that it makes you want to keep finding those incremental improvements—that’s a mistake a lot of <em>Vampire Survivors</em> clones make (and let’s not forget, there have been&nbsp;<em>so many</em> of them over the last three years), where things are too easy near the start, so you get too far into your early runs before difficulty ramps up, making it feel laborious to go through it over and over. But here, as in&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>, I’m finding there’s a sense of strategy in seeking the things that let me improve each run.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627602" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627602"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627602">© vedinad</figcaption></figure> <p>In fact, if anything it’s just how, er, “faithfully”&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em> sticks to the&nbsp;<em>VS</em> formula that is the secret of its success. So many knock-offs sensibly attempt to add their own twists, but too many of those break the formula. It’s perhaps not exactly high praise to point out how <em>Megabonk</em>‘s lack of originality helps it succeed, but it remains true.</p>

 <p>Despite costing twice as much as&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em> (which is still an extraordinary $5),&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em> is proving that success in player numbers. While it’s not exactly troubling the tops of the charts, 20,000 concurrent players for a first-time dev’s crude-looking indie game is no small feat, and it only released at the end of last week. The game’s already hitting that number today, and the U.S. has barely woken up, so it seems this game is still growing. It’s also boosted by glowing Steam reviews, with the game bathing in 91 percent positive ratings, affording it the highly coveted “Overwhelmingly Positive” label. It’s that combination of a winning formula (albeit somebody else’s) and a massive amount of luck that lets Steam games occasionally see this sort of buzz. And what a treat for the developer, whomever they may be—according to their BlueSky, the game had sold over 100,000 copies by the end of the weekend.</p>   <p>That’s life-changing money, and you love to see it.</p> <p>And yes, of course there have been other 3D <em>VS</em> reimaginings, not least last year’s FPS incarnation <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2206270/Vampire_Hunters/"><em>Vampire Hunters</em></a>, but it’s so interesting when something catches the zeitgeist in this way. It’s even more satisfying when the resulting game is a bunch of fun to play, too. Even if poncle might feel like he’s owed a couple of bucks as a result.</p>
