A sudden dismemberment murder of the leader of a religious nation that advocates an apocalyptic ideology… Five <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,386 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure games</a> are combined into one, centered around a suspenseful story full of mystery and intrigue.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>“168 remaining until the end of the world…”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Humanity is approaching its end.</p><p>In a world steeped in despair and chaos, a strange religious organization called Shuten Order emerges, yearning for the end of humanity. The group rapidly gains followers, eventually forming a small nation state called Shuten.</p><p>Tragedy strikes during the grand festival celebrating their nation’s founding—the leader of the Shuten Order is murdered. Soon after, the protagonist awakens with no memory, greeted by two self-proclaimed “angels”. They reveal a shocking truth: the protagonist is the murdered Founder, revived by divine power. However, the resurrection is incomplete—their memories are gone, and their life limited to a mere four days.</p><p>To survive, the protagonist must overcome “God’s trial”: identify and kill their murderer.</p><p>With the clock ticking, the protagonist, given the alias Rei, dives into the tumultuous city as a detective. The suspects? Five ministers of the Shuten Order. There’s no time to investigate them all. Choices must be made, and the pursuit of truth demands sacrifice.</p><p>Who killed the Founder?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot on the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">the layoffs that have swept through Xbox</a>, the founder of Microsoft-owned Arkane Studios has hit out at Game Pass, whose subscription model he called “unsustainable.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raphael Colantonio, who founded the Dishonored and Prey developer and served as its president before leaving in 2017 to start <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/weird-west">Weird West</a> maker WolfEye Studios, <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941503596870369388" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media to ask</a>: “Why is no-one talking about the elephant in the room? Cough cough (Gamepass).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked to expand on his thoughts on Game Pass, which Weird West launched straight into as a day one title in March 2022, Colantonio said: “I think Gamepass is an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by MS’s ‘infinite money,’ but at some point reality has to hit. I don’t think GP can co-exist with other models, they’ll either kill everyone else, or give up.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Colantonio’s comment sparked a vociferous debate about the pros and cons of Game Pass in industry terms as well as for the customer. Microsoft's subscription service has been called many things over the years: the death of the video game industry; the savior of smaller developers who benefit greatly from payments made by Microsoft to secure their games; and everything in between. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-boss-jim-ryan-many-publishers-believe-xbox-game-pass-is-value-destructive">During the great Xbox FTC trial to decide the fate of Microsoft's $69 billion aquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard</a>, then PlayStation boss Jim Ryan claimed that he had talked to "all the publishers" and that, unanimously, they all hated Game Pass "because it is value destructive." He also said Microsoft "appears to be losing a lot of money on it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in 2021, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-sustainable-phil-spencer">Xbox boss Phil Spencer countered Game Pass doomsayers</a>, saying: "I know there's a lot of people that like to write [that] we're burning cash right now for some future pot of gold at the end. No. Game Pass is very, very sustainable right now as it sits. And it continues to grow."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was four years ago. What about now, in the wake of cuts that have seen Rare's Everwild, the Perfect Dark reboot, and an unannounced MMO in the works at developer behind The Elder Scrolls Online all canceled?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colantonio’s comments were backed by a number of industry peers, including <a href="https://x.com/joekreiner/status/1941661474356687099" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the former VP of biz dev at Epic Games</a>. Michael Douse, publishing director at Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian, <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1941515662037483920" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that the biggest concern right now revolves around what happens when all that money runs out. This, Douse added, is “one of the main economic reasons people I know haven't shifted to its business model. The infinite money thing never made any sense.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(It’s worth noting that Baldur’s Gate 3 has so far not launched in Game Pass or PlayStation Plus.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colantonio then ridiculed Microsoft’s insistence that launching games into Game Pass did not impact sales, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-admits-game-pass-cannibalizes-sales">only to later admit the contrary</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1941517481463701744" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a> to to say he prefers the Sony way of doing things. Sony’s PlayStation Plus policy is to keep first-party games off the subscription service at launch, only adding them some time later. That’s why you won’t see this year’s Sony’s Ghost of Yotei launch straight into PS Plus, but you will see Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 as a day one Game Pass launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The economics never made sense, but at the same time I do recognize that for smaller teams with new or riskier IPs it helped derisk,” Douse said. “Much prefer Sony's 'lifecycle management' strategy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah, the only way GP can co-exist without hurting everyone is for the back catalogue," Colantonio concluded.</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/behind-microsofts-layoffs-a-new-attitude-shaped-by-ai/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reports have indicated that Microsoft’s layoffs were more about the company’s high-profile push into AI</a> than any failing with the gaming business, but Colantonio <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1941518787037319382" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested</a> this was “a bs excuse.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He then went on to insist that “the maths don’t work for most publishers/devs nor for Xbox once they stop investing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colantonio was also asked why Microsoft would continue to push Game Pass if it were unsustainable, even now, eight years after it launched. He responded to say that Game Pass isn’t profitable, Microsoft is still in the "customer acquisition phase", and the company hopes that one day, subscription revenue will make its significant investment pay off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colantonio explained that Game Pass on its own cannot be considered profitable because you need to factor in the billions of dollars Microsoft has spent acquiring content for the subscription service, and he includes Bethesda owner ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard in that equation. “It’s a spreadsheet trick where they don’t put that detail in a profit and loss section, but instead in the amortization over time,” he claimed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game Pass is of course an incredible deal for the gamer that lets subscribers dip in and out of a long list of games for a fraction of the cost of buying those games standalone. Game Pass is often said to be too good to be true because of how cheap it is relative to what it offers. When you throw in every game Microsoft has on its books as a day one Game Pass launch (Call of Duty included), the deal feels even better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Colantonio, though, the Game Pass deal is “too good.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What *might* happen once MS has won: the games will start to suck and your sub will go up,” he added. “Why? Because the current amazing deal you have is subsided by MS bleeding money into it with the hope they’ll kill the competition, but once they manage to do it, things will get real.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: “... it’s a long game that involves throwing a tsunami at the entire ecosystem of the industry. Only the gamers like it because the offer is too good to be true, but eventually even gamers will hate it when they realize the effects on the games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft does not report on the success of Game Pass either way in financial terms. Indeed, its reporting on its gaming business is vague at best. In its last financial report (for the quarter ending March 31, 2025), Microsoft said Xbox content and services grew 8% year-over-year, which was in part due to growth in Xbox Game Pass. PC Game Pass revenue increased 45% year-over-year. But we don’t have an updated figure for how many subscribers Game Pass has, nor how much money it brings in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an April interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-phil-spencer-minecraft-movie-fallout-season-2-1236352653/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Microsoft gaming boss Phil Spencer was asked how he views Game Pass’s ongoing role in the larger Xbox business. Spencer replied to say he thinks about Game Pass as “a healthy option for certain people,” but admitted “it’s not for everybody.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our biggest areas of growth right now are PC and Cloud, which makes sense, since consoles, all up, are a good business, they’re an established business, but they’re not really a growing segment in gaming," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So we’ve got good growth on PC, we’ve got growth on Cloud, in terms of users and hours. And console continues to be a really healthy part of Game Pass. But there isn’t a unique need for Game Pass to be the only way for people to play. If everybody who’s a Game Pass subscriber instead decided to buy their games, that’s good for the business as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For me, I look at Game Pass as a healthy option for certain people. It’s not for everybody. If you play one or two games a year, Game Pass probably isn’t the right business model for you, you should just buy those two games, and that would make total sense. But I want you to have the choice. So we remain focused on everything that’s on Game Pass is also available to buy. We’re making those games available to buy in more places.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I look at the overall hours of people who are playing on Xbox, playing our games, and that’s a number that continues to grow fairly substantially, and that’s really the metric I think about for success. And Game Pass has been an important part of that, but I don’t try to solve for Game Pass specifically on its own. It’s kind of part of the equation for Xbox finding new players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<figure><a title="eShop Selects June 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3be05fd374dba/eshop-selects-june-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well well well — one month with the Switch 2, and we're <em>still</em> swimming in eShop games. Yep, it's time for eShop Selects for June 2025!</p>
<p>Who needs <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> when you've got backwards compatibility, eh? Just because we have a new console, doesn't mean we're <em>just</em> looking at Switch 2 games. And going forward, eShop Selects will be looking at eShop games on both consoles.</p>
<p>So, let's run down the rules quickly; Game Key-Card and Code In Box releases won't be included here, only eShop exclusives (at least in the West). Where a digital-only game has a Switch 1 and Switch 2 version, we'll be focusing on the Switch 2 version. And we know some of these are and might get a limited physical down the line, but for now, they're digital only, so they do count.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yuwhrk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Okay. Other than that, things are basically the same — we ask our writers and contributors to pick their top three eShop games from June 2025 from what we reviewed, and the games with the highest total scores will make our top three. It's a strong month this time around, too.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:184784,184489 @ 1751866598 -->
<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>Eleven games made the cut this time around, with the new console ushering in some new exclusives and upgraded titles. But most of these <em>are</em> Switch 1 games, of course. Hooray for being able to play old games on the new system!</p>
<p>A busy month, unsurprisingly, then! Note that No Man's Sky isn't here because it has a Switch 1 physical. Otherwise, here's what didn't quite make our top three, and as always, there's a ton of variety here.</p>

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">3rd Place - Deltarune</a></h2>
<p>Even though we've got at least three chapters left, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> still absolutely rules.</p>
<p>All three of our podium finishers are Switch 2 launch titles, and Deltarune — along with the new chapters 3 and 4 — was maybe the most surprising. Deltarune may have started way back in 2018, but the two new chapters may well be the best of the bunch.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 is this writer's favourite, balancing brand new gameplay styles with hilarious characters and a shocking end. Chapter 5 comes in 2026, and we can't wait. We gave the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">first four chapters an 8/10</a>.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">2nd Place - Fast Fusion</a></h2>
<p>Shin’en has done it again; Fast Fusion is a stand-out launch title, even alongside the beautiful Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>If you need a game to demonstrate the Switch 2's graphical capabilities (that isn't Cyberpunk), then Fast Fusion is it. It looks <em>stunning</em> both docked and handheld, and is the current hardcore racers' choice on the new console. Plus, you can play it with a friend on Switch 1 with GameShare.</p>
<p>While it's largely a refinement of what came before, with a few new mechanics sprinkled in, Fast Fusion is a must-buy for the Switch 2, and one of the cheapest games to pick up right now, too. We scored this one a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">well-deserved 9/10</a>.</p>

<p>Just weeks after launch on Switch 1, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> got a Switch 2 Edition, and — lo and behold — it's outstanding. Because we were still working on our review in May's eShop Selects, and the Switch 2 version was looming, we decided to hold the game back for June's edition. And, well, we may as well invent a new life for the game — Champion.</p>
<p>Level-5 has cemented its return with a huge time sink that's incredibly difficult to put down, once it has its hooks in you. While it may not have the narrative depth of the 3DS game, there is <em>so</em> much to do, and it never gets boring. You can decorate an entire island, journey through a huge open world, spend hours fishing and crafting, or attempt to level every single Life. It's a staggering achievement, and there's still more to come, including DLC.</p>
<p>We scored Fantasy Life i <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">a 9/10</a>, and it's our eShop Selects June 2025 winner!</p>

<p>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-june-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/roundup/dying-light-the-beast-everything-we-know-about-techlands-new-chapter-in-the-zombie-series/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-%E2%80%93-everything-we-know-about-techland%E2%80%99s-new-chapter-in-the-zombie-series.1236783/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
<p>There are less than two months between the publication of this article and the release of Dying Light: The Beast. This game started as the second DLC for Dying Light 2: Stay Human. However, it slowly evolved into a standalone game that Polish developer Techland is now referring to as essentially Dying Light 3 in all but name.</p>



<p>Why did the studio change its mind about this project being a DLC for DL2? Well, Franchise Director Tymon Smektala <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed in an interview with Wccftech</a> that Techland suffered a narrative leak in 2023, with hackers getting their hands on the DLC's plot. That and a desire to bring back the original game's protagonist spurred the team toward an entirely new direction. Interestingly, in another, more recent interview with Wccftech, Smektala <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-wants-to-switch-to-a-3-4-year-cycle-starting-with-dying-light-the-beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed</a> the desire to make games more quickly, starting with this one, which only took about three and a half years compared to the seven years or so that were necessary for the first two games.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast will be released on Friday, August 22, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game will be released later in 2025 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, too, as Techland hasn't abandoned the old console generation yet. In the aforementioned interview, Tymon Smektala also <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-would-love-to-bring-dying-light-the-beast-to-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he'd love to see the game on Nintendo Switch 2, too, but there's no confirmation yet.</p>



<p>The game is already available for pre-order in two different editions. The Standard Edition is priced at $59.99, while the Deluxe Edition costs $10 more and includes the following benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li>Official Soundtrack</li>



<li>Wallpaper Pack</li>



<li>Castor Woods Tourist Map</li>



<li>Castor Woods Prepper Bundle</li>



<li>Castor Woods Prepper Outfit</li>



<li>Survivalist SMG</li>



<li>Roadhog</li>
</ul>



<p>Any pre-order will also receive the following: </p>



<ul>
<li>Ultimate Survivor Outfit</li>



<li>Harran Combat Knife (+ Upgradable Blueprint)</li>



<li>The Follower Crossbow (+ Upgradable Blueprint)</li>



<li>In Jade’s Memory Pistol (+ Upgradable Blueprint)</li>



<li>Castor Woods Patrol</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, anyone who purchased Dying Light 2: Stay Human Ultimate Edition at launch will receive Dying Light: The Beast for free, owing to the fact that the game was originally planned as the second story-driven DLC for Stay Human.</p>




<figure></figure>




<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Just like its predecessors, Dying Light: The Beast is an open world action survival horror game played exclusively in first-person view. The setting is Castor Woods, a rural region that was once popular among tourists before the zombie apocalypse. Techland has confirmed to Wccftech that Castor Woods is definitely geographically closer to Villador (the setting of Dying Light 2) than Harran (that of the first installment), with both taking inspiration from European countries. However, the returning protagonist is Kyle Crane, once again voiced by Roger Craig Smith. </p>



<p>After the events of the first game and its expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-following-review-zombies-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Following</a>, Crane was taken prisoner and has been for thirteen years the unwilling subject of experimentation with the zombie virus at the behest of Marius 'The Baron' Fischer. After finally escaping captivity, Crane's main goal is to get revenge on The Baron. To that end, Techland said they took inspiration from the South Korean movie Oldboy, where the main character similarly escapes from long captivity and then sets out on his vengeance mission. Chronologically, the events of Dying Light: The Beast take place right after Dying Light 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>In many ways, the developers are seeking a return to the first game's more hardcore survival feel, which most fans prefer to Dying Light 2. One example is save zones, which take after the basic design of the original title with some additional features such as barricading. </p>



<p>In combat, players will be able to take advantage of Crane's new beast-like powers. The franchise always put a strong emphasis on melee combat, and with his enhanced strength, the protagonist can crush skulls, rip heads off, and tear enemies in half. However, firearms are in the game from the start, unlike with Dying Light 2, where they were <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-roadmap-shows-the-game-is-getting-firearms-weapon-repairs-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added with a patch</a> after launch. Similarly, parkour will still be a big part of the game, although the more rural setting of Castor Woods will make jumping from building to building less common. On the other hand, vehicles (specifically, a 4x4) return from Dying Light: The Following, allowing players to feel the joy of crushing zombie hordes under their wheels.</p>



<p>In keeping with series tradition, players will find it easier to explore Castor Woods during the day, while the most dangerous breeds of infected come out at night, where everything is much harder. Co-operative gameplay for up to four players is also available in this new installment, and shared progression has been confirmed so that player groups can experience the whole adventure together.</p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast is powered by the latest iteration of Techland's proprietary C-Engine. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-impressions-and-qa-from-sgf-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to the studio</a>, improvements have been made in rendering weather effects, materials, lighting, shadows, and more. PC system requirements haven't been shared yet, so we will update this article once they are made public. However, the fact that the game will eventually be available on old-gen consoles makes it likely that the specs won't be too demanding.</p>

<p>Launching the same month as CrossWorlds</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Sega is promoting its upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> in all sorts of ways, and apart from the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/wait-busted-member-is-the-singer-of-sonic-racing-crossworlds-opening">opening theme reveal earlier this week</a>, it's also recently teased a new animation.</p>
<p>This new animation celebrating Sonic's latest racing game is scheduled to arrive this September (the same month as the game), and this initial preview was originally featured at Anime Expo. It shows Sonic and Shadow speeding along, but we don't get much else.</p>
<p>Sega released a two-part animated series for the previous game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/team_sonic_racing">Team Sonic Racing</a>. And more recently it released its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/sonic-x-shadow-generations-dark-beginnings-episode-3-is-out-now">Dark Beginnings animation</a> to promote <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> (which is now also available on the Switch 2).</p>

<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will launch for the Switch on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>, with the Switch 2 version of this new game to arrive at a "later date", with a paid upgrade path also planned.</p>

		<p>The game publisher lobby group Video Games Europe has issued a statement in response to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stop-killing-games">Stop Killing Games</a> <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">passing the 1 million signature point on the European Citizens’ Initiative</a>. Would you be surprised to hear that they are less than enthusiastic about the notion that they might have to provide a minimum level of functionality for games to be played offline?</p>
<p>Stop Killing Games is a community movement that will petition lawmakers to implement some kind of rules to prevent publishers from killing games through the removal of online services. In the interests of game preservation, SKG hopes that publishers can be forced to provide end-of-life plans for games with online components so that they remain playable in some state. This does not demand that all functionality remains, but rather that a core experience is still available to purchased games.</p>


<p>The lobbying group has board members from Warner Bros. Games, Epic Games, Electronic Arts, Activision, Embracer, Microsoft, Nintendo of Europe, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Take 2, Ubisoft, Bandai Namco Entertainment, Square Enix, Level Infinite, as well as for regional industry groups UKIE, VGFC, SELL and game. As you would expect, pretty much all of these companies have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.</p>
<p>In their statement, they say:</p>
<p><em>“We appreciate the passion of our community; however, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable. We understand that it can be disappointing for players but, when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws.</em></p>

<p><em>“Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players as the protections we put in place to secure players’ data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable. In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create.”</em></p>
<p>Angling their argument around player safety has a high level of success, with the European Commission taking user privacy and platform security very seriously. This is something that the EC would have to account for, should they proceed to legislate new end-of-life provisions for video games, ensuring that publishers would not be considered a platform holder responsible for moderation and security once a game’s service has been deactivated.</p>
<p>At the same time, arguing in the full statement that publishers are the only ones able to ensure that online games are safe and that hackers aren’t able to run rampant is a nonsense. You just have to look at the state of online multiplayer in older Call of Duty games to see the such support is relatively minimal – heck, they just released Call of Duty WW2 into Game Pass and then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-ww2-rce-exploits-on-pc/">pulled the game from PC Game Pass once it was found that it enables a RCE hack exploit</a>.</p>
<p>What can be agreed is that this should not be treated as a trivial matter, but it’s also far from an impossible hurdle for developers to overcome.&nbsp;Following the public backlash to The Crew’s server shutdown which triggered the SKG movement, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/the-crew-motorfest-and-the-crew-2-are-both-getting-offline-modes/">Ubisoft pledged to update both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorsport to ensure that they have offline modes</a>, ready for whenever it is that the online servers are shutdown. While multiplayer is a key component in these games, they can also be played as purely single player experiences.</p>
<p>There’s further examples, such as Gran Turismo Sport having online-only progression at launch, but Polyphony <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/29/gran-turismo-sport-server-shutdown-confirmed-for-january-2024/">switching this to local progression for single player for the server shutdown</a>. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/03/knockout-city-is-shutting-down-but-a-pc-private-servers-will-help-it-live-on/">Velan Studios made Knockout City private servers available</a> to the public, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, Video Games Europe also pulled out their ace, which is that you don’t own your games, so there:</p>
<p><em>“All video games, whether digital or physical copies, are licensed. As is the case with virtually all digital works when consumers purchase online games, regardless of the country of sale, what they acquire is a personal license to access and play the copy of the game they have purchased in accordance with the game’s terms of service. The consumer does not acquire ownership of that video game. These clear intellectual property rights underpin the entire market and enable the strong investment that the industry has seen for decades. There is no legal uncertainty about the status quo of video games.”</em></p>
<p>This is true to varying degrees depending on local laws, and EULAs and terms of service are a bit of a grey area that is rarely tested in court. In the EU, the New Digital Content Directive stated that EULAs are only enforceable to the extent that they do not breach reasonable consumer expectations. I’d say that the ability to play a game that you paid for indefinitely is a reasonable consumer expectation, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>Hopefully SKG can bring some serious debate and meaningful, good-faith consideration of this matter by EU lawmakers.</p>

<figure><a title="Star Wars: Rogue Squadron - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/64677a195d6b9/star-wars-rogue-squadron-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/384-star-wars-rogue-squadron">Nintendo Life</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello there, young Padawans, are you ready to continue your training in the art of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>?</p>
<p>Before we become one with the Force, let's look back to last week, where we saw a duel (of the fates) between two covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/resident_evil_the_darkside_chronicles">Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles</a>. It was the European and Japanese cover that took the high ground in the end, snatching up 61% of the vote compared to North America's 39%. *<em>Insert falling LEGO Yoda sound effect here</em>*</p>
<p>This time, we're heading back to a galaxy far, far away — <em>yipee!</em> — as we match up two covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/star_wars_rogue_squadron">Star Wars: Rogue Squadron</a>, on the N64. While perhaps not <em>quite</em> as beloved as its GameCube sequel, this high-octane flight combat game gave us all the Star Wars kick we so desperately craved in the late '90s, and <em>man,</em> did we pour the hours into it!</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEee42ub-Hw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>There are just the two covers to check out this time (no more, no less), so let's see which will become the Master, and which the Apprentice...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:123791 @ 1751869274 -->
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Star Wars: Rogue Squadron - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/79631c29329f4/star-wars-rogue-squadron-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/384-star-wars-rogue-squadron">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gosh, now there's a piece of art! The X-Wing takes centre stage, naturally, but the European and North American covers are all about the dogfighting. It's one of those where you spot more the longer you look. The TIE Fighter exploding in the background, the AT-ATs destroying Mos Eisley down below, all realised in a sweet painterly style. It's a good 'un, we've got to say.</p>
<p>Of course, the European variant was also home to the classic black border around the edge, but the art is identical, so we're not splitting them in two this time.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Star Wars: Rogue Squadron - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/98f26850baff1/star-wars-rogue-squadron-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/384-star-wars-rogue-squadron">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese cover is darker and more stripped back than the previous one we looked at, subbing the '<em>action everywhere!</em>' approach for a simple one-on-one between an X-Wing and a TIE Fighter. The attempt to go more realistic with the visuals means time hasn't been too kind to this one, but we appreciate the gloomy vibes it's going for. And hey, the ship 'blueprints' on the top and bottom of the box are cool.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-star-wars-rogue-squadron]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Virtuos team chimes in</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/34b637da5b98c/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Even now that we've got our hands on the Switch 2, there are still developers sharing their thoughts about the power of the system and where it fits in. In the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-port-specialist-believes-switch-2-can-surpass-its-predecessors-success">same interview with Wccftech</a>, the Virtuos team was asked how the new Nintendo device holds up in terms of "raw console performance" and if it's closer to an Xbox Series S or PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>According to Eoin O'Grady, who is technical director at Black Shamrock (a Virtuos studio and subsidiary), it's a bit of both, depending on what aspect of the hardware you're looking at. The GPU in the Switch 2 apparently performs "slightly below" the Series S (but does come with some added technologies) and as for the CPU, the Switch 2 is supposedly "closer" to the PlayStation 4.</p>
<p>Here's O'Grady's response in full, which also goes into how the experience might be for developers porting their current games to Nintendo's new hardware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In terms of raw console performance, do you agree that the Switch 2 is closer to the Xbox Series S than it is to the PlayStation 4, making it easier for developers to port their current-gen games to the hardware?</strong></p>
<p>"GPU-wise, the Switch 2 performs slightly below the Series S; this difference is more noticeable in handheld mode. However, the Series S does not support technologies like DLSS, which the Switch 2 does. This makes the GPU capabilities of the two consoles comparable overall.</p>
<p>"CPU-wise, there is a clearer distinction between the two consoles. The Switch 2 is closer to the PlayStation (PS) 4 in this respect, having a CPU just a bit more powerful than the PS4’s. Since most games tend to be more GPU-bound than CPU-bound when well optimized, the impact of this difference largely depends on the specific game and its target frame rate. Any game shipping at 60 FPS on the Series S should easily port to the Switch 2. Likewise, a 30 FPS Series S game that’s GPU-bound should also port well. Games with complex physics, animations, or other CPU-intensive elements might incur additional challenges in reaching 30 or 60 FPS or require extra optimization during porting."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows companies like Koei Tecmo suggesting Nintendo's new hybrid system was closer to an Xbox Series S in terms of "raw computing power". Other companies like Firaxis (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Civilization VII</a>) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/civilization-vii-dev-likens-games-switch-2-graphical-performance-to-mid-tier-pc">have also chimed in</a> with their own development experiences. Nvidia (the creator of the Switch 2 chip) even labelled it a "technical marvel" and "unlike anything" it's ever built before.</p>

<p>The description for Cyberpunk: Edgerunners season 2 says, <em>“Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 presents a new standalone 10-episode story from the world of Cyberpunk 2077— a raw chronicle of redemption and revenge. In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter? Director Kai Ikarashi (Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, SSSS.Gridman) brings a bold, cinematic vision to the series, supported by the lead character designer Kanno Ichigo (Promare, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners). They’re joined by returning collaborators Masahiko Otsuka (Gurren Lagann, Promare) and Hugo Award winner Bartosz Sztybor as Showrunner, Story Writer, and Producer.”</em></p>
<p>It has been nearly three years since the first Cyberpunk: Edgerunners series was released on Netflix, and told the story of David Martinez, a kid who lived in Night City and fell into a spiral while dealing with tragedy and the pressures of that the city threw at him. If you have not watched it, it is a decent watch and fleshes out the Cyberpunk 2077 world.</p>
