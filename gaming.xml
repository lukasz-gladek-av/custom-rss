            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-improves-how-demos-appear-and-behave-in-your-library-and-the-steam-store<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Steam has updated how demos "appear and behave" within the Steam library.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/6233628070477025191">post</a> to the official website, Valve said that with "thousands of playable demos launching on Steam every year, and millions of players trying them out, we've noticed some trends in feedback from both developers and players about the process and functionality. We've put together an update based on that feedback".</p>

<p>Going forward, you'll be able to add demos to your library without having to immediately install them. Just like full games, you can simply click "add to library" and download later on them when you're ready.</p>
<p>They also "behave more like free games" in that they'll now appear in all the same sections and lists, including the new and trending chart.</p>
<p>Perhaps best of all, Steam will now automatically notify you if a demo becomes available for a game you have on your wishlist.</p>
<p>"Demos can be installed even if you already own the full game," Valve adds. "Primarily, this will make it easier for developers to test demos, but it will also help players more easily manage installing/uninstalling demos."</p>
<p>You can also explicitly remove demos from your account, and when you choose to uninstall a demo, it will be scrubbed completely from your library, too.</p>
<p>"By default, free demos appear as a button on the full game's store page. But, developers have been asking for a way to enable a full store page to better describe the contents of the demo, add separate screenshots, upload a trailer, and specify supported features," Valve explains.</p>
<p>"So, that is now possible and you'll find that clicking on a demo sometimes loads a full demo store page while other times will take you to the full game's page with a button to install the demo.</p>
<p>"If developers have chosen to enable a store page for their demo, it will also be possible for players of the demo to post user reviews for the demo. These reviews and review score will appear on the demo store page just like reviews for any other free game on Steam."</p>
<p>ICYMI, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/">Steam app for Sony's PlayStation VR2</a> headset is due for release on 6th August. The free, official app will allow Steam users to play games on the virtual reality headset, as well as use the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers.</p>
<p>Use of the app will also require the PC adapter, which was unveiled in June and will release on 7th August.</p>

            <p>An open console beta is now available for Riot Games' hero shooter, Valorant.</p>
<p>The free-to-play 5v5 shooter was initially released for PC in 2020, but support for current-gen console systems finally rolled out last month through closed playtests.</p>

<p>Right now the open beta is limited to Brazil, Canada, Europe, Japan, and the US, and whilst console players will be able to team up with pals on the other console, there's currently no crossplay available with PC players. Sorry. Riot says it "believes strongly in competitive integrity, and this is the best way for us to keep the experience fair and consistent for players on both console and PC".</p>
<p>Riot also <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1816877050000736415">confirmed</a> on social media that PC players will have "access to [their] full collection [of skins and cosmetics] on PC and consoles".</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>All progress will be saved, too, so any battlepass progression, unlocked agents and skins will remain on your account even after the beta finishes, and you apparently don't require PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass to play.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Riot says there's no formal end to the beta period. It will only be closed "once [Riot] feels confident in where the game is at".</p>
<p>In a frank discussion about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valorant-studio-head-tells-toxic-players-to-play-something-else-we-wont-miss-you">"current state of player behaviour" in Valorant, Riot Games' head Anna Donlon recently outlined upcoming changes</a> designed "to make our community a better place".</p>
<p>It's the latest in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-outlines-plans-to-start-monitoring-valorant-voice-chat-in-a-bid-to-combat-disruptive-behaviour">Riot's long-running effort to clamp down on toxicity and unacceptable behaviours in Valorant</a>. In July 2022, Riot Games began collecting "in-game voice communications" in North America as part of its "larger effort to combat disruptive behaviour."

		<p>Remasters of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 an 2 have leaked out via two collectable statues at San Diego Comic-Con. That’s a new one for leaks for sure, we’ve had games revealed by the ERSB, by promotional drinks and mistimed adverts, but never a statue.</p>



<p>We can also see the Crystal Dynamics logo and as that team took ownership of the franchise back when they <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/08/crystal-dynamics-tomb-raider-legacy-of-kain/">joined Embracer</a>, it appears they will have at least some input on the remaster. The statues are on display at the Dark Horse booth at San Diego Comic-Con 2024.</p>
<p>“We are excited to inform you that Crystal Dynamics has taken control of several game franchises—including TOMB RAIDER and Legacy of Kain—from the games’ previous owner, Square Enix Limited,” the team stated at the time. “As a result of this change, Crystal Dynamics (or its affiliate) is now the owner of these games and the controller of the gameplay and personal data related to them.”</p>
<p>Fans have been clamouring for something from the Soul Reaver franchise for many years but there really has not been any hint of a remake or remaster until now.&nbsp; However, Embracer did say that they saw “great potential, not only in sequels, but also in remakes, remasters, spinoffs, as well as transmedia projects” when they spent vast amounts of cash buying up loads of IPs.</p>

<p>The two games are sequels to The Legacy of Kain, both featuring the vampire wraith Raziel in a quest to kill Kain, the star of the first game.&nbsp; Both titles picked up excellent reviews when they were released between 1991 and 2001, not surprising when they were directed by Uncharted’s Amy Hennig.</p>

<p>Neither Crystal Dynamics or Embracer have officially revealed the games but if the merchandise is already in production they cannot be too far away from release.</p>

            <p>Activision has published a 25-page white paper exploring the impact of skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) on its multiplayer lobbies, determining that SBMM is better for all players.</p>
<p>As spotted by indie game developer and consultant <a href="https://x.com/tha_rami/status/1817178179208925317">Rami Ismail</a>, the report – which can be <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/CallofDuty_Matchmaking_Series_2.pdf">read in full on Activision's official website</a> – outlines an "amazing A/B test" where Activision "secretly progressively turned off SBMM and monitored retention… and turns out everyone hated it, with more quitting, less playing, and more negative blowouts".</p>

<p>Activision announced plans to launch the series of white papers back in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/01/call-of-duty-update-an-Inside-look-at-matchmaking">April</a>, and has already considered the impact <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/01/call-of-duty-update-an-Inside-look-at-matchmaking">connections and Time to Match</a> has on online play.</p>
<p>The most recent paper, however – entitled "Matchmaking Series: The Role of Skill in Matchmaking" – "shares a look at matchmaking inside Call of Duty multiplayer, including how we always work to create a balanced system for the benefit of all players. While skill is one of many factors in matchmaking; it is not the driving force behind Call of Duty’s matchmaking system".</p>
<p>"Playing a better opponent may push players to become more proficient over time, but being severely outperformed in their matches, our testing has shown, instead leads players to quit matches in progress or to not play multiplayer," Activision surmises.</p>
<p>It also confirmed that it whilst it was "considering a single core multiplayer playlist that does not use skill as a factor in matchmaking", Activision believes "historical testing reveals that low- and mid-skill players would be unlikely to participate in such a playlist. As a match can only be created from players actively searching for a playlist, the likely result would be matches composed solely of high-skill players."</p>
<p>The experiment, Activision opines, shows that the existing SBMM system allows a broadest range of players to participate in "all key parts of Call of Duty's game design in core multiplayer".</p>
<p>This "includes games where players can contribute meaningfully to their team, not only with wins, but for their own personal records and achievements".</p>
<p>"The system strives for team balance, where players are not consistently on the wrong side of blowout matches. Players who frequently experience blowouts are seen to quit matches in progress and the game itself, which negatively impacts the experience for players of all skill levels," Activision concluded.</p>
<p>"We will always strive to improve our approach to matchmaking to ensure that players of all skill levels are having the best possible experience. A healthy player population is good for everyone in the community."</p>
<p>Further research papers into ranked played and "experimental methods" are expected later this year.</p>
<p>ICYMI, last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-is-heading-to-xbox-game-pass-this-week">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 joined Xbox Game Pass earlier this week</a>.</p>

            <p>Amazon Prime's Like a Dragon adaptation Like a Dragon: Yakuza will premier on 24th October, 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-yakuza-tv-series-on-amazon-prime-later-this-year">Previously</a>, we'd been told the series would debut on 25th October.</p>

<p>Sega's Yakuza game series released in 2005. Amazon says in the video description that it was "positioned as an entertaining game for adults, which found massive fanfare amongst its target audience".</p>
<p>The series will span two time periods - 1995 and 2005 - and follow "the life, childhood friends, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity".</p>
<p>"The series depicts the lives of fierce yet passionate gangsters and people living in a huge entertainment district, Kamurochō, a fictional district modeled after the violent Shinjuku ward’s Kabukichō, that acts as the backdrop of the gameplay," the description adds.</p>
<p>"Like a Dragon: Yakuza showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore. Coming October 24 to Prime."</p>
<p>Japanese actor and model Ryoma Takeuchi (who cameoed in Detective Pikachu, among other roles) will take on the lead role of Kazuma Kiryu, while Masaharu Take (The Naked Director) will direct.</p>
<p>The TV series is yet another indication of the success of the series, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-sammy-reports-best-financial-performance-for-a-decade-despite-european-studio-disappointment">sold 21.3m units in total</a>. The most recent game, this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-hits-1m-sales-in-first-week">Infinite Wealth, sold 1m units in its first week</a> and was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-is-series-biggest-steam-launch-to-date">series' biggest Steam launch ever</a>.</p>

            <p>For those watching the Olympics opening ceremony last night, no, that was not your imagination – a familiar hooded Assassin did indeed invade the rooftops of Paris last night.</p>
<p>Whilst it's hard to find footage given a trigger-happy copyright gremlin is striking down videos all over the place, there are still a number of images and video of Assassin's Creed Unity's Arno carrying the Olympic torch for anyone who missed it:</p>

<p>And no, it's not a coincidence – that really is an Assassin's Creed reference. Though it had been <a href="https://x.com/ac_landmarks/status/1816424863961411730">suggested</a> that Ubisoft's tentpole franchise may be making an appearance, last night the French company confirmed it:</p> <div>

<p>Assassin's Creed Unity – which will soon celebrate its tenth anniversary – was set in 18th-century Paris, which makes Arno's return fitting, if a little surprising given he is perhaps not the most beloved Assassin, and Unity was not the best-performing game at launch.</p> <div>

<p>It does, however, commemorate the hugely-successful series in a mainstream event seen by millions, and solidifies just how influential Ubisoft is to the people of Paris.</p>

            <p>I like a good factory game, but there's a fine line between "I enjoy this" and "I am uninstalling this before it ruins my year." I can't tell on which side of the divide <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shapez-2">Shapez 2</a> will fall, but I'm planning on finding out when it launches in Early Access next month on August 15th.

<p>Here's the Early Access announcemnt trailer from earlier this week:

<p>Like most factory games, Shapez 2 is about laying down conveyor belts to carry items between machinery that alters those items in some capacity. The difference is that instead of rendering one type of ore into another, Shapez is all about... shapes. That allows the game to broaden the possible solutions, with no predetermined recipes for the objects you're trying to create. Instead, it gives you machines that perform simple, fundamental actions - cutting a shape in half, changing its colour, rotating it, etc. - which you can puzzle out how to combine.
</p>
<p>The second compelling element to me is that the machinery is free to plonk down, and resources are infinite. It's more of a pure puzzle game, nearer the Opus Magnum end of the spectrum than the Factorio end. That's where I live. (Ollie, who lives in every factory possible, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shapez-2s-next-fest-demo-is-the-purest-catnip-for-factory-game-lovers">loved the Shapez 2 Next Fest demo</a>.)
</p>
<p>I didn't play the original Shapez (which has overwhelmingly positive reviews and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318690/shapez/">currently costs less than £1 on Steam</a>) but I admit, the leap to 3D presentation does make the sequel seem more approachable. You'll find Shapez 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2162800/shapez_2/">also on Steam</a>, where it's aiming to be in Early Access for around six months.</p>

            <p>It's not often that a trailer release alone is enough to justify a post around here, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-goo-2">World Of Goo 2</a> ought to be bigger on everyone's radar. A sequel to one of the best games ever made ought to be cause for an international holiday. It's being released next Friday, on August 2nd, and the new trailer below will gloop your tower with glimpses fo the puzzling tower-building to be found therein.

<p>World Of Goo's premise is simple enough. Goo balls slither around levels and you can pick them up. Hold them close to other goo balls and they will form connective beams, fixing them in place. Through this, you can build towers towards a level exit, and unused goos can scale the tower and escape. It's Lemmings with a 2008 physics twist.
</p>
<p>What makes World Of Goo a classic is that, on top of such a simple premise, each level introduces a delightful surprise: new types of goo, new obstacles, new settings, and so on. I remember people crowding around my monitor as I played it in an office in 2008 and <em>applauding</em> during end-of-level cutscenes, overcome by what an explosive and coherent act of imagination the whole thing was. The prototypical example of an indie game taking a good idea and exploring it to its fullest potential.
</p>
<p>Which, if you buy the argument, makes it a tough act to follow. I'd be worried about World Of Goo 2's ability to find as much invention as the original if sixteen years hadn't elapsed. Since it has been that long, I'm just happy there's more of it, and if it repeats a bunch of ideas and is ultimately a lesser game, then who cares, I'd still have fun playing it.
</p>
<p>August 2nd. I think Brendy's bagsied the review.</p>

            <p>Grimdark hack-and-slasher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked-2024">No Rest For The Wicked</a> has received its first major update - or the first that isn't focused on bug fixes and performance improvements, anyway. It focuses on revamping the Crucible, the endgame's repeatable roguelite, adding more randomisation to arenas and a new system of player buffs.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"One of the biggest features that we always envisioned for the Cerim Crucible but weren’t able to ship at launch is this Echoes. Echoes allow you to customize every run with a huge variety of buffs and effects, creating a staggering amount of possibilities as it allows you to create a build on top of your build," says Moon's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/4338739067969013801">own introduction to the update</a>. "Thanks to Echoes and the randomization of them, no two runs in the Crucible will ever be alike."
</p>
<p>The randomised chambers you'll fight through have been tripled in number, alongside a new art theme, a new vendor, and a new enemy faction called the Gloam. Glowing with a "corrupt bioluminescence", the Gloam will only appear in the Crucible for now, but will be added to the overworld in a later update. 
</p>
<p>Outside of the Crucible, the update adds some extensions to the overworld, new agear upgrades, "punchier" effects in combat, stray animals you can pet, several further performance upgrade, and Steam Deck verification. You'll <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/4372516525986618808">find the full patch notes over on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>No Rest For The Wicked is from Moon Studios, known previously for the two Ori games. If what you crave is another maudlin metroidvania from them, you're out of luck: they say they'll be working on No Rest in Early Access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-expect-ori-3-anytime-soon-as-devs-say-theyll-be-working-on-no-rest-for-the-wicked-for-up-to-a-decade">for up to a decade</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warcry-briar-and-bone-review.938487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warcry-briar-and-bone-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Warcry</em>&nbsp;Briar and Bone is the third expansion in the latest season of Warcry. It follows the same format as the previous expansion's release, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warcry-hunter-and-hunted-preview-who-let-dogs-out">Hunter and Hunted</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warcry-pyre-and-flood-guide-life-vs-death-clash">Pyre and Flood</a>,&nbsp;where it contains 2 new warbands and their rules, and a single piece of scenery, rather than the full scenery set up that earlier season's boxes contained.&nbsp;In this article, we'll have a look at what's in the Briar and Bone box, talk in-depth about the 2 new warbands, and explain why this box is different from previous seasons, and if you're a new player, what you need to use it.</p>
<p><em>Warcry</em> is a skirmish wargame, set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar&nbsp;</em>setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Warcry</em> features a small number of fighters, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies.&nbsp;We've covered <em>Warcry</em> in depth since its first edition, and you can read our review of the latest starter set <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-warcry-crypt-of-blood-review-skirmish-gaming-101">Crypt of Blood</a>.</p>

<h2>What Does Warcry Briar and Bone Contain?</h2>
<p><em>Warcry</em>&nbsp;Briar and Bone contains:</p>
<ul><li><em>Warcry</em>&nbsp;Briar and Bone Warband Tome</li>
<li>8x Twistweald miniatures</li>
<li>8x Teratic Cohort&nbsp;miniatures</li>
<li>1x Ravening Gnarloak&nbsp;scenery piece</li>
<li>Fighter and ability cards for both warbands</li>
<li>42x Battleplan cards</li>

<p><em>Warcry</em>&nbsp;Briar and Bone is an expansion pack for <em>Warcry</em>, so it doesn't require everything needed to play.</p>
<p>To use <em>Warcry</em> Briar and Bone you will also need the following&nbsp;<em>Warcry </em>products:</p>
<ul><li><em>Warcry</em>&nbsp;Core Rulebook</li>
<li>Six-sided dice (D6), measuring tools and tokens</li>
<li>A game board and scenery set (you can use anything you want, including your existing scenery, or the new official set for this season, the&nbsp;Savage Lands: Scales of Talaxis&nbsp;scenery box)</li>
</ul><h2>What Warbands Do You Get In Warcry Briar and Bone?</h2>
<p><i>Warcry </i>Briar and Bone, as standard with <em>Warcry</em> expansions, includes 2 brand new warbands, the&nbsp;Sylvaneth Twistweald, and the&nbsp;Ossiarch Bonereapers Teratic Cohort.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcry-briar-and-bone-003.jpg?itok=xqOTilmw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcry-briar-and-bone-003.jpg?itok=VhFL3MOO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Twistweald</h4>
<p>The Twistweald aren't the Sylvaneth warriors as you know them, they are forest spirits infected with bizarre arcane parasites, that makes them outcasts from their own kind for fear of spreading the infection further. They're not fast, but they're durable and they all have access to the powerful Quad ability, Twisted Song, that lets them remove damage and make a bonus move or attack action. They also have an ability card filled with offensive doubles and triples, like the Swamsage's Thorned Grasp that deals 2 damage to an enemy on a 2 plus, and continued dice rolls for damage as long as you roll higher than the previous roll.</p>
<p>The Twistweald fighters are expensive, with the cheapest costing 110 points,&nbsp; but they have a solid mix of hard-hitting close and ranged attacks to spread amongst the warband. The spitesspear armed Twistroot has a great range 2, 4 dice 2/4 damage attack that keeps enemies at range.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcry-briar-and-bone-002.jpg?itok=ylqWIvW_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcry-briar-and-bone-002.jpg?itok=n6rNAySO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Teratic Cohort</h4>
<p>The Teratic Cohort are some of Nagash's most pitiful creations, sculpted into skeletal beasts from failed soldiers, their minds forever tormented, which makes them lethal to their enemies. Their animalistic nature gives them the Predatory Ravage reaction, which allows them a free attack after damage has been dealt to them by either discarding a wild dice or subtracting 1 from the attacks and damage from each hit dice from the attack. This reaction can be super lethal from the warband's leader, the Kavalos Centari, an amalgamation of warrior and steed, who attacks with 5 dice at range 3.</p>
<p>The rest of the warband are a mix of Mortek Cyloptians, slow and durable warriors with strength 5 attacks, and the 2 types of beasts, the winged Aviarch Harpies, and houndlike Teratic Prowlers.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcry-briar-and-bone-004.jpg?itok=M0We4Nz6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcry-briar-and-bone-004.jpg?itok=hvsPczY8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Warcry Briar and Bone?</h2>
<p>The 2 warbands in <em>Warcry Briar and Bone</em> aren't to my taste, although I've always liked the Bonereapers aesthetic, but both are very thematic and matched well against each other. The Twistweld and Teratic Cohort are both slow and durable, and each has a slightly faster fighter option for moving on objectives, or late-game repositioning. I love that they're both outcasts from their own societies, and are still battling each other for the benefit of their own hated factions. I do love the Ravening Gnarloak terrain piece, and kicking an enemy fighter into the maw is extremely satisfying.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy Warcry Briar and Bone?</h2>
<p>If you want either of the warbands and the scenery piece in this set, then this will probably be the only way to get them for a couple of months before their individual release. If the warband's playstyle or aesthetics don't appeal to you, you won't get much out of this. There is an additional game option, Battle Traits included in the rulebook that adds additional abilities for all <em>Warcry</em> warbands, but that won't be enough to justify the cost if you don't want either of the warbands, and should be published in the <em>Warcry Annual</em> at the end of the season.</p>

		<p>Back in June, there was confirmation from Amazon that there was a Like A Dragon Yakuza show coming, with it set to be released on October 24th. During San Diego Comic Con, Amazon dropped the first proper teaser for Like A Dragon Yakuza, showing glimpses of scenes from the show, including the nightlife, fighting, and a unique take on the Millennium Tower,</p>
<p><iframe title="Like A Dragon: Yakuza - Teaser Trailer | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mZkC1sYxzZo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Like A Dragon Yakuza will be an adaptation of the first Yakuza game, which originally released in 2005. It sees Kiryu and his sworn brother Akira Nishikiyama, aka Nishiki, fall on different sides as they both rise through the ranks. Before the teaser, it was announced that Kento Kaku was cast as Nishiki, joining Ryoma Takeuchi who is playing Kiryu Kazama. Masayoshi Yokoyama, Director of RGG Studio also had a message for fans, and his reaction to the show which you can watch below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Like a Dragon: Yakuza - Director of RGG Studio / Executive Producer - SDCC Interview | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9NS-3_Gqr-s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When the show was originally announced, Amazon said, <em>“The series’ story is set in two time periods, 1995 and 2005, and follows the life, childhood friends and the repercussions of the decisions of a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.”</em></p>

<p>Like A Dragon Yakuza will have a total of six episodes, with the first three episodes dropping at the same time on October 24th on Amazon Prime.</p>

		<p>The Olympics are upon us after last night’s opening ceremony in Paris, and you really have to admire all the dancers, performers and athletes that stuck it out in the pouring rain, as boats, horses, more boats, and the Olympic flame made its way up and down the Seine in Paris.</p>
<p>Are you going to be gorging yourself on all manner of sporting disciplines over the coming fortnight? Hopefully the weather’s a bit better!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-goes-all-in-on-videogames-wants-to-ship-1-2-games-per-year-starting-late-2025-early-2026/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Wizards of the Coast is once again pushing itself toward videogames. President and CEO Chris Cocks openly said as much during the Q&amp;A portion of Hasbro's Q2 2024 earnings call (transcript available <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/26/hasbro-has-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Fool.com</a>), revealing that the studio has hired veteran executive John Hight with the goal to ship one or two games per year starting in late 2025 or early 2026 at the latest, thanks to a yearly investment of around $125 million.</p>
<p><em>John, I think, is a luminary hire. He's had a major hand in a bunch of franchises: Warcraft, Hearthstone, God of War, and even going way back to Command &amp; Conquer. He's worked on some great stuff, which I think is perfectly on point with what Wizards of the Coast is all about and what our digital gaming strategy is all about, which is extending a bunch of great mid-core and hard-core brands and an expertise in designing for those kinds of audiences and helping us digitize what those brands can do. I think between our board moves and with talent that we brought on board, most recently with John, but even before that, studio leaders we have like Ames Kirshen, who was in charge of the Batman: Arkham series; James Ohlen, who was the Head of Creative Design at BioWare, responsible for the first Baldur's Gates, Neverwinter Nights, Mass Effect.</em></p>
<p data-uw-rm-sr=""><em>We're going all in on becoming a digital play company. Roughly, our capital envelope is about $250 million a year. About half of that is going into Digital Games. Our goal is to be shipping one to two new games per year starting as early as late 2025, potentially early 2026. And I think we have a balanced approach to that. When you look at our game, when you look at our portfolio of investments in games, whether they're partnerships or JVs that we're doing are just fully internal investments.</em></p>
<p><em>And then you look at our whole lineup of licensed games, we have 150 projects that are either active in the market or in development. I think it's important for us to have a hand as a publisher to guide our franchises and to work on the areas and the audiences that we think are hyper-important. But I also think it's important for us to work with the best partners in the business and extend those franchises in areas where either we don't have the expertise or we don't have the platform. And I think we've been doing a good job of it.</em></p>
<p><em>It's no accident why I think we're the No. 1 licensor in the space. And I think we're going to be a top publisher eventually in the space, and we're going to take our time and do it right.</em></p>
<p>It's not the first time we <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-coast-dd-based-videogames/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> Cocks talking about a push toward the videogame industry, particularly <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-seven-or-eight-dd-games-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the Dungeons and Dragons franchise</a>. However, last year Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-cancels-at-least-5-games-including-2-dd-titles-from-hidden-path-otherside/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> five games, including two D&amp;D projects in development at Hidden Path Entertainment and OtherSide Entertainment.</p>
<p>Given the newly confirmed push, it's safe to guess those projects were axed due to their own problems rather than a change in strategy. Wizards of the Coast currently owns <a href="https://wccftech.com/archetype-entertainment-is-a-new-wizards-of-the-coast-studio-working-on-a-sci-fi-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archetype Entertainment</a> (which is working on the Mass Effect-like sci-fi RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-is-an-epic-sci-fi-rpg-from-bioware-vet-james-ohlen-features-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exodus</a>), <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-opens-austin-studio-for-aaa-game-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skeleton Key</a>, Atomic Arcade (currently working on a triple-A GI Joe game based on the character Snake Eyes), and Invoke Studios, formerly known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-acquires-tuque-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuque</a> and now working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new triple-A Dungeons and Dragons game</a> powered by Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Wizards of the Coast is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-franchise-to-continue-as-wizards-of-the-coast-talks-to-many-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in talks</a> with various partners to continue the Baldur's Gate franchise following Larian's decision to find its own path elsewhere.</p>

		<p>During San Diego Comic Con, NetherRealm Studios revealed a major new expansion for Mortal Kombat 1, and it is called Khaos Reigns. This new expansion brings a new story to Mortal Kombat 1, expanding on the game’s events with a new threat that threatens the peace of Liu Kang’s reshaped universe. That threat is Titan Havik, who wants to tear down everything and bring anarchy to the realm.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PF7nFD80g3M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns is not just a new story expansion, but also brings with it Kombat Pack 2, adding six more fighters to the game. On release, those who have access to Kombat Pack 2 will receive Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot. The three guest characters, who are yet to receive release dates, are Ghostface from the Scream movies, the T-1000 from Terminator 2, and Conan The Barbarian. Kombat Pack 2 will not be available as a standalone purchase, and those who have Khaos Reigns will get one week early access to the guest characters. Finally, Animality fatalities will be brought back for Mortal Kombat 1, and these will be added as part of a free update for all players. Those who pre-order Khaos Reigns will get bonus costumes, and those are Wedding Scorpion, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Sub Zero, Empress Mileena, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Noob Saibot.</p>

<p>In our Mortal Kombat 1 review, Nick said, <em>“Mortal Kombat 1 serves as a love letter to fans of this thirty-one-year-old franchise and as a pseudo-reboot it also has potential appeal to newcomers alike. There’s still room to grow and I’m sure it will just keep getting better, but Mortal Kombat 1 is already definitely worth your time.”</em></p>

<p>Mortal Kombat 1: Chaos Reigns will be available on September 24th, and it is available for pre-order now across PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, with Switch coming soon.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hcs-atlanta-major-live-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo%E2%80%99s-atlanta-major-is-live-now-with-250-000-on-the-line.938451/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hcs-atlanta-major-live-now/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The Halo Championship Series Atlanta Major is live now and will run until the end of the weekend. With a $250,000 prize pool on the line, there’s plenty to play for, and both OpTic Gaming and FaZe Clan have burst into the tournament with strong leads and capable showings. While FaZe Clan has the edge in the tournament and the momentum after winning the HCS London Major, OpTic Gaming has a lot to fight for this time around.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-run-up-to-champs">The Run Up To Champs</h2>



<p>Once the HCS Atlanta Major is over, players will travel to Salt Lake City to compete in the final Major of the season. Then, all eyes are on the World Championship, which is being hosted in the home of Xbox in Seattle, Washington in October. Last year’s Champs tournament ended in an epic showdown between FaZe and OpTic, with the former team winning and scooping the top prize.</p>



<p>It’s looking like we could go that way once again this year.</p>



<p>The HCS Atlanta Major has opened up nicely, with FaZe Clan dominating the board. On the stats sheet, the team is running rampant, with Snakebite racking up a K/D of 1.79 – three of the top five players on the leaderboard are from FaZe Clan. </p>



<p>In a brief interview <a href="https://x.com/TheNarrativeOB/status/1817035324482023696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with The Narrative</a>, Snakebite gave his sentiments about the tournament thus far:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d say we’re happy with the way we played – we won 3 – 0 both series so we can’t complain too much but we definitely need a lot more energy just going into the weekend. We know it, so hopefully we bring it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>OpTic Gaming has lagged somewhat, securing a close finish against Pure with a 3 – 2 scoreline but then dominating ITB in the next series – it’s representative of there needing to be a little work done for the team to perfect their performance ahead of the next stage. </p>
