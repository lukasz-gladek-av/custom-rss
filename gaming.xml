<p>Players will be free to roam the large and realistic open world of the real Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, transformed by the fictional Chernobylite material. They will get to create and develop their own hero, with attributes and skills affecting combat effectiveness and the conversation style.</p>
<p>The developers claim the sequel will feature an advanced melee combat system, in addition to a diverse arsenal of firearms. Stealth or calling on others for help are other options available. Each of the main character's buddies is a potential teacher, ready to share their knowledge and skills. Assemble your team and discover the unique strengths and abilities they bring to the table.</p>
<p>Planewalking allows you to change the build and equipment on the fly. Moreover, players are free to develop more than one character skill set. Base expansion is also important, with players able to craft valuable items and upgrade their weapons every day. Assigning tasks to NPCs ensures they will take care of your equipment and supplies.</p>
<p>Throughout Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone, players will fight for influence and negotiate with the game's factions. The Exclusion Zone is a battlefield that changes daily and reacts to your actions.&nbsp; Perhaps the biggest addition is online co-op. Dedicated missions are reportedly embedded in the single player campaign, allowing players to interact with each other in various ways.</p>
<p>We'll keep a close eye on the development of this promising sequel. Stay tuned for more information as the release draws near.</p>

Sony is slashing prices across various games, DLCs, and even some in-game currency. Odds are if you’ve had a game you’ve been eyeing for a while, it might be fairly cheap at the moment. If you’re looking for a fun cooperative game to play with a friend, a lover, or a family member, there are a few cheap, quick games for you two to finish in a night or two on your PS5 through PS4 backwards compatibility. Here are a few co-op games on sale to play on your couch with your player 2.<br></p></div><div><p>While cooperative marriage counseling platformer <em>It Takes Two </em>was the game that got developer Hazelight the most recognition when it won Game of the Year<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/it-takes-two-wins-game-of-the-year-at-the-2021-game-awa-1848067354&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/it-takes-two-wins-game-of-the-year-at-the-2021-game-awa-1848067354"> at the 2021 Game Awards</a></span>, before that, the team released <em>A Way Out</em>. This cooperative action game has to be played with a friend, and you only have to buy it once if you’re playing online, as you can join a friend’s session without owning a copy of the game. It stars two criminals who break out of prison, and the roller coaster ride of cooperative antics doesn’t end there. <em>A Way Out </em>is the kind of co-op game that requires you to communicate, coordinate, and move in a synchronized fashion. Whether it’s climbing back to back through a small space, or one person moving around the world while another talks to an NPC, or playing a game of Connect Four, <em>A Way Out </em>is all about two players working like two arms on one unit, and it makes for a really compelling, sometimes meaningfully frustrating experience to play with a friend. It’s currently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-CUSA07995_00-HAZELIGHTAWAYOUT&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-CUSA07995_00-HAZELIGHTAWAYOUT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$5.99 as part of the Summer Sale</a></span>.<br></p></div><div><p>I loved the original <em>Unravel</em> when it launched in 2016, and the sequel takes all the original yarn-based metaphors about the threads that connect people and makes them literal by tethering two yarn-based heroes together. <em>Unravel Two </em>can be played alone, but the gimmick the puzzle-platformer utilizes this time around is that it adds a second “Yarny” character to the mix and ties both heroes together. This means you’ll be navigating gorgeous, sidescrolling environments while also dragging each other across the screen. Sometimes it doesn’t quite feel like it’s made for two people, as it can be completed by swapping back and forth between your two Yarnies, but there’s something special about finishing it alongside a friend, sitting together on the couch for local co-op. <em>Unravel Two </em>is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-CUSA10483_00-COLDWOODPIKE0000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-CUSA10483_00-COLDWOODPIKE0000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">running for $4.99</a></span> during the remainder of the Summer Sale.<br></p></div><div><p>Berzerk Studio’s <em>Just Shapes &amp; Beats </em>is still a staple at plenty of gaming conventions years after it launched in 2018 because it’s such an easy pick-up-and-play experience to dive into with friends. The bullet hell/rhythm game hybrid has you and your friends control small shapes plopped into a visualization of some banger EDM tracks, all while trying to avoid the chaotic obstacles that spawn to the rhythm and melody of the music. I’ve picked up <em>Just Shapes &amp; Beats </em>with friends and colleagues at many a PAX and PlayStation Experience, and I imagine it’s just as much of a hectic hoot with a friend or two on the couch. It’s available for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0060-CUSA10349_00-JUSTSHAPESNBEATS&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0060-CUSA10349_00-JUSTSHAPESNBEATS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$13.99 as part of the Summer Sale.</a></span></p><hr><p>If you’d rather not play games with others, the Summer Sale has a lot more to offer before it ends on August 15.

Now, not only has the community-driven mode made a ton of progress, but it also has a playable beta that shadow-dropped yesterday. </p><p>Maximilian Dood announced his Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite mod, now minted as Marvel Vs Capcom Infinite &amp; Beyond, in a <a href="https://youtu.be/wSZeUh5FlWY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>lengthy YouTube video on his channel</u></a>. In the hour and 46-minute video, Maximilian detailed the mod and its changes in comparison to the game’s original release. </p><p>“The only way you can play other people online with these balance changes is if the other person also has it,” Maximilian said in the video. </p><p>While the mod is still a ways away from being complete, a beta for the game is available to download on <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/534185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GameBanana</u></a>. Detailed in the mod’s patch notes are character gameplay changes and a feedback submission form for players to report bugs they encounter. Once the mod is complete, it will be free to download. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There has been alot of confusion of how to install the Balance beta for <a href="https://twitter.com/MVCI_Beyond?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MVCI_Beyond</a> .

Hats off to you and the team for having come thus far already, and thank you for having me aboard!” Moukala wrote in a YouTube comment. “Getting to flex my passion for fighting game music on this project is such a fun experience, and doing so alongside Little V is a hell of an icing on the cake.”</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@maximiliantiktok/video/7402029798190533918" data-video-id="7402029798190533918"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@maximiliantiktok?refer=embed" target="_blank" title="@maximiliantiktok" rel="noopener noreferrer">@maximiliantiktok</a> Thank you for coming!

Since starting the project, Maximilian has enlisted the help of Unreal engineer and technical artist <a href="https://x.com/erebuswolf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erebus</a> as lead technical developer and Hearthstone proucer Barrett Womack as the mod's creative producer. At the time, Maximilian revealed that the guiding principle for the mod was to attract players "who adduced their eyes" to Capcom's crossover fight. </p><p>“This is the most active game dev I’ve ever done and it isn’t just me. It’s a lot of people. The budget of this project already at three months has well-passed five figures. It’s one of the most expensive things I’ve ever done,” Maximillian said. “This is a mod that is going to be completely free for everybody that bought MvC: I. We have no plan to sell this. We have no plans to turn it into a product in any way. All it’s going to be is that if you like MvC: I, try it out. Our version one should be available at the end of this year.” </p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

The midseason "Reloaded" update will likely arrive to MW3 and Warzone on August 21.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the future of Call of Duty, the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/">Black Ops 6</a> game releases on October 25.

"Witcher 4 has been announced. I can't say anything about it," Cockle said. "What we know is that Geralt will be part of the game. We just don't know how much, and the game won't focus on Geralt, so it's not about him this time."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkl5T0pMFb4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="9">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vkl5T0pMFb4?start=9" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As for whom the game is about, Cockle claims to not know.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/ps1-translation-hilltop-playstation-localization</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98many-ps1-games-are-almost-impossible-for-us-to-play%E2%80%99.951198/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ps1-translation-hilltop-playstation-localization<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There were over 4000 games released on the PS1. That’s a lot of games, but sadly, even today, many of them remain unknown to Western audiences because they were never released outside of Japan. Now, decades later, fans are trying to change that.</p><hr><p><em>The following is excerpted from the book&nbsp;</em>The Console Chronicles, <em>by Lost In Cult. This chapter, </em>Twilight Translations<em>, was written by Brogan Chattin.</em> <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://harpercollins.co.uk/products/the-console-chronicles-lost-in-cult?variant=40921043107918" target="_blank">The book is available for preorder now.</a></em></p><hr><p>For English- speaking audiences, the Sony PlayStation had a robust catalogue that offered experiences which its competitors struggled to compete against. It had excellent multi-disc RPGs with epic stories and demanding memory usage that a Nintendo 64 couldn’t rival. It had goofy platformers featuring Gobbos or sentient primates, and high production horror masterpieces that pushed their genre forward.</p><p>Sean Seanson is a Youtuber that covers obscure games and regularly returns to<br>the PlayStation library. Sean’s channel has dozens of hours of PlayStation videos alone, and his enthusiasm for the console is essential to the identity of his work. It’s infectious, whether he’s talking about <em>Incredible Crisis</em> or <em>Gamera 2000</em>.</p><p>Sean explained why the system is so special to him, remarking that “the PlayStation’s library is almost like a bottomless pit of creativity and strange ideas.There are over 4,000 unique games released for the platform which is an absolutely incredible amount when you think about it. And considering how popular and influential this console is, there’s still so much that people don’t know about it.” That is due to myriad factors, such as marketing and business decisions which dissuaded localisation efforts and often kept exciting catalogue titles away from certain regions.</p><p>The relationship between cultural sensitivity and market forces become delicately intertwined when it comes to localising a game for the West. As a result, many PS1 games are almost impossible to play now, simply because they’ve never been translated. If director Bong Joon-Ho was right about film subtitles being an infamous one-inch barrier to a wider appreciation of that medium, the same is perhaps true of games — the effort of localising and then experiencing that video game might just be a mountain for devs and players alike.</p><p>For years, an independent translator named Hilltop has been working on translating Sony titles for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2. They are one of many in a community of modders who translate games that were never localised (and sometimes, some that were). The motivation to take on these sorts of projects often stems from a combination of personal ambition, time, and passion. “I’ve been gaming for as long as I can remember,” Hilltop said. “Most of my earliest memories are about me and my family huddled around an NES playing <em>Mario</em>. I didn’t start doing translations until I found myself unemployed and with a lot of spare time during COVID, though.”</p><p>For Hilltop, what’s most exciting is the opportunity to show people something they’ve never experienced before. “These works may have not found great success at the time, but here in 2023, these games look and feel fresh, and we have a chance to give them a second life by bringing them to a new audience.” Hilltop’s translations include some unique picks. <em>Dr. Slump</em> is an adaptation of an Akira Toriyama manga with beautiful texture work and animation similar to <em>Mega Man Legends</em>. <em>Aconcagua</em> is an impressive cinematic effort that combines adventure game elements with <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Parasite Eve</em> fixed-camera gameplay. <em>Harmful Park</em> is a fun take on the cute-’em-up genre mostly<br>represented in cultural memory by <em>Parodius</em>.</p><p>These games aren’t novelties, though. They represent a large part of the system’s true identity. Playing <em>b.l.u.e. Legend of Water</em> and hearing its music for the first time feels instantly familiar, in an uncanny sense. It’s a deep sea diving game that may not break any barriers, but instead advocates for beauty and aesthetics clearly, making it an essential PlayStation experience.</p><p>One particularly interesting translation in Hilltop's catalogue is <em>Racing Lagoon</em>. This game, published by Square, combines standard role-playing and street racing. Its style and gameplay influences has cultivated a community to this day with people sharing builds on Discord servers. "<em>Racing Lagoon</em> is an absolutely fantastic video game and unique like a gemstone. Yet it was absolutely hammered by reviewers at the time who simply didn't 'get it. They thought a racing RPG was pointless, 'why wouldn't you play <em>Gran Turismo</em> or <em>Final Fantasy</em> instead of this middle ground?' But now that people have finally tasted it, it's almost like a curse. It gave them an itch that nothing else can scratch - <em>Final Fantasy</em> and <em>Gran Turismo</em> simply don't have it," Hilltop said.</p><p>Stories of influence and innovation can be found elsewhere in the canon of translated games too. In 1994, FromSoft made the first<em> King's Field</em> game, an early ancestor to the now-juggernaut Soulsborne genre. This first title was never localised officially, but as of 2006 John David Osborne provided a translation for the PlayStation 1 classic. It's an essential first-person dungeon crawling title if not because of how good it is on its own - for the legacy it carried onwards. Similar translations of classic dungeon crawlers such as the PlayStation versions of <em>Ultima Underworld</em> (translated by Gertius) and Sting Entertainment's <em>Baroque</em> (translated by one Plissken) continue to be workshopped and released. These hard-working translators are adding more PlayStation games for you to experience, unbound by time.</p><p>This sort of work is largely a team effort even when a single person does the majority of the work themselves. Exporters, debug tools, and other programs are essential for many of these projects. Hilltop credits a single document by <em>Policenauts </em>translator Slowbeef as a tool that allowed him to understand the work required for the <em>Dr. Slump</em> project… which was a game full of proprietary encryption algorithms and a whole bunch of other words that make heads spin. Hilltop has also worked with Cargodin before, who translates games and song lyrics on his blog. From SnowyAria to people who have been in the practice for actual decades such as Esperknight there's a rich community of translation personalities. and a history of fan development to explore.</p><p>But why do so many dedicate themselves to the PlayStation? Why any console, for that matter? "Don't get me wrong, I love the PlayStation 1," Hilltop remarked, "I love its games, its music, its aesthetics, the creativity in its burgeoning 3D titles, but it's not cool to like PlayStation, you know? It's almost a given, since it's so ubiquitous. On the other side, you have a lot of people who exclusively work on Nintendo titles because of how much their games have meant to them, and because SNES hacking in particular is friendly territory for a hacker trying to break in".</p><p>Hilltop cites practical reasons for translating any console game. How many tools and retractable footsteps are there for newer hackers? Is there an audience? The latter is a foregone conclusion. People are eager for new experiences and have gone far in supporting Hilltop and other translators in their endeavours. They playtest on real hardware and provide consistent financial support or ongoing feedback. The internet facilitates direct connections between artists and their audience.</p><p>It's a two-way street for Hilltop. "Having an audience I can connect with has helped tremendously. The entire time I've been doing this, I actually did not possess any convenient means to play my translations on real PSI hardware. Being able to reach out for testers has helped keep the patches hardware compatible. And of course, it's incredible to see the vast amount of people who come to these games not just to play them, but to create content and share them on social media."</p><p>This showcase of passion is one of the best ways to communicate the importance of art and preservation. It's easier to care about a game when someone has poured their enthusiasm into it and brought it to you, rather than just stumbling upon said game in isolation. It's like making a playlist for your best friend.</p><p>Sean Seanson's Youtube work embodies this - Sean has both a passion to learn and a passion to show. "So much of what I know about video games is thanks to the great work of writers and video makers, who helped to educate me about the history and wider world of video games. So my videos are a way to both satisfy my own curiosity and have a creative way to help teach others about them, because I think there's a lot we can learn from some of these older games. If they help to inspire creatives or even just give somebody a fun new game to check out, then I feel like I'm at least doing my part."</p><p>Sean, and creators like him, become the gateway for many curious enthusiasts who want to learn more about games history, so perhaps creators also shape the future identity of a console too. "I think when you see how the elements of [PlayStation's] visuals and sound are still popular today (PSX-style horror, PSX D&amp;B/Jungle mixes), its influence on people goes further than just the games. The PlayStation is a vibe, as the kids would say, and I think it's something that will continue to resonate with fans both old and new throughout the years," Sean said.</p><p>These voices also showcase the importance of the internet and less-than-official channels for wider cultural understanding. "[I'd] go to a video game store, or rental place, pick out a game and that was that," Sean explained. "Across certain parts of Europe, Asia, and South America, they were getting games from family members and markets and ending up with all sorts of strange games from across the globe. So games that are maybe quite obscure and unusual to a Western audience might end up being a well-known classic to the kids who got all their games from the local market."</p><p>When a console's identity is only defined by how its parent company advertises it, we become region-locked. We think of Kirby's furrowed brow when we think of the Pink Puffball in the States, but Kirby's demeanour is quite different in Japan. Developers and publishers often decide that elements of their catalogue aren't worth the financial risk in certain parts of the world, or they craft various marketing schemes that change design intent to fit their target audience. There are two forces that ultimately determine a console's identity: the marketing machine and the fans who want to play. Each is deeply informed by the other, but often the gaming industry strives to control the conversation.</p><p>These companies have a financial incentive to dictate the image of the past, or to forget it entirely. This is why community-driven preservation is essential. "Please consider playing [a fan translated game)," Hilltop said as our conversation concluded. "And consider supporting the people creating them. It is no easy task to create a fan translation and they are no lesser than any 'official' work. The pool of games that never left Japan are some of the most interesting relics of the era and absolutely deserve your time and attention."</p><p>When Sony released the PlayStation Classic as a retro revival product in 2018, the game list was wildly different depending on the region. The US PlayStation Classic included the original American release of <em>Revelations: Persona</em>, along with all of its questionable localisation choices. I think of that title when I look at Hilltop's disdain for the word 'official.’ How many official translations of <em>Symphony of the Night</em> exist now? Games are collaborative works, and a translation in any medium requires its own artistic liberties. A console or game's identity has to live beyond the purview of marketing, in the hands of people willing to have a conversation. The very book you're reading in your hands is part of the effort to have this ongoing conversation. Consoles may die in the eyes of their manufacturers, but we ensure that their twilight remains eternal.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sega vs. Nintendo defined a generation in the '90s, while today's comparatively mild console wars and monthly Circana reports keep sales figures near the forefront of games-related discussion. New monetization models require new metrics for success — monthly active users, player retention rates, in-game revenue, etc. — but one of the industry's biggest questions remains: What are the best-selling video games of all time?</p><p>To answer this question, we set out to compile the most accurate list possible by reaching out to publishers and digging through financial reports, news stories, interviews, and more. The result is the following list of the ten best-selling video games of all time.</p><p><em>Some notes up front: </em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>Pack-in games are counted toward sales totals, considering most games on this list were, at one point, bundled with a console.</em></li><li><em>Free downloads are not counted as sales, which excludes massively successful games like Fortnite and League of Legends from a list like this.</em></li><li><em>Due to a lack of available sales data, we could not include certain games that may belong on this list. For example, we reached out to Activision-Blizzard seeking updated sales numbers for Diablo 3 (30 million units sold as of June 2015) and the Call of Duty franchise but did not receive updated information to include those games on this list.</em></li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>10 Best Selling Video Games of All Time</h3></div></output><h2>10.

Terraria – 58.7 million</h2><p>Perhaps the biggest surprise on this list is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/05/25/terraria-review"><u>Terraria</u></a>, the hit 2D sandbox game from developer Re-Logic. As of June 2024, 58.7 million copies of Terraria have been sold, according to the <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-state-of-the-game-june-2024.136658/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer</a>, with 32 million on PC alone.</p><h2>8.

"We’re sitting here, it’s 12 years after Skyrim," <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/starfield-interview-todd-howard-on-fulfilling-his-vision-xbox-performance-and-more">Howard told IGN</a>.

Rockstar’s western epic has sold "nearly" 64 million copies through March 2024, according to publisher Take-Two’s latest financial <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/75cef79f-3814-4a46-9748-53db35eda24a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>.

Factor in sales of the original Wii U release and that total rises to over 70 million, good for the sixth-best-selling game of all time.</p><h2>5. PUBG – 75 million</h2><p>Given its critical role in the rising popularity of battle royale games over the last five years, it’s unsurprising that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/05/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-review"><u>PUBG</u></a> has been such a massive sales success. Krafton creative director Dave Curd told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22821220/pubg-playerunknowns-battlegrounds-free-to-play-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Verge</u></a> it has sold 75 million copies of PUBG as of December 2021. That will likely be the shooter’s final sales tally, as it went <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pubg-battlegrounds-free-to-play-january-2022"><u>free to play</u></a> a month later in January 2022.</p><p>While free mobile downloads don't count toward its sales total, it's worth noting PUBG Mobile had been downloaded <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pubg-mobile-has-been-downloaded-literally-one-billion-times"><u>over 1 billion times</u></a> as of March 2021.</p><h2>4.

While most entries on this list were bundled with a console at some point, Wii Sports was bundled with the Wii in nearly all territories at launch. At nearly 83 million copies sold, it’s the top-selling single-platform exclusive of all time.</p><h2>3. Grand Theft Auto V – 200 million+</h2><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/16/grand-theft-auto-v-review"><u>Grand Theft Auto 5</u></a> is the best-selling console/PC-only game of all time (the top two entries on this list have mobile versions). Sales of Rockstar’s ambitious open-world adventure passed 200 million units by the end of July 2024. That number compiles the game’s sales totals across three console generations and PC.</p><p>GTA 5 was the fastest entertainment release from any medium to reach $1 billion in retail sales — and it’s since earned Rockstar and Take-Two <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/09/gta-5-has-made-more-money-than-any-film-book-or-game-says-analyst"><u>billions more,</u></a> making it the most profitable entertainment release <em>ever</em>, at least as of 2018.

                <p><em>PT, the playable teaser for Silent Hills, is celebrating its 10-year anniversary today, August 12, 2024. Below, we look back at how even as a demo, it impacted the survival horror genre.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Nobody thought much of a new horror title from an unknown studio called 7780, dropped in right as Hideo Kojima was finishing up on stage at Gamescom on August 12, 2014. Mostly, it was just cool they were introducing a game using a “playable teaser”--an idea that, by itself, does deserve to happen more often.Some hours later, it became clear August 12, 2014 was the day horror in video games would be changed for years to come.</p><p dir="ltr">On August 12, 2014, players who downloaded P.T. booted up the game and began their long walk to perdition, through a recursive hallway. The hallway was dusty and cluttered, but recognizably normal, aside from the radio broadcast describing the grisly murder-suicide of a father and his family. Walking through the door at the end of the L-shaped hallway brought them back to the beginning--over and over, but with small, unnerving changes. A bathroom door is cracked open, with a woman vaguely visible inside before it slams shut. The next time through, the bathroom is open, laying bare the bloody, screaming fetus in the sink. The next: A featureless woman stands in the hall before vanishing. The next: The radio broadcast tells you, yes you, to turn around.</p><p dir="ltr">Doing so puts the player face-to-disfigured-face with a woman named Lisa, who promptly murders you, only for you to wake up, yet again, in that hallway. The lights are now dimming. The squeak of the chandelier above replaces the radio broadcast. The pictures on the dresser are increasingly scratched and torn. Aside from the fetus, the horror was shockingly bloodless. And yet, it was terrifying gamers around the planet. P.T. wasn't just a playable teaser; it was an interactive, self-contained nightmare, and unlike anything else in gaming at that point.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite its creators thinking it would take weeks for the world to figure out the final, obtuse puzzle and get to the surprise waiting at the end of P.T., within mere hours, players had beaten the demo, and the cat was out of the bag. P.T. was, indeed, a teaser for a new Silent Hill, with Norman Reedus cast as the new protagonist, directed by Hideo Kojima, working hand-in-hand with Guillermo Del Toro (with Junji Ito giving an assist, something we wouldn’t learn till much later). The rest of the story is the stuff of legend now. It was a dream project, and the dream was dead a year later, when Kojima was fired from Konami under a cloud of internal drama.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="803995089" data-promo-id="0"

started on Death Stranding with Reedus (with new friend Del Toro lending his visage for the cast as well). Aside from the occasional pachinko machine, Konami would sit Smaug-style on the Silent Hill license until announcing a slew of new games in 2023: two of which have already released to poor reception, and another being a controversial Silent Hill 2 remake coming in October 2024. Meanwhile, Konami all but gave P.T. the full Ark of the Covenant treatment, pulling it from the PlayStation Store after Kojima’s firing, removing the ability to even redownload it, and deliberately locking it from even being played on the PlayStation 5. We were robbed of one of the most promising horror projects in gaming history. P.T. is now its only enduring remnant--a mere demo, and it’s technologically imprisoned on the PS4. But something terrible and wonderful has occurred in the decade since. Survival-horror had grown stagnant by 2014. With only a few notable exceptions--the Amnesia games, in particular--it was marked by a never-ending parade of cheap jump-scares and mindless gore, punctuated occasionally by a few excellent dramatic pieces using horror as a launchpad for other ideas, e.g. The Last of Us and Telltale’s Walking Dead. After 2014, the landscape would start developing an undercurrent. Fear looked and felt different. Horror in every moving medium has always leaned on disgust and surprise to be effective. After P.T., game developers learned a word rarely employed with any degree of effectiveness prior: dread.</p><p dir="ltr">Compared to the surprise of a creature jumping out at you from the shadows, or all the varying ways a human being could be vivisected without players growing numb to the experience, dread is one of those emotions that games didn’t lean on if they wanted to sell to a mass audience. It’s not cinematic or flashy, it’s difficult to convey in a trailer, and it requires time and patience that the vast majority of games teach players not to have. Suddenly, Hideo Kojima put that approach back in play on a grand scale. There were no musical stings. None of its horrors were telegraphed. There was simply the pervasive, inescapable knowledge that something here is wrong, and you are powerless to do anything but move forward.</p><p dir="ltr">Junji Ito’s involvement was the ace here. His best horror stories all feed on the idea of people compelled by unknowable forces into grotesque acts of human desecration. With only one way forward in P.T., once players stepped into the hallway, they belonged to the hallway. No UI. No life system. No narrators. No voiceovers. None of the safety rails to remind players they’re just playing a game. This is your hole. And in the years that followed, others would be emboldened to follow Kojima’s lead.</p><p dir="ltr">It started almost immediately after Konami had P.T. stricken from the PlayStation Store. Multiple projects sprang up, eager to recreate P.T. on PC, from respectable “inspired by”s like Lilith Ltd’s Allison Road and SadSquare’s Visage, to just direct recreations of the game like Unreal P.T. It was an act of artistic reverence that doubled, whether consciously or not, as an act of preservation. Recreation shortly gave way to elaboration, or at least a solemn attempt at it. The first to get major attention, 2016’s Layers of Fear, owed its mood and presentation to P.T., but went in its own direction with its story about a painter going insane in his own home while trying to paint his masterpiece.</p><p dir="ltr">While it had its share of mechanical imperfections, and was clumsy in how it explored its themes--a problem that’s only gotten worse for Bloober in subsequent titles-- it was at least thinking differently than its contemporaries. It was, at minimum, a story about a failing marriage, through indirect, distressing terms. Its developer got enough right where the particular solitary mood and tone became their bread and butter, aping and elaborating on it to the point that in 2024, Konami put them in charge of the Silent Hill 2 remake, a decision that… well, we’ll get back to that.</p><p dir="ltr">Ironically, maybe the most successful of P.T.’s ideological progeny is 2017’s Resident Evil 7. After that series hit a dead end of ideas with the ridiculous cartoon that was Resident Evil 6, they stripped the series down. It’s the survival-horror equivalent of Taylor Swift’s Folklore. Without its high-concept military fetishes to lean on, Resident Evil found itself leaning into its name a little more. Players were trapped in a house in Middle of Nowhere, Louisiana. It was a place of crumbling walls, rotting food, and dead bodies. Its inhabitants were a hostile, homicidal family empowered into eternal domestic abuse by the fact that they can no longer die.</p><p dir="ltr">Even when it engaged in its sillier moments--looking at you, chainsaw fight--there’s a very adult mean streak to it all. Resident Evil found the will to delve into its dark heart, delivering one of the most-frightening experiences in recent memory. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-7-producer-explains-what-the-full-ga/1100-6440991/">While its producer states</a> RE7 was on its path before P.T. released, it’s clear they were emboldened by its very existence. This was the right track, and while Village scaled things back somewhat amidst complaints that RE7 was actually too frightening, even that game found ways to keep the spirit alive; specifically, in the absolutely terrifying House Beneviento section.</p><p dir="ltr">This is all to say nothing of a slew of indie titles more than willing to eschew easy scares for unmooring the audience from reality, but not their emotions--a hallowed, elevated level of a horror encompassing everything from Red Candle’s heartbreaking but terrifying Detention to the abstract technological nightmare of Rose-Engine’s Signalis. Games had been playing this particular mode before. P.T.’s release gave those ideas license to kill. There is a hard question to ask, though: Would P.T. have had such an impact if Silent Hills actually happened? One of the unspoken things driving the boom of horror games is absolutely the fact that Konami never replaced Silent Hill with anything. While they were quick to try and squeeze a buck out of Metal Gear after Kojima was gone, Silent Hill only existed as a pachinko machine in P.T.’s wake.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike so many canceled projects, we actually got a taste of what the promised land could’ve been, and so much of the horror boom was in mourning and questioning an unfinished symphony. The closest analogue would be Alejandro Jodorowsky’s doomed adaptation of Dune inevitably inspiring the Lynch and Villeneuve iterations. What if that version of Dune came to fruition, as weird and ahead of its time as it was? Do we get Lynch’s messier version--and does either version go on to influence generations of creators in the same way?</p><p dir="ltr">It’s hard to even think about the game Silent Hills could’ve been, in the same way it’s hard to even think about Half-Life 3. Enough time has passed where the game in our heads is likely better than what would’ve gotten made, even with the pedigree it had. The Konami that would’ve delivered Silent Hills is the Konami that also allowed the series to sit dormant, and is currently the one letting Silent Hill 2 be remade, but by a studio that frequently can’t handle adult themes with the white gloves they deserve. Silent Hills, very possibly, could have been imprisoned in a very different way. As it stands now, P.T.’s black, unfathomable spirit roams free.</p><p dir="ltr">P.T. has haunted the horror genre in games for a decade. It's a creative black hole that hopes and dreams went into, and spat out radioactive evil, in search of a glory we will never experience, for better and for worse. That search, that need to hit those heights again, has led to a creative vacuum unlike anything else in media. A successful film or album--whether that success was creative or financial--will see imitators eager to cash in while its ideas are profitable. Those imitating or iterating on P.T. are caretakers of ideas that only ever existed for a year.</p>

			<p>The start of August saw the release of Magic: The Gathering – Bloomburrow, the seventh set of the year, and there’s plenty yet to come with the addition of Foundations to the release calendar in November pushing up the next set, Duskmourn, up to be just seven weeks away. But as anti-cute as Duskmourn promises to be, it’s time to appreciate the fluffy and adorable Bloomburrow.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tiny Tails, Big Adventure | Bloomburrow Official Trailer | Magic: The Gathering" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGNHxIP3PIo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bloomburrow is, as we said, incredibly cute. MTG is, at its core, a game where we visit different planes of existence that each have their own rules, lores, histories and so on. Bloomburrow’s shtick is that there are no humans, and any humans that do make their way here are turned into animalfolk for the duration of their visit. The majority of players seem to agree that this is a nice change of pace, but the impact that it has had on gameplay is unfortunate.</p>


<p>This focus on creature types creates what it known as a tribal set, which tends to be quite shallow when it comes to building your deck. This is certainly true when it comes to the draft experience – while experienced players can eek out win percentage by knowing when to pivot, the difficulty level of this set is really quite low, making it very accessible to newer players.</p>


<p>Each creature type in Bloomburrow represents two of Magic’s five colours. Otters, for example, are red and blue-aligned. Mice are Red and White, while squirrels are Green and Black. This is fantastic when it comes to new players learning the game —&nbsp;in Draft (where you pass packs of cards around the table, taking one at a time and adding it to your deck), you can simply pick all of the cards that say Lizard or Frog and put them into a deck, rather than stopping to read each card and see what it does — something vital to more complex sets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some animals are more equal than others – how very Animal Farm – and a clear tier list has emerged on Arena. Rabbit (Green-White) and mice decks are hyper-aggressive and win quickly, with slower otter decks struggling to keep up. When one deck is winning on turn three of four and you’re looking at cards you can’t cast until turn five, it feels pretty bad.</p>
<p>It’s rare this early into a set that the format feels like it has been ‘solved’ by players, but the replay value in Draft appears rather… limited.</p>

<p>So, how does Sealed shape up? This is a game of opening six packs at once and seeing what you have. The problem here is much more acute: you either have the cards for a hyper-aggressive deck or you lose. Without much synergy between species, this isn’t a format where you can simply chuck all of your blue cards into a pool and hope for the best. Your frogs will care about returning creatures to your hand, while your birds will care about what has flying and the otters are counting how many non-creature spells you are casting. You can get it to work if you try, but when others can quickly flood the board while you do backflips trying to get your deck to work, you’re fighting an uphill battle.</p>
<p>Fortunately, playing with these cards is more than just Draft and Sealed. Standard, for example, takes all of the Standard Sets (usually four per year, but five in 2024 thanks to Foundations) from the past three years and asks you to build the best deck you can. We’ve just had the rotation where old sets cycle out, which means that until late 2025, we’re looking at everything from Dominaria United onwards. For newer players and those who dip in and out, working with a shallower card pool is always helpful.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, you don’t want a set to come in and completely shake up Standard — this is a sign that the set is overpowered and something has gone horribly wrong. This happened for Modern in June with Modern Horizons 3, when <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/193/nadu-winged-wisdom">Nadu</a>’s release broke the format so badly that almost nobody wants to play.</p>

<p>So how has Bloomburrow affected Standard? While it hasn’t completely shaken up the format, it has had a sizeable impact. The top deck in the meta, Golgari Midrange, takes <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/blb/180/innkeepers-talent">a new card</a> and creates a turn-five instant win <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/115/vraska-betrayals-sting">Vraska, Betrayal’s Sting</a>. Mono-red Aggro (my current pet deck) is around 50% Bloomburrow cards (excluding lands), but that is an outlier since it’s focused on Mice — most decks at the top of the meta that aren’t Bloomburrow decks add a couple of cards and call it a day. And unlike modern, there’s no one deck that really dominates the meta with an outsized win rate. With Bloomburrow in the fold, Standard is quite a lot of fun at the moment, and in a really good place — helped of course by the recent rotation.</p>
<p>Modern won’t be affected by Bloomburrow until Nadu is gone, and even then its expansive card pool isn’t dented by this set –&nbsp;the relative power levels just don’t compare. Timeless and Explorer, by the same token, lie effectively untouched.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer The Farm 51 has announced&nbsp;<em>Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone</em>, a sequel to 2021's survival game <i>Chernobylite</i>. The sequel is set to debut on PC and consoles in 2025.</p>
<p>Per the game's official Steam page, you'll play as a planewalker (yes, that is someone who travels between parallel reality, so don't worry, you didn't turn over two pages at once) on the hunt for the mysterious titular resource.</p>
<p>You'll find yourself trapped in the Exclusion Zone and fighting for your life against hordes of monsters. The Farm 51 describes&nbsp;<em>Chernobylite 2</em>'s environment as a "big and realistic open world" which has been taken over by the Chernobylite resource, with the inhabitants of the Zone trying to fight back using "prototype technology".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-portal.jpg?itok=m-7BVX5I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-portal.jpg?itok=FkVyzvgl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone&nbsp;</em>promises to expand on the gameplay elements that made the first game so well-liked.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Chernobylite 2&nbsp;</em>will allow you to create your own character, and you'll be able to make choices about how your character approaches situations. The Farm 51 gives the examples of an "arrogant muscle man with a big sword" intimidating everyone he meets, as well as a "smart sniper who always finds the right arguments", so it sounds like you'll be able to diversify pretty extensively.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to choose whether you approach combat with melee weapons or firearms, and The Farm 51 says you can opt for stealth or "ask[ing] others for help" if you prefer. The planewalking system allows you to switch builds on the fly, so you can switch up your approach depending on what the situation calls for.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<em>Chernobylite 2</em>'s Steam page, the game will also feature a cast of party members to meet and talk with, each of whom is "a potential teacher, ready to impart their knowledge and skills". It sounds like The Farm 51 is taking a more RPG-centric approach to this followup.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-walkers.jpg?itok=EXA70SOO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-walkers.jpg?itok=7wImteoa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of the creatures you'll encounter in&nbsp;<em>Chernobylite 2&nbsp;</em>look pretty creepy.</figcaption></figure><p>Between everything outlined above, a base you can expand, and factions you'll meet (and potentially influence),&nbsp;<em>Chernobylite 2&nbsp;</em>sounds like a significantly more ambitious undertaking than <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/chernobylite">the first game</a>, which was already pretty expansive.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Chernobylite 2&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2075100/Chernobylite_2_Exclusion_Zone/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a> and "consoles" (which presumably means PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, at the very least) next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>The survival genre is undoubtedly one that’s overflowing with new projects, and most of them wind up flopping hard. But with an IP like this, how could Terminator: Survivors follow suit? It’s likely to make it big in the scene, but we’ll have to wait a bit longer. So, do we know the Terminator: Survivors release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-terminator-survivors-come-out">When Does Terminator: Survivors Come Out?</h2>



<p>Initially, Terminator: Survivors was scheduled to launch on October 24. Unfortunately for every one of us excited fans, Nacon revealed it’s delaying the game until sometime in 2025. They said:</p>



<p>“Dear Survivors,</p>



<p>We are working very hard to bring the post-apocalyptic world of Terminator to life. Our goal is to create a deep immersive experience where each decision you make is crucial to your surviving.</p>



<p>Over the past few months, we’ve been really impressed by your enthusiasm and amazed by the response to our announcements, and we know how eagerly fans are awaiting Terminator: Survivors. To realize our vision, we need some additional time. Thus, we will be pushing the launch to 2025.</p>



<p>We know that this will be a disappointment to many, but we want to do right by this universe, its fans, and our community. In the long term, we believe this is the right call.</p>



<p>We are grateful for your understanding and support.</p>



<p>We’ll be back.”</p>



<p>Sadly, they don’t even provide a release window for the game. So, for the time being, we don’t know the official release date of Terminator: Survivors. The moment one pops up, we’ll let you know!</p>

<h2 id="h-what-systems-does-terminator-survivors-support">What Systems Does Terminator: Survivors Support?</h2>



<p>Once it launches worldwide, you can play Terminator: Survivors on PC, first and foremost, but eventually on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. For now, Nacon is focusing all of its efforts on the PC (Steam) release of the game, which will hit sometime in 2025. Once it’s out, they’ll look to current-gen consoles for a follow-up launch there.</p>
