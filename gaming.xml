            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blades-of-fire">Blades Of Fire</a> is the latest dark fantasy smackeroo from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/castlevania-lords-of-shadow">Castlevania: Lords Of Shadow</a> developers MercurySteam. It takes place in a world where steel is a divine substance passed down to humanity by the mysterious Forgers. Some sinister young queen has, however, cast a spell that turns everybody else’s steel into stone, granting her followers a near-monopoly on all the butt-kicking.</p>
<p>Playing as bleak and burly beardyman Aran “We Have Kratos At Home” de Lira, your job is to chase down that queen, murder her minions, and craft a whole bunch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darksiders">Darksiders</a>-esque weaponry. Aran is accompanied by Adso, a juvenile sidekick in the vein of Atreus, who catalogues the game’s “over 50” enemy types and can also translate lore written in the ancient Forger language.</p><!--more-->

<p>I’m keen on what I’ve seen of Blades Of Fire’s geography, which is stuffed full of ruined palaces, enchanted trees and such. I’m much less keen on Aran – he’s got a tragic past he “refuses to let define him entirely”, but any empathy I feel is sabotaged by the fact that Aran’s default outfit consists of at least eight belts. I’m undecided, meanwhile, on the combat. It’s described as “unique”, with controller buttons corresponding to body parts, but come now, MercurySteam, the concept of limb-targeting is literally as old as I am.</p>
<p>Ah, if only there were some kind of demo I could play to work through my misgivings. Oh yeah, that’s right – publishers 505 have <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/blades-of-fire-demo-78b5d3">just released a demo on the Epic Games Store</a>. Way to smother the lede, Evans-Thirlwell!</p>
<p>As you might deduce from the title, Blades Of Fire is heavy on the blacksmithing. You’ll collect Forge Scrolls to develop your crafting capabilities. There are 30 of these scrolls, plus seven weapon families, at least three types of damage in the shape of stabbing, slashing and bludgeoning, and an unspecified quantity of different raw materials. All of which allows for “almost infinite weapon combinations”. Please, PRs, I beg of you. Please allow the ridiculous phrase “almost infinite” to die. I hate getting all tangled up in self-contradictions when I’m trying to count broadswords.</p>
<p>Blades Of Fire is due out on 22nd May, so now is a fine time to sample that demo. Let us know if you do. Also, let us know what your preferred maximum belt count is for a videogame protagonist. Seriously, eight belts - that’s like, four more than Voldo in most Soulcalibur games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks is exiting early access and getting its 1.0 release on May 22nd, PLAION and Wired Productions has confirmed. The big announcement is that when the game launches, all microtransactions will be removed. Players who have been part of the early access period and bought the in game currency will be able to spend it through the in game store. The in game store is not going to be available for those who did not take part in early access. The general DLC model will replace microtransactions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks – Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLRTsjrCP00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Game Director Chris Mallinson, of developer Caged Element, said, <em>“We set out to make the Orkiest of Warhammer 40,000 games, and through our early access period we’ve had thousands of people help us achieve that goal – along with our previous publisher PLAION. Now with Wired Productions picking up the torch, we’re launching out of early access and into version 1.0 with a different approach that we think players will really appreciate and enjoy. We thank both partners for their dedication to the game, along with Games Workshop. We’re of course very happy to be back with our pals at Wired Productions, since we worked with them before on GRIP. Now enuff o’ dat, on to da WAAAGH!!!”</em></p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:154">Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks was going to be a free to play title funded by microtransactions, though that has obviously changed. The main move to being a paid title means that Caged Element can include player hosted games with custom rules, private games, a free roam mode, and remove the third party account requirement. As the game transitions from free to play to paid, the game will be offline from May 20th to May 22nd. The launch price will be $15.99, 15.99€ and £12.79.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-swearing-darth-vader-ai-fixed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An exploit that caused&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s new Darth Vader AI to swear at players has already been fixed, so if you were hoping to hear some fruity language from everyone's favorite Sith Lord, you might be disappointed.</p>

<p>Earlier today, a clip showing Australian streamer Loserfruit prompting the game's new AI-powered Darth Vader to swear at her (as preserved <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923397890241593822" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here by user Cordial</a>) went viral. In the clip, the Vader AI can be heard clearly dropping an F-bomb. He might be evil, but that's probably not what Epic intended.</p>

<p>Following the clip's proliferation, Epic <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923397890241593822" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">responded</a> to Cordial in order to confirm that the issue "shouldn't happen again", since a hotfix has been pushed. If you ask me, it would have been infinitely funnier if they'd kept the swearing in the game, but I guess we can't have nice things anymore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-swearing-darth-vader-ai-grievous.jpg?itok=m4uO1d19 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-swearing-darth-vader-ai-grievous.jpg?itok=6wKLtCv7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The now-not-swearing&nbsp;Darth Vader AI is part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>season.</figcaption></figure><p>According to an official <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/disney#darth-vader-faq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a>, Vader's dialogue is generated by Google Gemini 2.0 Flash, and the audio, which is clearly based on original actor James Earl Jones' voice, is created by the ElevenLabs Flash 2.5 model.</p>

<p>Vader only understands English (and not Galactic Basic, weirdly enough), and if you're a minor, you'll need your parent or guardian to approve voice or written communication with Vader via the parental controls section of the game.</p>

<p>The character can be spoken to by the first team to recruit Vader in either the standard Battle Royale mode or its Zero Build alternative, and he's also available in the Ranked play mode, so even if you're trying to sweat up a storm, you can still take some time to chat with Ani (spoiler alert).</p>




<p>The Darth Vader AI is part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-star-wars-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow">latest&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>collaboration</a>, which also brings the likes of Emperor Palpatine, Poe Dameron, and, er, Darth Jar Jar as skins for players to terrify their foes with.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on iOS, then all of this is moot, at least for now; earlier today, Epic announced that Apple has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block" rel="nofollow">blocked the release of the game</a> on iOS in the US and Europe, which means it's currently offline on the platform "worldwide".</p>

A mere vessel without a soul. Someone like Matt Sloan (voice of Darth Vader in various video games and shows) carries more sentiment to this role than an AI ever could.

"Sure, Darth may comment on sweaty players or comment on his hatred for sand, but is that worth [it] in [the] long-term? Is this small addition really needed to enhance our experience in the bigger sacrifice of polluting our world?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nothing in this world is certain, except death, taxes, and the internet making AI racist," added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1ko0lla/comment/msmm0eq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another</u></a>, while one simply <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1ko0lla/comment/msmofg9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: "Leave it to the internet to take a cool thing and ruin it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is probably a timely opportunity to remind parents that players under 13 or their country’s age of digital consent, whichever is higher, will need their parent or guardian’s permission to talk with Darth Vader. You can approve or deny Darth's shenanigans by heading to Epic Games' parental controls and selecting “allow voice and written communication with AI Features."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

It's unclear if the port will release digitally-only or be sold as a physical edition, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We considered Red Dead Redemption 2 a "masterpiece" when it released in 2018, awarding it a 10/10. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review"><u>IGN's Red Dead Redemption 2 review</u></a> said: "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open-world ode to the outlaw era."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps red Dead Redemption 2 coming to Switch 2 wouldn't come as a huge surprise. In a Q&amp;A with investors following Take-Two's most recent financial results, CEO Strauss Zelnick answered a question about the publisher's support of the Switch 2 by saying he felt "great optimism" for Nintendo's new platform. In fact, he said Nintendo's support of third-party publishers this time around was better than it had been in the past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're launching four titles with Nintendo Switch 2, and that's I think a bigger array of releases than we've ever offered before with a new Nintendo platform," he said. "Historically, being a third-party in the Nintendo business has been a bit challenging. I think Nintendo has been very forthcoming in addressing that. And we're stepping up too, because we have great optimism for the platform. In terms of what we would bring to any platform, we address it on a case-by-case basis, we obviously want to be where the consumers are. But we would not necessarily bring every title to every platform. There are also great catalog opportunities as well."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Take-Two is bringing Civilization 7 (June 5, launch day), the NBA 2K and WWE 2K series (unclear which games, or when), and Borderlands 4 (September 12). Those admittedly aren't surprising inclusions, as Take-Two was already publishing all four franchises on the Nintendo Switch. But Zelnick's quote does make it sound like the door could be open in the future to other releases, especially from Take-Two's back catalog. GTA 6 probably won't make the cut, but perhaps GTA V or red Dead Redemption 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

The game’s director Nate Fox recently talked about his commitment to bringing the same kind of cultural sensitivity to the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, emphasizing the importance of research, respect, and listening to cultural advisors.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Ghost of Tsushima had us take on the role of Jin Sakai as he defends Tsushima from a Mongol invasion in the 13th century, Ghost of Yotei skips forward to 1603, where we play as female warrior Atsu in Ezo (modern day Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost main island). She is out to wreak vengeance on a band of outlaws who murdered her family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ghost of Tsushima paid homage to classic samurai movies (with its black-and-white “Kurosawa mode” named after legendary Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa), so it will be interesting to see if Ghost of Yotei takes any influence from Japan’s many movies featuring tough female warriors exacting revenge, like the Lady Snowblood series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/15/ghost-of-yotei-how-sucker-punch-chose-hokkaido-for-the-games-setting/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation Blog post,</u></a> Ghost of Tsushima and Ghost of Yotei director Nate Fox talked about how the research trips to Japan have not only been the “best part” of working on the games, they have also been highly inspiring and eye-opening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Everyone from Sucker Punch that went on those reference gathering trips came back to the studio with a driving passion to bring a sense of authenticity to our fictional depiction of these real life places," he commented, emphasizing the importance of getting the feel for a place in person, and then using this experience to craft an original, in-game environment that matches the spirit of the real location.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/d_ishidate/status/1792615489707147300" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Comments</u></a> made by Ghost of Tsushima’s English-to-Japanese localization producer Daisuke “Dice” Ishidate on Twitter / X back in May 2024 echo these sentiments: “The Ghost of Tsushima development team told me that 'we want to create enjoyable entertainment, not a history lesson...' I think that maybe the reason for Ghost of Tsushima’s success is not objective historical accuracy but its subjective period drama-like style (and flair).” (As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ghost-of-tsushima-japanese-localization-producer-responds-to-assassins-creed-shadows/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Ghost of Tsushima read like a thoughtfully researched love letter to historical Japan with a dash of classic samurai movie thrown in. What inaccuracies it has were mostly artistic license used to create a more entertaining and atmospheric experience for the player, and to make the game more accessible to wider audiences. For its depiction of samurai, Ghost of Tsushima tapped into later centuries and the pop culture image of samurai as katana wielders, when they predominantly used bow and arrow in the 13th century (archery expert Sensei Ishikawa is perhaps the closest character to the samurai of that period). As for accessibility, Jin can compose haiku (the most widely recognized type of Japanese poem), however the haiku form didn’t develop until centuries later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Ghost of Tsushima’s towns, shrines, and environments do feel like experiencing a nature hike through Japan from the comfort of your sofa, the game took some liberties in allowing the player to experience all Japan’s seasons. The real Tsushima is subtropical, located between South Korea and Japan’s southernmost main island of Kyushu. The heavy snow that Jin encounters in Act 3 is anachronistic, as the real Tsushima is too far south to experience such weather. However, this gave players the chance to experience a sort of virtual postcard of the most iconic and famous aspects of each season in Japan. Wandering the game’s fictional Tsushima, the player moves between different seasons: abundant pink cherry blossoms bringing a splash of spring to your screen one second, only to be replaced by orangey brown autumn leaves when you enter another area.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Best PS4, Xbox One Games to Play on PS5 and Xbox Series X</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Fox explained, the digital Tsushima was never intended to be a perfect recreation of the island, but it was meant to faithfully capture the spirit of the place. In the PlayStation blog post, he commented: “We felt that by listening to our cultural advisors and by doing research, we could deliver a respectful representation of what made Tsushima so special... For Ghost of Yotei, we’re doing the same thing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fox revealed that Sony picked Hokkaido for Ghost of Yotei’s setting because it is “unbelievably beautiful.” Upon visiting the place, Fox recounted that the dev team were struck by the contrast between the majestic views and the potential threat posed by the bears that inhabit Hokkaido’s Shiretoko National Park. “A perfect marriage of beauty and danger, that was the exact feeling we wanted for our game,” Fox enthused. Added to this, in 1603 when Ghost of Yotei is set, Hokkaido was a sparsely populated, harsh northern island, which the developers felt fit with the tale of a female warrior so hell-bent on revenge that the locals start to believe she is a demon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, official information about Ghost of Yotei has yet to mention how and if it will address Hokkaido’s complicated history of eventual colonization by Japan. How will Ghost of Yotei depict Hokkaido’s indigenous people, the Ainu, and their language and culture? Will it portray tensions between Japanese and Ainu populations? This could be a difficult part of the game to get right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After release, Ghost of Tsushima met with mostly positive reception from Japanese gaming media and people, gaining a perfect score from Famitsu and winning two awards at the Japan Game Awards 2021. It has also been embraced by the real life island of Tsushima, with its popularity encouraging more tourists to visit the island. The game’s director Nate Fox and creative director Jason Connell were named cultural ambassadors to the island, for their role in drawing people’s attention to Tsushima and its history. If Ghost of Yotei becomes as successful as its predecessor, it might also bring more overseas tourists to Hokkaido. However, they should probably make sure they are better prepared than <a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/japan-life/news-and-opinion/british-couple-rescued-from-mount-yotei/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the British couple who recently got stranded on Mount Yotei</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-board-game-buying-guide<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When Undaunted: Normandy hit the shelves in 2019, it was an instant smash hit. It's a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games"><u>deck-building game</u></a>, a genre where you start with a small deck of weak cards that you can upgrade and tweak during play until you’ve got a much more powerful, reliable engine. But its genius is to twin these mechanics with a squad-level tactical <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war board game</a>. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soldier cards let you move and fire with the matching unit on the modular board in pursuit of scenario goals, while officer cards fine-tune your deck, allowing you to focus on particular squads. It's a marriage made in heaven, giving you strategic levers in deck construction, tactical thrills as you maneuver for position on the board, while still basically feeling like a simple simulation of combat where officers bolster the morale and makeup of squads under their command.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Undaunted: Normandy's success has led to a slew of games using the same basic system, which now ranges across a much wider variety of settings and complexity levels - even into outer space with a sci-fi variant. Undaunted is a great franchise, and this buying guide is here to help you decide which of its many titles is right for you.</p><p id="undaunted-normandy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Normandy">Undaunted: Normandy</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221009"><div id="221009" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Normandy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: People who want the simplest, fastest version and don’t object to the military theme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first game in the series sets the action in the days after the allied invasion of Normandy during World War 2. While none of its predecessors are particularly complex, it is nevertheless the most accessible game in the series, focusing entirely on different types of infantry units and with a limited range of quick-playing maps. While that has an obvious attraction for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games">casual play</a>, it can feel a bit repetitive if you want to commit to playing all the scenarios in the box. It also has the most realistic historical bent apart from Undaunted: Stalingrad which might appeal to those interested in the military aspects of the series, but which some may find off putting. </p></div><p id="undaunted-north-africa"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: North Africa">Undaunted: North Africa</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221010"><div id="221010" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: North Africa</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: Players who want to see vehicles in their wargames, or who like cinematic action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most frequent asks from fans of the original was the addition of vehicles, and publisher Osprey Games delivered in this sequel, adding armored cars and small tanks to the mix. While these are governed by the same simple card play that drives all the units, they do necessitate a degree of extra rules overhead to cover the difference between anti-armor and small arms fire. As well as moving the setting to the North African theater, this also turns down the scale with the squad-level counters of the original turning into individual combatants. This gives the game a more gung-ho, cinematic feel, heightened by the choice to feature the allied troops as the Long Range Desert Group, the forerunner to Britain’s famous SAS. </p></div><p id="undaunted-reinforcements"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Reinforcements">Undaunted: Reinforcements</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221011"><div id="221011" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Reinforcements</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: Hardcore fans, gamers who want to solo Normandy or North Africa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many fans of military games like to be able to play solo, even if it means playing both sides themselves, but Undaunted’s tense initiative bid system made this difficult. As a result, a key draw for this expansion, which – unusually – also supports both the first two games, is the addition of a complex but very effective set of AI routines to allow challenging <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a> play. Each scenario in both the original boxes has unique routines tailored for each unit, meaning the automated opposition is very effective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also new units and scenarios for both of the original games, as well as an expanded box that allows you to store both of those titles together. As good as all these features are, however, they’re only really for hardcore fans. You have to own both of the previous games and be interested in solo play to get the most out of this expansion.</p></div><p id="undaunted-stalingrad"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Stalingrad">Undaunted: Stalingrad</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221012"><div id="221012" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Stalingrad</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: Those willing to put in repeat plays for the best Undaunted experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both of the initial games could be played in a loose form of campaign, progressing through the scenarios and keeping a tally of who won what. But Stalingrad kicks things up a notch, featuring a branching campaign with narrative elements and in which the results of each scenario carry into the next. Soldiers gain experience, or carry injuries, while the city itself is slowly reduced to rubble in which troops can find cover or build fortifications. The result is an absolute triumph, earning a 10/10 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-stalingrad-board-game-review"><u>Undaunted: Stalingrad review</u></a> by retaining all the great things that made those first two games such hits, while adding yet another strategic layer to ponder and wrapping the whole thing in a dramatic, unfolding story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this is the best game in the series, beware: you and an opponent will need to commit to a lot of repeat games to get the most out of it. </p></div><p id="undaunted-battle-of-britain"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Battle of Britain">Undaunted: Battle of Britain</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221013"><div id="221013" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Battle of Britain</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: Undaunted veterans who want a novel take on familiar mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a major departure from the infantry combat that characterizes most of the Undaunted games, Battle of Britain takes the action to the skies. While the core deck building remains unchanged, the way units behave on the board is very different, reflecting the fact that airplanes can fly! Most notably, units now have a facing and they have to move each time their card comes up, meaning you have to plan more carefully, trying to set up traps for your opponent in the likely direction of travel, just like a real dogfight. However, deck construction just doesn’t fit the theme quite as well as it does in terms of having officer cards direct the combat on the ground but, despite that shortcoming, the game is still fun and full of thrills and, most importantly, feels fresh and different compared to its peers in the franchise.</p></div><p id="undaunted-2200-callisto"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted 2200: Callisto">Undaunted 2200: Callisto</h2></p><div catalogid="ebe477e2-2f63-4623-a7f4-efd546c7aa21" id="221014"><div id="221014" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted 2200: Callisto</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Best for</strong>: People who want the action and strategy, but not the historical military theme</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the success of the original game, a growing body of gamers started asking the designers for a version that didn’t glory in the horrors of real-world warfare. Their answer was to move the game to outer space in this sci-fi version. It’s a fantastic translation as we explained in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-2200-callisto-board-game-review"><u>Undaunted 2200 review</u></a>: capturing all the great stuff that have made the franchise such a hit, but also learning lessons to improve on the previous entries. There are vehicles to pilot, greater asymmetry between the two factions, and a more varied mix of scenarios to enjoy. So if the military focus of the previous titles put you off, this is a fantastic alternative, and even if you’re not bothered by the theme then, mechanically speaking, it's the best of the series after Stalingrad. </p></div><p id="promo-scenarios"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Promo scenarios">Undaunted Promo Scenarios</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the series might be interested to learn that, in the years since its release, there have been a number of additional scenarios published in magazines and given away at conventions. Over time the publisher has made most of these available to <a href="https://www.ospreypublishing.com/us/discover/gaming-resources/board-card-games/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>download for free on its website</u></a>, so fill your combat boots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance writer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

A key clarifier here is what Take-Two means by "in earnest." We don't know for sure, but it's likely this is in reference to full production as opposed to early-stage development. Oftentimes in game development, smaller teams map out projects before ramping up.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>GTA V was released in September 2013 for PS3 and Xbox 360 and the game grew substantially over the years with more and more content and features for the uber-popular GTA Online mode. Additionally, Rockstar's teams brought GTA V to PS4 and Xbox One in November 2014 and the PC in April 2015. Versions of the game for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S came out in 2022. In total, GTA V has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-has-sold-an-absolutely-absurd-amount-of-copies-in-the-last-three-months/1100-6531582/" data-ref-id="1100-6531582">sold more than 215 million copies. </a></p><p>Another key thing to know is that for the past 10+ years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-more-than-1000-people-made-gtav/1100-6415330/" data-ref-id="1100-6415330">Rockstar's teams across the world have worked in tandem</a> on whatever the studio is making next, and this likely applies to GTA 6 as well.</p><p>Also during the earnings briefing, Take-Two said the "ambition and complexity" of GTA 6 is greater than any past Rockstar release. CEO Strauss Zelnick said GTA 6 was delayed from Fall 2025 to May 2026 due in part to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-reacts-to-grand-theft-auto-6-delay/1100-6531597/" data-ref-id="1100-6531597">a need for additional polish</a> as part of Rockstar's effort to achieve "perfection."</p><p>"In this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported of course that approach," he said. "While of course, delays pain me--how could they not?--the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection."</p><p>Addressing the long wait for GTA 6, Zelnick told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-id-argue-rockstar-has" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> that while fans have been waiting more than a decade for the next entry in the numbered series, he believes Rockstar's teams have been giving fans what amounts to "a new Grand Theft Auto release" multiple times per year via GTA Online.</p><p>"Rockstar has been supplying content to Grand Theft Auto Online, some of which is so robust that if you go back 15 years, it would have counted as a standalone title," he said. "One could really argue that Rockstar has been putting out a new Grand Theft Auto release a couple of times a year. Same thing holds true for Red Dead Online, which has been on-going. And in the most recent quarter, Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online has exceeded expectations."</p><p>GTA 6 launches on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. In other Rockstar news, it's been reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-feels-really-good-about-switch-2-amid-reports-of-rdr-2-port/1100-6531595/" data-ref-id="1100-6531595">the studio is bringing Red Dead Redemption 2 to Switch 2. </a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/avowed-update-1-4-brings-arachnophobia-mode-to-the-living-lands-promises-new-game-in-future/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Obsidian has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avowed">Avowed</a> Update 1.4, with an arachnophobia mode to turn all those eight-legged frights into strange colourful blobs with floating swords, while also giving a preview of what’s coming down the line with a roadmap.</p>



<p>I actually think that’s more freaky than a spider, but then I’m not aracnophobic…</p>
<p>Update 1.4’s other bullet points include enhancement for map exploration when you visit new areas, critter loot drops, passing time at camp and more.</p>
<p>The complete patch notes on the Obsidian <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134717-patch-140-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forums</a>, but there’s the highlights below.</p>

<p>Looking to the future, and you can expect improvements to cooking and crafting, more NPC abilities and behaviours, new unique weapons and custom map markers this summer. You’ll have to wait longer to the autumn for New Game Plus, a photo mode, new weapon type and more character customisations, but they’ll be welcome additions.</p>

<p>Beyond that, Obsidian is working to localise the game for Korea and Japan, as well as improve the French localisations.</p>
<p>Here’s the cliff notes for Avowed Update 1.4:</p>
<p><strong>Map Exploration Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once most of a map’s accessible areas are explored, the fog of war will now fully clear.</li>
<li>Entering a city on an overland map (e.g. Northern Paradis in Dawnshore) will now reveal that portion of the map.</li>
<li>Increased radius for fog clearing as you explore.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Critter Loot Drops</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Critters can now be defeated—and may drop loot!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Party Camp Feature</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Players can now wait at the Party Camp to advance time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improved Soul Pod Functionality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Soul Pods now dispel illusions (except for Ryngrim’s entrance, which still requires Yatzli’s help).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Settings Options</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Chests now optionally appear on the minimap.</li>
<li>Power attacks with the Bow and Arquebus can now be canceled with a new setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avowed has been one of many highlights for Xbox and PC gamers this year (and PlayStation, to be fair), as Microsoft’s many studios and subsidiaries deliver on long-awaited projects, and as they’ve continually stuffed games into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>. “Avowed is an incredible RPG,” we said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/">our review</a>. “Its vibrant world and stellar cast make every moment a joy to take part in, enhanced by a script that gives equal measure to drama, action and humour. Coming hot on the heels of Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, Microsoft’s software revival is well underway.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-acknowledges-stolen-marathon-art-promises-thorough-review.1191372/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie has acknowledged that some of the art featured in the game was stolen from an artist who didn't work on the game, promising a "thorough review" of&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s "in-game assets" as a result.</p>

<p>For context, artist Antireal <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">alleged</a> yesterday that&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s environments are "covered with assets lifted from poster designs [she] made in 2017", posting a number of examples of areas in which&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s art was lifted from her own&nbsp;as proof.</p>

<p>In response to Antireal's allegations, Bungie, <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posting</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>development team's account, confirmed that "a former Bungie artist included [Antireal's designs] in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bungie-marathon-artwork-stolen-antireal.jpg?itok=tf1fookp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bungie-marathon-artwork-stolen-antireal.jpg?itok=OY9DC327 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>has a pretty distinctive art style, but not all of that style is Bungie's, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217325722874199" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">thread</a>, Bungie says its current art team didn't know about the artwork's theft, and that the studio is "still reviewing how this oversight occurred".</p>

<p>As a result of the stolen artwork's discovery, Bungie says it will now conduct a "thorough review" of&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s asset pool, specifically assets created or contributed by the former artist in question (who isn't named, for obvious reasons).</p>

<p>Additionally, Bungie says it will be "implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions", although I'm honestly pretty shocked those checks weren't in place to begin with and that something so egregious could get through unnoticed.</p>

<p>The studio says it's "reached out" to Antireal to talk about the issue and is "committed to do right by the artist", as well as by "all artists who contribute" to Bungie's games.</p>




<p>Bungie's lax security when it comes to spotting stolen artwork is even more upsetting given that this isn't the studio's first time being accused of stealing from fans. In 2021, Bungie <a href="https://x.com/Cozmo23/status/1442534201165635587" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">used a fan depiction</a> of one of its characters in promo material, subsequently apologizing and crediting the correct artist.</p>

<p>After that incident, in 2023, a&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>fan claimed Bungie had stolen their art for an in-game cutscene, an allegation that Bungie itself subsequently <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1671927000498597888" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed was true</a>. Then, in 2024, artist Tofu <a href="https://x.com/Tofu_Rabbit/status/1833851336607101076" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">accused</a> Bungie of stealing a weapon design they had made in 2015, and again, Bungie copped to doing so.</p>

<p>I don't want to cast aspersions, but I also don't know how many times something has to happen before it can be considered a pattern. Let's just say I wouldn't be surprised if Bungie was caught out for stealing fan artwork again before&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is released.</p>

<p>If this whole thing hasn't left a bad taste in your mouth and you still want to check out&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, you can do so when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marathon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/marathon/9pb32dkqkzdq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on September 23rd.</p>

In her thread, Fern posted side-by-side comparisons of her work and what appears in <em>Marathon</em>. She also made a post on X in 2024 saying that she <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1798098416314265905">hid a reference to the Ctrl + Alt + Del webcomic “Loss” in her designs</a>. A year later, a player posted a screenshot from the game that includes a coded reference to the comic.</p><p>Bungie says that it was made aware of the issue and determined the art team did not know the artwork was stolen and that a former employee was responsible for adding the assets. The studio also said it reached out to Fern to discuss the matter and that it is, “committed to doing right by the artist.” </p><p>This is not the first time an artist’s work has been used for a Bungie product without their permission. In 2024, Bungie agreed to compensate the artist Tofu Rabbit after she discovered that the design for a <em>Destiny 2</em>-themed Nerf Gun <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/13/24243893/destiny-2-nerf-ace-of-spades-stole-artists-work">was ripped directly from her fanart</a>. Bungie has also been accused of using other creators’ <em>Destiny 2</em> fanart for references and cutscenes without permission.</p><p>Bungie says it’s reviewing its in-game assets especially those done by former employees to ensure this won’t happen again (or again, or again).</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/667919/8bitdo-all-button-hitbox-leverless-arcade-controller<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Four years after the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21402897/8bitdo-wireless-arcade-stick-nintendo-switch-pc-price">released its first wireless arcade-style controller</a>, 8BitDo is debuting a new version that’s almost one-third as thick as the original. Its new Arcade Controller managed to slim down by ditching the original’s joystick and focusing on only buttons in a unique layout. Often referred to as a leverless controller, or Hitbox after <a href="https://www.hitboxarcade.com/products/hit-box">the company that helped popularize this style</a>, 8BitDo’s includes a dynamic button layout that swaps labels at the turn of a dial.</p><p>The new 8BitDo Arcade Controller is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R4XTQX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">available for preorder</a> starting today for $89.99 and is expected to officially release on July 15th, 2025. The standard version is compatible with the Nintendo Switch and Windows PCs. 8BitDo also has an additional all-black version with adjustable glowing RGB accents that’s designed for the Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Windows, but it’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7RMB4RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">slightly more expensive at $99.99</a>. However, both are much cheaper than competitors’ offerings, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kitsune-All-Button-Arcade-Controller-Desktop/dp/B0CCX2DMXV?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Razer’s $300 Kitsune</a>.</p><p>Leverless controllers may seem counterintuitive to those who’ve spent their lives gaming with analog joysticks or four-way directional pads, but they’re becoming popular among fans of fighting games where lightning-fast reaction times can sometimes be a deciding factor in who wins. Although it seems miniscule, playing with only buttons can eliminate the time it takes to move a joystick until an input is registered by a game, potentially giving a player a competitive advantage. At the same time, trying to aim in a fast-paced FPS game using four buttons will probably put you at a disadvantage, so this controller style isn’t for everyone.</p><p>Measuring in at 16mm thick, 8BitDo’s new Arcade Controller connects to the Switch over Bluetooth and to PCs using an included 2.4GHz USB dongle. For minimal latency, it can also connect to either with a USB-C cable. Its 1,000mAh rechargeable battery is enough for up to 20 hours of gameplay when using a wireless connection.</p><p>The controller’s 16 action buttons use Kailh Wizard low-profile mechanical switches out of the box, but you can swap those with alternative switches if you prefer a different feel. Four of the buttons, labeled P1 through P4, are programmable and utilize bean-shaped button caps to differentiate their feel. They can also be swapped out with included lie-flat alternatives, making them even easier to distinguish.</p><p>A toggle switch flips the controller’s button layout between an S-Input mode for the Switch and X-Input mode for PCs, which also swaps the illuminated labels automatically. And as with many of 8BitDo’s recent gamepad releases, its new Arcade Controller supports the company’s Ultimate Software, which lets you customize the button mappings or make complex macros that can be assigned to its four programmable buttons.</p><p>The 8BitDo Arcade Controller for Xbox also has a few key differences (besides the all-black finish and glowing RGB accent lighting around 12 of its buttons). There’s no Bluetooth connectivity — only 2.4GHz or a USB cable — and the battery is quite a bit larger at 3,000mAh, which bumps wireless playtime to 20 hours with lighting on or 40 with it off.</p><p>Only P1 and P2 can be reprogrammed. It also doesn’t offer the ability to switch the layout of its buttons. Instead, the gamepad’s dial controls volume, which will help if you use the included headphone jack for streaming gameplay and chat audio to a wired headset.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/pokemon-scarlet-violet-frame-rate-fixes-are-among-the-switch-2s-free-game-updates/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When Nintendo took the wraps off the Switch 2 in early April, it announced that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/some-original-switch-games-will-run-better-on-switch-2-some-wont-run-at-all/">around a dozen first-party Switch games</a> would be getting free updates that would add some Switch 2-specific benefits to older games running on the new console. We could safely assume that these updates wouldn't be as extensive as the $10 and $20 paid upgrade packs for games like&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild</em> or&nbsp;<em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>, but Nintendo's page didn't initially provide any game-specific details.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/">updated its support page</a> with more game-by-game details about what players of these older games can expect on the new hardware. The baseline improvement for most games is "improved image quality" and optimizations for the Switch 2's built-in display, but others include support for GameShare multiplayer, support for the new Joy-Cons' mouse controls, support for HDR TVs, and other tweaks.</p>
<p>The most significant of the announced updates are frame rate improvements for&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, the main-series <em>Pokémon</em> games released in late 2022. Most latter-day Switch games suffered from frame rate dips here and there, as newer games outstripped the capabilities of a low-power tablet processor that had already been a couple of years old when the Switch launched in 2017. But the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> performance problems were so pervasive and widely commented-upon that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/nintendo-is-working-on-improvements-to-latest-pokemon-games-after-buggy-launch/">Nintendo released a rare apology</a> promising to improve the game post-release. Subsequent patches helped somewhat but could never deliver a consistently smooth frame rate; perhaps new hardware will finally deliver what software patches couldn't.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">8BitDo has revealed a pair of exciting new controllers for fighting game enthusiasts. Launching July 15 for Switch/PC and Xbox/PC, the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F7R4XTQX,B0F7RMB4RH&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Arcade Controller</a></strong> is a thin, leverless fight pad. All-button arcade "sticks" have become quite popular in the fighting game scene in recent years; some players find that the dedicated directional and jump buttons make it easier to hit precise inputs for special moves and combos. However, leverless models tend to be expensive, especially if you're looking for a reliable and customizable device. At $90-$100, 8BitDo's Arcade Controller will be the most affordable option from a major brand, and both models offer wireless connections on their respective platforms as well as PC. You can preorder the 8BitDo Arcade Controller for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R4XTQX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch/PC</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7RMB4RH?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox/PC</a> at Amazon.</p><div title="6531585 - Leverless 8BitDo Wireless Arcade Controllers Preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3529" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6531585 - Leverless 8BitDo Wireless Arcade Controllers Preorder" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7RMB4RH?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F7RMB4RH?tag=gamespot-preorders-20 &quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7RMB4RH?tag=gamespot-preorders-20 ">8BitDo Arcade Controller (Xbox/PC)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7RMB4RH?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F7RMB4RH?tag=gamespot-preorders-20 &quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7RMB4RH?tag=gamespot-preorders-20 ">$100 | Releases July 25</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, the new leverless 8BitDo Arcade Controllers use a button-only layout. Both models include four directional buttons (up, down, left, right), eight face buttons, and four additional remappable buttons. Each button uses hot-swappable Kailh Wizard low-profile mechanical switches, and the extra buttons also come with swappable locking flat caps in case you don't want to use them and want to avoid accidental presses. Both models also feature platform-specific inputs--like the Xbox Guide button and Switch Home button--for navigating the console's menus and interface.</p><p dir="ltr">These leverless models are thinner and lighter than the previously released 8BitDo Arcade Controllers with joysticks, with a smudge-resistant material on the top panel, and a slip-resistant silicone mat on the bottom so it stays in place while playing. They also have foldable magnetic feet so you can adjust the angle.</p><p dir="ltr">The Xbox version of the leverless 8BitDo Arcade Controller connects wirelessly to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, or PC with the included 2.4GHz dongle. The included USB-C cable can be used to establish a wired connection as well as charge the Arcade Controller.</p><p dir="ltr">While the hot-swappable PCBs are convenient for modding the device's buttons and switches to your preferences, you can also personalize the button mapping and other options on PC or Xbox using 8BitDo's Ultimate Software X. One of those customizations is the RGB lighting rings around the buttons, which are exclusive to the Xbox model.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R4XTQX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F7R4XTQX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20 &quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R4XTQX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20 ">8BitDo Arcade Controller (Switch/PC)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R4XTQX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F7R4XTQX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20 &quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R4XTQX?tag=gamespot-preorders-20 ">$90 | Releases July 25</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Switch version of the leverless 8BitDo Arcade Controller the same button layout and overall design as the Xbox edition, but it's $10 cheaper and adds Bluetooth support. Since it uses Bluetooth to sync wirelessly with your Nintendo Switch, you should have no problem pairing it to the upcoming Switch 2 console.</p><p>The Switch edition still comes with a 2.4GHz dongle for wireless play on PC, just like the Xbox model. The detachable charging cable can be used for wired mode on Switch or PC. So if you're buying the controller for PC, you can save $10 by opting for the Switch version. You will miss out on the backlit buttons, but the Switch edition does have a cool retro-themed design.</p><p>The gray, black, and red color scheme pays homage to the Nintendo Entertainment System. The trio of bright menu buttons running along the top nod back to the SNES controller's face buttons.</p><p>Button mapping and other competition-focused control customizations can be applied to the Switch edition using 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4495869-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495869" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4495869-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495869"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4495869-001.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4495870-8bitdoarcadecontroller-12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4495871-8bitdoarcadecontroller-15.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4495872-8bitdoarcadecontrollerforxbox-7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4495873-8bitdoarcadecontrollerforxbox-16.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4495874-hero.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4495875-hero1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495870,1300-4495871,1300-4495872,1300-4495873,1300-4495874,1300-4495875" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4495870-8bitdoarcadecontroller-12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4495871-8bitdoarcadecontroller-15.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4495872-8bitdoarcadecontrollerforxbox-7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4495873-8bitdoarcadecontrollerforxbox-16.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4495874-hero.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4495875-hero1.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4495870-8bitdoarcadecontroller-12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4495871-8bitdoarcadecontroller-15.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4495872-8bitdoarcadecontrollerforxbox-7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4495873-8bitdoarcadecontrollerforxbox-16.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4495874-hero.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4495875-hero1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For those who prefer the traditional feel of a joystick, the original 8BitDo Arcade Controller is also available now. Like the levelerless edition, the 8BitDo Arcade Controller with a joystick is available in Switch and Xbox versions, and both work with PC.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> won't support Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) on TVs after all, despite Nintendo previously suggesting it would.
</p>
<p>
The Mario maker today set the record straight in a comment to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-apologises-for-error-with-mention-of-switch-2-vrr-tv-support">Nintendo Life</a>, acknowledging that VRR would only be available when playing Switch 2 in handheld mode. 
</p>
<p>
An earlier, now-removed statement on Nintendo's website had not made that distinction, and suggested VRR while docked would also be possible.
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo Switch 2 supports VRR in handheld mode only. The incorrect information was initially published on the Nintendo Switch 2 website, and we apologise for the error," Nintendo said today.
</p>
<p>
When Nintendo Life probed further on the possibility that Switch 2 VRR support while docked would be added in a future system update, Nintendo said it had "nothing to announce" at the moment.
</p>
<p>
Today marks the first time Nintendo has acknowledged this officially, just days after Digital Foundry reported the lack of docked VRR support in its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-final-tech-specs-and-system-reservations-confirmed">comprehensive Switch 2 final tech specs report</a> just days ago.
</p>
<p>
"Something that is important to clarify is that as far as Switch 2 developers are concerned, VRR is indeed a function of the internal display only and that there is no support at all right now for VRR over HDMI," Digital Foundry boss Richard Leadbetter wrote. 
</p>
<p>
"The best theory we have for this is that the dock's DisplayPort to HDMI converter doesn't support standard HDMI VRR, but whatever is the cause, we would hope to see Nintendo provide some sort of solution in due course."
</p>
<p>Nintendo is likely to become the "primary partner for third-party game publishers" over the next console generation, a leading analyst firm forecasted yesterday, as reported by Eurogamer, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-likely-to-become-primary-partner-for-third-party-game-publishers-over-next-gen-analyst-firm-forecasts">Switch 2 expected to sell 100m in five years</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Jade Raymond has departed Sony’s Haven Studios, the developer that she founded in 2021, with the development of their first title, Fairgames (stylised as Fairgame$) yet to be completed for PlayStation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NzM0MzgxOSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ3OTQ4NjE5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTV0JOMllUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.qOIF32mVNJUCz17mJYYZM-YWpEEYhCcjFt6lm8BeeFo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">reporting by Bloomberg</a> digs into the situation surrounding her departure, stating that PlayStation leadership did not give Haven’s staff a reason for her departure, but that it came several weeks after an external test of Fairgames – according to people with knowledge of the matter. Apparently, the team at Haven are a bit concerned about how the game was received and its general progress.</p>


<p>In a statement to Bloomberg, a PlayStation spokesperson confirmed Raymond’s departure. “Jade Raymond has been an incredible partner and visionary force in founding Haven Studios. We are deeply grateful for her leadership and contributions, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter.”</p>
<p>However, they are “committed to supporting Haven Studios and excited to continue the journey” and the studio will now have a pair of co-studio heads in the form of Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski.</p>

<p>Announced in 2023 and in development for PlayStation and PC, Fairgames is one of the many live service titles that PlayStation greenlit at the tail end of Jim Ryan’s tenure. We haven’t seen or heard anything about the game since it was revealed, arriving with a slick cinematic trailer that showed a multiplayer heist ’em up with PvPvE elements. In other words, it’s an extraction shooter, a high tech modern take on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/12/hood-outlaws-and-legends-review/">Hood: Outlaws and Legends.</a></p>

<p>Jade Raymond is one of the best-known known individuals in the games industry, though mainly for the string of new studios that she has founded and ventures that she has led over the past decade. Having been a producer and then executive producer through the early years of the Assassin’s Creed franchise, she went on to work on the first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/06/03/watch-dogs-review/">Watch Dogs</a> before moving on from Ubisoft. In 2015 she founded <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/07/13/jade-raymond-founds-eas-new-motive-studios/">Motive Studios at EA</a>, intent on making Star Wars games in partnership with Visceral Games and Amy Hennig. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/17/ea-shut-down-visceral-games-moves-its-star-wars-game-to-another-studio/">We all know how that turned out</a>, but Motive did craft the single player for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/13/star-wars-battlefront-ii-review/">Star Wars Battlefront II</a> during her tenure and has become a core part of EA’s line up of studios.</p>
<p>Following Battlefront II’s release, Raymond left to join Google as head of Stadia Games and Entertainment… and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/29/google-stadia-shut-down-january-2023/">we know how that turned out</a>. Then, with fresh funding and backing from Sony’s push to make live service games, she founded Haven Studios, and got to work on Fairgames. While we don’t know Farigames’ fate, we do know how <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/report-sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-at-bluepoint-bend-studio/">Sony’s live service plan has been turning out</a>…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/668349/fortnite-star-wars-james-earl-jones-vader-ai-voice<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/charles-pulliam-moore">Charles Pulliam-Moore</a> <span>is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>When <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661237/epic-games-fortnite-apple-us-ios-app-store-eu-account">Fortnite</a> </em>players meet Darth Vader in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659347/fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle-season-battle-pass">the game’s ongoing <em>Star Wars </em>event</a>, they will be able to speak with the Sith Lord directly, and he’s going to respond with a voice that sounds exactly like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/19/5323642/james-earl-jones-doesnt-pay-much-attention-to-his-voice">James Earl Jones</a>.</p></div><p>Though Darth Vader has previously appeared as an NPC (and a battle pass skin) in <em>Fortnite</em>, Epic Games announced today that the character’s latest outing will be a bit different thanks to the use of AI. After finding and defeating Vader on the map, players can recruit him onto their teams and speak directly with him using <em>Fortnite</em>’s in-game audio chat functionality. And Vader will respond in an AI recreation of James Earl Jones’ iconic voice whose answers vary depending on what players.</p><p>Per a FAQ about the interactive feature, Epic says that Vader’s answers will be based on audio recordings of player’s voices that are sent directly to Gemini. Player audio and transcriptions of their voices will not be stored, though Epic will have access to transcriptions of Vader’s responses for instances in which players report what the character says. The company also says that it will “not use any of your interactions with Darth Vader to train AI models.” Additionally, players under the age of 13 or their country’s age of digital consent will need parental permission to use the feature.</p><p>The note about reporting Vader’s responses implies that the AI-voiced character might be able to say inappropriate things Epic, Disney, and Lucasfilm wouldn’t approve of. And, as Twitch streamer Loserfruit demonstrated earlier today, that seems to be very much the case. Following Loserfruit’s stream, <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1923397890241593822">Epic said</a> it pushed a patch to prevent Vader from saying “fuck.”</p><p>In <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/this-will-be-a-day-long-remembered-speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite">a statement</a> about the feature, Epic explained that Vader’s voice was created using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603821/google-gemini-flash-2-0-ai-app">Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23864878/ai-voice-clones-podcastle-elevenlabs-personal-voice">ElevenLabs</a>’ Flash v2.5 models. The studio also said Vader “wouldn’t be nearly as sinister” without Jones’ performance, and thanked Jones’ estate for signing off on the collaboration. Jones’ family echoed Epic’s sentiments, and said that the late actor “always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience” <em>Star Wars</em>’ with his voice in it.</p><p>“We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character,” the family said.</p><div><p>Before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240301/james-earl-jones-darth-vader-voice-died">his death last September</a>, Jones signed off on a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/24/23370097/darth-vader-james-earl-jones-obi-wan-kenobi-star-wars-ai-disney-lucasfilm">deal with AI startup Respeecher</a> that gave the company the rights to recreate his voice for Disney Plus’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/27/23144221/obi-wan-kenobi-review-disney-plus"><em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em></a> series. The deal was just one example of Disney and Lucasfilm’s desire to keep the <em>Star Wars </em>films and series running with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914062/the-book-of-boba-fett-star-wars-luke-skywalker-aging-cgi">digital recreations of its original cast</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s because Link’s Awakening is already targeting 60 FPS on Switch 1 – it just struggles to hit and maintain that. Presumably, by accessing <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-hardware-detailed-120-fps-hdr-and-more">the extra power of the Switch 2</a>, the game will be able to run at its already-in-place 60 FPS. Only time will tell, but fortunately, we don’t have to wait long because the Switch 2 launches June 5.</p><p>For more about the console, read about how <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/15/nintendo-has-a-plan-for-continuous-flow-of-switch-2-through-the-holidays">Nintendo has plans for a “continuous flow” of Switch 2 through the holidays</a>, and then check out the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/13/2025-nintendo-switch-2-game-release-schedule">2025 Switch 2 game release schedule</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Once again, Bungie has been caught taking art from an artist without that artist's permission and putting it in their games, this time with <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-wont-be-a-full-priced-game-according-to-bungie/">Marathon</a>.</p>
<p>Artist Antireal posted on <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">X</a> that the Marathon alpha is "<em>covered with assets lifted from poster designs I made in 2017,</em>" with design comparisons showing the assets were essentially copied.</p>
<p>"<em>Bungie is of course not obligated to hire me when making a game that draws overwhelmingly from the same design language I have refined for the last decade,</em>" they continued, while posting even more evidence, "<em>but clearly my work was good enough to pillage for ideas and plaster all over their game without pay or attribution.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I don't have the resources nor the energy to spare to pursue this legally but I have lost count of the number of times a major company has deemed it easier to pay a designer to imitate or steal my work than to write me an email. In 10 years I have never made a consistent income from this work and I am tired of designers from huge companies moodboarding and parasitizing my designs while I struggle to make a living.</em>"</p>

<p>Bungie confirmed their error from the <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">MarathonDevTeam X account</a>, which has a significantly smaller following than the main <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame">Marathon account</a> for the game and the main <a href="https://x.com/Bungie">Bungie</a> account. It was a mistake made by the Marathon development team, so it makes sense to have an account that speaks for that team being the one to speak up, but it has the air of Bungie owning up to the mistake with a whisper, instead of with its full voice.</p>
<p>"<em><span>We immediately investigated a concern regarding unauthorized use of artist decals in Marathon and confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used</span></em><span> in-game</span>," the post on the MarathonDevTeam account reads.</p>
<p>"<em><span>This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred.</span> <span>We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to</span> Antireal </em><em><span>to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist. As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission.</span></em><span>"</span></p>
<p>This is the fourth time Bungie has been caught taking art from an artist without giving them proper credit: first in <a href="https://x.com/Cozmo23/status/1442534201165635587">2021</a>, then again in <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/bungie-says-it-will-compensate-and-credit-artist-whose-work-was-mistakenly-used-in-this-weeks-major-destiny-2-cutscene/">2023</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-to-compensate-artist-for-destiny-2-nerf-blaster-art/">2024</a>, and now once again in 2025.</p>
<p>"<em><span>To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist</span></em><span> <em>contributions,</em>" the MarathonDevTeam account continued.</span></p>
<p>"<em><span>We value the creativity and dedication of all artists who contribute to our games, and we are committed to doing right by them. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.</span></em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Alpha Intro Cinematic" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4Jv5H3_yAo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In response to a separate question about the assets being lifted, Antireal confirmed that artists from Bungie, including the Marathon franchise art director <a href="https://x.com/josephacross">Joseph Cross</a>, followed <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923083432713650246">them on X for years</a>, though Antireal had previously never interacted with Cross or any of the Bungie artists who followed them.</p>
<p>For the fourth time running, it's clear that Bungie has a major issue with its art pipeline. That these mistakes continue to happen is, frankly, ludicrous, and it only makes you wonder where <a href="https://wccftech.com/bugnie-attempt-at-dismissing-copyright-lawsuit-denied-by-court-due-bungies-inability-to-provide-vaulted-destiny-2-content-as-evidence/">other issues might lie</a> in its creative process.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-goes-for-deep-cuts-with-latest-fighting-game-collection.1191288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/667921/capcom-fighting-collection-2-review-xbox-switch-steam-ps4<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At this point, there are more than enough ways to play <em>Street Fighter II</em>. But <em>Project Justice</em> and <em>Plasma Sword</em>? Well, those are something entirely different, and much harder to find. And Capcom has made the smart decision to continue to make some of its more obscure fighters the focal point of its growing library of retro collections.</p><p>While it’s called <em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em>, the latest release is actually the third in the series from Capcom. The first, in 2022, focused on 2D games like <em>Darkstalkers</em>, <em>Cyberbots</em>, and, yes, <em>SFII</em>. That was followed by the long-awaited collection of <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> releases. The latest collection isn’t quite as focused, but instead covers eight Capcom fighters released between 1998 and 2004, spanning arcades and consoles like the Dreamcast.</p><p>Mostly these games are divided into two categories. There are a bunch of 2D crossover releases that mash up characters from different franchises. That includes two <em>SNK vs. Capcom </em>games —<em> Millennium Fight 2000 Pro</em> and <em>Mark of the Millennium 2001</em> — along with <em>Capcom Fighting Evolution</em>, which brought together characters from <em>Street Fighter</em>, <em>Darkstalkers</em>, and <em>Red Earth</em>. If nothing else, <em>Fighting Evolution</em> is notable for being a game where Ryu can fight a dinosaur.</p><p>Rounding out this half is <em>Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper</em>, which isn’t a crossover, but <em>is</em> an excellent 2D fighter. In fact, all of these are. They’re slick and polished, filled with incredible animation and character designs, and lots of interesting mechanics based around teams and power-ups. These are games that largely came out as interest in 2D fighters seemed to be dwindling, and Capcom was throwing everything it could at keeping the genre appealing. Because of this, they’re some of the most over-the-top examples of a fighting game.</p><p>Perhaps more interesting, though, is the quartet of 3D fighters included in the collection, which were all early attempts at exploring the genre in a new dimension. They’re all pretty different because of it. <em>Power Stone</em> and its sequel were particularly ambitious, with their large, interactive levels that players could run around, collecting items and power-ups as they fought. The other two are somewhat more straightforward but with their own twists: <em>Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein</em> is built around weapons-based combat, while<em> Project Justice </em>puts you in control of various fighting teams as you punch your way through a surprisingly deep storyline about rival schools.</p><p>These games haven’t aged as well as their 2D counterparts. The controls can be a little fiddly, and the action is often slower, with floaty physics. But they still stand up, even to someone like me who never played them originally. More importantly, though, they’re finally available for a wide audience to play. Despite being a cult classic, the most recent port of <em>Power Stone</em> came out on the PlayStation Portable in 2006. This collection is long overdue for most of these games.</p><p>Aside from the games themselves, which are available in both their English and Japanese incarnations, <em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em> has the usual assortment of add-ons, like online support, a music player, and a collection of associated art. It’s not as robust as, say, a Digital Eclipse release like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24291537/tetris-forever-review-ps5-switch-pc-xbox"><em>Tetris Forever</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23451349/atari-50-review-xbox-playstation-switch-steam"><em>Atari 50</em></a>. But Capcom’s new collection nails the important thing: it’s eight classic games that all play great, showcase an interesting evolution of the genre, and are finally available for modern players.</p><p><sub>Capcom Fighting Collection 2<em> is available now on the Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
