<figure data-uuid="afbb73de2ace7"><a title="Hollow Knight vs Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/afbb73de2ace7/hollow-knight-vs-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite pledging that we'd take a break from games of this ilk when we finished pouring blood, sweat and tears into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> last year, Team Cherry has somehow found a way of dragging us back in with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, we put the halls of Hallownest behind us for good many years ago now, but the promise of buttery smooth performance had us flying back to it like a Markoth to a flame — <em>mmm, "additional effects"</em>. The more we played, the more we remembered just how much we love this world, these characters, this floaty little knight.</p>
<p>'Oh no,' we suddenly realised, ' without the performance argument in our arsenal, there's nothing stopping us from asking the ultimate question: do we prefer Hollow Knight or Silksong?'</p>
<p>When Silksong launched last year, it felt like a foregone conclusion. In this sequel, Team Cherry had done everything in its power to take what made the first game so wonderful, and make it even <em>wonderfuller</em>. Hornet is quicker and more acrobatic than the Knight. Her tools open more combat possibilities than we ever thought possible. The map makes Hallownest feel piddly.</p>
<p>We even said as much in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 10/10 review</a>: "It elevates map design and purposeful challenge effortlessly, and is an improvement on Hollow Knight in every single way." And yes, for reference, we <em>only</em> awarded its predecessor a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hollow-knight">9/10</a>.</p>
<p>But, returning to Hallownest on Switch 2 in recent days, our preference isn't quite as clean cut as it was back in September, when the long-awaited Silksong was still so shiny and new in our hands. The map may be smaller, but it feels just as dense. The overarching narrative of the fallen kingdom is sublimely woven into your surroundings, with a simplicity that's tough to knock. And can anything ever truly replicate the feeling of pure dread experienced with your first steps into Deepnest?</p>
<figure data-uuid="2ec88e322390e"><a title="Hollow Knight / Silksong Bench" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2ec88e322390e/hollow-knight-silksong-bench.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>So... come here often? — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honestly, there are voices for both sides of the argument here at Nintendo Life Towers, so we thought it was only right to throw it out to you, our lovely readers. Do Silksong's improvements leave it at the top spot in your mind, or is Hollow Knight still your number one? You can cast your <del>Zote</del> vote in the following poll.</p>

            <guid>1431352</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Later this week, <strong>Sony</strong> is set to host its first <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a> </strong>event of 2026. This hour-long showcase will include several announcements we could guess at, and many we won't be able to, but a new report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-une-grosse-exclusivite-ps5-debarque-ce-mois-de-fevrier-61029">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a> has pretty much cemented one of the announcements that we'll see at Thursday's show (if we don't see it tomorrow): the games entering the <strong>PS Plus Extra Catalog</strong> for February 2026. Which, according to the report, will be headlined by <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</strong></p>



<p>The first of <strong>Insomniac's</strong> Spider-Man titles, <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man</strong> (the remastered variant, that is), entered the PS Plus Extra library of games <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-august-2025-mortal-kombat-1-marvels-spider-man-remastered/">back in <strong>August 2025</strong></a>. With <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales</strong> already included in the catalog, this means that players who sign up for the second tier of <strong>PlayStation's</strong> subscription service will be able to play all three of Insomniac's Spider-Man games so far.</p>



<p>Spider-Man 2 isn't the only game mentioned in the Dealabs report, as it also cites that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/neva-the-gris-follow-up-from-nomada-studio-receives-beautiful-new-gameplay-trailer/">Neva</a>,</strong> the follow-up to the critically acclaimed <strong>Gris</strong> from <strong>Nomada Studio</strong>, will enter the catalog alongside Spider-Man 2, as will <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a></strong>.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 EXCLUSIVE 🚨</p><p>A big PS5 Console Exclusive is Coming to PS Plus Extra (Game Catalog)</p><p>Yes, it will be<br>🕷️ Marvel's Spider-Man 2</p><p>We reveal 2 other headliners in our latest report<br>(Other titles may be revealed tomorrow or during next State of Play)<a href="https://t.co/BqKAr24wqR">https://t.co/BqKAr24wqR</a></p></div>— billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/2021255882273620133?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>There will undoubtedly be more games than just those three entering the catalog, but those are the only ones mentioned in the report. Normally, it's worth taking any leaks you see ahead of showcases like Thursday's upcoming State of Play with a grain of salt, but in this case, you'll want to add more salt to the pile. Dealabs and Billbil-kun have an extremely strong record of revealing PS Plus news ahead of time.</p>



<p>So, at least in this case, we can bet that we'll see Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Neva, and Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown as part of the PS Plus Extra games for February 2026.</p>



<p>PS Plus subscribers at every tier can already enjoy <strong>Undisputed, Ultros, Subnautica: Below Zero</strong> and <strong>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</strong> as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-february-2026-games-undisputed-ace-combat-subnautica-ultros/">PS Plus Essential games</a> for February 2026 (which, unsurprisingly, were leaked ahead of time by Dealabs).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Scarlet Hollow </em>Episode 5, which was originally set to debut in its entirety later this week, will instead be releasing in two parts, developer and publisher Black Tabby Games has announced.</p><p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1609230/view/519737782627731799" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a post</a> on Steam, the studio says that Episode 5's first part will still be launching on Friday (which, appropriately enough, is the 13th of the month), but that the second half will now be arriving on February 20th, one week later.</p><p>The split is happening because "the art for the ending" of the fifth episode "has taken a little bit longer than [Black Tabby has] anticipated", according to the studio, and so rather than rushing the climax or delaying the entire episode, the decision has been made to cut the fifth chapter in two.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>According to Black Tabby, the first part of Episode 5 "is still roughly the size of all of Episode 4", so if you are still planning to dive into the fifth episode on Friday, there should still be plenty to keep you occupied.</p><p>Black Tabby says the split release will also have the added benefit of allowing <em>Scarlet Hollow</em>'s community to theorize and digest the events of the fifth episode, promising "twists and revelations" as part of the chapter.</p><p>Just in case you're unfamiliar with <em>Scarlet Hollow</em>, it's a horror visual novel from Black Tabby Games, the developer behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slay-princess-sales-1m-scarlet-hollow-100k" rel="nofollow">the breakout hit</a> <em>Slay the Princess</em>.</p><p>Unlike that game, <em>Scarlet Hollow </em>is episodic, and not all of its episodes are out yet; the game is planned to span seven chapters, with four currently available and the fifth now arriving across the next two weeks.</p>
<p>If you'd like to get caught up with <em>Scarlet Hollow </em>ahead of the fifth episode's release on Friday (and then the climax's arrival next week), you can pick the game up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a>.

            <p>
The single most offputting thing about a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, i.e. an extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, is that every single other person you meet in-game is Schrödinger's asshole. They could be a friend who you share a story or some loot with, or they could mercilessly gun you down at the drop of a hat. It's certainly not for everyone, but in the game's latest update, a new PvE event has arrived encouraging everyone to walk hand in hand together to defeat those big bad bots.
</p>
<p>
This new event is called Shared Watch, described in-world as an "annual holiday that reminds us of the true enemy, by celebrating those that look out for their fellow Raiders. Tolerate, team-up, or take out some Arc - it’s all in the spirit of the Shared Watch." The event is running from right now as you read this, through to February 24, and anyone that destroys, helps to destroy, or simply damages any Arcs can earn merits and rewards for doing so. However, killing others in PvP encounters won't get you anything, obviously to discourage you from doing so.
</p>
<p>
It's an interesting choice to leave friendly fire on, and I think conceptually one I broadly agree with. In an ideal world more people will help others than debilitate them, though the odd griefer is still all but guaranteed. This does raise questions as to how developer Embark should handle such people - are they shunned or punished for their nastiness, or are they ignored and the law of the people takes precedence? A moral quandary that will come to light in the coming days.
</p>
<p>
Outside of this, the Cold Snap map condition is returning to the rotation, so dress up warmly if you're heading out. You'll also be able to pick up the Vulpine and Slugger cosmetic sets. There's a few fixes and tweaks in this update, like an annoying issue where some couldn't reconnect after disconnecting from a game, and another where crafting would just randomly be cancelled. You can read the full patch notes on this handy blog post right <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-15-0">here</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-tips-beginnner-guide-roguelite-poop-2000667291</link>
            <guid>1431334</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest game from&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac&nbsp;</em>creator Edmund McMillen is out today, a roguelite unlike any other in which you must master the RPG-like turn-based battles of a group of cats, who upon victory will all immediately retire and require you to start over with their kitten spawn. Think&nbsp;<em>Rogue Legacy</em> meets&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em> but played like <em>X-COM</em>. With poop. So much poop. Here’s a bunch of stuff I’d love to have already known when I started playing.</p> <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000667314" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667314"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667314">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Never fall in love</h2> <p>So the central conceit of&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> is that you don’t get to keep your cats. While it’s so tempting to think of them like a deck in a deckbuilding roguelite, and thus start to rely on particular aspects of a particular kitten’s abilities, or even more the way two or three cats’ skillsets can seamlessly work together to create one-two-three punches that dominate in battles, they’re always going to be cruelly taken away from you. If you <em>do</em> have the purrfect team, all that means is you’re going to reach a new goal, defeat a new location, and as such be forced to return home and see your menagerie retire. And even if you try to recreate it, pick a Hunter, Cleric and Fighter like last time and set up that same synergy, they’ll have different skills, spells, and abilities next time out. That teleport you’d built your whole game around? Nope, you don’t have that now. And even if you did, your Fighter won’t be able to spawn rocks this time, and…It’s about letting go, moving on, never getting attached.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Food goes down faster than you think</h2> <p>At the start of the game you’ll have 50 portions of cat food, and it seems like it’ll last forever. Each cat requires one portion per day, and when you’ve got just four of them in the house you feel safe for the foreseeable future. But after, say, another four nights you’ll now have at least eight cats via the arrival of strays, and likely another two or three kittens by the magic of nature. That’s at least 10 cats to feed per night, and your supplies have already dwindled getting here. So pick up food whenever you can. It’s gathered while out on adventures, but that of course requires either successfully reaching a goal farther than you’ve been before, or abandoning a run after a boss and not making vital progress. So when you see it on the shelves in the stores, grab it. In fact, think about saving up for that 100 coin expansion to your food supply stores with some urgency. I wish I’d done that straight away.</p> <hr> <h2>You need to clean up poop</h2> <p>To say that&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> is obsessed with poop is to understate things. This is a game where poo plays a vital role in battles, used to boost your cats, or to block tiles. Then there’s the pee, and the farts, and well, it’s an Edmund McMillen game. But given this fecal focus, it’s odd that it forgets to tell you early on how important it is to remove it from your base. The cats’ wellbeing depends on a bunch of factors, including the furniture you add later in proceedings, but early on the simplest way to keep them happy and healthy is to click on the sweet curlers to make them disappear.</p>

 <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000667310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667310"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667310">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Middle click for clarity</h2> <p>Something I stumbled on quite by mistake, as&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> didn’t mention it, is that holding the middle mouse button down offers a far clearer view of what’s happening in any battle. (It’s Y on a controller.) The game is splendidly drawn, but it’s also very cluttered. Holding down the middle button causes a level to represent itself like a far simpler board game, with red counters for enemy positions and green counters for your squad. This is so very, very helpful when trying to get a clearer idea of the challenge, especially when so many enemies can be teeny maggots or flies, pretty much the same color as the background, not least when they’re hidden in long grass or behind a rock. Hold down that button, get a good sense of the situation, and then crack on.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Eat stuff you find on the ground</h2> <p>Like in life, you’ll be far better off if you pick up any food you see lying on the ground and eat it. While it’s generally a good idea to have one of your cats be a Cleric on any run, since that’s the most reliable source of vital healing, it’s not the only way to improve health. Levels tend to be covered in all sorts of debris, and a lot of it turns out to be edible. Hover you mouse over anything and it’ll pop up letting you know if you can eat it, and if a cat stands on that tile it’ll automatically gobble it up. This can make a really big difference, and is too easy to forget when thinking about the 790 other vital parts of positioning for battles, causing you to over-rely on your healer.</p> <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000667312" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667312"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667312">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Kill the birds</h2> <p>Birds on the battlefield are an early mystery. You’ll immediately assume they’re part of the enemy team, but that’s not the case at all. They are in fact neutral, appearing with a grey counter when you middle-click (a great way to be sure they’re not enemies), and as such will most likely leave you alone but for annoyingly taking up a tile. But kill them anyway! They fly off of their own accord a few rounds in to any battle, so you need to prioritize them, but not only will they likely drop useful items but they’ll also see the killing kitty’s stats all increase for doing so. That can be a big advantage, especially when taking on mini-bosses or especially irritating foes.</p>

 <hr> <h2>This game is way bigger than you think</h2> <p>It’s tempting, given the&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em>-like delivery of the paths down which you adventure, to assume&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> is about mastering those levels and then trying to outdo your previous runs. But that’s not it at all: this is a game far more focused on progress. And there’s a lot more of it than you’re expecting. Not only does each level have multiple routes through of varying difficulty, but there are far more of them than you might imagine. A great way to make this clear to yourself is to play non-stop for six hours, then go look at your save game to see it tell you that you’ve completed eight percent of the game. There’s <em>so</em> much to find in here, and it wants you to find it.</p> <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000667311" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667311"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667311">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>You can’t lose…sorta</h2> <p>Well, you can lose all the time. But you can’t&nbsp;<em>lose</em> lose. While all four of your kitty-cats can fall in battle, causing you to lose the lot and return home empty-pawed, that’s not a game over. Even if they were your last four available cats, it doesn’t end. Instead, you just need to keep accepting new strays until you have four to take on a new run. Heck, even if you’re out of food you’ll just take surviving starving creatures with you. There’s no way to completely fail, but boy are you in a hole when you reach that point. Unless you get super-lucky and feel super-confident with the four cats you happen to have, you’re going to want to deliberately do some single-section runs just to guarantee bringing back some coins and food to start digging your way out. Don’t forget that all your retired cats can be sent off to the various other characters for extra bonuses, so even if you’re burning them on short runs, they’re still proving useful.</p> <hr> <h2>You can switch off the film grain</h2> <p>I’m not normally one for turning off grain effects—if they’re there I tend to consider them part of the aesthetic the developer intended for me to experience. But&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em>‘ effects are somewhat egregious, and the flickering of its old-timey film projector ways began to really wear on my tired eyes. This can all be tweaked, turned down, or turned off in the game’s settings.</p> <hr> <h2>Keep your donkey-faced fuggos in the basement</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000667315" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667315"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667315">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure>

			<p>PlayStation is ready to reclaim the spotlight after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/"><strong>Xbox Developer Direct</strong></a> and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a></strong>. After a quiet start to the year, Sony has officially pulled back the curtain on a massive February State of Play, which promises to be a beefy broadcast that will set the tone for the PS5’s 2026 lineup.</p>



<p>With rumors of new <strong>first-party reveals</strong> and <strong>long-awaited updates on third-party projects</strong>, here is everything you need to know about the upcoming showcase.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>



<p>On the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official PlayStation Blog</a></strong>, Sony has explicitly stated that this broadcast will feature a look at "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">eye-catching third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios</strong></em>." With no game officially confirmed to be shown, however, speculation has begun on what we should expect to see.</p>



<h3 id="h-hardware-news">Hardware News</h3>

<p>With the <strong>PlayStation 6 and rumored PlayStation handheld console still far from release</strong>, no next-gen hardware reveal should be expected. However, there still could be some hardware announcements, as a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-low-key-success-and-a-very-good-idea-the-rumored-updated-playstation-portal-could-be-the-best-answer-to-hardware-price-increases/">PS Portal OLED model is rumored to be in the works</a></strong>.

<p>As the latest news from teams at PlayStation Studios will be shared during this State of Play, it stands to reason we will hear more about multiple first-party games, including <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/"><strong>Marvel's Wolverine</strong></a></em>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-playstation-5-pro-shows-its-muscles-by-delivering-5k-resolution-rendering-in-marathon/"><strong>Marathon</strong></a></em>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/"><strong>Saros</strong></a></em>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrilla-cartoonish-coop-game/"><strong>Horizon Hunters Gathering</strong></a>,</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-system-works-shows-more-marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-closed-beta-december/"><strong>MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls</strong></a></em> (whose <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3787240/MARVEL_Tkon_Fighting_Souls/"><strong>Steam page</strong></a> was recently updated to confirm the 20-character big launch roster).

<p>New reveals could also be in the cards. Will Cory Barlog's new IP, or the rumored<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-2-5d-metroidvania-spin-off-could-be-announced-today/"> <strong>2.5D Metroidvania God of War</strong></a> be announced this week?</p>

<p>As the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trilogy development team has been speaking at length about <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/we-nailed-it-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-director-was-really-looking-forward-to-recreating-this-very-emotional-scene/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the third and final entry in the series</strong></a>, a reveal of the game's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">name and the first footage</strong> wouldn't really be surprising, even though it's been suggested that this game will not launch as a PlayStation 5 exclusive like its predecessor, and will be available from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-will-reportedly-be-multiplatform-on-launch-no-timed-playstation-exclusivity/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)">day one also on PC, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch 2.</strong></a></p>

			<p><strong>Supermassive Games</strong>, the studio you'll recognize as the team behind games like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-reportedly-effectively-closed/">Until Dawn</a></strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-quarry-supermassive-big-screen/"><strong>The Quarry</strong>,</a> has announced the release date for their next narrative-driven horror adventure, <strong>Directive 8020</strong>. This new sci-fi entry in Supermassive's <strong>Dark Pictures</strong> anthology will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming <strong>May 12, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>The news was announced with a new release date trailer, which also ushered in the launch of pre-orders going live on both PS5 and Xbox Series. Pre-orders for the game on Steam will go live "<em>soon</em>" according to the video description, so just keep an eye on your Steam notifications if you already have it wishlisted for when those pre-orders are ready.</p>



<p>The trailer dubs Directive 8020 as "<em>a new chapter of horror</em>," while showcasing plenty of gameplay and the difficult decisions you'll be forced to make in Supermassive's latest terrifying adventure. You can check out the new trailer below.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Technically, we first heard about Directive 8020 all the way back in 2022, but that notice came from the public release of a bundle of titles Supermassive had <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/five-new-the-dark-pictures-titles-trademarked-supermassive-games/">trademarked</a></strong>. It wasn't until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etXhOhzbXso">2024</a> that the game was properly announced, with a release date initially set for 2025.</p>



<p>However, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed-2026/">a round of layoffs</a></strong> at Supermassive pushed the game out of its October 2025 release window and into 2026. Thankfully, today's announcement confirms that we didn't have to wait too much longer after it missed its October release, as it is still arriving in the first half of 2026.</p>



<p>The last time we saw Directive 8020 was at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a></strong>, where Wccftech's Francesco De Meo got to spend half an hour with the game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/directive-8020-gamescom-hands-on-previews-a-new-page-in-the-anthology/">In his preview</a>, he highlighted how the addition of real-time threats sets Directive 8020 apart from other games in the Dark Pictures Anthology, and how, alongside its new tier of graphic fidelity and all-star cast, Directive 8020 looks set to "<em>mark a new beginning</em>" for Supermassive's Dark Pictures games. Or, as Supermassive puts it in today's trailer: "<em><strong>a new chapter of horror</strong></em>."</p>

              <p>Starting next year, Hasbro will begin making most of the<em>&nbsp;Harry Potte</em>r-related toys available on shelves around the globe. But even though its parent company announced a massive licensing deal with <a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-rowling-transphobia-1850127849">WB and </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-rowling-transphobia-1850127849">Harry Potter</a>,</em> Wizards of the Coast confirmed it has no intentions to bring the wizard-filled franchise from author J.K. Rowling to <em>Magic: The Gathering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p> <p>On February 10, <a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-and-warner-bros-discovery-global-consumer-products">Hasbro and Warner Bros. Discovery announced</a> a massive licensing deal involving <em>Harry Potter</em> that will see the toy company become the de facto manufacturer of toys and merchandise for the<em> Harry Potter</em> franchise in 2027. Hasbro plans on making and selling “dolls, role play, action figures &amp; collectibles, interactive plushes, and board games” with “more to be revealed later this year.” This is obviously a very big deal for Hasbro, and with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/harry-potter-tv-cast-harry-ron-hermione-jk-rowling-hbo-1851782496">new<em> Harry Potter</em> series arriving on HBO Max next year</a>, the company is likely predicting a huge influx of interest around the popular wizarding franchise.</p>

 <p>On February 10, in response to a Reddit post mentioning Hasbro’s big new licensing deals, a Wizards of the Coast rep denied any <em>Harry Potter</em> crossover was in the works despite its parent company jumping all in.</p> <p>“The Magic Multiverse has its own school of Magic at Strixhaven with plenty of secrets still to explore,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1r12ed3/comment/o4metfg/">said WOTC’s community team on Reddit</a>. “Our Universes Beyond roadmap currently doesn’t have us visiting any others.”</p> <p>Of course, you can’t talk about <em>Harry Potter</em> without mentioning franchise creator and author J.K. Rowling, a<a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/a-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy"> woman who has spent years saying terrible things about trans people</a> and <a href="https://www.advocate.com/news/jk-rowling-anti-trans-organization">has used her vast wealth to support anti-trans initiatives</a>.</p>

 <p>So it makes sense that some fans of <em>Magic</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-monty-python-holy-grail-crossover-1851604859?_gl=1*bj20lt*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzk4MjY4Ni4yMDkuMS4xNzI3OTgzODc1LjU2LjAuMA..">which in recent years has found big money in IP crossover cards via its Universes Beyond brand</a>, wondered if the card game owned by Hasbro would soon start releasing<em> Harry Potter</em> cards as part of this deal. But WOTC’s Reddit comment suggests that, for now at least, <em>Harry Potter</em> won’t be coming to <em>Magic</em>. Of course, plans change, and WOTC’s wording is just vague enough that, in a few months, this comment could look very silly in retrospect.</p>

              <p><span>Little Saint James, informally known as Epstein Island, saw a sudden influx of virtual visitors over the weekend after </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span> players spotted that the location was home to a Pokéstop. The Pokéstop in question has since been removed from the game by developers Niantic, but not in time to stop an unquantifiable number of players from flocking to the island once owned by deceased convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</span></p> <p><span>The inciting post that caused the flood of </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span> to Little Saint James seems to be </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonGoSpoofing/comments/1qvhkj9/can_someone_see_if_theres_anything_on_epsteins/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>this post</span></a><span>, dated February 4, on r/PokemonGoSpoofing, titled “Can someone see if there’s anything on Epstein’s Island?” In this context, “spoofing” refers to a method that allows </span><i><span>Pokémon Go </span></i><span>players to alter their in-game GPS data so that they can visit any location they desire. Prior to its removal, I was able to verify the existence of the “Sun Dial” Pokéstop on Little Saint James by using a spoofing method.</span></p>

 <p><span>From there, several viral posts began to surface on social media, </span><a href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2020090411990077784?s=20"><span>including this</span></a><span> February 7 post on X. There’s no exact way to quantify how many players visited the island, but there are numerous posts on r/pokemongo detailing methods to reach the location. On February 9, developer Niantic confirmed to </span><a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/pokemon-go-epstein-island-sundial-pokestop-376117-20260207"><i><span>GAMINGbible</span></i></a> <span>that the Sun Dial Pokéstop had been removed from the game.</span></p> <p><span>However, Niantic wasn’t quick enough to stop one user on r/pokemongo from figuring out exactly how the Pokéstop made it into </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span>. In a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/1qz5osi/comment/o48yrkb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>now-deleted thread</span></a><span>, the user discerned that the Sun Dial Pokéstop was submitted as a point of interest through </span><i><span>Ingress</span></i><span> at some point between 2020 and 2021. </span><i><span>Ingress</span></i><span> is Niantic’s other augmented reality mobile title, and served as a precursor to </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span>. As a result, a lot of the data in </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span> has been scraped from </span><i><span>Ingress</span></i><span>. The same user also figured out that the image used for the Sun Dial Pokéstop was taken from a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUUQqNdJrHI"><span>YouTube video</span></a><span> dated July 2019, which features drone footage of Little Saint James. As its name indicates, the Pokéstop was indeed at the exact location of a large sundial on the island.</span></p>

 <p><span>Oddly enough, this is one of many Epstein-related video game stories to spawn out of the three million pages released by the Department of Justice on January 30, as Epic Games had to debunk a “</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/littlestjeff1-epstein-files-fortnite-v-bucks-conspiracy-epic-2000666464"><span>Jeffrey Epstein Is Alive</span></a><span>” </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>conspiracy last week.</span></p>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is a tough proposition, no matter how experienced you are. The February 10, 2026, Quordle has four new words for you to find, and this guide has hints and a helping hand to have you be four for four.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>

<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="block-44882c9d-d6a6-4e4f-9b1a-8312ae0b3036">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone and region, meaning the next game will start on February 11.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

<p>A reliable insider has revealed the headliner for PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for February 2026: none other than Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. </p>



<p>PlayStation Plus <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/february-free-playstation-plus-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free monthly titles</a> were revealed recently, and one big complaint was that there were no good titles in the collection. The headliner was Undisputed, featuring Subnautica: Below Zero, Ultros, and more. It seems that PlayStation will be making up for a big exclusive through Game Catalog. </p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-s-spider-man-2-coming-to-playstation-plus-game-catalog-on-february-17">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 Coming to PlayStation Plus Game Catalog on February 17</h2>



<p>The news about Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 coming to the February Game Catalog comes from a <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-une-grosse-exclusivite-ps5-debarque-ce-mois-de-fevrier-61029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a> report. The report reveals that Insomniac’s hit superhero title, along with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown and Neva, will be available through PS Plus on February 17. It is also likely that PlayStation will announce the upcoming PS Plus games at the State of Play event this week; however, that hasn’t been confirmed. </p>



<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is the sequel to Insomniac’s acclaimed superhero action-adventure game. Released in 2023 for PlayStation 5, it also received a PC port in 2025. The game features both Peter Parker and Miles Morales as playable characters, as they face off against symbiote forces. </p>



<p>New York City has been expanded, and new gameplay features have been introduced to allow players to navigate the city more quickly. Additionally, players will encounter original interpretations of iconic villains from the series, including Venom, Kraven, Lizard, and more.</p>







<p>In other news,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-announces-new-horizon-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Horizon multiplayer game</a>&nbsp;has been announced.

It's already destined to be one of my favorite games of 2026. The game's climbing system and vertical level design are technical and creative wonders, and its stunning art direction is a feast for the eyes. But what I was most surprised by was the story's protagonist, Aava.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In video games when we meet characters determined to accomplish an impossible task, they're often positioned as eager go-getters. But Aava is something different—a prickly person often rude and abrasive to the people she encounters. She's a case study in contrasts, and a great reference point for developers looking to tell morally nuanced stories in the video game medium.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Aava is an athlete struggling to keep her humanity">Aava is an athlete struggling to keep her humanity</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spoiler warning - we'll be discussing the plot of </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Cairn</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> in great detail below.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I spoke with The Game Bakers creative director </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/cairn-s-manual-climbing-system-is-like-a-vertical-death-stranding-">Emeric Thoa</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> back in 2024, he described </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cairn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s emotional core as being inspired by the intense rush that climbers feel making it to the top of a climb.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thoa described how this emotion informed Aava's character in an interview in a December 2025 interview on the official PlayStation blog. "She’s demanding, perfectionist, and can't stand failure. And when she conquers a difficult route, when she pauses for a moment on a ledge with a breathtaking view, she feels free. It's for moments like these that she climbs—that's her main drive."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That "main drive" is more overwhelming with Aava than in most other characters I've seen with similar motivation. As the story progresses, players are likely to be surprised by how little warmth this fictional celebrity solo climber shows for anyone else in the story. She screams in anger any time her partner Naomi or handler Chris send messages. She's rude to Marco, a younger and less-jaded climber also scaling Kami and at first she shows no affection for Climberbot, her cute robot pal wordlessly supporting her journey up the mountain.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/danielle-riendeau-s-top-three-games-of-the-year-2025-wrap-up" target="_self" data-discover="true">Danielle Riendeau's top 3 games of the year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This behavior doesn't just appear in cutscenes. Some of these interactions play out in barks that pop up during the climb, and there are a few key moments where the player can only proceed when they lash out at Marco.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Aava isn't always like this. Like many gruff protagonists, she warms up to Marco after initially telling him off. She's somber and reflective when studying journals left by other climbers and a native tribe called the Troglodytes. And her indifference to Climberbot turns to intense sorrow after she strikes it in a fit of anger.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a traditional arc, this would be a story where she lowers her guard and learns to let others in. But this is not a traditional arc. And Aava's journey isn't about love or warmth—it's about searching for the only thing that can make her feel alive.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/game-developer-s-2025-wrap-up-bryant-francis-top-10-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Bryant Francis' top 10 games of the year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What happens when you're only happy doing the impossible?">What happens when you're only happy doing the impossible?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cairn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is also a fantastic case study in subtext. Players are trusted to pick up on Aava's emotional state through terse exchanges with other characters and the ignored messages from home. But the subtext hits a peak when late in the game, Aava sends a message home trying to express her feelings and why she's on this dangerous journey—and she can't.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not just because of exhaustion. Aava has lost so much of her humanity in search of the climb. The thing that makes her feel alive is the sensation of reaching the summit. Aava will only be happy when she—and the player—reach the mountain's summit. But Kami's environment is like Mt. Everest on steroids. The bodies of dead climbers litter the slopes all the way up, and to finish her journey is to risk life, not just limb.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This becomes apparent after a devastating dream sequence midway through the game that uses Fleischer-era style animation entirely unlike anything else in the story. Aava has received news that would have sent most people turning around to rush down the mountain and comfort her loved ones—and instead all she can do about it is have nightmares and continue the climb.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not for nothing, but what follows is also one of the most challenging sequences in the game. I muscled through it, refusing to reload an earlier save even after many failures, because I did not want to experience that dream sequence again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Back in 2023 I asked Thoa why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cairn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a science fiction adventure game and not just a climbing simulator (which maybe could have been a less-risky business proposal), he said the team at The Game Bakers loves games with some kind of meaning.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here, that meaning comes all from Aava's shattering sense of self, and players have to confront the question—what else is left for someone like her when they summit the highest peak in all the land?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's fascinating how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cairn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> pulls off this complex story without needing the subversive setpieces you might find in a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last of Us</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spec Ops: The Line</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In my own work, I've had to interpret characters through the lens of the player power fantasy—Aava makes me contemplate how writers can create complex characters without taking the player's attention away from the fun and rewarding parts of a game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="February inspirations: Bone Temples and Boston abolitionists">February inspirations: Bone Temples and Boston abolitionists</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As promised, I'm leaving you with a short list of works to look at outside of video games, with some notes on what to pay attention to.</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Years_Later:_The_Bone_Temple">28 Years Later: The Bone Temple</a></span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Come for a study in how filmmakers hand off characters like batons, preserving their essence while changing cinematic direction.

            <p>More Resident Evil remakes are happening. That's an inevitability after all the modern REmakes crossed the <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/game/226039/resident-evil/">10m copies sold mark</a>. We're now getting close to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">RE4</a>'s third anniversary, and news on the next comeback could drop any moment now. If we pay attention to the ESRB website, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-5">Resident Evil 5</a> could be next in line.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-5-re5-remake-capcom-xbox-series-2000667258">Kotaku</a>, we've been alerted of a new listing for an Xbox Series X/S version of the game originally released in March 2009. The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40376/resident-evil-5/">page</a> is barebones and provides a short description that could perfectly apply to yet another remaster or re-release of the fifth mainline entry, but as pointed out by Kotaku, there's mention of in-game purchases. Capcom has been throwing those into every game in recent years, even single-player ones, so whatever this iteration of RE5 is, some form of new content is coming <em>at the very least</em>.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm mostly convinced by the theory it's a full-blown remake. It's been almost three years since RE4's release, and while leakers <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449?s=20">have been denying</a> rumblings of RE5 being up next in favour of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-code-veronica">Code Veronica</a>, the Africa-set game's return is looking a lot more likely right now. Again, it could just be a new remaster with a few extra bits of content while other game gets the remake treatment, but looking at Capcom's trajectory so far, we'd put our money on the next mainline instalment.</p>
<p>The timing is also funny, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-announced">PlayStation's next State of Play stream is happening later this week</a> and will have more than enough space for all sorts of game reveals. Kotaku is also smartly pointing out the RE4 remake was revealed during a State of Play stream in 2022. Adding fuel to the fire, Eva La Dare, who voiced and mocapped Sheva Alomar, <a href="https://x.com/KarenShevaEva/status/2011868483194392926?s=20">has also been teasing something</a> for March.</p>
<p>Regardless, Resident Evil fanatics have lots to look forward to later this month, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is arriving and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-switch-2-ports">biting into Nintendo Switch 2</a> with RE7 and Village by its side.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Blizzard has said it's discussing a visual redesign for new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> hero Anran following controversy about her look, which arose after she was revealed last week.</p>
<p>Anran is one of the five new heroes arriving in Overwatch today (formerly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>) as part of an expansion-like release called The Reign of Talon. Early access to Anran was available at the weekend.</p>
<p>The controversy is twofold, and intertwined. One: people somewhat rightly accuse Overwatch of having a same-face problem - "same face syndrome", it's colloquially called - whereby the female character models in particular in the game tend to have the same or similar face. Two: and this seems to be the main source of aggravation here, we've seen a depiction of Anran before looking notably different.</p>
<p>Anran is the sister of existing Overwatch hero Wuyang, and when Wuyang was introduced to the game, Anran co-starred in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytZnOGwEq9s">Wuyang's animated short cinematic, Elemental Kin</a>, and <a href="https://blz-contentstack-assets.akamaized.net/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltda027517bc96a819/6892813ccec4566b0c2fe2bc/OW_Aqua_EN.pdf">in Wuyang's adjoining comic, Against the Tide.</a> There, Anran cut a different image, one with a more believable face and a stronger sense of ferocity. It's a presentation even Blizzard has agreed is at odds with the young, cutesy looking presentation of Anran that's in the game now.</p>

We're so proud of the work that our team has put into Anran and the rest of the five heroes launching in Season 1, and we agree that she can be even better if we get this aspect of her right in-game.</p>
<figure>

<p>"We discussed sharing this with all of you last week but wanted to wait until we had confirmation of exactly what we can do. We're hoping to make this update in Season 1 but I don't have specifics to share just yet. Our hero models are incredibly complicated and we really need to test out what we can do."</p><p>Keller's comments follow unrest in the Overwatch community but also criticism from the voice actor who portrays Anran in the game, Fareeha Andersen (who didn't say anything about this at Blizzard HQ when we met two weeks ago, perhaps understandably). Andersen's comments cut a little deeper, calling out a wider problem with female representation and beauty standards in general.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/AskFareeha/status/2020291256279089431?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2020291256279089431%7Ctwgr%5E2e86c06a906d90bb07e764c795a439a71e01f7e2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-is-a-hill-worth-dying-on-overwatch-actor-supports-potential-redesign-of-criticized-character">Andersen said in a videoed message on social media</a> that, "There was an unspoken promise [made in the animated short and comic] that said, 'We're going to challenge the beauty standards ransacking media these days - the Ozempic chic, the contour your nose / you have no nose / the tiniest nose. And because of that precedent, I think people feel let down.</p>



<p>"Overwatch is a trailblazer at challenging that, at trying to break those moulds, at trying to explore the bounds of what it means to be good, what it looks like to be heroic. And I think the result we got says something else - it says something that leaves a bad taste in our mouths. It's not the bold, optimistic swing that we know Overwatch to make. And it's a look that isn't congruent with her personality; she looks like the younger sibling, she looks more docile somehow, as the fire hero. She looks more docile than the most peacekeeping support in the game.</p>
<blockquote><em>"She looks more docile than the most peacekeeping support in the game."</em></blockquote>
<p>"I've been seeing everyone's redesigns - and quietly bookmarking them - but I wanted you to hear that this concern is important. This is a hill worth dying on, it's worth speaking on, because I believe that the more we speak up about the things that truly matter to us, the more we'll see ourselves reflected in the world around us."</p>
<p>Overwatch has been commended in the past for its representations of characters from around the world. Early on, it introduced the older Egyptian lady Ana to the game, which was a type of character we had very rarely seen before. Blizzard also goes to lengths to ensure it matches actors with similar backgrounds to the characters they're portraying, such as it did with Fareeha Andersen and Anran, and Kerem Erdinc and Emre, one of the other new characters coming to the game. Erdinc actually helped spot <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-nearly-had-an-f-bomb-problem">a Turkish Emre f-bomb problem Overwatch nearly had</a>.</p><p>That is to say that I believe this matters to Blizzard, and the quick response from Aaron Keller here is to be commended, although it remains to be seen what Blizzard will actually do about Anran's design. And if it alters Anran, will it also consider tweaking the faces of other heroes as well?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">This week is a big week for Overwatch</a>, which is undergoing something of a relaunch. Blizzard is moving to a kind of annual expansion release model for the game, under the guise of year-long collected storylines of content. The first is The Reign of Talon that begins/launches today, 10th February, and adds five new heroes to the game, with a further five planned over the course of the year. There are also many other changes besides - not least the dropping of the "2" from the game's title. Overwatch, in a sense, is back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Artefacts Studio and New Tale have announced the first videogame adaptation of Fantasy Flight Games’ Descent board game, with this first game being Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent. The story of Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent will be a new one, and not based on the board game so it will be something new for fans of Descent, as well as an entry point for those who have not played Descent before.</p>
<p><iframe title="Terrinoth®: Heroes of Descent | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/66iyYCF771o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent takes place one year before the events of Descent: Legends of the Dark, adding to the lore of the world while introducing new events. The gameplay will be a turn based RPG along with exploring different dungeons with a group of heroes. Additionally, players can choose to play through the entire campaign or play through self contained questlines outside of the main story that can be completed in a few hours. Both the story campaign and standalone quests can be played solo or in co-op.</p>
<p><em>“As fans of Descent, stepping into Terrinoth has been both a huge responsibility and an incredible joy,”&nbsp;</em>said Bruno Chabanel, CEO of Artefacts Studio.&nbsp;<em>“With Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent we wanted to capture the feeling of a tense tabletop dungeon crawl and translate it into a tactical RPG that flows naturally on PC and consoles with a multiplayer cooperative mode to accurately convey the atmosphere of the board game. It’s easy to pick up, but there is always another strategy, another synergy or another build to discover.”</em></p>

<p>There is a demo available on Steam to try out what Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent has to offer ahead of its planned release this Spring for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

<figure data-uuid="f277304b26af4"><a title="Mario Tennis Fever" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f277304b26af4/mario-tennis-fever.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>September 2025 feels like an awful long time ago. It was in this Direct that we first locked eyes on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, and while the marketing hasn't been all that in-yer-face in the months since, the occasional trailer drop or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> update has kept us eager to learn what Mario's latest sporting escapade would bring to the table.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's not long to wait. Fever launches on Switch 2 later this week on <strong>12th February</strong>, and today, we can start to get an idea of the critical consensus as the reviews start rolling in.</p>
<p>Here at Nintendo Life, we had a great time with just about everything the game served up to us. While the wonderful PJ O'Reilly was a little let down by the single-player Adventure Mode in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">our 8/10 review</a>, he found that there was a lot to like about the central tennis matches and their wacky Fever mechanics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's lucky, given the disappointing adventure offering, that the tennis here is so sweet, and easily the sort of thing I reckon has a long online life ahead. It helps, too, that it looks superb, never dropping a notable frame in docked or handheld</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196982 @ 1770742566 -->
<p>But of course, we're not the only ones with a review out there. Below, we've assembled a roundup to help you see the breadth of opinions at a glance — and yes, there are quite a few different takes on this one.</p>
<p>Kicking things off at the top with <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/mario-tennis-fever-review-scores-ace-pinpoint-precision-507991-20260210">GAMINGbible</a>, which awarded Fever a 9/10 thanks to its fun-filled whimsy and the "pleasant surprise" of its short-but-sweet Adventure Mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With its surprisingly charming Adventure Mode and more match variations than you could possibly imagine, <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> is a bountifully delightful release that conjures up the pure, whimsical escapism that only Nintendo so wonderfully nails</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/mario-tennis-fever-review-3315802/">Dexerto</a> was similarly optimistic in its 4/5 review, describing Fever as "the most fun sports game in years":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As chaotic as Mario Kart, it stands alongside the likes of Mario Golf Toadstool Tour and Mario Strikers Charged as the best Mario sports games. It’s completely thrilling</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-tennis-fever-review-bringing-the-heat/1900-6418460/">GameSpot</a> also came in with an 8/10, praising the arcade-y addition of the special-powered rackets and the sheer variety of gameplay options:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mario's various dalliances into sports have been inconsistent, often because they feel so bare-bones and perfunctory. Mario Tennis Fever breaks this trend with a multitude of modes and a playful, flexible gimmick that makes it more wild and unpredictable while also testing your tennis skills in a new way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things were marginally lower in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mario-tennis-fever/running-hot">Game Informer</a>'s 7.5/10 review, which still found a lot to like about Fever despite an all-too-short Adventure Mode and some occasional stutters in the review-period online matches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mario Tennis Fever is hardly a revolutionary entry, but it nails the series' most important element by offering a well-rounded experience with myriad ways for players of all skill levels to enjoy the game of tennis</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>For many of the same reasons, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-review">IGN</a> awarded Fever a 7/10, where the stellar party vibes and stacked character roster are only let down by the single-player content and occasional repetitiveness of certain modes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 20 hours, I already feel like I’ve had my fill, and I see it as more of a fun distraction to play for a few minutes here and there while my group warms up for something else rather than one that’s going to get a serious amount of playtime</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, we have <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/mario-tennis-fever/">VGC</a>, which gave Fever a "solid" 3/5 on account of that much-discussed Adventure Mode and the risk of things becoming rather unbalanced in online matches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before long, you’ll realise that of the 30 rackets on offer, less than a third of them can have a major impact on the game. I’d imagine that once the online community turns up, it’ll only be a matter of time before the metagame kicks in and the vast majority of these rackets are dismissed in favour of the handful that have the most obvious advantage</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>There you have it, not the most divisive game in recent memory, but certainly a good range of opinions — it currently sits at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mario-tennis-fever/">Metascore</a> of 77 based on 64 critic reviews.</p>
<p>You'll be able to see it all for yourself later this week, when Mario Tennis Fever arrives on 12th February.</p>

A good portion of the presentation focused on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ports</strong> launching this year for the current-generation Nintendo system, including <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-trio-of-bethesda-ports-are-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026-fallout-4-indiana-jones-and-oblivion-remastered/"><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-arrives-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-june/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.</strong></a></em></p>



<p>With the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">recent Nintendo Switch 2 port of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</em> running and looking great on the system</strong>, many are wondering how the console will ha<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ndle the second entry in the series</strong>, which is a more complex game in pretty much every aspect. Though too early to say, an early analysis of the only footage available to date suggests that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 could deliver a better experience than the Steam Deck</strong>.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">During the latest episode of their weekly podcast</a></strong>, the tech experts at Digital Foundry provided <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">an early analysis of the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Nintendo Switch 2 footage</strong> shared last week. At a glance, the new version of the game looks like a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">pared-down version of the PlayStation 5</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">version</strong> running at a lower resolution, but a deeper look shows <strong>how much the game had to be scaled down.</strong></p>



<p>Besides running at an internal resolution of <strong>720p</strong>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> on Nintendo Switch 2 will sport <strong>lower texture quality</strong> than on PlayStation 5 (which also brought a sensible reduction of the game's file size, which will be around 100 GB on Switch 2), <strong>reduced foliage, particle and density, removed shadows</strong> in some instances and <strong>lower shadows resolution</strong> in places where they are still in, and a <strong>sensibly worse hair rendering</strong>. Performance also seems iffy, with visible <strong>frame pacing issues</strong>, though these could be fixed in time for release.</p>



<p>While on paper these visual cutbacks may seem like a lot, the tech experts noted how <strong>they are only truly noticeable with side-by-side comparisons</strong> with the PlayStation 5 release. Ultimately, with platform-specific optimizations, the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 could deliver a better experience than the Steam Deck</strong>, which obviously did not benefit from such optimizations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first game in the next season of Supermassive Games’ Dark Pictures anthology is now available for pre-order.</p>



<p>As revealed in a new trailer, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/directive-8020/" id="90789">Directive 8020</a> will release on May 12, and players can now pre-order it for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles. The game was originally scheduled for early October 2025; however, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/supermassive-games/" id="1159">Supermassive </a>announced layoffs in July 2025, which pushed the release to 2026.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-directive-8020">What to Expect From Directive 8020</h2>



<p>Directive 8020 is a Sci-Fi survival horror game where the Earth is dying, and a crew travels to a new planet that can hopefully be the next home for Humanity. However, the planet is home to an alien organism that can take the form of any crew member, setting the stage for a tense experience.</p>



<p>Lashana Lynch, known for her work in The Woman King, stars in the title, where choices matter and will affect the outcome of the main campaign.</p>



<p>This is the first non-VR Dark Pictures Anthology game since 2022’s The Devil in Me. The games were originally released annually, but the team ultimately decided they didn’t want to be tied to such a demanding schedule.</p>



<p>“We don’t want to be tied down to a game every six months or one every year or anything like that. This game’s big, and we want it to be treated as such,” Will Doyle, creative director of Directive 8020, told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/directive-8020-is-a-notable-upgrade-to-the-dark-pictures-anthologys-formula" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer </a>back in 2024 about the upcoming title.</p>
