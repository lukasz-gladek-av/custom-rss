            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-patch-112-dlc-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and From Software have released&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>patch 1.12, and while the update is paving the way for tomorrow's&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC, that's far from all it's doing.</p>
<p>As well as adding support for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-release-date">arrives across all platforms tomorrow</a>, patch 1.12 also makes a number of important balance changes to both PvE and PvP gameplay.</p>
<p>Major new quality-of-life features include a new inventory tab that shows items recently acquired, as well as a new "!" marker that appears next to items you've just obtained. No longer will you need to sift through your massive inventory looking for that new greatsword.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-patch-1.12-shadow-of-the-erdtree-leaping.jpg?itok=bHYTgpuP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-patch-1.12-shadow-of-the-erdtree-leaping.jpg?itok=l_ncf_Zs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is imminent, and a new patch has arrived to herald its launch.</figcaption></figure><p>Other major improvements include new hairstyles being added to the game's character creator (or Rennala's Rebirth system), as well as the ability to ride Torrent during the final boss battle. I won't spoil the identity of that battle here, but be aware that the patch's official notes do just that.</p>
<p>Naturally, patch 1.12 also includes a ton of minor balance fixes and changes, including weapon and skill adjustments, general balance improvements, and lots more. You can take a look at the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-112" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full patch notes for update 1.12 here</a>.</p>
<p>As well as releasing the patch notes for this update, Bandai Namco has also unveiled a launch trailer for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, teasing some of its locations, bosses, and characters. You can check that out below.</p>

<p>Don't worry; if you're looking to head into the Land of Shadow without spoilers, then be aware that although this trailer contains a brief glimpse of some bosses, it doesn't give any major story details away. Obviously, if you don't want to know anything at all, it's best not to watch.</p>
<p>If you're wondering exactly what time you'll get to check out&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>&nbsp;and all of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-trailer">many mysteries</a>, Bandai Namco has you covered there as well.</p>
<p>Here's a map showing the release times for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>around the world.</p>

			<p>Today's Elden Ring patch brings some significant ray tracing performance improvements on PC, a new comparison video highlights.</p>
<p>The comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> puts the game's previous and current versions of the game running side by side running on an RTX 4080 GPU at 4K resolution, maximum settings and ray tracing, confirming how the new patch brought significant performance improvements with ray tracing. In scenarios where the game struggled to hit 60 frames per second, it now hits them easily, making playing the game with ray tracing a viable option on powerful systems.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING Patch 1.10 vs Patch 1.12 - Significant Performance Improvements | RTX 4080 4K" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVgvKNWIjkA?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides these ray tracing performance improvements, the Elden Ring 1.12 patch introduces new features and balance tweaks, such as new Inventory and Map features, PvP and PvE balance changes, and more. You can find the full patch notes <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-1-12-patch/">here.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One worldwide. You can learn more about the excellent Shadow of the Erdtree expansion by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game.</em></p>

It has to do with the prequel movies and the lifespans of one particular race of aliens that really doesn’t factor into anything important. The response from some people has been so apocalyptic, though, that even the editors of Wookiepedia, the internet repository for every bit of arcane <em>Star Wars</em> lore you could imagine, have had to come out and tell everyone to chill out. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193897" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="418" data-playlist="193897,194499,196406" data-current="193897"><div><p>10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19360.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The textbook definition of not having a normal one began on June 18 after episode 4 of <em>The Acolyte</em> included a cameo by Ki-Adi-Mundi, the High Council Jedi Master with the massive forehead many might remember from his brief appearances in <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, <em>Attack of the Clones</em>, and <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>.

Hate like that has no place here, and you are not welcome in our community.” When one person quipped that “I thought gatekeeping had no place in Star Wars,” a sentiment often expressed in the face of toxic Star Wars purists, Wookiepedia immediately moved to shut them down. “Telling people death threats are not welcome here is not gatekeeping. It’s basic decency.”</p><p>What makes the freak-out extra silly is that Mundi’s age and the average lifespan of his race, the Cereans, were based on expanded universe information which hasn’t technically been canon for years.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CitiesSkylines/status/1803769912462082301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, the Cities Skylines 2 developers confirmed that the Economy 2.0 patch will finally launch on June 24, 2024.</p>



<p>The update will roll out at 10:00 CEST, introducing a highly anticipated rework for the divisive economy system. </p>



<p>Last May, the devs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-will-rework-economy-console-release-window-shrinking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a> that this update would arrive “somewhere between June 3 and 19.” In today’s post, the team explains why they missed that release window. They state that the update required some “last minute fixes,” citing that “a small thing can have a ripple effect.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The developers also addressed a series of fan replies in the same thread. They elaborate that the anticipated patch will release on Monday instead of the weekend just in case critical hotfixes are necessary.</p>



<p>Many replies also requested an update on the console version. Surprisingly, the devs did <a href="https://x.com/CitiesSkylines/status/1803776814550012007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reply on X</a>, confirming that they are still actively working on it.</p>



<p>They reveal that “the console version is going through a series of test builds to reach the necessary level of performance and stability.” At this time, the devs still seem to be aiming for an October 2024 release window.</p>



<p>In addition to the upcoming economy patch, the devs recently adjusted how the Rent mechanic works in Cities Skylines 2. They ultimately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-rent-was-too-high-so-they-removed-landlords/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to remove landlords</a> for balancing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/playstation-is-offering-free-online-multiplayer-access-on-june-22/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=playstation-is-offering-free-online-multiplayer-access-on-june-22<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="201" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Sony has announced that the coming weekend will offer PlayStation players free access to online multiplayer modes in games that they own. The PlayStation Plus free weekend access is set for June 22-23.</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">While PS Plus’ online multiplayer feature will be free for all players this weekend, it is important to understand that the free access is solely for online multiplayer gaming, and no other PS Plus benefits will be free this weekend, such as access to Game Catalogue. This also means that you must own the video games you want to try out the online multiplayer modes for.</p> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="758" data-injectable="true">Subscription to a PlayStation Plus tier is generally required across many games on the PlayStation in order to play online multiplayer modes. Owning a video game on the console is not enough for some titles to gain access to multiplayer modes, with titles such as <em>Helldivers 2</em>, <em>EA Sports FC 24</em>, <em>Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3</em>, <em>GTA Online</em>, and many more requiring a PS Plus subscription.</p>
 <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">However, there are also games available on PlayStation that do not require any PS Plus subscription to gain access to the online multiplayer modes. Games such as <em>Fortnite</em>,<em> Call of Duty Warzone</em>, and <em>Rocket League</em> give players access to multiplayer modes without requiring an active PS Plus subscription.</p> <figure data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="492" data-injectable="false">PlayStation X/Twitter account’s official announcement carries the promo picture for this upcoming free multiplayer weekend, where for some reason,<em> Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2</em> is featured alongside <em>NBA 2K24</em>, and <em>EA Sports FC 24</em>. <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> came out back in 2022, and its successor<em> Modern Warfare 3</em> came out last year in November 2023. Regardless, the free multiplayer weekend can be utilized to try out multiplayer modes for games you own. What are you planning to play this weekend?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-is-now-the-world%E2%80%99s-most-valuable-company-as-it-overtakes-microsoft.906555/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/nvidia-most-valuable-company-overtakes-microsoft/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=nvidia-most-valuable-company-overtakes-microsoft<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="310" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Nvidia, the giant GPU manufacturing company, is now the world’s most valuable company in terms of market capitalization. The company has overtaken Microsoft to reach the pinnacle with $3.33 trillion in market cap, edging past Microsoft’s $3.31 trillion market cap, as per stats on <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/">Marketcap</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-overtakes-microsoft-to-become-worlds-most-valuable-company/1100-6524369/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">Gamespot</a>).</p> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">After the top two spots, Apple is ranked third at $3.2 trillion, followed by Google’s parent company Alphabet which has a market cap of $2.17 trillion. Amazon is the fifth most valuable company with its market cap at $1.90 trillion at the time of writing.</p> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">Nvidia is a leading graphics card manufacturer and faces active competition from AMD, but the rival company also invests its time and energy into providing processors to the tech market. While Nvidia’s GeForce RTX graphics cards have been facilitating AAA gaming in desktops and laptops for years, this rise to the top could be attributed to the recent AI boom.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="NVIDIA ACE for Games Sparks Life Into Virtual Characters With Generative AI" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5R8xZb6J3r0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="532" data-injectable="true">Nvidia has long been known for investing its resources and research into AI, and its shift in focus can be dated back to as far back as 2006 when it released Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), a parallel computing platform.</p>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">The focus on AI has paid dividends for Nvidia in the long run, now that the tech market is chasing after an AI-powered future. To achieve that, tech companies that are investing in AI require GPUs that can handle the AI processes, and that’s where Nvidia’s value comes into play. The company’s stock price has seen over 200% growth since 2023.</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="693" data-injectable="false">With the focus on generative AI increasing rapidly, and companies such as Microsoft and Apple introducing the likes of Copilot+ and Apple Intelligence, Nvidia stands to profit. Currently, Nvidia’s stock price is hovering around $135, and this is due to the stock split of 10:1 decided by the company in June after an announcement back in May.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus has announced that&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance&nbsp;</em>sales have topped 500,000 in just three days, bringing the total for both&nbsp;<em>Vengeance&nbsp;</em>and the original&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei V&nbsp;</em>to an impressive figure as well.</p>
<p>On the official Japanese&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/megaten_atlus/status/1803586067469328467" rel="noopener" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter) account</a>&nbsp;(for which we're using machine translation), Atlus says that <i>Vengeance</i>, which was released on June 14th, sold 500,000 copies in its first three days on sale.</p>
<p>This brings the total sales for what <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1803586415084687609" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Atlus calls</a> "the&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei V&nbsp;</em>series" to more than 1.6 million units. That's a pretty impressive figure, but it's probably not too surprising given that the original game enjoyed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shin-megami-tensei-v-hits-highest-launch-sales-in-franchise-history">highest launch sales in the franchise's history</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-sales-frost-storm.jpg?itok=D0cF8nkf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-sales-frost-storm.jpg?itok=nkJn0R2V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance&nbsp;</em>has done pretty well for itself.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Vengeance</em>'s solid sales figures are no doubt down to the fact that the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-gets-new-release-date-but-it-isnt-delay">released across multiple platforms</a>, whereas the 2021 original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shin-megami-tensei-v-comes-to-nintendo-switch-exclusively-in-2021">was a Switch exclusive</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike that game,&nbsp;<em>Vengeance&nbsp;</em>is available across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, as well as the Switch. Given that many of Atlus' other RPGs, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-release-date">upcoming&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-release-date">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>series, are multiplatform, <i>Vengeance</i>'s is a strategy that makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>, it's an updated re-release of 2021's&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, complete with lots of new stuff to enjoy.</p>

<p>The new version of the creature-collecting RPG includes an entirely new story route, the Canon of Vengeance, which roughly matches the original story in terms of length.</p>
<p>It also offers tons of quality-of-life improvements, gameplay tweaks, and other enhancements. It's clear Atlus intends this to be the definitive version of&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, especially considering the original Switch version was delisted from the store the day before&nbsp;<em>Vengeance</em>'s release.</p>
<p><em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875830/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V_Vengeance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0177-PPSA15716_00-SMTVDXUS00000000/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance/9nz6n5748bvt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <p>
With Elden Ring's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC mere hours away from release, you might think there's not much FromSoftware could possibly do to refocus your excitement on the base game. But Elden Ring's previously promised new base game patch is now here, and it's already caused a bit of a flutter among fans - not least because it finally lets you take your trusty steed Torrent into the concluding Elden Beast boss fight.
</p>
<p>
Now, I'll readily admit I haven't fought the Elden Beast myself - the short explanation being my wildly misguided decision to do a purely melee-based first run through and, uh, Malenia - but even I'm aware of the boss fight's notoriety. Not due to its difficult, mind, but because it teleports itself around an arena so massive, players have frequently found the ensuing on-foot chase-the-monster action utterly exhausting. This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/theyok/elden_beast_is_the_single_worst_designed_boss_in/">Reddit thread from two years ago</a> called it the "single worst designed boss" in Elden Ring, and, well, it's a fairly common opinion.
</p>
<p>
Plenty of people have speculated the Elden Beast was originally designed to be fought on the back on Torrent given its cavernous arena - and wondered why everybody's favourite goat-horse wasn't accessible in the final release version - but, some two years on, he's finally here. "Added new feature to summon spectral steed during the Elden Beast the boss battle", explains today's <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-112">1.12 patch notes</a> - and the Elden Ring fanbase rises for thunderous applause.

<p>
Torrent's inclusion in Elden Ring's finale is just one of the additions in a fairly hefty patch. A lot falls under the banner of balancing changes, but there are also bug fixes, new Steam-exclusive keyboard and mouse settings, FIVE NEW HAIRSTYLES, plus the handful of extremely welcome quality of life improvements <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-base-game-is-getting-new-hairdos-and-other-improvements-ahead-of-its-dlc">detailed earlier this week</a>.
</p>
<p>
Elden Ring's inventory has, for instance, been tweaked so it's easier to see newly acquired items at a glance (previously, new items just vanished into the pile, which was a pain for lore hooverers like me) by highlighting them with an exclamation. A Recent Items tab has also been added to the inventory.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, colosseum competitors will find all crafted consumable items used during PvP battles are now replenished at the end of a session, and Summoning Pools have had a bit of an overhaul too. Active Summoning Pools now carry over to NG+, and it's possible to enable or disable individual Summoning Pools in the newly added Map Functions menu.

<p>
"If 'Include Distant Areas' is selected when using the Small Golden Effigy," FromSoftware notes, "summoning pools within the Mohgwyn Palace will not be selected for summoning, even if you have activated them. If you are within the Moghwyn Palace and select 'Nearby Only' when using the Small Golden Effigy, you will be able to be summoned within the area."
</p>
<p>
All this, of course, arrives ahead of FromSoftware's highly anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Elden Ring DLC</a> - a release I'm currently so excited about my reality is practically shimmering. Based on my previous experience of FromSoftware DLC, I expect this excitement to last approximately 30 seconds before turning into utterly humiliated misery - but for anyone planning a more cautious approach, here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/time-is-running-out-to-prepare-for-elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree">everything you might want to do to prepare for Shadow of the Erdtree</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2024-biggest-booth-yet/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-will-attend-gamescom-2024-with-%E2%80%9Cbiggest-booth-yet%E2%80%9D.906531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2024-biggest-booth-yet/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft has confirmed that Xbox will attend Gamescom 2024 with the "biggest booth" to date.</p>
<p>Yesterday, like previous years, Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-confirms-its-skipping-gamescom-again-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemingly confirmed</a> that PlayStation will be skipping the annual gaming event in Germany. Back in April of this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-skipping-gamescom-2024-switch-2-reveal-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo already confirmed</a> that it won't be attending the event either.</p>
<p>Luckily for fans, however, Xbox will be present during the event this August, and <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1803774842774127085" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to</a> the official Xbox X account, the Xbox team will have the "biggest booth yet". While additional details about Microsoft's presence during the event will likely be shared later on, we already got a glimpse of which games will be present: "Just a few you can expect to see: Age of Mythology: Retold, Avowed, Ara: History Untold, Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, Diablo Immortal, The Elder Scrolls Online, Fallout 76, Towerborne &amp; World of Warcraft: The War Within. More to come!", the official Xbox account <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1803774846100189342" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X.</p>
<p>We also received an official press release from Blizzard about its presence as part of Xbox during the event. “We are incredibly excited to bring Warcraft, Diablo, and Overwatch to our European community at gamescom,” said Johanna Faries, President of Blizzard Entertainment. “It’s wonderful to be able to travel to Cologne alongside some of our talented developers so that we can gather with players and celebrate the special connections that continue to be forged within our universes together.”</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, last week, known Xbox Insider Parris Lilly already claimed that, following the amazing Xbox showcase earlier this month, the Xbox team had a lot more to show. In addition, the insider <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2024-show-will-be-big-xbox-insider-says-plenty-of-stuff-wasnt-shown-during-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said that Microsoft's Xbox Gamescom 2024 will be "big"</a>. "Told ya that Showcase was gonna be good and the wild thing is I had multiple people at Xbox tell me there was so much more they could have shown", Parris said on the ResetEra forums last week. "Gamescom is shaping up to be a big show too", he added.</p>
<p>Gamescom 2024 is taking place in Cologne between 21-25 August 2024. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about the event.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24181086/marvel-nyx-2024-preview-ms-marvel-wolverine<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Mqqn2D">Whether or not <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/9/20/20875610/house-of-x-5-x-men-resurrection-professor-x-apocalypse-explained">the Krakoan age of the X-Men</a> was your cup of tea, you’ll have to admit: It was about as far from everyday human life the characters had ever gotten. Living on a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2021/6/28/22550965/marvel-x-men-krakoa-sex-babies-way-of-x">paradise island</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/26/21153170/x-men-7-crucible-nightcrawler-jonathan-hickman-scarlet-witch">inventing mutant religion</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/22537362/x-men-planet-size-marvel-comics-universe">terraforming Mars</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/9/20/20875610/house-of-x-5-x-men-resurrection-professor-x-apocalypse-explained">triumphing over death</a> — it was a long way from Kansas. </p>
<p id="ufZmkU">Now, the Krakoan era is over, and Marvel’s new line of X-Men comics is scattering the characters to superhero adventures across the globe, in titles like <em>X-Men</em>, <em>Uncanny X-Men</em>, and <em>Exceptional X-Men</em>. And in the new ongoing series <em>NYX</em>, writers Collin Kelly and Jackson Lanzing, with artist Francesco Mortarino, are bringing a select group of teenage mutants right down to the pavement of New York City to face a completely unfamiliar challenge: Getting through a college course together. </p>
<p id="SM1XAt">“A lot of these [new] books, while there are some incredible solo titles, are X-team books,” Kelly told Polygon via video call, “and they’re very much about X-Men solving X-Men problems. One of the things that we’re lensing in on is <em>Yes, this is arguably a team, but they’re not a superhero team</em>. They are a friendship, they are a community.” </p>
<p id="136CRB"><em>NYX</em> (say it <em>N-Y-X</em>, not <em>Nix</em>) is a throwback title to Marvel’s divisive <em>NYX</em> miniseries of the ’00s, that followed the hard-knock lives of homeless mutant teens in New York City and introduced Laura Kinney/Wolverine to comics canon. But when Kelly and Lanzing talk about their guiding stars for their <em>NYX</em>, they mention <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2018/4/20/17263744/best-new-comics-marvel-runaways-hulu"><em>Runaways</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23954016/marvels-young-avengers-kamala-khan-final-scene"><em>Young Avengers</em></a>, <em>Phonogram</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/9/4/20848000/the-wicked-the-divine-ending-image-comics-kieron-gillen-mckelvie"><em>The Wicked + The Divine</em></a>. </p>

<p id="Q9yEvj">“The cool thing about teen superhero books,” Lanzing said, “is that [characters] tend not to come together over a big threat. They tend to instead be a lot closer to hang out or friendship books. They tend to be a little bit closer to a teen drama, than they do to a big action extravaganza.”</p>
<p id="5txToF">In the case of <em>NYX</em>, leads Ms. Marvel, Sophie Cuckoo, Prodigy, Anole, and Laura Kinney start to get acquainted because some of them are taking the same Empire State University class that another one of them is teaching. (Kelly and Lanzing didn’t specify, but with Prodigy’s mutant power to instantly absorb the studied expertise of those around him, he seems like a shoo-in for professorial duties.) </p>

<p id="KvAQMs">Kelly, himself a university professor, said the course is about examining what the mutant cultural diaspora looks like now that the mutant island paradise is no more. “So we are starting right off the bat with bringing several of these characters together in not a superhero context, but an intellectual educational context.”</p>
<p id="eoDKqv">If that all sounds heady, don’t worry — both writers were emphatic that there’s still plenty of action in <em>NYX</em>, whether it’s Wolverine appointing herself the dark mutant avenger of New York, or a mysterious new mutant villain called the Krakoan, who represents a threat to the continuation of Krakoan-style community in the post-Krakoan world.</p>
<p id="OEYhYU">For more hints at the series — including Anole’s new job bartending at a mutant nightclub, and Ms. Marvel and Wolverine having it out in a very recognizable New York location, check out these four pages of preview art from <em>NYX</em> #1, courtesy of Marvel Comics. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-announces-new-ai-policy-for-game-development/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Embracer Group has released its annual report for 2023/24, and with it comes the revelation of a new AI policy for game development. </p>



<p>The company says that it began rolling out a new “Group AI Policy” over the last year. This policy comes with material to help on-board AI usage as well as provide principles to work by, an overall risk assessment of using AI within game development, and a general risk framework.</p>



<p>“AI has the capability to massively enhance game development by increasing resource efficiency, adding intelligent behaviors, personalization, and optimization to gameplay experiences,” the company said. “By leveraging AI, we create more engaging and immersive experiences that provide each player with a unique, dynamic, and personalized experience. We also see great opportunities for AI in game development speed, logistics and planning.”</p>



<p>Embracer says that it “understands the potential risks” that using AI in game development can provide. However, they want to “empower” their developers with various AI uses.</p>



<p>The use of AI, the company says, isn’t meant to “replace people” in the work being done by studios.</p>



<p>“We do not want to replace people with AI, we want to empower them,” head of privacy and AI governance Tomas Hedman said. “This is the core of our human-centric approach to leveraging the potential with AI.”</p>



<p>He continued: “It’s not just that AI enables our developers to do even more, and to become more efficient on certain tasks, it will also open up coding to a broader group of developers. Entry into the industry might be easier for individuals with disabilities who, for instance, cannot use a keyboard as easily as others.”</p>



<p>Hedman does mention a potential for bias to come from using AI based on its training, specifically in areas like diversity. However, he says, it’s something that has the potential to improve diversity within games over the years if used properly.</p>



<p>As far as more specific uses will be for AI, the company didn’t fully say in its report. Over the last year, Embracer has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-lay-offs-shareholder-value/">laid off over 1,400 employees</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alone-in-the-dark-2024-developer-pieces-interactive-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">counting</a>, cancelled dozens of games, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-splitting-into-three-separate-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a split</a> into three companies.</p>

<p data-characters="420" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">By now, pretty much every gaming news outlet has been talking about the weirdly popular clicker game <em>Banana</em>. I <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/i-played-weird-banana-game-blowing-up-on-steam/">did an article</a> a few days ago, where I took the plunge myself to see what all the fuss was about. Spoiler alert: I didn’t see the appeal (yes, we’ve made that joke already). But it’s tough to deny how much it’s exploded on Steam. Even the developers themselves could not anticipate it.</p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">Recently, the team behind <em>Banana</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2923300/view/6852870308436648531?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a message</a> where a decision has been made based on the changing of some of the community-made bananas. Changed into “something else,” it seems. As such, the studio is “reviewing all the bananas that are public,” having taken on some new artists. The post goes on to say that things “blew up faster than any of us could dream [of].”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">Things have gotten to the point where some are accusing the game of being a bit dodgy, to say the least. However, one of the developers has assured everyone that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/developer-behind-steam-smash-hit-banana-swears-it-isnt-a-scam/"><em>Banana</em> is not a scam</a>, though they acknowledge a former member of the team has been embroiled in suspicious activity in the past. That person has since “parted ways” with the company.</p>
 <h2 id="h-this-is-indeed-bananas" data-injectable="false">This is, indeed, bananas</h2> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">How popular is the game currently? Well, when last I checked in, it was well into the 800,000 concurrent player mark. Now, though? According to the latest data from the third-party site <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2923300/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a>, <em>Banana</em> appears to be fast-approaching the one million mark, having registered 909,733 players earlier today.</p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true">On top of that, it’s still sitting pretty as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second-most played game on Steam</a>. At the time of writing, it’s ahead of <em>Elden Ring</em>, which will almost certainly be making a beeline for the top spot once the <em>Shadow of the Eldtree</em> expansion unlocks later today.</p>
 <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">Seriously, there are some AAA titles that can only dream of this type of popularity. It might not last, but <em>Banana</em> is proof that games are more than just their pixelated boundaries. And also that I really didn’t try hard enough in my programming classes.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1803774842774127085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, Xbox announced that it will return for Gamescom 2024, and it also confirmed just a few of the titles that fans can expect to see.</p>



<p>Xbox says it will host its “biggest booth yet” for the event between August 21 and 25, 2024. In the same thread, Xbox confirmed that the following titles will make an appearance at the event:</p>



<ul>
<li>Age of Mythology: Retold</li>



<li>Avowed </li>



<li>Ara: History Untold</li>



<li>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</li>



<li>Diablo Immortal</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls Online</li>



<li>Fallout 76</li>



<li>Towerborne</li>



<li>World of Warcraft: The War Within</li>
</ul>



<p>Naturally, Xbox added that there is still “more to come.” It’s unclear if that implies Xbox will reveal even more of the titles and ambitious plans for its Gamescom booth.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Today’s announcement comes shortly after Sony officially confirmed it will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-to-skip-gamescom-2024/">not attend Gamescom 2024</a>, marking its fifth absence in a row. It did not offer any further details to explain why. </p>



<p>Further, Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-isnt-going-to-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed last April</a> that it will not join Gamescom this year, either. However, Nintendo just hosted a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy direct showcase</a> this week. And it still plans to reveal the Switch device successor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-successor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during this fiscal year</a>.</p>



<p>Fans are quickly speculating on the potential titles coming to Xbox’s Gamescom booth. Just last week, Phil Spencer also stated that more Xbox games are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pohil-spencer-xbox-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to other platforms</a>. </p>

We seek to empower our employees to enable them to create better, more immersive, and more powerful experiences in the same amount of time," the company said.</p><p>Also in the document, Embracer said it is pushing ahead with plans for AI to work on "relevant tasks" because not doing so could "lead to us losing competitiveness and being outrun by our competitors."</p><p>Embracer said it has launched a company-wide "AI forum" where its teams can discuss the potential for the implementation of AI in its products and the requirements associated with that.</p><p>The company made it clear that there may be hurdles to the implementation of AI into its products and processes, noting that there are laws and requirements around the use of AI, and the nature of these rules are "comprehensive" and may require "continuous updates."</p><p>"AI may also produce unethical, biased, discriminatory or completely wrong results if it has not been properly trained, instructed or used for purposes it was not designed," Embracer said.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-bandai-namcos-most-ambitious-expansion-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Publisher says it has marketed DLC as it would a brand new title, expects "significant impact" on sales of base game</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Bandai Namco says the marketing campaign behind Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion is "unparalleled in its scale" and the publisher's "most ambitious" for DLC to date.</p>
<p>Shadow of the Erdtree launched today and adds a new map with additional dungeons and bosses, extends the story, and features a range of improvements to the RPG elements.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, Bandai Namco Europe's chief marketing and sales officer Anthony Macare said the company's anticipation for this launch has been "sky high."</p>
<p>"We envision Shadow of the Erdtree as a monumental milestone," he said. "It’s not merely an expansion; it’s the largest FromSoftware [expansion] ever crafted, transcending the traditional scope of downloadable content."</p>
<p>He added that the size of Shadow of the Erdtree "rivals the scope of a standalone game," which has driven Bandai Namco's approach to its launch.</p>
<p>"Recognising the significance of this release, we’ve approached the marketing of this expansion with the same vigour and commitment as we would for a brand-new title," he said. "From the initial announcement to the release, we’ve allocated a substantial budget and resources to ensure the campaign’s impact matches the content’s quality.</p>
<p>"This campaign is unparalleled in its scale and by far our most ambitious for an expansion."</p>
<p>Far from being a digital-only release like most expansions, Bandai Namco has prepared "multiple physical and digital editions," including a premium collector's edition, to make a splash at retail.</p>
<p>Macare also expects the launch to "make a significant impact" on sales of Elden Ring, observing that Bandai Namco has already seen a surge in the number of active players in the run-up to Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>
<p>He added the active player count has "reached new heights," and that it's not just the game's early adopters but a wave of new players as well.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, we consider ourselves fortunate that our audience is willing to set aside their other engagements – and not just other video games – to re-immerse themselves in the extraordinary universe FromSoftware crafted once again," he said.</p>
<p>Finally, he addressed a recent <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcgamer.com%2Fgames%2Faction%2Fheres-a-friendly-psa-for-shadow-of-the-erdtree-only-39-of-elden-ring-players-have-beaten-the-optional-boss-necessary-to-reach-the-dlc%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjames.batchelor%40gamesindustry.biz%7Cb5f3f185f9d34c9fd78a08dc9119666d%7C9274ee3f94254109a27f9fb15c10675d%7C0%7C0%7C638544785561148667%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=OPhcV9dmwoDgCb0q3vUMuQCuTCipbmRsWuuVm84c6Ks%3D&amp;reserved=0">PC Gamer report</a> that less the half of Elden Ring's audience on Steam had beaten the boss required to start Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>
<p>"That statistic... does present a unique challenge," he said. "However, with over 25 million units sold, even a fraction of our player base constitutes a substantial audience. Our marketing efforts have been tailored to engage this significant segment effectively."</p>
<p>He added that Bandai Namco believes the expansion's release will be a "powerful motivator" for players to finish the required parts of the game.</p>
<p>"The journey to the DLC is as much a part of the adventure as the content itself, and we’re excited to see players rise to the challenge."</p>

It shouldn’t come as a surprise that some members of the community are unhappy with how much time the developer, The Indie Stone, is taking. This has all come to a head in the comment section of a <em>Project Zomboid</em> YouTuber MrAtomicDuck’s recent video talking about the current state of Build 42, where a lead <em>Zomboid</em> developer Chris Simpson (otherwise known as ‘Lemmy’) stated that the pressure of the development has made him consider outright selling the game off to a different studio.</p>

An Honest Discussion On Project Zomboid's Next Major Update." width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DfHygs1W_yI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>  <p data-characters="641" data-current-count="941" data-injectable="true">Simpson’s full comment to the video in question is quite lengthy, and it’s already been copied and pasted into <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/projectzomboid/comments/1dj4jcm/lemmy_speaks_out_against_the_spiteful_community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the appropriate Reddit discussion thread</a> by user Zontafermg, for future reference. “I’ve not watched the vid for mental health reasons, feel like carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders right now as we always are at this stage of dev, and in my naivety, i looked at these comments and now feel like chewing my lips off my face,” Simpson said. “Am sure it’s fair as Duck is a fair chap, but I can surmise from the comments and nasko’s comments to me what it involves.”</p>
 <p data-characters="648" data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true">I highly recommend reading up on Simpson’s personal experience about working on <em>Project Zomboid</em> for yourself, but the gist of things is that there’s an immense amount of pressure on him and his team to push Build 42 out as soon as possible, which they’re not all that keen on doing. “We don’t have ANY IDEA accurately how long the update will take. That’s why we don’t have ‘release dates’. Most companies don’t know either, and when they are invariably wrong because they are unable to divine the future, they either end up delaying or rushing out while still its broken,” he said.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="748" data-current-count="1048" data-injectable="true">“After posting <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/project-zomboid-posts-striking-before-and-after-screenshots-for-build-42/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that Thursdoid last addressing the issues</a>, everyone in the comments addressing this video seem oddly punitive. As soon as we release we’ll be ‘doing it right’ for doing what everyone drags us over the coals for now. Been through it a million times by now, we’re the bad guys, slow, incompetent, don’t know what we’re doing, feature bloat, all the classics, all the ‘hits’, then we release and its ‘wow this is great, damn am so glad TIS isn’t like all the other companies out there [that do what I was chastising TIS for not doing a few months back]!!’ I’m used to it by now and increasingly cynical and mentally exhausted by it,” Simpson explained.</p>
 <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">The bit that might sound particularly alarming to long-time fans of <em>Zomboid</em>, of course, is the notion that The Indie Stone might wish to wash its hands of the project for the sake of mental health: “We get approached to sell the company and IP all the time, for a LOT,” Simpson said. “It’s sometimes tempting just to be free of this ambient eternal pressure, expectation, and judgment. Honestly, don’t make me talk myself into it any more.”</p>
 <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true">It doesn’t <em>seem</em> like this is what’s going to happen in the end – not yet, at the very least – but it’s plainly obvious that The Indie Stone and Simpson, specifically, are under a huge deal of stress in getting <em>Zomboid</em>‘s Build 42 out and about. Since Simpson has now availed himself of most social media, he has explained he’ll be leaving direct contact with the community to The Indie Stone’s community manager.</p>
 <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="false">Veteran <em>Project Zomboid </em>players will know that this isn’t the first time that <em>Project Zomboid</em> has had development problems in its long tenure. Notably, back in 2011, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/burgled-project-zomboid-hit-with-another-major-set-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Indie Stone was targeted by “crass and cold-hearted” criticism</a> due to losing the game’s code as part of a burglary, so it’s not too strange to see Chris Simpson taking the community’s less tactful commentary to heart. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-group-embraces-ai-despite-potential-risks.906474/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-ai-annual-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Embracer Group has announced a new strategy for incorporating AI into its business, claiming the technology has the power to "massively enhance game development".</p>
<p>In its annual report for the 2023-24 fiscal year, Embracer says AI will help with its production processes by "increasing resource efficiency", as well as "adding intelligent behaviors, personalization, and optimization" opportunities to games.</p>
<p>Despite this enthusiasm, the company says it's aware of some of the potential risks of AI, saying that it doesn't want to "replace people" with AI, but to "empower" them to create games instead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/embracer-group-ai-report-remnant-2-gameplay.jpg?itok=HG1powgG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/embracer-group-ai-report-remnant-2-gameplay.jpg?itok=6heH2Lme 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Remnant 2&nbsp;</em>is just one of the many games under Embracer Group's massive umbrella.</figcaption></figure><p>Embracer privacy and AI governance head Tomas Hedman says that not using AI would represent a "competitive disadvantage", likely referencing some of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-working-hard-on-using-ai-to-make-npc-and-worlds-more-alive-reactive-and">other studios</a> that have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-ceo-pledges-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-and-cutting-edge-tech-to">already decided</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more">embrace AI</a>.</p>
<p>He says that Embracer wants to take a "human-centric approach" to the technology, and that it could have useful applications when it comes to diversity and inclusion, as well as its "tremendous benefits" for creative teams in terms of "scriptwriting, image creation, idea generation, quality control, and more".</p>
<p>In the risk assessment area of its report, Embracer points to AI governance as a potential risk for its business, citing the possibility for AI to produce "unethical, biased, discriminatory or completely wrong results" without proper training.</p>
<p>The company also points to the fact that AI-generated material can't be patented or copyrighted, meaning Embracer might run into "serious copyright or intellectual property issues" without doing its due diligence where AI is concerned.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-ai-adoption-skull-and-bones-embracer.jpg?itok=zrmsWYbl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-ai-adoption-skull-and-bones-embracer.jpg?itok=KsLtjzg_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other studios, including&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>developer Ubisoft, are also exploring AI.</figcaption></figure><p>Significantly, there's no mention of the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ais-climate-impact-goes-beyond-its-emissions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">significant impact AI has on the environment</a>, nor of the ways in which AI has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/21/we-need-to-come-together-british-artists-team-up-to-fight-ai-image-generating-software" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accused of plagiarism on behalf of artists</a> whose work has been used to train large language model systems.</p>
<p>This is a particularly concerning absence given that a significant part of Embracer's report is given over to its intent to be "part of the movement for a climate-neutral industry" and the initiatives it's engaging in to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>Embracer's latest report comes after a year of layoffs and studio closures for the company as part of a "restructuring" effort which has now concluded.</p>
<p>That effort saw studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition">Volition</a> (and, more recently,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alone-in-dark-developer-pieces-interactive-shut-down"><em>Alone in the Dark&nbsp;</em>developer Pieces Interactive</a>) being closed down, as well as&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-saber-interactive">Saber Interactive being sold</a> and many employees across Embracer's studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter">being laid off</a>.</p>
<p>If we compare today's report to last year's, we can see that Embracer claims to have "106 internal game development studios" and "more than 11,000" employees, as compared to last year's "16,600 employees" across 138 studios, so more than 5,000 employees have been let go.</p>
<p>The drop in employees includes a "cumulative headcount reduction" of 1,583 during Embracer's restructuring program, as well as "around 3,000 employees" leaving as part of Saber's sale. It does not include the shutdown of Pieces Interactive, which was announced after this report's cutoff point.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more on all things Embracer, although hopefully, that "more" won't include any further layoffs. In the meantime, you can read Embracer's <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Embracer-Group-publishes-Annual-Report-20232024-240620.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full annual report here</a> if you feel like getting seriously in-depth.</p>

A lot of time is therefore spent running after the Elden Beast instead of actually fighting it.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OMG YOU CAN SUMMON TORRENT DURING THE ELDEN BEAST BOSS FIGHT NOW <a href="https://t.co/pO4JAItlKG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/pO4JAItlKG</a></p>— 𓆣 (@LadyRanni) <a href="https://twitter.com/LadyRanni/status/1803730820626026814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 20, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>"I just saw someone beat the Elden Beast with a cheat engine enabling the use of your horse Torrent during the fight, and this was absolutely the way the boss was meant to be played," wrote X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/velvetbnuuy/status/1798141244159430767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@velvetbnuuy</a> earlier in June. "This is one of the biggest design fumbles in an otherwise amazing game I can think of."</p><p>As the fan notes, many mods have been created to allow Elden Ring players to summon Torrent in the fight, and YouTube videos showcasing the modded battle in action have thousands of views.</p><p>"I got tired of Chase the Boss Simulator 2022 towards the end," wrote GameFAQs user <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/265987-elden-ring/79991891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OnyxZephyr333</a>.

Needless to say, many players wanted FromSoftware to allow Torrent in the fight, and the Elden Ring community has erupted in excitement about today's change.</p><p>"Oh my god, thank you Miyazaki," said one Reddit user, referencing Elden Ring director Hidetaka Miyazaki. "We can finally summon Torrent for the Elden Beast." "Torrent buddy we made it," said someone in the replies.</p><p>The update makes this and several other changes ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's launch tomorrow, June 21.

                <p>There has been an abnormally large number of video game studio closures and layoffs in 2024, which has understandably caused some to worry about the state of the industry. Sometimes, not even successful games are enough to prevent jobs from being lost. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Elden Ring</a> developer From Software hasn't followed suit, and the studio's president Hidetaka Miyazaki says this will be the case as long as he's in charge</p><p>"Speaking to myself and this company, I want to say that this is not something I would wish on the staff at From Software in a million years," Miyazaki told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/fromsoftware-boss-addresses-gaming-industry-layoffs-as-long-as-this-companys-my-responsibility-i-would-not-let-that-happen/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "I'm pretty sure our parent company Kadokawa understands that and shares that view... We can't say with complete certainty what the future's going to hold for From and Kadokawa--at least as long as this company is my responsibility, that's something I would not let happen. So hopefully our players and our fans can take a little bit of assurance from that."</p><p>Elden Ring has already sold over 25 million copies across all platforms, and and that likely gives From Software more leeway if it runs into a potential rough patch. Having said that, video game journalist Lewis Gordon noted that Japanese labor law prevents companies from laying off workers just to pump up the company's revenue numbers for the appearance of profitability.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/lewis_gordon/status/1803030756265992359" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Not saying this isn't a good thing to say, but it's worth noting that enacting such mass layoffs in Japan (to, say, juice the numbers of a quarterly report for shareholders) is essentially illegal. Labor law is what fundamentally protects Japanese employees, not benevolent CEOs. <a href="https://t.co/RNnCBN0nZn" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/RNnCBN0nZn</a></p>  — Lewis Gordon 🐚 (@lewis_gordon) <a href="https://twitter.com/lewis_gordon/status/1803030756265992359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>From Software's new Elden Ring DLC expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, will be released on June 21.</p>

<p data-characters="305" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Epic Games has removed region lock from <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-find-a-war-bus-in-fortnite/">Fortnite</a></em> for all tournaments except Fortnite Champion Series (FNCS). This effectively means that players can join multiple tournaments without any restrictions based on their region. Now, players in the North American region can join tournaments in Europe and Asia.</p> <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="157" data-injectable="false">The official Fortnite Competitive account on X/Twitter announced, “Effective now (apart from FNCS) we will be removing region lock from all tournaments.”</p> <p data-characters="169" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">“This also applies to this season’s ongoing tournaments. If you previously played in one region for an event, you can now play in other regions in that event.”</p> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 Attention competitors!</p><p>Effective now (apart from FNCS) we will be removing region lock from all tournaments. </p><p>This also applies to this season's ongoing tournaments. If you previously played in one region for an event, you can now play in other regions in that event.</p></div>— Fortnite Competitive (@FNCompetitive) <a href="https://twitter.com/FNCompetitive/status/1802784145510150607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="144" data-current-count="144" data-injectable="false">Earlier, players had to wait a whole season to change their season just to take part in a Fortnite Competitive Tournament in a different region.</p> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">The decision from Epic Games was met with a positive response from fans, but the lack of explanation behind this change has created speculations. Some <em>Fortnite</em> fans feel that Epic Games made this decision to tackle an alleged player count on <em>Fortnite</em> or to increase engagement in the competitive modes. However, it is speculation at best with no stats to back these assumptions.</p>
 <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="204" data-injectable="false">Now with no region lock in place, players can even compete in the same tournament in different regions, meaning that they can take part in the Victory Cup in Europe, and then North America, or vice-versa.</p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="false">This gives aspiring competitive players more stages to showcase their skills and earn money. As for streamers, it opens up a new venue of content, as they can extend their streaming sessions to provide more competitive content, as opposed to simply playing ranked or queuing up in public lobbies.</p>

<p data-characters="170" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Sony has released a new PlayStation Portal system update, introducing the ability to join Wi-Fi networks and new visual feedback for using the touchpad on the PS Portal. </p> <h2 id="h-how-to-connect-ps-portal-to-public-wi-fi-network" data-injectable="false">How to connect PS Portal to public Wi-Fi network</h2> <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="548" data-injectable="true">This new update will enable PS Portal users to join public Wi-Fi networks on their PS Portal but there’s a catch to it. The feature is not in-built on the PS Portal and users will require a smartphone or tablet to connect their PS Portal to the Wi-Fi network. When a user wishes to join the public network, the PS Portal will show a QR code that must be scanned via a smartphone or tablet. Scanning the QR code will open up the mobile’s web browser where users have to follow instructions in order to connect the PS Portal to the Wi-Fi network.</p>
 <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="194" data-injectable="false">With this new update, a new visual feedback has been added to highlight the use of the touchpad areas on the PS Portal. The new visual effect will be shown when gamers make use of the touchpad. </p> <p data-characters="26" data-current-count="220" data-injectable="false">Here is how it would look:</p> <figure data-current-count="220" data-injectable="false"><video controls="" src="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/06/abc0b1a4d8f5156184663dec95f90223dd550792.mp4"></video><figcaption>Video via Sony PlayStation</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="575" data-current-count="795" data-injectable="true">Another visual quality-of-life improvement is that the PS Portal will now show the battery level in percentage. So, if the default visual of battery cells does not work for you, and you want a more accurate idea about the battery level of your PS Portal, you can now switch to displaying the battery level in percentage by opening the quick menu, heading to Settings, selecting System, then choose Battery, turn on the Show Battery Percentage option. As you can see in the image below, you can still see the battery levels in percentage and with the classic visual indicator.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Sony PlayStation</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-most-popular-ps-portal-games" data-injectable="false">Most popular PS Portal games</h2> <p data-characters="153" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">Sony has also revealed some of the most popular games on the PS Portal within three months of launch. Here are some of the most popular PS Portal games: </p>
 <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>God of War Ragnarök</em></li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em></li> <li><em>Astro’s Playroom</em></li> <li><em>Fortnite</em></li> <li><em>Rocket League</em></li> <li><em>EA Sports FC 24</em></li> </ul>

<p data-characters="200" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Finding the best build for Jade might be a tricky one in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe</a></em>. She has been touted as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-and-farm-jade-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest support frame</a>, but we have found a way to sort of make her a huge DPS gal with the right mod setup.</p> <h2 id="h-best-jade-build-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">Best Jade build in <em>Warframe</em></h2> <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="110" data-injectable="false">The following build will turn Jade somewhat into a “nuking” frame while still having some support utility.</p> <p data-characters="36" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false"><strong>Auras:</strong> Growing Power and Aerodynamic</p> <p data-characters="15" data-current-count="161" data-injectable="false"><strong>Exilus: </strong>Aviator</p> <p data-characters="4" data-current-count="165" data-injectable="false"><strong>Mods</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true"> <li>Adaptation</li> <li>Archon Vitality</li> <li>Primed Continuity</li> <li>Streamline</li> <li>Umbral Intensify</li> <li>Stretch</li> <li>Augur Reach</li> <li>Transient Fortitude</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="60" data-current-count="60" data-injectable="false"><strong>Arcanes:</strong> Arcane Avenger and Molt Augmented / Arcane Energize</p> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">This setup will give Jade a lot of Range and Strength with a little bit of Duration and Efficiency. It’s to give more bang for your buck for your first and fourth abilities. Since her fourth ability, Glory on High, is an Exalted Weapon, you also need to mod that, which will be below:</p> <p data-characters="10" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false"><strong>Glory Mods</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true"> <li>Galvanized Diffusion</li> <li>Hornet Strike</li> <li>Primed Heated Charge</li> <li>Lethal Torrent</li> <li>Primed Target Cracker</li> <li>Creeping Bullseye</li> <li>Scorch</li> <li>Galvanized Shot</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">While you may be building Jade’s Exalted Weapon with just Heat and a typical crit setup, there’s more once you top this build off with the right Helminth ability and Archon Shards.</p> <h2 id="h-best-helminth-ability-for-jade" data-injectable="false">Best Helminth Ability for Jade</h2> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">If you want to get more out of this build for Jade, the best Helminth ability for her will have to be <strong>Nourish</strong>. It provides a steady way to get more energy per blue orb for her and will add Viral to her Glory Exalted Weapon. She can burn through armor and soften up enemy HP this way, making sure that everything dies faster.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-best-archon-shards-for-jade" data-injectable="false">Best Archon Shards for Jade</h2> <p data-characters="102" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">Since this will be a very energy-hungry build for Jade, you should equip the following Archong Shards:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li>2 Violet Archon Shards – Health pickups give +20% Energy. Energy pickups give +20% Health.</li> <li>1 Topaz Archon Shard – Increase Secondary Critical Chance by 1% every time you kill an enemy affected by Heat Status. Max 50%</li> <li>2 Azure Archon Shards – +50% Energy Max</li> </ul> <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">Of course, if you have the Tauforged versions of these Shards, the build will be even more potent. This way, Jade has another good source of maintaining her energy economy while boosting up the power of her fourth ability.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-jade-build-playstyle" data-injectable="false">Jade build playstyle</h2> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true">With this playstyle, you’ll be primarily using Jade’s fourth ability as previously mentioned. Since you’re always airborne, the Aerodynamic and Aviator mods will always be applied, giving her a ton of damage reduction. Pair that with Adaptation and she’ll be almost unkillable, especially if she’s inside one of her Judgment bubbles.</p>
 <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">In flight, you’ll be casting her Light’s Judgment on enemy clusters and detonating them with the alt-fire of her Glory. It’ll cause all enemies inside and slightly around the bubble to take massive Heat damage.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">You’ll ideally also cast Nourish and Symphony of Mercy as much as possible to always keep them up. Nourish will increase damage output greatly and Symphony of Mercy will either help you survive more or deal more damage.</p>
 <p data-characters="113" data-current-count="113" data-injectable="false">With Arcane Energize, Nourish, and the Violet Shards, Jade will be as self-sufficient as ever with energy upkeep.</p> <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">Weirdly enough, even if Jade takes a more DPS role here, her other abilities do have support utility to them. Light’s Judgment will bring in a lot of healing and her Nourish can affect allies. So, in a way, Jade is another jack-of-all-trades.</p>

<p data-characters="298" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Rayka Studio has announced that there’s not long left to wait before you can hop in and play its stunning <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/relive-your-critter-collecting-game-boy-glory-days-with-disc-creatures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creature-collecting</a> RPG, <em>Yaoling: Mythical Journey</em>. The game’s early access launch is just around the corner and packs in a staggering amount of content to play through. </p> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true"><em>Yaoling: Mythical Journey</em> will be released for PC via early access on Steam on <strong>July 16, 2024</strong>. I knew the game initially as<em> Home of the Yokai</em>, but while the name has changed, the gameplay that drew me into it has not. It’s a cozy fusion of turn-based RPG gameplay and combat with creature-collecting, eastern fantasy, and even a bit of base-building for those of us who like slowing down between bouts of epic battles. </p>
 <h2 id="h-yaoling-mythical-journey-has-a-brilliant-art-style-and-more-to-do-than-you-can-shake-a-stick-at-in-early-access" data-injectable="false"><em>Yaoling: Mythical Journey</em> has a brilliant art style and more to do than you can shake a stick at in early access</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Yaoling: Mythical Journey Gameplay Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cDArhNok8k8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">In <em>Yaoling: Mythical Journey</em>, you explore the Land of the Ancients. Here, creatures called Yaolings and humans live together in harmony. You want to become a Yaoling Keeper, sort of like a <em>Pokemon</em> Master, but darkness has corrupted the land. As you continue your training, you’ll free the world from this evil power and develop strong relationships with your Yaolings along the way. </p>
 <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">When it’s released in early access, the game will have over 300 Yaolings to capture, train, and battle with. My ten-year-old self would have been blown away if <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-pokemon-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokemon Red and Blue</a></em> had that many Pokemon to catch. You’ll find them across 30 regions, with some being easier than others to track down. I’m a sucker for the rarest creatures in these sorts of games, so I hope there are legendaries and other rare Yaolings to hunt down. </p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">There’s a massive index of Yaolings you can look through at any time, and every system you’re used to from other creature-collectors has been contextualized in your village in<em>Yaoling: Mythical Journey</em>. This includes a huge building for all your Yaolings, vendors to help you craft new items, and even facilities for minigames such as my favorite in every game, fishing. </p> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="false"><em>Yaoling: Mythical Journey</em> packs a lot into a single game, but its gameplay trailer shows that it all works well together. You can try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2816950/Yaoling_Mythical_Journey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam demo</a> now before its launch. We won’t know what the plan is for updates until the game is out, but I imagine new regions and Yaolings are the baseline, with much more on the way in the future. </p>
