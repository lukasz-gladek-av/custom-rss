            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/27/frostpunk-2-delayed-to-september-after-beta-feedback/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Frostpunk 2 has been delayed to a new release date on 20th September, developer 11 bit studios has announced, as they look to address feedback from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> Beta held a couple months ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/07/frostpunk-2-release-date-25-july/">Previously planned for launch on 25th July</a>, 11 bit is taking an extra two months to try and refine the game in key areas identified by players of the beta – they say the game had an 8/10 from the post-beta survey, which is pretty solid for a work in progress game. There will be changes to game mechanics to help things proceed more smoothly, and improvements to the UI and UX so that it’s the core decision making that gives you pause, not figuring out where that management feature is. And in response to players no longer feeling a connection to the actual citizens of their frozen city, there’s new Zoom Stories to cut back down to the personal level while retaining the broader scope of this diesel-powered sequel.</p>


<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>
<p>1. Additions to the game mechanics</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Changes to temperature, Heat and proximity-based gameplay, including new and rebalanced Hubs, that will make the city-building gameplay deeper and more impactful,</li>
<li>More detailed and flexible workforce management,</li>
<li>More direct-use abilities in the game loop, to allow you to react to crises more dynamically,</li>
<li>A new resource to make city-building and expansion more strategic, helping you stabilise the city’s economy,</li>
<li>Ability to reshape your districts after their construction,</li>
<li>Factions’ behaviour that is better aligned with their lore,</li>
<li>A more thorough and complex approach to dealing with protests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Extensive UI &amp; UX enhancement</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Improving the HUD (Head-Up Display) to make it clearer and more intuitive,</li>
<li>Adding a new construction menu along with five new city Hubs,</li>
<li>Improving the clarity, readability and look &amp; feel of the Idea Tree and frostland.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. A new city feature called ‘Zoom Stories’</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Zoom in on specific city parts to watch the day-to-day life of citizens</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the above features have already been previewed and tested by a select few players, while 11 bit state that these are not the full extent of what they’re working on over the next few months.</p>

<p>Looking back at that original game, Jason wrote in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">Frostpunk review,</a> “Frostpunk is a horrifyingly playable post-apocalyptic survival game that demands more out of you than most games ever could. Each decision and each sacrifice you make is hard on your city and on you. There are so many impossible choices and no win situations that the game is almost hard to play, but it’s so compelling that you will be unable to step away from it. The only real negative is the sheer overwhelming nature of the world the game is set in, and really that is more of a compliment to the designers than anything else.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-top-5-million-in-under-a-week.913281/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>sales have hit a major milestone less than a week after the long-awaited DLC's release, publisher Bandai Namco has revealed.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/eldenring/status/1806326803276906929" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly known as Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>has sold five million copies since its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-release-date">release this past Friday</a>. The publisher extends its "heartfelt gratitude" to those who are treading "the path left by Kindly Miquella".</p>
<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>itself has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million">sold 25 million copies</a>&nbsp;at last count, that means around 20% of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s players have picked up the DLC so far. It's likely that more players will discover the Land of Shadow as time goes on, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-fire.jpg?itok=6cKNkUAt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-fire.jpg?itok=XPazlTWn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is selling very well.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is the first - and probably also the last - expansion for From Software's huge open-world masterpiece&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>. The DLC adds a number of new bosses to fight, as well as new lands to explore and new weapons to collect.</p>
<p>Since it's a From Software project,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>boasts a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-trailer">typically obscure story</a>, but on the face of it, you're journeying to the mysterious Land of Shadow to follow in the footsteps of the Empyrean Miquella and discover the reason behind his journey.</p>
<p>Along the way, you'll have to reckon with the terrifying Messmer and his all-encompassing flame, plus plenty of other creatures that would love to kill you and display you on their mantelpiece.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-fight.jpg?itok=XLYWjjXS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-fight.jpg?itok=Iv2jCOEy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>For more of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s excellent combat, look no further than&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>On release,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>garnered <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16525/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/reviews" rel="noopener" target="_blank">universal acclaim amongst critics</a>, who praised its rich exploration, wealth of new weapons, and highly difficult bosses.</p>
<p>However, the difficulty of the DLC proved a sticking point for many players;&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>debuted to a Mixed rating on Steam (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/?curator_clanid=41005067#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now sitting at Mostly Positive</a>), with many players complaining about its difficulty being too high.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Bandai Namco <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-update-easier">issued an update for the DLC</a> to address this issue, and while it doesn't address things like boss attack patterns, it does make Blessings more potent, thereby potentially increasing players' damage while lowering the damage they take from enemies.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/9PMPZZLKQM43" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-game-recording-beta</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can-try-out-steams-new-game-recording-tools-right-now.913278/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-game-recording-beta<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has announced a new suite of Steam game recording tools which will allow you to record, clip, and share game footage directly within Steam.</p>
<p>Per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/6087258371786989397" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official announcement</a>, the aptly-named Steam Game Recording feature offers two ways to capture your footage. You can either grab it in the background without needing to press record, or you can set the feature up to record on-demand according to your input.</p>
<p>Once footage has been captured, you can easily and quickly replay it, grab clips from it, and share those clips either to Steam chat or to external platforms.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-game-recording-beta-timeline.jpg?itok=P9BGPYhz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-game-recording-beta-timeline.jpg?itok=VFkWZ4Es 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Steam Game Recording lets you grab footage direct from Steam without needing third-party apps.</figcaption></figure><p>The tool's Timeline feature appears while you're recording, and if a game is "Timeline-enhanced", it'll automatically generate markers for certain events, like killing bosses or discovering new areas. Of course, you can also add your own markers.</p>
<p>Right now, two games are Timeline-enhanced, and it won't surprise you to learn they're both Valve games:&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-surprise-releases-counter-strike-2">Counter-Strike 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dota 2</em>.</p>
<p>Once you've got your footage, you can save it as a clip or export it as an MP4, and you can also send clips between a PC and a Steam Deck. Oh, that's right: Steam Game Recording is completely functional on Steam Deck as well.</p>
<p>The new Game Recording tool works across any Steam game; as long as you can access the Steam overlay, you can access Game Recording as well, which is pretty neat. Not all games are Timeline-enhanced, though.</p>
<p>You can also tell Steam how much disk space you want footage to take up, as well as for how long you want the tool to record if it's set up not to need your input.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-game-recording-beta-helldivers-2.jpg?itok=8n-mnmlc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-game-recording-beta-helldivers-2.jpg?itok=Q57fkjdM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new Steam Game Recording tool looks pretty powerful.</figcaption></figure><p>Steam Game Recording is available right now if you're using the Steam beta client; all you need to do is head to Settings, then Game Recording (assuming your Steam client is up to date).</p>
<p>If you're not using the beta, just head to your Steam settings, then Interface, then Beta Participation. Pick one of the two betas to participate in, then update and/or restart your client as needed.</p>
<p>As well as announcing the Game Recording beta, Valve also released some interesting Steam Input <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4142827237888316811" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stats</a> yesterday. According to Valve, controller use on Steam has tripled since 2018.</p>
<p>59% of controller sessions are using Xbox controllers, Valve says, while 26% are using PlayStation controllers and 10% are Steam Deck users.</p>
<p>Presumably, some of them will also eventually be users of the <a href="https://hori.jp/products/hpc/hpc-055/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newly-announced Wireless Horipad</a>, which is launching in October in Japan. No word yet on a Western release, so stay tuned for more.</p>

That is hilarious when you think about how the games he and FromSoftware have become famous for have garnered a community known for fawning over difficulty and creating the hateful phrase “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-calls-for-an-end-to-git-gud-1847272679&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-calls-for-an-end-to-git-gud-1847272679">git gud</a></span>.” The director reveals that once he’s developed a game, he typically doesn’t pick it up as a player, but ahead of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> he forced himself through <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p><p>But if Miyazaki sucks so much at video games, how did he get through <em>Elden Ring</em>? “My approach or play style was to use everything I have at my disposal,” he says, “all the assistance, every scrap of aid that the game offers, and also all the knowledge that I have as the architect of the game.” While that last part about designing the game doesn’t apply to other players, Miyazaki’s play style has some great lessons for anyone hitting a wall in<em> Elden Ring</em>: It’s ok to use something if the game provides it. </p><p><em>Elden Ring </em>takes the Soulslike formula and opens it up, quite literally, in the form of a sprawling world players can explore at their own pace. Per Miyazaki, this “lowered the barrier of entry,” and made the game more accessible to players. For some, that open design and the inclusion of mechanics like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-curseblade-meera-spirit-ash-where-find-1851554428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-curseblade-meera-spirit-ash-where-find-1851554428">Spirit Ashes</a></span> (which let you summon NPC aid) took away from the need to ‘git gud.’ Those people then began to accuse players who use those tools of not playing the “right way” or playing on easy mode. But with Miyazaki playing with those offered aids, it’s pretty clear that the right way to play is any way you want, and that the ‘git gud’ argument is bullshit. </p><p>Miyazaki and the developers at FromSoftware created every system with the intent that it would support players in surmounting the challenges they face, there is nothing wrong with using them. That is true in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>as well: summon as many co-op players and Spirit Ashes as you need to pummel enemies into the ground. Just remember, it’s what Miyazaki would do.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The news dump contradicted <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.resetera.com/threads/pyoro-leaks-switch-game-announcements-part-4.860007/page-23&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/pyoro-leaks-switch-game-announcements-part-4.860007/page-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pyoro’s vague expectation-setting</a></span> ahead of time, and seemed to expose them as out of information.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-21/rumors-go-dark-as-video-game-leakers-face-a-reckoning?sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-21/rumors-go-dark-as-video-game-leakers-face-a-reckoning?sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As <em>Bloomberg</em></a></span> reported at the time, fans quickly realized that unlike previous Nintendo Directs, many of the games announced didn’t immediately have store pages go live on the eShop, suggesting that perhaps backend data from those listings was part of how Pyoro had been getting their information. The leaker then took the incredibly odd step of leaking their own source to <em>Bloomberg</em>, stating that source was a Nintendo employee in Japan and  that the “backend theory is a reasonable guess” about where that person got their information from. Even more surprisingly, Pyoro later locked their account after stating they hadn’t expected their comments to a reporter to be included in a news article. </p><p>Store pages for the games announced last week have only recently started going live, including the one revealing the unexpected $60 premium for <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>. It’s possible that this is one of the steps Nintendo is taking to crack down on leaks, alongside potentially shifting how it engages with video hosting services like YouTube. We’ll have a better sense of how those strategies are working when and if we <em>don’t</em> hear about future upcoming announcements, including for likely Switch 2 launch games. </p><p>In the meantime, the video game leaking scene is still in shambles. Midori, another mysterious leaker, was recently revealed to be well known male <em>Persona</em> fan posing as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/midori-mysticdistance-leak-persona-6-kingdom-hearts-4-1851536988&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/midori-mysticdistance-leak-persona-6-kingdom-hearts-4-1851536988">a mysterious Japanese woman</a></span>. Until a new hero rises up, super fans will just have to wait for the eventual press releases like everyone else. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

(If you’re still hoping to play, check out IGN’s guide on <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/How_to_Prepare_for_the_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">How to Prepare for the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</a>.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Many would assume this to be an issue for developer FromSoftware and Bandai Namco, given the game itself is essentially stopping more than half its player base from accessing the DLC and therefore wanting to spend more money. But Bandai Namco Europe's chief marketing and sales officer Anthony Macare told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-bandai-namcos-most-ambitious-expansion-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GI.biz</u></a> that Elden Ring sold so many copies that it doesn't matter.</p><p>"That statistic does present a unique challenge," he said. "However, with over 25 million units sold, even a fraction of our player base constitutes a substantial audience. Our marketing efforts have been tailored to engage this significant segment effectively."</p><p>Five million sales after just three days on sale is an incredible result for Shadow of the Erdtree, and suggests an impressive 20% of Elden Ring base game owners paid another $40 for the DLC. Sales will surely increase over time, as Elden Ring's did over the course of 2022 and 2023.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>After an initial ‘mixed’ Steam user review rating for Shadow of the Erdtree, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-down-to-mixed-on-steam-as-players-complain-about-the-difficulty-and-performance">sparked by a feeling its bosses are too hard as well as performance problems</a>, the DLC is now up to ‘mostly positive.’ Shadow of the Erdtree has certainly enjoyed critical acclaim, and has become the highest-rated video game expansion of all-time by overtaking Witcher 3 DLC Blood and Wine on Metacritic. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review"><u>Shadow of the Erdtree review</u></a> returned a 10/10. We said: “Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single-player DLC expansions. It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/meet-the-nintendo-3ds-fans-hoping-to-finally-beat-puzzle-swap-by-tracking-down-its-rarest-puzzle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I vividly remember from young adulthood the thrill of pulling my 3DS out of my bag at the end of the day and seeing the familiar blinking light indicating I’d received a StreetPass while I was out and about. I’d open the app and see the Miis of the different people I’d passed that day, with cute messages and silly hats. And every time, I’d immediately open Puzzle Swap to see what puzzle pieces they had given me.</p><p>When I first started Puzzle Swap, I entertained delusions that I might someday complete every puzzle just by passing fellow 3DS owners on the street. I quickly learned this was a nigh-impossible fantasy for a number of reasons, one of which being that several of the available puzzles couldn’t even be unlocked unless I traveled across the globe for special, limited-time events where unique puzzles were being handed out. I settled for trying to finish the various Mario, Kirby, and Zelda-themed puzzles that came by default on the device, or through occasional online updates. Admittedly, I never managed that either.</p><p>Now, my 3DS is gathering dust in a cabinet somewhere, its online services having been permanently shut down earlier this year and my motivation to use it having long since dried up. But a dedicated group of fans are still trying to realize the dream of collecting every Puzzle Swap puzzle, and they’re doggedly working to find their white whale: ANA: the rarest puzzle of them all.</p><h2>Chasing ANA</h2><p>The missing puzzle is a bit of a strange one. It’s called ANAでDS, ANA for short, with ANA standing for “All Nippon Airways.” It’s a special puzzle distributed way back in 2012 from July 21 to September 30 in Japan, but only at three select airport locations: Haneda Airport Terminal 2 (Tokyo), New Chitose Airport (Hokkaido), and Naha Airport (Okinawa). What’s more, the puzzle itself cannot be passed to others via StreetPass. You can collect pieces from others who have them if you already have the puzzle unlocked, but with the event having concluded over a decade ago, there’s no “legitimate” way to acquire the puzzle if you didn’t receive it at the time. As a result, the puzzle is exceptionally rare compared to other puzzles distributed more widely, eluding many hunters over the years. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/26/20-ana28jap29-1719439427538.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>An image of the completed ANA puzzle, courtesy of the Nintendo fan Wiki. Notably, while all the other puzzles have high quality images, all we have of ANA is a photo of a 3DS screen. <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Puzzle_Swap">https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Puzzle_Swap</a></figcaption></figure></output><p>Which is where Benny and his fellow puzzle hunters come in.</p><p>Benny runs a Discord server called The Search for ANAでDS, where roughly 20 individuals have been collaborating over the last several weeks to track down the final missing puzzle. Benny tells me he became interested in finding ANA only recently, after his love for the 3DS was reignited thanks to a homebrew application called NetPass, which allows players to receive StreetPasses over the internet.</p><p>Through his interest in NetPass, Benny stumbled upon and joined the search for the Japan-exclusive マックでDS ビッグマック (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetPassNetwork/comments/1cyb3bg/japanese_big_mac_puzzle_%E3%83%9E%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%81%A7ds_%E3%83%93%E3%83%83%E3%82%B0%E3%83%9E%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF_is_now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a picture of a McDonald’s Big Mac</u></a>), which was only just officially cataloged last month. Just before that, others in the community managed to track down another time-limited puzzle, EU-exclusive <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetPassNetwork/comments/1cmgtrp/european_puzzle_swappers_obtain_the_event_puzzle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mario &amp; Happy</u></a>. With the inclusion of both Mario &amp; Happy and the Big Mac, 62 of Puzzle Swap’s 63 total puzzles were officially uploaded online and available for anyone to download. With just one puzzle left, Benny’s next objective was clear: ANA.</p><p>“Those puzzles were easier to recover because the required SpotPass data had already been dumped by users on the Internet; it was essentially just a matter of finding the data,” Benny explains. “In this case, it is more difficult because to the best of our knowledge, the ANAでDS puzzle data has not been publicly dumped anywhere, so we have to search for someone who has the puzzle so we can recover the required data from them directly”</p><p>What Benny and his fellow hunters need to document ANA is simple on its face: they just have to find one individual who has the puzzle unlocked on their 3DS who is willing to upload a file from their SD card to the internet. That’s it! No homebrew or modding required, and the individual doesn’t even need to have the puzzle completed. Just a single piece is enough.</p><p>Since May, the group has been spreading the word to news outlets, subreddits, forums, and other communities in an effort to find ANA. Once the file is uploaded, the community will take matters from there and incorporate the puzzle into a larger file with all the other puzzles, enabling anyone who wants a complete puzzle collection and doesn’t mind a bit of homebrew to download all 63 puzzles at once.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Do you have the rarest StreetPass puzzle? ✈️</p><p>In summer 2012, Nintendo collaborated with All Nippon Airways to distribute the Puzzle Swap puzzle “ANAでDS”. Currently, this is the only lost puzzle out of the entire collection.</p><p>(a 🧵; 1/?) <a href="https://t.co/XqogPwQvSD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/XqogPwQvSD</a></p></div>— The Search for ANAでDS (@PuzzleSwapANA) <a href="https://twitter.com/PuzzleSwapANA/status/1805680588524818567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 25, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>“If someone has the puzzle, they can contact us by email at puzzleswapana@gmail.com, send us a Twitter/X direct message at @PuzzleSwapANA, or join our Discord server at https://discord.gg/JTAJF3DgxY and we will guide them through completing the simple steps needed to recover the puzzle's SpotPass data (it should only take at most 10 minutes),” Benny explains.</p><h2>Puzzle Preservation</h2><p>It may seem strange that a community has rallied around a game like Puzzle Swap especially after Nintendo officially <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63227/~/announcement-of-discontinuation-of-online-services-for-nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>discontinued online communications</u></a> for the device earlier this year. While local communications are still possible, meaning StreetPass itself still works, not a lot of folks are carting 3DSes around in their bags in 2024.</p><p>But a number of those I spoke to in the community tell me that it was Nintendo’s discontinuation of services for the 3DS that motivated them to pick up the handheld device again.</p><p>“I’m personally using it about as much as my switch, but I think the shutdown motivated a lot of people (me at least) to start archiving, modding, getting replacement services (ie Pretendo), etc,” said Croton, another community member who’s been heavily involved in the hunt, “like I forget when the shutdown was announced but I only just modded on a random Tuesday in October, and when the SpotPass archival server started recovering game data I modded my family’s 4 other 3ds’s to archive more data.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even if it’s a relatively unknown or niche part of the legacy of the 3DS, it still matters.</p></div><p>Some of those in the community are in it simply for the collect-a-thon. One community member, MrNoobingtonThelll, tells me that after the Big Mac puzzle was found some of the energy for puzzle hunting started to die down. “[T]he missing puzzles topic kinda died but Benny was one of the few one [sic] actively searching for it, so with my collectors anxiety of [100 percenting] a game I started to offer a little help.”</p><p>Others, like Ninja Squid, see the hunt as critical to game preservation. “It’s rewarding to be a part of this team and see all the amazing work we’ve done,” he said. “Finding this puzzle is important because, even if it’s a relatively unknown or niche part of the legacy of the 3ds, it still matters and is a big part of eventually archiving most of the history of the 3ds. [I]t’s a very neat novelty from an interesting time in Nintendo’s history that I would love to know is accessible to anyone. Being a part of this gives me the opportunity to help archive an important and rare piece of this amazing console’s history, and it’s nice to know that we are getting to be one big step closer to archiving as much of the 3ds as possible.”</p><p>At the time this piece is being written, the ANA hunters do have one lead – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/random-streetpass-fans-are-hunting-for-a-super-rare-puzzle-swap-panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a comment on a NintendoLife article from a user claiming to have ANA on their DS</u></a>. The community has reached out and is waiting for a response. In the meantime, they’re keeping their eyes open for other leads on ANA in case this one falls through. But overall, the mood is hopeful.</p><p>“[D]ude since the file for every puzzle combined is new the first person to complete ana ds would be the first to actually beat puzzle swap,” observed MrNoobingtonThelll.</p><p>He may just be right – and it only took 13 years.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

You have the power to see them all. Help the spirit community to thrive again and use their magic – fly with the Harpien, dive with the Nixen, run through the Grasslands with the Zlatorog. Blend foraging, farming and crafting with heartfelt relationships and a community rich with stories. Embark on a serene journey to bring harmony to the worlds of humans and mountain spirits, transforming Kindred Vale back into a haven of peace and beauty.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_895537"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Bridge the Two Worlds</strong> – The Spirits and humans of Kindred Vale lived in harmony for many years before a tragic rift came between them. Ever since, more and more of the town has slipped into the magical fogs the folkloric creatures use to protect their home. This divide has led people to lose touch with the spirits. You, alone, can still see them all, interact with and communicate with them. You have the chance to mend old wounds and rebuild the trust that has been lost. It is up to you to bring the two communities back together.</li><li><strong>Encounter the Spirits</strong> – Kindred Vale is full of spirits inspired by the folklore of our home in the Austrian Alps. Wolpertinger, Perchten, the Tatzelwurm and many more are a part of life in Kindred Vale and always have been. By interacting with the spirits and exploring their needs, you’ll be able to befriend them and rebuild their trust in humanity, as well as unlocking strange and wonderful abilities that only you can harness.</li><li><strong>Use the Spirits’ Magical Gifts</strong> – Each spirit has a unique gift that allows you to explore Kindred Vale like never before. After befriending them, fly up to the peaks of the Alps with the Harpyien, dive down to the depths of the lake with the Nixen​, venture to the hidden places of the forest with the Wolpertinger​, or speed through the grasslands with the legendary Zlatarog. Use these gifts to help restore Kindred Vale to the peaceful and harmonious place it once was.</li><li><strong>Meet the Townspeople</strong> – Kindred Vale features a diverse community of townspeople. Like the Spirits, they have their own unique personalities, likes and dislikes. Each brings a distinct story and perspective to the town, which will be added to as we bring more and more updates to the game. Who you befriend is completely up to you. Among them, you may even find that special someone who makes your heart flutter, with relationships adding yet more depth to each character.</li><li><strong>Forage, Cook, Craft, and Decorate</strong> – <em>Kindred Vale</em> reimagines the cozy game classics! Once you’ve settled into town, you can forage and fish ingredients to cook, craft furniture to decorate your home, and give a range of gifts to your fellow townies. Unlock and discover more recipes through your interactions, explore the surrounding areas to find parts of Kindred Vale’s long history, and take them back to be celebrated in the local museum.</li><li><strong>Uncover the Secrets of the Vale</strong> – Kindred Vale is truly unique—nestled in the heart of vast mountains, lush grasslands, a beautiful lake and a mysterious forest. And in town, each district has much to offer; its own look and unique spirit. Explore at your own pace and enjoy the amazing views and vistas the area has to offer.</li></ul><p>But, there is more to Kindred Vale than meets the eye. The protective fogs that cover much of the town hold secrets that many don’t know and some don’t speak of. By working with both people and spirits to unify the town, you can uncover the truth of what happened many years ago, mend the rift between the two communities and—maybe—even learn something about yourself along the way…</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

        <p>49 people were reportedly let go yesterday</p>

    </div><div>



            <p><strong>Update</strong>: Gameloft has confirmed layoffs to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, with a spokesperson saying it was "necessary" for the studio to "implement a reduction in workforce" due to the current situation of the games market.</p>
<p>"As a company, we need to constantly review our production capacities," the statement read. "After careful consideration and in response to the ever-changing market conditions we are facing, it has become necessary to implement a reduction in workforce. </p>
<p>"Unfortunately, this leads us to substantially reduce our production activity in our Toronto studio and to let go some employees of the office. This decision has not been taken lightly, and we understand the impact it may have on affected employees. We will be working with them, on a case-by-case basis, to find the best way to handle their situation."</p>
<p><strong>Original story</strong>: The majority of Gameloft Toronto has reportedly been laid off, <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> has been told.</p>
<p>Only HR, IT, and management are believed to be unaffected by the cuts, which reportedly would see the developer's title, 2016's Disney Magic Kingdoms, transferred to Gameloft's studio in Kharkiv, Ukraine. All staff who had been working on the title in Toronto have reportedly been laid off, representing around 49 people.</p>
<p>In addition to our own sources, community manager Tasha Huggins has written a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7211838073465184256/">Linkedin post</a> in which she mentions that yesterday was her last day at Gameloft Toronto.</p>
<p>"As of today, there is a lot of incredible talent that has just entered the market," she said. "If you are interviewing anyone from the Gameloft Toronto/Disney Magic Kingdoms team, please reach out to me. I would love another opportunity to talk about just how amazing they are."</p>
<p>According to our information, the other project Gameloft Toronto was working on has been cancelled following the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gameloft-sees-staff-redundancies-in-lviv-and-toronto-offices">first round of layoffs at the company back in February</a>.</p>
<p>A second round of redundancies reportedly happened in April, during which 40 people were also let go.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> has reached out to Gameloft for comment.</p>

I’m not interested in clearing the base game prerequisites necessary to access it, nor am I really in the mood for the type of game it so clearly is right now. That said, I am positive I could beat it – obliterate it, actually – if I had a dedicated therapist to help me regulate my emotions throughout the process.</p><p>Kai Cenat, one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, recently brought in a therapist to help him topple the biggest <em>Elden Ring</em> boss of all: his feelings. By that point, Cenat had been marathoning the game for <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kaicenat/video/2180034612?filter=archives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 90 hours</a> and had died nearly 1,000 times. Dozens of those hours had been gobbled up solely by the expansion’s <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/shadows-of-the-erdtree-currently-has-a-mixed-status-on-steam-with-many-of-the-negative-reviews-complaining-that-the-bosses-are-too-hard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oft-lamented-about final boss</a>. Cenat missed his friends. He missed touching grass. He was frustrated, bordering on despondent. Then the therapist arrived:</p><p>Seven hours and 79 deaths later, Cenat <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2181718739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slew <em>Erdtree</em>’s final boss</a>, proving that therapy is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/therapy-broken-mental-health-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the solution to all of life’s problems</a>. So yeah, I’m pretty sure that if I had my own <em>Elden Ring</em>-specific therapist, I could buzzsaw through <em>Erdtree</em>’s gallery of notoriously sturdy bosses, probably on my first try. But sadly, I can’t afford one, so I guess we’ll never find out.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Xbox and Amazon have partnered up to deliver Xbox Cloud Gaming via select Fire TV devices.</p>
<p>"Today, we're announcing a collaboration with Amazon where Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members in over 25 countries can play games directly from the Xbox app on select Fire TV devices via cloud gaming, giving people even more choice in how they play their favourite games," Xbox announced earlier today.</p>
<p>The company called this latest cloud-based initiative "a great low-cost, convenient, and portable option" for players, with no console needed to access games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-guides-tips-tricks-9352">Starfield</a> and Fallout 4 on a TV.</p>

<p>Those interested need a Fire TV Stick, a Bluetooth-enabled wireless controller, and an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership "to gain instant access to hundreds of phenomenal games", the team said.</p>
<p>Here are details of how to get it set up, as per <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/27/xbox-cloud-gaming-amazon-fire-tv/">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply install and launch the Xbox app from your Fire TV device.</li>
<li>Sign in with your Microsoft account to play. If you're an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate member, you'll have instant access to hundreds of cloud-enabled games.</li>
<li>Not a member? No worries! You can join Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/ultimate">one low monthly price</a>, or check out Fortnite without a membership.</li>
<li>Connect a Bluetooth-enabled wireless controller. Controllers like the Xbox Wireless Controller, Xbox Adaptive Controller, PlayStation DualSense, or DualShock 4 controller are all compatible.</li>
<li>Start Playing!</li>

<p>"Over the past several years, we have been on a journey to deliver cloud gaming to more devices and to more people around the globe. We are excited to add Fire TV to our growing family of cloud gaming devices and eager to welcome new players into this experience," Xbox wrote.</p>
<p>"This increased availability and flexibility provide an ideal jumping-on point for anyone looking to see what the buzz around cloud gaming is all about," <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/xbox-gaming-on-amazon-fire-tv">Amazon</a> added in its own post.</p>

<p>Nintendo knows it takes more time for larger games to be released than before.</p>



<p>Over the last 10+ years, one thing that’s been common is how long it has taken for new large-scale games to launch. It’s a subject many people have questions about, and was even brought up during Nintendo’s annual shareholders meeting on Thursday.</p>



<p>As part of the Q&amp;A portion of the meeting, Nintendo was asked about the length between games in their franchises with Super Mario Bros. Wonder  being used as an example. Specifically, they were asked about releasing games in a series on a more consistent basis as opposed to the “once-in-a-decade” cycle. </p>



<p>“Currently, game development times are becoming longer and more complex,” the company said as <a href="https://x.com/NStyles/status/1806145357073842419">translated by NStyles</a> on Twitter. “We are expanding and investing in development resources.”</p>



<p>“The length of development time is unavoidable due to the advancement of game consoles,” senior managing executive officer Shinya Takahashi said. “The development environment has also improved, so I think we are making efforts to shorten the time. I want to create games that are fun and entertaining in a short period of time.” </p>







<p>Senior officer Takashi Tezuka then added, “When I talk about Mario Wonder, I was surprised that it took 11 years from the previous game. In the meantime, we’ve also released Mario Maker and 3D Mario. </p>



<p>“We’ve offered a number of Mario-related games. We are developing the game while thinking about how to make people fall in love with Nintendo. We are also considering short-term titles.”</p>



<p>Currently, Nintendo has a number of new games across its various franchises set to release this year, including Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and Super Mario Party Jamboree. </p>

<p>Nintendo knows about all of the online leaks surrounding its games and hardware development, and its working to prevent them from continuing.</p>



<p>During its annual shareholders meeting on Thursday, Nintendo commented on the leaks for the first time publicly when asked about it during the Q&amp;A section of the meeting. </p>



<p>“We have become aware of the specific issues pointed out through media reports and other sources,” Nintendo said as <a href="https://x.com/NStyles/status/1806143409180279055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">translated by NStyles</a> on Twitter. “We work with specialist companies to diagnose information security and take various other measures.</p>



<p>“The company has introduced information security management as part of its internal information security system, and is also working on continuous education for employees.”</p>



<p>These leaks have come from various sources within Nintendo as it was recently revealed by one well-known leaker Pyoro that their source was from a Nintendo of Japan employee. It was also uncovered that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-youtube-leaks-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google employees on the YouTube side</a> of the business had been able to access private Nintendo videos in order to get information out to leakers.</p>

                <p>In the '80s, some of the classic arcade characters weren't always called by the names that we know them by today. Pac-Man was originally Puck Man, which was changed in America because of how easily that name could have been defaced into an expletive. Even Mario was internally called Mr. Video and Jumpman before Nintendo settled on his famous name. Now, several of Donkey Kong's potential names have resurfaced, and one of the possibilities was Kong Dong.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-could-have-been-called-kong-dong-nintendo-court-documents-state" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, that very amusing alternate name for Donkey Kong emerged in legal documents from Universal Pictures' lawsuit against Nintendo, which were scanned by gaming historian <a href="https://x.com/GamingHistorian/status/1222939644217757697" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Norman Caruso</a>. Some of the other potential names Nintendo considered for Donkey Kong were Kong Man, Mr. Kong, Big Kong, Giant Kong, Kong Boy, Funny Kong, and Kong the Kong. The final Donkey Kong name was chosen as a rough translation of "Dumb Ape."</p>

      </div>
<p>In retrospect, Nintendo made the right call by going with Donkey Kong for the original 1981 video game that also introduced Mario to the world. However, Universal's 1982 lawsuit contended that Nintendo had infringed upon the studio's King Kong and sued the video game company for a share of the game's profits. Nintendo emerged triumphant in court when the company's attorney, John Kirby, successfully cited an earlier court case in which Universal argued that King Kong and all of its associated characters were in the public domain.</p><p>Universal and Nintendo eventually buried the hatchet, which led to Nintendo themed lands in Universal Studios locations around the world and The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which featured Seth Rogen as the voice of Donkey Kong. Of course, the Donkey Kong video game franchise lives on with a port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-preorder-nintendo-switch/1100-6524388/" data-ref-id="1100-6524388">Donkey Kong Returns</a> heading to Nintendo Switch in early 2025.</p>

                <p>Microsoft and Amazon have officially announced a new partnership to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to Amazon Fire TV devices. The collaboration will begin in July and will roll out to 25 countries, allowing owners of supported Amazon TVs to play cloud games directly from the Xbox app. You'll need to own either the Fire TV Stick 4K Max or the Fire TV Stick 4K, and Xbox says that games like Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2, Starfield, Forza Horizon 5, and titles from the Fallout series will be supported.</p><p>"The expansion of Xbox gaming to Fire TV devices offers players another option for enjoying their favorite games using devices they already own," Xbox Experiences and Platforms Engineering VP Ashley McKissick said in a press statement. "For those who don't own an Xbox console, this provides an affordable and convenient way to get started. With Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, there's something for every type of player. We look forward to having more people join the Xbox gaming community."</p><p>To get started, you'll need to have the Fire Stick hardware, a Microsoft account, a subscription to Game Pass Ultimate, and a Bluetooth-enabled controller. Xbox and PlayStation controllers are supported, and once you're connected, you can start playing. Cloud gaming has been a big focus for Xbox for several years now, as the company has continued to develop this technology and fine-tune it.</p><p>Last year, plans for Microsoft's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-next-gen-plans-leaked-cloud-hybrid-console-planned-for-2028/1100-6517814/" data-ref-id="1100-6517814">next generation of consoles</a> leaked and showed a focus on "cloud hybrid" technology, and recently, a patent for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-streaming-console-patent-unearthed-showing-what-cloud-gaming-could-have-been/1100-6524542/" data-ref-id="1100-6524542">console that could stream Xbox games through the cloud</a> was unearthed, though it's believed this was a previous and unreleased design. In 2022, an Xbox app was released for Samsung TVs and brought cloud gaming to those devices.</p><p>Developing dedicated cloud gaming consoles like this have turned out to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-why-the-xbox-streaming-console-isnt-ready-yet/1100-6509207/" data-ref-id="1100-6509207">more expensive than Microsoft anticipated</a>--Xbox chief Phil Spencer was aiming to release a device priced between $99-$129--but the Amazon Fire Sticks are more affordable in comparison, as their prices start at 4K.</p>

<p>Assetto Corsa Evo aims to “[redefine] the concept of realism and the features of one of the most popular cross-platform driving simulations ever developed.” The game will include cars from multiple classes – AC Competizione was all about GT3, in contrast – and so will include road cars, classics, hypercars, prototypes and racing cars.</p>


<p>All of this is being reproduced with modelling that takes mechanical, electronic and aerodynamic performance into account, while circuits have been captured using Laserscan technology. That feeds into a new algorithm that simulates asphalt behaviour through dynamic weather conditions, to make changing weather feel all the more realistic.</p>

<p>From initial screenshots, comparing hub caps and other clues, we’ve spotted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alfa Romeo Giulia GTAm</li>
<li>Alpine A110</li>
<li>Alpine A290_β</li>
<li>Hyundai N Vision 74</li>

<li>Porsche 911 (930)</li>
<li><span>Porsche 911 GT3 Cup (992)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>As for the race circuits, we spy Imola, Nurburgring Nordschleife and Brands Hatch. Here’s the iconic Variante Alta chicane in the wet-ish:</p>


<p>Kunoz Simulazioni is stepping away from Unreal Engine to make this happen. AC Evo will have a new proprietary graphics engine specifically for driving simulations, promising photorealistic details and support for both VR and triple screen racing rigs.</p>
<p>It’s not currently clear what form the Assetto Corsa Evo launch will take. Both previous games in the series launched first into Steam Early Access, matured to a full launch on PC, and then made the jump to console down the road. We’d expect AC Evo to take a similar path, but have asked for clarification.</p>
<p>PC requirements on Steam look to be fairly modest for 2024, essentially taking the recommended spec GPUs from Competizioni and having those be the new minimum spec here. Either a GeForce GTX 1070 or Radeon RX 580 will be the minimum, while a GeForce RTX 2070 or Radeon RX 5600 is the recommended spec. It’s worth noting that they state you will need 100GB of SSD storage to run the game from.</p>
<p>Looking back at Assetto Corsa Competizioni, I said in our PS5 and Xbox Series X|S review that “Where the original console release of Assetto Corsa Competizione had some huge caveats hanging over it, the game’s release on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S brings it up to spec, effectively matching the PC version. It still has some weaknesses in presentation and structure for new players in particular, but once you get into the groove, it’s one of the best sim racers you can buy right now.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/massive-palworld-update-brings-new-island-new-pals-and-much-more.913143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-palworld-update-sakurajima<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has released a new&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's a big one, bringing a brand new island to explore, new Pals to meet and befriend (or potentially exploit), and more.</p>
<p>We first learned about this update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-summer-game-fest-2024-announcement">during the Summer Game Fest Live showcase</a>, but now, the full patch notes have been revealed, showing just how much is being added.</p>
<p>First up, you've got a whole new island to explore in the form of Sakurajima, which will give you the chance to battle the new Moonflowers faction, as well as to explore a new area and meet plenty of new Pals.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-update-sakurajima-moon.jpg?itok=_Kj5EfWa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-update-sakurajima-moon.jpg?itok=FQlA_Y0z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New Pals and more are waiting for you in the latest&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>update.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're of a mind to take on other players, then a new arena in the Dessicated Desert will give you the chance to do just that, but if you prefer more PvE-focused engagements, you'll want to try out the new Oil Rig Stronghold instead.</p>
<p>Said Oil Rig offers the chance to amass the new Crude Oil resource, which allows you to craft Plasteel, an essential material for higher-tier upgrades.</p>
<p><em>Palworld</em>'s level cap has been increased to 55 in this update, too, giving you the opportunity for further adventures, and you can also look forward to tons of new weapons, items, and cosmetics.</p>
<p>This is, of course, all in addition to the usual smorgasbord of bug fixes and minor gameplay improvements, all of which should hopefully give you a good excuse to head back into&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and start up those production lines once more.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game that takes influence from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-company-issues-statement-about-palworld-as-game-passes-8-million-copies-sold">the likes of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-company-issues-statement-about-palworld-as-game-passes-8-million-copies-sold">Pokemon</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>.</p>
<p>The game, which is currently in Early Access, sees you roaming an open world, meeting creatures known as Pals, and working alongside them (or cruelly exploiting them) to achieve whatever ends you desire.</p>
<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>has picked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet">a massive number of players</a> since its launch back in January, no doubt aided by its inclusion as a Game Pass game on day one, although its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-finally-dethrones-baldurs-gate-3-as-most-played-game-on-steam-deck-in-february">Steam numbers are also mighty impressive</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's also available on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

            <p>This War of Mine developer 11 bit studios has made the decision to postpone the release of Frostpunk 2, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frostpunk-2s-beta-period-has-been-announced">following the game's beta</a>.</p>
<p>In a post shared on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/4203628368742496775">Steam</a>, the studio thanked all those who took part in the beta, saying the average rating from the experience was a healthy eight out of 10. "We are super grateful for that," the Frostpunk 2 team wrote.</p>
<p>However, it noted that along with some positive comments, it also took the time to analyse and prioritise what the studio wanted to add into the game, and - in order to "properly do them justice" and "guarantee the best possible experience" at launch - the team came to the conclusion it should postpone Frostpunk 2's release.</p>

<p>"We know this is not the news you wanted to hear," it wrote. "However, we believe these additional features are something you deserve to see in-game on day one, not in a patch added after the release.</p>
<p>"We can only hope you understand that our decision comes from a place of wanting to create the best game possible for you."</p>
<p>11 bit studios is now planning to release Frostpunk 2 on 20th September. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frostpunk-2-to-launch-as-day-one-release-with-game-pass"> It will launch straight into PC Games Pass</a>, as previously announced.</p>
<p>"One thing is certain - these few weeks will pass by VERY quickly for us, because we're cooking some really exciting stuff," the studio continued. "The list is too long to go through all at once, but the highlights include new additions to the game mechanics, extensive UI &amp; UX enhancement and, by popular demand, a new city feature we like to call Zoom Stories."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-delayed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Frostpunk 2, the highly-anticipated sequel to 2018's Frostpunk from 11 Bit Studios, has been delayed by two months.</p>
<p>Game directors Jakub Stokalski and Łukasz Juszczyk announced the delay in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/4203628368742496775" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new development update</a> on Steam. According to the duo, the game is getting "bigger and better", but in order to implement the changes following feedback received from the game's beta, additional time is needed. "Before we go into detail on the new additions, there’s one drawback we need to be upfront about", the duo writes. "As we analyzed your feedback and prioritized things we want to add to the game, we realized that to properly do them justice – and to guarantee the best possible experience at launch – we need more time to finish the development of Frostpunk 2. That’s why we made the difficult decision to&nbsp;postpone its release to September 20th, 2024."</p>
<p>New additions to Frostpunk 2 include more detailed and flexible workforce management, extensive UI and UX enhancements, a new city feature called 'zoom stories', which allows players to watch citizens up close, and more. "In the Beta survey, you pointed out that after shifting the game’s scale, you lost attachment to individuals", the update from Stokalski and Juszczyk reads. "Indeed, Frostpunk 2 plays out on a much larger scale, but we want to give you an opportunity to get close to your citizens as much as possible even in this new frame. That’s why we’re adding something we like to call ‘Zoom Stories’, which are basically zoom-ins available in specific city parts that allow you to watch the day-to-day life of your citizens.</p>
<p>Frostpunk 2 was first slated for a release on July 25, but as mentioned, will now release on September 20 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Earlier this month we <a href="https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-story-mode-hands-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted our hands-on article</a> with the game's story mode. <em>"Everything I've tried in Frostpunk 2, from the earlier utopia builder to this hands-on with the early stages of the story, gives that feel of a natural expansion that should be found in a successful sequel. What was micro is now macro, but it still feels like Frostpunk."</em></p>

  <p id="EvVJYA">We <em>love</em> anime here at Polygon. But we <em>also</em> love <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22762260/best-anime-one-season">recommending anime</a>. Whether it’s the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22783137/best-anime-on-netflix">best anime on Netflix</a>, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23891489/best-anime-movies-watch-streaming-netflix-hulu-prime-max">best movies to watch</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23960593/new-anime-2024-release-calendar-schedule-watch-streaming">seasonal premieres</a>, or just the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24074811/best-anime-2024">best of the year</a>, we’re always trying to introduce readers to new and exciting shows, movies, and shorts they’ll love. And now, we want to find the perfect anime for you. (Yes — we mean <em>you</em>.)</p>
<p id="MHNdUK">That’s why we have this regular open thread dedicated to helping you, our dear readers, find the perfect watch. Looking for a limited series that will tell a self-contained story with questions that linger with you forever? We’ve got you. Looking to find the next deep cut to watch so you can branch out from whatever seasonal favorite you’ve been watching? We’ve got you there too.</p>
<p id="DQEOOH">From 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. EDT, I will be in the comments section down below answering your questions and fielding requests for what you should watch. This is also a great place to share what you’ve been watching, if you want to talk about that with your fellow Polygon readers! Participation is very welcome, even without questions.</p>
<p id="7Nj4Qf">A little bit about me, your curator for this go round: I’m Toussaint Egan, a curation editor here at Polygon. I’m pretty open to every genre of anime, though my tastes primarily skew toward sci-fi, action, horror, psychological thrillers, and mecha. Aside from watching the spring season of anime, I’ve been having a blast lately working my way through the Universal Century continuity of Mobile Suit Gundam. I’m currently enjoying <em>Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory </em>and <em>Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</em>, and I also recently had the pleasure of rewatching the 4K remaster of <em>Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence</em> in theaters.</p>
<p id="dR0xF8">I firmly hold to the belief that there is anime for every type of viewer — even if only one. Whether or not that anime is available to purchase, rent, or stream online or as a physical copy is another matter entirely, but still — there’s a wealth of beautifully crafted stories the medium has to offer. There’s no one “right” way to be an anime fan, so no matter whether you’re new to anime or a seasoned simulcast watcher, you are welcome here.</p>
<p id="rB37f0">Now it’s time to turn it around to you. What would you like to watch this weekend (or what are you planning to watch)? Leave a request in the comments and I’ll get to it between 3:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. EDT. Details help — let me know what you’re looking for, some idea of your taste as a viewer, and any other relevant info you feel like sharing (like the streaming services you have access to, or what it was about a show you’re looking to emulate, if anything).</p>
<p id="yx50jZ">Some examples of good queries from past TV and movie recs threads:</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiBmgse9GTc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new trailer</a> released today, Aspyr revealed that the classic game Star Wars: Bounty Hunter is coming to all platforms on August 1, 2024.</p>



<p>It will be available on PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation, including current-gen consoles. According to today’s trailer description, fans who pre-order Star Wars: Bounty Hunter now can get a 10% discount. </p>



<p>Star Wars: Bounty Hunter originally launched in 2002 for PlayStation 2 and Gamecube. Limited Run Games later released a limited edition of the game for PlayStation 4. </p>



<p>According to a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/27/jango-fett-returns-in-enhanced-star-wars-bounty-hunter-coming-to-ps5-august-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, Aspyr’s Star Wars: Bounty Hunter release will be an enhanced version. It will feature visual improvements, PS5 features like integrated adaptive triggers, and more.</p>

<p>Today’s announcement raised concerns again over the way Aspyr handled the Star Wars Battlefront Classic Collection. That collection launched to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-battlefront-collection-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mostly Negative Steam reviews</a>, largely due to bugs and server issues.</p>



<p>Aspyr did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-update-released-on-pc/">update the game</a> soon after launch, but the update still didn’t address server problems. The team later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/developer-aspyr-address-star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-launch-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addressed the launch issues</a>, citing “critical errors with our network infrastructure.” </p>



<p>However, fan backlash remained fairly strong. The Star Wars Battlefront Classic Collection still has a 2.4 user score on Metacritic.</p>



<p>Aspyr was also previously working on a Knights of the Old Republic remake, but that was later dropped. Last April, Saber Interactive did confirm that the remake is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still “alive and well,”</a> during an interview with IGN.</p>
