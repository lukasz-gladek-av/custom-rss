<figure data-uuid="f8804591966af"><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f8804591966af/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, Team Cherry surprised us all with the shadow drop release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> (at least, it would have been a surprise if its PEGI rating hadn't cropped up online before), and the studio snuck out a new update to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>The ver. 1.5.12459 update isn't packed with game-changing additions, but it's always nice to see Team Cherry fine-tuning the experience. Alongside new screen resolution support for PC players, the patch also introduces "many under-the-hood improvements brought over from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> to the original game," Team Cherry said in a <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollowknightupgraded">blog post</a>. And yes, this update is available on both Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared in an announcement on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/367520/view/526493182068785899">Steam</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Hollow Knight ver. 1.5.12459 (Released 5th Feb 2026)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>- Added support for 21:9 &amp; 16:10 resolutions.<br>
- Game now pauses while in inventory menus.<br>
- Upgraded to Unity Input System for broader controller support (original input system is still available, if preferred, via Options&gt;Controller&gt;Advanced Settings)<br>
- Added dithering effect, and dithering options, to reduce colour banding.<br>
- Fixed a softlock in City of Tears Grub room.<br>
- Reduced Grey Prince Zote's stagger bounce height.<br>
- Updated Sly's Great Slash collider to closer match visual.<br>
- Salubra's Blessing now deactivates after reaching max Soul.<br>
- Map panning is now smoother.<br>
- Various performance improvements.<br>
- Various smaller fixes and tweaks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The new Switch 2 version of Hollow Knight boasts improved resolution, frame rate, and a handful of additional effects, with a new 120fps option to boot. We've added our thoughts about the new release to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hollow-knight">our original review</a> below, saying, "Honestly, if you haven't played Hollow Knight, the Switch 2 Edition is a no-brainer".</p>

            <guid>1428388</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>MindsEye</strong> was the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/">worst game of 2025 by Metacritic's standards</a>. While developer <strong>Build a Rocket Boy</strong> has made significant strides to work on and improve the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mindseye-update-is-a-big-step-forward-for-both-build-a-rocket-boy-and-mindseye-new-content-is-in-development/">including a major update that was released earlier this week</a>, the studio's co-chief executive officer, <strong>Mark Gerhard</strong>, reportedly believes the game's issues stem from more than just Build a Rocket Boy (BaRB) failing to deliver a solid product.</p>



<p>In a new report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/">Insider-Gaming</a>, the studio claims to have obtained <strong>evidence</strong> of a "<em><strong>coordinated campaign</strong> to <strong>purposefully and maliciously damage Build a Rocket Boy's reputation and undermine confidence in MindsEye</strong>. We are working with our legal team and taking steps to address this</em>."</p>



<p>That comes from a statement BaRB sent to Insider-Gaming, after the publication requested a comment on information it had obtained from an internal meeting, where Gerhard not only claimed that the studio had "<em>caught the guys who've been sabotaging MindsEye</em>," but that the alleged sabotage campaign involved the perpetrators spending upwards of <strong></strong><strong>€</strong>1 million (approximately <strong>$1.1 million USD</strong>).</p>



<p>So who are the alleged devils behind the sabotage campaign? According to Insider-Gaming's report, it stemmed from a company based in the UK called <strong><a href="https://www.ritualnetwork.com/">Ritual Network</a></strong>, and video network, influencer management and advertising company. Allegedly working with Ritual Network in this claimed smear campaign includes a number of influencers, three journalists, and some internal employees at BaRB.</p>



<p>Gerhard reportedly added that the individuals accused of carrying out the alleged sabotage campaign "<em>will all be served in person, criminal complaints, shortly</em>," with the specific charges being <em>"espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference</em>." He added, "<em>Everyone who's involved has real problems, including the company behind it. This is the start of our comeback</em>."</p>



<p>A statement from Ritual Network denies the allegations, saying, "<em>Ritual Network is a creator support platform and is not involved in the matter you referenced. We are not aware of any legitimate legal action involving Ritual Network and have not been provided with any evidence supporting these claims. Any suggestion that Ritual Network is connected to these allegations is incorrect.</em>"</p>



<p>Later in the meeting, Gerhard also reportedly added that the studio will "<em>use these people, these names and these facts for our own fun</em>," confirming that his intention is to "<em>put some of these names into our upcoming spy mission</em>." This spy mission is also reportedly the one that was supposed to include <strong>Hitman's Agent 47</strong>, though that collaboration is no longer in the works <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-said-to-have-ended-publishing-deal-with-io-interactive-after-last-years-mindseye-bomb/">since BaRB and <strong>IO Interactive</strong> ended their publishing agreement</a>. Instead, it'll be reshaped to include the alleged perpetrators.</p>



<p>"<em>Let's tell the community the story before it even plays out in court</em>," Gerhard reportedly added. "<em>So, you know, I think this is not us being the victim. We've taken a couple of punches. We've kept turning the other cheek while we got our house in order. And now it's time to start judoing this right back at them. And, you know, so let's have some fun with it. At the end of the day, we're storytellers, we're game makers</em>."</p>



<p>Last year, when MindsEye launched in an undeniably broken state, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">with players asking for refunds</a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">reports of mass layoffs</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/"> (that were later confirmed)</a> coming less than a month after its launch, the studio said it was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">"<em>heartbroken</em>"</a></strong> with how things had gone, and vowed to keep working on the game to make it up to players and realize the vision it always had for MindsEye.</p>



<p>At the same time, Gerhard and his fellow co-chief executive officer, <strong>Leslie Benzies</strong>, who you might also recognize as a former long-time producer at <strong>Rockstar</strong> who worked on several games in the <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> series and both <strong>Red Dead Redemption </strong>titles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-ceo-blames-saboteurs-mindseye-struggles/">also blamed internal and external "<em><strong>saboteurs</strong></em>" for the game and the studio's woes</a>. </p>



<p>But while BaRB leadership was busy pointing fingers, developers at the studio pointed them right back at Gerhard and Benzies. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developers-call-out-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-build-a-rocket-boy/">93 BaRB developers called out Gerhard and Benzies in an open letter</a></strong> last October for "<em>longstanding disrespect and mistreatment of your staff</em>."</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>For years, you have expected them to adapt to your every whim, with those in disagreement being shut down or cast aside. We estimate a UK-majority of the 250-300 workers across the company have now lost their livelihoods. These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce's years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade</em>," the letter reads.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into. BaRB needs to change. CEOs need to take a backseat and allow the skilled people who remain at the company to forge the path ahead</em>."</p>



<p>A little more than a week after the open letter was published, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-report-details-how-leslie-benzies-leadership-failed-staff/">a report from the BBC also pointed to the studio's internal issues stemming from its leadership,</a> with Benzies and Gerhard cited as the problem once again. "<em>Leslie never decided on what game he wanted to make. There was no coherent direction</em>," one BaRB developer told the BBC. The report added that when employees would bring their concerns to Benzies and Gerhard, they were "<em>just ignored</em>" and even "<em>laughed at</em>."</p>



<p>It's important to remember all of this when looking at the last major point of Insider-Gaming's report, which is that BaRB leadership had an employee monitoring and cybersecurity software called <strong>Teramind</strong> installed to track employee behaviour, <strong>without employees' knowledge</strong>.</p>



<p>The report adds that Gerhard took "<em>full responsibility</em>" for the poor way the software was rolled out and that he hopes to have it removed in three months' time. That said, Gerhard also reportedly stipulated, "<em>I think it goes without saying that we can trust 99.9% of this business. The problem is it's the one. It's the 1%. That is the problem, and, you know, the next 90 days for this business are absolutely critical</em>."</p>



<p>If Gerhard and BaRB actually do have the evidence to prove that there has been a sabotage campaign rolled out against BaRB and MindsEye, then that drastically changes the story around this game and adds credence to why BaRB leadership would spy on its employees without telling its staff. </p>



<p>If not, then what we're more likely seeing is another video game industry story where poor leadership and mismanagement have led to those in charge pointing their finger everywhere but at themselves, with hundreds of developers losing their livelihoods in the process, and players who, unfortunately, spent their hard-earned money on an unfinished product that may remain in that state forever.</p>



<p>If you're wondering what players think of MindsEye after all this time and all of its patches, some of its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/#app_reviews_hash">user reviews on Steam</a> in the last 30 days are positive, noting improvements to AI-controlled characters and the introduction of new missions. However, there are still several negative reviews citing technical issues that have not been fixed, and perhaps more importantly, those negative reviews are citing more than just technical problems, like the game's writing, pacing, lack of gameplay variety, and other problems, which show MindsEye's issues go far beyond a few bugs and meme-worthy screenshots.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>This week saw the early access launch of turn-based tactics game Menace, created by the piss-swigging misanthropes behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-brothers">Battle Brothers</a>. Julian has been having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jetpacking-space-pirates-taught-me-a-painful-lesson-in-punishing-strategy-game-menace">a wonderful time</a> playing it and learning about the importance of spare ammo and adequate reconnaissance. It could have been worse, Julian. Your antivirus software could have deleted some of the game’s files. This being one of the currently known issues listed in the patch notes for the game’s first proper update.</p><!--more-->
<p>“Some antivirus programs incorrectly classify the 'GameAssembly.dll' file as malware and delete it, making the game unplayable,” explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2432860/view/540003980950897283?l=english">the Steam post in question</a>. “If that happens please whitelist the ‘GameAssembly.dll’ and ‘Menace.exe’.” A simple-enough fix, then.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why, exactly, some antivirus programs have a bone to pick with Menace, and I have to say, I am a little suspicious. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/streamer-raising-funds-for-cancer-care-loses-32000-to-steam-game-malware-thanks-to-appalling-levels-of-vetting">It’s not like Steam games are malware-proof</a>. The other way of looking at it, of course, is that your antivirus is trying gallantly to spare you the humiliation of being pinned down and bombarded by some entry-level space pirates. You, the pride and flower of the Terran Congressional Republic Navy!</p>
<p>As if there weren’t already pirates enough, the update adds a few more: "pirate veteran scavengers”, "pirate veteran scavenger armor", and the fearsome-sounding "pirate heavy machinegun truck". Julian! Stop sobbing into your Space Weetabix and help me make sense of these miscellaneous game tweaks. They’ve adjusted the splash screen for ultra wide monitors, which sounds positive, but I’m not sure what to make of “anti-tank mines now also trigger for especially large units other than vehicles”. Are you a mine-layer, Julian, or do you tend to be the one triggering them?</p><p>There are some hefty balancing tweaks in here too. They’ve added a heat mechanic to laser rifles and plasma rifles, instead of regular ammunition, and given pirate EMP units a motion scanner accessory. That’s going to ruin somebody’s day (Julian's). Are you playing Menace? Seems like it’s a sturdy bit of turn-based brain-o-war, whatever your antivirus provider may determine.</p>

Lara Croft’s iconic dual pistols are strapped to her thighs, and she dons her classic small knapsack in green canvas with brown leather straps.

 <p><span>She continued, “I’ve learned I have a perpetual back problem, but I also realized that it’s much easier to kind of build muscle if you’ve ever worked out before in your life, which I never had, so it has taken me months and months and months to get into good shape.” She’s just like me for real.</span></p> <blockquote data-media-max-width="560"> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Sophie Turner performs her own parachute stunt on the Lara Croft set! <a href="https://t.co/j8IzQN9Tpn">https://t.co/j8IzQN9Tpn</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ok2gOFTas2">pic.twitter.com/Ok2gOFTas2</a></p> <p>— TMZ (@TMZ) <a href="https://twitter.com/TMZ/status/2019815012726976672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The woodsy set is located in Surrey, according to the </span><em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15534645/Sophie-Turner-stunts-set-Tomb-Raider.html"><span>Daily Mail</span></a></em><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The series is being produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Crystal Dynamics, with </span><i><span>Fleabag</span></i><span> creator and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge helming the project.

<p>Fortnite loves a good collab. miHoYo and Honkai: Star Rail are joining forces with the Fortnite goliath to create epic content for all players to experience through skins and more, and a release date is available.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/honkai-star-rail/" id="3565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Honkai: Star Rail</a> is another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/hoyoverse/" id="95199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HoYoverse</a> success, with the free-to-play title continuing to dominate the scene over two years after its explosion into the universe. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/epic-games/" id="87655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games</a> smells success from a mile away, which is why a Honkai: Star Rail and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> collab makes too much sense NOT to do.</p>

<p><strong>The Fortnite and Honkai: Star Rail collab goes live on February 26.</strong></p>



<p>This isn’t a collab weeks away or months down the pipeline; the official announcement was revealed on February 6. In the same statement, ‘February 26’ was outed, and arrives one week after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-2-delayed-by-over-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now-delayed Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2</a>.</p>

</ul>



<p>It’s not an extensive crossover, but fans of both franchises will be pleased with the upcoming content.</p>



<p>You can look forward to “A brand-new UEFN island and kick off a creator-involved collaboration tournament,” to celebrate the occasion.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-honkai-star-rail-amp-fortnite-content-amp-skins">All Honkai: Star Rail &amp; Fortnite Content &amp; Skins</h2>

<p>Here’s everything that’s been revealed so far, along with the expected content arriving:</p>



<ul>
<li>Stellaron Hunter Kafka skin (compatible with LEGO styles).</li>

<li>Additional crossover content.</li>

<p><strong>You need to download Honkai: Star Rail from the Epic Games Store during the outlined Fortnite collab period, and “participate in designated activities” to receive a free “Blade” character outfit.</strong></p>

That streak continues today with the release of Episode 2, which adds a heavily requested Ranked Mode, the game's first new warden, a new map, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Episode 2 is live in the game already, and those who boot up the gamewill meet Ekon, a "legendary monster-slayer who shapeshifts into a powerful direwolf to track and hunt his prey." Ekon, who is pictured below, has a passive ability called Dread that reveals the heartbeat of wounded enemies, a tactical ability called Wolf Spirit that let him unleash a spirit wolf to hunt the nearest enemy and apply Dread to them, and an ultimate called Fearsome Howl, where Ekon applies Dread to all enemies across the map and increases his movement speed – it can be cast in human and wolf form (yes, Ekon can transform into a wolf).&nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of today's update, developer Wildlight Entertainment has released a new story cinematic called "Skydrift" centered on Ekon and his place amongst the other Highguard wardens. Launching alongside Ekon is Skydrift, a new map for the game's 3v3 and now-permanent 5v5 raid modes.&nbsp;</p><p>You can check out a look at Skydrift in the image at the top of this story, and you can watch the Skydrift cinematic story trailer below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fYgZOD7FMU4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fYgZOD7FMU4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Perhaps the biggest addition to Highguard with the Episode 2 update is Ranked Mode, which allows players to earn Ranked Points, point modifiers, and more as they climb the ranks to gain unique rewards. You can go from bronze (Hare) to grandmaster (Leviathan) if you're good enough. Ranked Mode will be available only in a 3v3 format, as Wildlight believes "3v3 is the more tactical structure of the game and fits best for comp," according to its <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2019456108734324869">update on X</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>All players will start at bronze 3 rank, and each rank has three divisions to climb through: bronze (Hare), silver (Goat), gold (Ape), platinum (Dire Wolf), diamond (Gryphon), master (Manticore), and grandmaster (Leviathan). At the end of each Episode, you will be rewarded based on your final rank achieved. You can also de-rank within a division during a Split, so be careful. More details about how this Ranked Mode works can be found <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2019456108734324869">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Wolf mount has been added to the game as a rideable beast as part of Episode 2, and is free to all players. If you play 10 matches of Ranked Mode, you will earn the Shadow Wolf skin, which is pictured below.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Square Enix have announced Paranormasight: The Mermaid’s Curse, a summery sequel to horror mystery visual novel Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo. The original game earned itself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paranormasight-the-seven-mysteries-of-honjo-review">a double thumbs-up</a> from former RPS reviews editor Rachel Watts, shortly before she vanished while gathering blood-stained stones one moonlit night. (I am just joshing with you – Rachel is alive and well over at <a href="https://thinkygames.com/">Thinky Games</a>. Remember, there's no such thing as ghosts and there definitely isn't one hovering behind you right now.)</p>
<p>The Mermaid’s Curse should be good, then. It trades the first game’s gloomy streets for the coast of Japan, where young pearl diver Yuza Minakuchi discovers another version of himself at the bottom of the ocean. I routinely discover other versions of myself at the bottom of a bottle of Tuppersmith's Old Peculiar, but nobody's making any dang visual novels about me. Anyway, here’s a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701440/PARANORMASIGHT_The_Mermaids_Curse/">the Steam page</a>, you can expect another multiple-perspective story featuring “a girl of unknown origins, a treasure hunter from a foreign land and a mysterious housewife investigating a drowning”.</p>
<p>You’ll once again be combing 360 degree backgrounds for clues, but there are also new systems and mechanics, including a diving minigame. The backgrounds are “faithful reproductions of real locations and vistas in collaboration with Mie prefecture”. Imagine partnering with horror storytellers to boost tourism. I guess it worked out pretty well for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDHGwnVWpJA">Saga prefecture</a>.</p>
<p>The Mermaid’s Curse is out… remarkably soon! 19th February, in fact. If you missed the first, I will risk being torn apart by Rock Paper Shotgun’s ancestral spirits and point out that it’s currently <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/PARANORMASIGHT-The-Seven-Mysteries-of-Honjo-2340650.html?srsltid=AfmBOopt8WmjdkgwIpfCvBn3ZRNdizrJFDhAljLl-bxGADlIGb0waspF">heavily discounted on Nintendo’s Switch</a>.</p>

            <guid>1428343</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This week’s partner-focused Nintendo Direct did not set the world on fire. In fact, it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-games-fallout-elder-scrolls-2000666038">damningly unimpressive</a>. Unless you love Japanese role-playing games, in which case boy, oh boy, even in its first year the Switch 2 is already shaping up to be the console of your dreams. A flood of recent JRPGs and a ton of new ones on the horizon have paved the way for an unprecedented run of turn-based mechanics, epic boss fights, and rewarding grind marathons on Nintendo’s new hardware. If that sounds horrifying, god bless. For all my other sickos out there, hell yeah!</p> <p>A bust for general audiences, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999">this week’s Switch 2 showcase</a> was a surprise coup for JRPG lovers. It confirmed a whopping nine games in the genre coming to the portable platform between now and the summer, including some really interesting deep cuts that will make a few niche fanbases extra excited. Here’s the list along with release dates:</p>

 <ul> <li><em><strong>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</strong></em> – March 13</li> <li><em><strong>Tales of Arise – Beyond the Dawn Edition</strong></em> – May 22</li> <li><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong></em> – June 3</li> <li><strong>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</strong><em> – &nbsp;June 18</em></li> <li><em><strong>Granblue Fantasy: Relink – Endless Ragnarok</strong></em> – July 9</li> <li><strong><em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em></strong> – July 10</li> <li><em><strong>Culdcept Begins </strong></em>– July 16</li> <li><em><strong>Another Eden Begins </strong></em>– Summer</li> <li><em><strong>Kyoto Xanadu</strong></em> – Summer</li> </ul> <p>Okay, let’s dig into a few of these. <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</em> is a turn-based spin-off in which you hatch, raise, and ride monsters (“Monsties,” lol) instead of fighting them. It’s got a pretty generous free demo out already. The <em>Adventures of Elliot</em> is an HD-2D <em>Zelda</em>-like from the makers of <em>Octopath Traveler</em>. And <em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> is a streamlined action-RPG in which you travel the skies in an airship doing multiplayer <em>Monster Hunter</em>-like raids with really fun combat. It’s coming to Switch 2 for the first time with cross-play and <em>Endless Ragnarok</em>, a new story DLC fans have been hoping for since launch.</p> <h2><em>Culdcept</em> and more make an unexpected comeback</h2> <p>Now for the deep cuts. <em>Culdcept Begin</em>s is a surprise new entry in the long-running, incredibly obscure and esoteric card-based board game series that began on the Sega Saturn. It’s been almost a decade since the last entry came to 3DS, which despite its flaws and rough edges <a href="https://kotaku.com/culdcept-revolt-proves-once-more-how-great-monopoly-an-1819229743">proved that JRPG Monopoly</a> is still a winning formula (with the right people). <em>Kyoto Xanadu</em> is the latest in a series of action-RPG dungeon crawlers from Nihon Falcom. I’ve never played them but it’s a cult favorite.</p>

 <p>Finally we have <em>Another Eden Begins</em>, a mobile game that players have been waiting almost a decade to get a proper console port for. Why do people care? Well, its script was written by Masato Kato who worked on <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. The theme music is by Yasunori Mitsuda, who made the music for <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. And overall the game plays like an old-school turn-based RPG with time-traveling hijinks and a literal frog knight so, yeah. The mobile version was free-to-play and had microtransactions. Hopefully the new port feels more like a proper paid release. We’ll see.</p>

 <p>That’s a good haul of popular ports and more niche releases, but it’s not coming in a vacuum. This trove of 2026 JRPG riches comes after players got <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> and <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> last fall. Earlier this year, we got&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> and&nbsp;<i>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</i>. Switch players who upgrade to Switch 2 finally got to play <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, with the sequel coming in just a few months. In the meantime, February has both <em>Ys X: Proud Nordics</em> and <em>Tales of Berseria Remastered</em>. And later this year there’s <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave</em> and <em>Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter</em>.</p> <p>It’s a wild time. Genre fans are eating well. There’s not enough hours in the day to play even half of these games in 2026, and that’s before we find out about the third <em>FFVII</em> remake game and whatever Monolith Soft is cooking up for the <em>Xenoblade</em> series. Nintendo should probably announce a killer first-party blockbuster for Switch 2 soon, but in the meantime it’s already a JRPG lover’s paradise.</p>

Just like clockwork, one day on, the company has shared an infographic summarising every game that featured.</p>
<p>While it might not have been a presentation of wall-to-wall bangers, there is something quite nice about seeing every game in one image, no? Sure, the biggies like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> immediately draw the eye, but a closer look reminds us that the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/scott-pilgrim-ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/valheim">Valheim</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a> also made an appearance.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wlpvng&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Nintendo shared the image across its social channels, helpfully splitting the announcements up into Switch 2, Switch 2 / 1 and Switch 1 releases, so you can see what's coming up, regardless of which console you own. Here's a closer look at the graphic itself:</p>
<figure data-uuid="f74f5d9845519"><a title="Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase - Feb 2026" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f74f5d9845519/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-feb-2026.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DUajL7qjgI5/">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We'd say that it's not a bad line-up, all in all. Perhaps not the most surprise-packed Direct in recent memory, but there's no denying that the 2026 release calendar is looking particularly stacked for Switch 2.</p>

			<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is a role-playing game that has already become <strong>legendary</strong>, less than one year after its release. Sweeping <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/"><strong>multiple Game of the Year awards</strong></a><strong> </strong>in recognition of its narrative and gameplay achievements, the game developed by French development studio Sandfall Interactive is set to have a lasting influence on the RPG genre as a whole, and it's safe to bet the first <em>Clair Obscur-like</em> game won't take too long to see the light of day.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/"><strong>These awards</strong></a>, however, may be nothing compared to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">high cultural honor</strong> Sandfall Interactive has now received.</p>

Last December it introduced several <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/840068/analogue-3d-transparent-funtastic-limited-edition">transparent versions of the Analogue 3D</a> inspired by Nintendo’s Funtastic N64 series, but this time the company says it drew inspiration from colored versions of the nearly 30-year-old console that Nintendo prototyped, but never released to the public.</p><p>The Prototype Limited Editions versions of the Analogue 3D will be <a href="https://www.analogue.co/3d">available for purchase through the company’s website</a> in limited quantities starting on February 9th at 8AM PT / 11AM ET, and are expected to ship 24 to 48 hours after that. Each will be $299.99, which is slightly more expensive than the $269.99 black or white versions of the console. The new colors include extreme green, ocean, atomic purple, ghost, and glacier, with the last three options being subtler alternatives to the colored collection that launched last December.</p><p>Alongside the new color options, and also available in limited quantities, will be color-matched versions of the 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth controller launching on the same day for $44.99 — which is about $5 more expensive than the standard version. However, the controllers are not expected to ship until sometime in April.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/874494/analogue-3d-4k-n64-console-prototype-limited-editions]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-goes-big-on-portable-bluetooth-speakers-soundlink-plus-restocks-at-a-record-low-for-another-clearance-push-2000662395</link>
            <guid>1428289</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Bose SoundLink Plus is a portable wireless speaker that’s designed for both indoor and outdoor use. A compact, rectangular body with a looped carrying strap makes it easy to hang, grab, or slip into a bag when you’re ready to go. It’s built to be rugged, dustproof, and waterproof (IP67), allowing it to handle wet, sandy conditions and random rain showers without interrupting your music. Plus, its battery lasts up to 20 hours, providing solid playtime for your playlists, podcasts, and background music until you need to recharge.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7081/">Go to Amazon and buy the Bose SoundLink Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $199, down from its original price of $269, for a savings of $70 and 26%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7081/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful speaker that projects sound beautifully</h2>
<p>The sound produced by the Soundlink Plus is engineered to produce rich bass and clean mids, making your music feel full and robust, not thin. The speaker can produce enough decibels to comfortably fill a room or an outdoor area, making it perfect for both relaxing background listening and concentrated sessions. So, whether you’re playing music, podcasts, or dialogue-driven shows, this speaker will provide enough presence to make them audible.</p>
<p>Portability and durability were key factors in the design of this speaker. The loop allows you to hang it securely or attach it to a strap, while the durable outer shell protects against minor mishaps like drops and knocks. Since the speaker is also dustproof and waterproof, you can place it on a picnic table, a beach towel, a poolside ledge, etc., without worrying about damaging it. You can also use the speaker to charge your mobile device if needed, as it can double as a power bank.</p>



<p>Wireless features extend the capabilities of the SoundLink Plus beyond a single-speaker setup when you want to expand coverage. For example, you can pair two SoundLink Plus speakers together for greater stereo width, or engage Party Mode with other Bose portable speakers to play the same track across multiple locations. Bose’s SimpleSync feature also lets this speaker connect with certain Bose smart soundbars and speakers, which can be convenient when you want to send a movie or playlist to other parts of your home without physically moving speakers.</p>
<p>The Bose SoundLink Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker has an IP67 rating, an estimated 20 hours of battery life, a USB-C charging port, the ability to fine-tune your EQ via the Bose app, and the ability to pair with multiple speakers using multi-speaker modes, all at a reduced price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7081/">At $199, compared to the regular retail price of $269, this is a great deal for a high-quality portable wireless speaker to use as your primary music source at home or on the go.</a></p>

These images are from the games’ 2024 beta, so ideally, they’ll look more polished when we see them later this month. We can see several varied environments, including an underwater area, a frozen tundra, grassy fields, and a city. Some of them are very clearly from an early stage in development, though, where a lot of the general shapes are laid out but the details and textures haven’t been added yet.</span></p>

<p>Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2 was supposed to arrive on March 4, 2026, but is now arriving on March 19. </p>



<p>Chapter 7 Season 1 of Fortnite introduces a bunch of new content, including a brand new island, new weapons, collaborations with Hollywood, including Back to the Future and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-to-feature-quentin-tarantinos-dream-kill-bill-chapter-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kill Bill</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Park</a> crossover, and so much more. It seems players will now have to spend some more time with this Season, until Epic Games works on CH7S2. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-7-season-2-now-arrives-on-march-19">Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2 Now Arrives on March 19 </h2>



<p>A new post on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2019788648376393947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) by the official Fortnite Status account confirms that Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2 will now release on March 19, 15 days later than intended. It also includes the caption “opens the loot vault &amp; starts cooking” with a ‘Let Him Build’ version of the Let Him Cook meme. It seems that Fortnite is hinting that they have something special in the works with the upcoming Season, and that’s the reason for the holdup. </p>



<p>Players have a little over a month until the next season begins, and there is a lot to look forward to. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-february-2026-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February roadmap</a> reveals details on events, maps, skins, collabs, and more coming throughout the month. Additionally, the game’s director has teased a “fun update” coming in February, which is designed to “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-director-teases-fun-update-to-spice-up-current-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spice things up</a>” in the current season. </p>



<p>In other news, Paul Heyman wants players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paul-heyman-wwe-2k26-play-instead-fortnite-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to play WWE 2K26</a> instead of Call of Duty and Fortnite. Additionally, Fortnite has teased a brand new collaboration <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-teases-brand-new-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Honkai Star Rail</a>.

It also includes access to soundtracks, a behind-the-scenes gallery, along with boss rush and time attack modes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">007 First Light Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-disney-afternoon-collection-nintendo-switch-2">Disney Afternoon Collection (Switch) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-where-to-buy">Forza Horizon 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-where-to-buy">Mario Tennis Fever Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-where-to-buy">Nioh 3 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2-where-to-buy">Pokemon Pokopia Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-where-to-buy">Resident Evil Requiem Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saros-ps5-where-to-preorder">Saros Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-switch">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-disney-afternoon-collection-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The House of the Dead is being adapted into a film, and today we have some news about its casting.</p>
<p>Earlier, it was announced Isabela Merced is set to lead the movie adaptation based on Sega's zombie shooter. These won't be the first zombies Merced has seen, with the actress recently starring as Dina in the second season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation.</p>
<p>As well as The Last of Us, Merced has also starred in Superman and Alien: Romulus.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/isabela-merced-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation-last-of-us-1236711085/">Deadline</a>, the upcoming House of the Dead film is a "a top Sega priority" after the success of the company's Sonic the Hedgehog films. The adaptation is coming from Resident Evil director Paul W.S. Anderson, who has also written the script. According to the publication, Anderson's House of the Dead film will  have a "fresh take" on the franchise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-film-in-the-works-from-resident-evil-monster-hunter-director">Anderson will also serve as a producer</a>, alongside his partner Jeremy Bolt. In addition, Sega's Toru Nakahara will produce along with Story Kitchen's Dmitri M Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Dan Jevons.</p>
<p>"The House of the Dead is a game I have loved for many years, and I'm beyond thrilled to be bringing this to the big screen with such an exciting talent as Isabela at its heart," Anderson said. "We envisage this as the start of a tentpole franchise which can explore the rich world and lore that Sega has created over a whole series of films."</p><p>Nakahara added: "Working with Isabela is a thrilling opportunity as she embodies the heroine character perfectly, bringing dynamic energy to the production. We're dedicated to crafting a visually striking and immersive experience by introducing compelling actors and terrifying creatures that will bring the House of the Dead universe to life on the big screen.</p>
<p>"With our deep understanding of video game adaptations, we're eager to deliver an electrifying cinematic journey for the franchise's fans."</p>

		<p>2026 is already proving to be another great year for game releases, within the context of long-awaited games being pushed back or cancelled altogether – I’m very sad we’re not getting a Sands of Time remaster, especially when it was seemingly more or less finished. Still, maybe Ubisoft were saving us from ruining our memory of the original. I’ve had plenty of fun this week, continuing to dabble in Highguard, though I can feel the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/04/overwatch-2-is-just-overwatch-again-with-new-story-focus-and-new-characters-including-a-flying-cat-healer/">soon-to-be numberless Overwatch</a> pulling me back with all of the new announcements coming out from Blizzard. Besides that, I’m working on a Monster Hunter Stories 3 preview and a Switch 2 Citadelum review, which may have just totally sold me on the mouse controls on Nintendo’s latest console.</p>
<div id="attachment_468571"><p id="caption-attachment-468571">BAFTA Games in Concert features Helldivers 2 –&nbsp;Image Credit: Andy Paradise</p></div>
<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has played a whole bunch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/02/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-review/">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</a>. He says, “It’s a really good game, thoroughly recommend! In other news, I checked out the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/06/bafta-games-in-concert-opening-night-in-review/">BAFTA Games in Concert</a> at the weekend. It was good, and worth checking out if it comes to an arena near you!”</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/04/nioh-3-review/">played lots of Nioh 3</a>. So much so, that he could only manage to say, “Game good!”</p>


<p><strong>Aran</strong> has continued with Star Wars Outlaws. He says, “40 hours in and I’ve only just landed on the last planet to explore. I’m really enjoying the vibe of the game, getting on my speeder and seeing what’s out there.”</p>
<p>Having watched the credits roll on Hellblade II, <strong>Jim</strong> came away from it with mixed feelings. He told us, “Some truly incredible visual set pieces and character building, though the puzzles felt very rehashed and unimaginative even if they look pretty cool. I also played some more Deadlock, which scratches two itches as I’ve been hankering for both a solid hero shooter and a MOBA, even though I don’t have the free time to fully commit to either.”</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> finally defeated the ram spirit boss in Spirit of the North 2! She said, “I’m just happy it only took me about 30 attempts opposed to some people online who claimed they were at it for months!! Now my fox can go play in the snow in the Frigid Peaks region I love how perturbed the fox looks when it slides down the ice tunnels.”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing three game for review, Romeo is A Dead Man, Aces of Thunder, and Icarus. That’s not all though! He said, “I’ve also fit a few goes of Halls of Torment in as well, and a couple hours of Factorio before I had to stop because it threatened to take over all my time.”</p>
<p>Also busy with reviews, <strong>Ade</strong> gave us a whistle-stop rundown of what he played: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/04/speedball-review/">Speedball</a> (fun but limited), Dispatch – Switch Edition (great if you love black rectangles!), and Aerial Knight’s Dropshot (can’t say, embargoed).</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> has been playing so much Romeo is a Dead Man and so much Code Vein II! Meanwhile, Tuffcub actually turned on his PS5 for the first time in weeks and played Highguard and&nbsp; – shock! Horror! – Destiny 2. He’s also starting off with Reanimal too.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been playing some underwhelming indie horror games that have not scratched the itch before Resident Evil Requiem with The 9th Charnel being the latest. He continued, “I also finished my bedtime Gigasword adventures and absolutely loved my time with it even if it weirdly got easier as it went along. I followed that up with a procedurally generated Metroidvania for review next week and finally a game that I cannot reveal.”</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been revving his two-stroke, as it were, in Ride 6 for review. He also ran through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/05/resident-evil-requiem-and-pragmata-both-show-what-the-switch-2-is-capable-of/">the Pragmata demo</a> on Switch 2 once again, finishing it in around 11 minutes. Can you do better?</p>
<p>What about you? Played anything good?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: Hollow Knight (Switch) - One Of The Finest Metroidvanias That's Not A Metroid Or 'Vania]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hollow-knight</link>
            <guid>1428256</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p><em>This review was originally published in June 2018 when Hollow Knight launched on the Switch 1. To celebrate the release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, we're republishing it along with some brief impressions of the free upgrade, which is available to download now.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The Switch isn't exactly lacking for quirky <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-metroidvania-games">Metroidvanias</a>, with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/yokus_island_express">Yoku's Island Express</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dandara">Dandara</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/steamworld_dig_2">SteamWorld Dig 2</a> all stretching the genre in new and interesting directions. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, though, is arguably the most striking of the lot. Team Cherry's platform-adventure has long been awaited by Switch owners in the know. The game has attracted considerable buzz — and no small amount of fan art — since its PC debut last year. Now Hollow Knight has taken its console bow, and it doesn't disappoint.</p>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/90228/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>You take control of the titular knight, a tiny bug warrior in an insectoid world gone to seed. The art style might be cartoony, but this is a surprisingly mournful setting from the off. The once-mighty kingdom of Hallownest has crumbled, its communities either abandoned or driven mad. All but a few lingering eccentrics have disappeared into the ground, drawn downwards by a mysterious miasma.</p>
<p>It's a beautifully melancholic canvas onto which you must gradually paint in the details. In time-honoured Metroidvania fashion, that involves venturing into the unknown to map out the world, conquering lumbering bosses, and expanding your ability set so that you can access new areas.</p>
<p>Structurally, then, Hollow Knight doesn't offer much that's new, but it's in the execution that it really shines. At the core of the game is a crunchy sword-and-magic combat system. Our knight might carry a so-called 'needle', but this spindly blade lands with a heck of a thwack. The recoil from each hit sends both you and your enemy back a little, which is both empowering and potentially endangering — particularly when battle takes place in the midst of a precarious platforming section.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the movement system is just as tight. Whether you're using the left Joy-Con stick or the D-pad on the Switch Pro Controller, our hero responds beautifully. It's no great spoiler to reveal that one of the first abilities you acquire is a dash, and this quickly becomes a staple part of your calculations throughout your adventure. It grants you extra speed on the floor and additional range and manoeuvrability in mid-air.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/accessibility-report/2208/embed @ 1770396298 -->
<p>Your magical abilities are fuelled by a smart system that feeds on the souls of defeated enemies. Given that your knight's first magical ability is to heal himself, it means that the best form of defence really is attack in Hollow Knight.</p>
<p>Not that you can afford to be too gung-ho about your business. This is a challenging game, with many of the regular grunts employing unorthodox movements and lightning-quick attacks to cause you headaches, particularly in combination. The bosses, meanwhile, will have you failing repeatedly with their formidable health bars and varied attacks.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a>-like system at play here, too, which means that you'll drop your soul along with all of your Geo (the game's currency) when you die. You'll need to backtrack and literally fight your own spirit to regain them.</p>

<p>To explain what really sets Hollow Knight apart from pretty much anything else on the eShop, though, we need to go back to its world design. This is a decidedly 2D game, but it's so thick with detail, shade, and texture that it feels positively three-dimensional. The world is full of items and foreground elements that exist only to be broken or smashed through, adding to an enthralling sense of physicality — and it all runs at a silky smooth frame rate in both docked and portable modes.</p>
<p>The sound design is equally inspired, from the dank drip of a drizzly city to the distinctive (and hilariously human) babble of its characters. The map maker's contented hum and a certain boss's prideful goading when you near his lair are particular stand-outs.</p>
<p>Like indie hits Yoku's Island Express and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a> before it, Hollow Knight feels like it's found its natural home on Switch. The game's beautiful 2D world, tactile combat, and impressive bevvy of secrets constantly drag you in for more, and it proves to be as strong an experience on the move as it is on your TV. On an eShop that's already filled with top-quality indie games, Hollow Knight is one of the very best.</p>

</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hollow Knight is a big, beautiful, forboding Metroidvania that's absolutely thick with detail and feels very much at home on Switch, proving to be as strong an experience on the move as it is on your TV. From its punchy combat system to its charming art and sound design, if you're up for the challenge this is one of the finest, richest adventures you can have on Nintendo Switch.</p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-here-and-in-just-3-hours-it-became-the-most-played-nioh-game-on-steam/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Nioh 3</strong> is officially out, and it only took the game three hours (one for every Nioh game) for it to become the <strong>most-played Nioh game on Steam ever</strong>. After going live at 05:00 UTC, with 22K+ jumping in right away, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3681010/charts/">SteamDB</a>, it had already surpassed its predecessors' concurrent player counts just <strong>three hours later</strong>.</p>



<p>The first Nioh game peaked on Steam at <strong>10,649 concurrent players,</strong> meaning that Nioh 3 had more than doubled the first game's peak concurrent player count right from the start. Nioh 2's peak concurrent player count currently sits at <strong>41,325 players</strong>, which Nioh 3 surpassed by hitting <strong>42,115 players</strong> by 08:00 UTC.</p>



<p>In the hours since then, it didn't just level out at 42K. The game continued to rise and hit a peak of <strong>70,186 players an hour ago, </strong>at the time of this writing. It has since dipped slightly to just under 70K with approximately 52 players needing to sign off, but that doesn't make the accomplishment any less impressive.</p>



<p>Ultimately, concurrent player counts are not the most significant factor for single-player games, though it's worth giving them a look when a new major single-player title launches, especially in this case, when we have two previous games to compare it to. It's not yet Team Ninja's biggest release on Steam overall, though, as <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a></strong> still holds that title with a <strong><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1448440/charts/">75,906 concurrent players peak</a></strong>. That said, if Nioh 3 continues its upward trend, it'll fly by that number in short order.</p>



<p>It's great to see a veteran studio like Team NINJA finding new heights of success in 2026. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-3-review-rise-of-the-shogun/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo gave Nioh 3 a <strong>9.8/10 in his review</strong></a>, and while he admits he has been a fan of Team NINJA's work for years, he's not the only one who shares the sentiment that Nioh 3 may just be one of Team NINJA's best games ever. The game currently sits at an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/nioh-3/"><strong>86 on Metacritic</strong>,</a> with none of its reviews sitting in the 'Negative' column and only six of its reviews in the 'Mixed' column. Hopefully, this milestone is followed by a sales milestone announcement from Team NINJA.</p>



<p>"<em>Nioh 3 is the culmination of Team NINJA’s evolution</em>," writes De Meo. "<em>By masterfully blending the engaging exploration of an open-field structure with a deep, dual-style combat system that bridges the gap between 'Masocore' and character-action, it has evolved into a genre of its own. While technical issues hold the game back, it is the definitive samurai fantasy and a modern masterpiece of action design</em>."</p>

            <p>
The open world dislikers bundle through the door of Dr Shrinko’s office like mardy harlequins, fuming and shrieking in their oversized licensed gear. One is wearing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> brand trousers so long they reach to her eyes. Another sports an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> hat that extends to his ankles. “Doctor, doctor!” they wail. “The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world games</a> are too big. They consume all of our free time. Why, it takes Yasuke 40-100 hours to get from one end of Assassin’s Creed Shadows to the other!”
</p>
<p>
Dr Shrinko leans back in his chair with a pleasant smile. “Solution is simple,” he trills. “Make Yasuke 40-100 times larger.”

<p>
No sooner has the physician spoken when the window of his office explodes. Another man clambers through the gap, straining to move easily against the friction from excessively tight, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sable">Sable</a>-themed pyjamas. “Don’t listen to them, Doctor,” he gasps. “Open world games are too small. Why, you can get through Marvel’s Spider-Man in less than 30 hours, without skimping on sidequests!”
</p>
<p>
Dr Shrinko gestures impatiently. “Then make Peter Parker 30 times smaller.”
</p>
<p>
In case you hadn’t gathered already, Shrinko is an open world exploration game that lets you change your size. There’s <a href="https://ntesh.itch.io/growshrink">a free, work-in-progress build on Itch.io</a>. It’s the most delightful explore-me-do in a while. You play a grinning turquoise tripod who is searching for collectibles - “Stars, Bananas, Jiggies, and the secret Udders”. I don’t really understand the mammary symbolism here, but I’m too overpowered by whimsy to care. Consider: the music alters depending on whether you are unspeakably large or terribly, terribly small.
</p><p>
Some of the collectibles are found in deceptively plain rooms that harbour hidden immensities; others might require you to do a Gigantor and stomp around the skyline. If you’re worried about stepping on people while in kaiju form, take consolation in the fact that the game’s island setting is currently empty of life besides plants and mushrooms. Well, based on the 20 minutes I’ve spent in it, anyway. Perhaps the locals are just hiding. Sensible of them. Dr Shrinko has no time to watch his step. He will secure those udders by any means necessary.
</p>
<p>
The developer, ntesh, is conscious of some blemishes. “The camera is absolutely garbage, I know this, you know this, I am trying really hard, I guess it's a difficult thing to fix,” they rant and rave on the Itch page. What’s more, “sometimes you warp to the ground really fast when running off ledges.” As if that wasn’t enough, “growing near walls can quite often launch you, especially in the city”. The final insult: “this game isn't exactly optimized so there may be screen freezes or jitters”. 
</p>
<p>
Please remove your hair shirt already, ntesh! You have made a game in which I can skydive into a birdbox while jumping over a valley. I think that’s more important than ironing down the frame-rate.

</p>
<p>Thanks for finding it, <a href="https://warpdoor.com/2026/02/06/shrinko/">Warpdoor</a>.</p>

            <guid>1428235</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there anything more frustrating than heading out and realizing your phone or laptop is almost out of power, or dying in the middle of something important when you’re on the go? Probably not.</p>
<p>This is where an efficient power bank can come in handy, and now is a great time to pick one up. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7079/">We just spotted the 20,000mAh, 165W Ugreen Nexode power bank going for $70 at Amazon, after a solid 30% discount on its usual $100 price</a>. This offer is open to all shoppers, and the retailer is also offering free delivery on your purchase.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charge Multiple Devices</h2>
<p>This portable, yet mighty charger features a built-in 25.6inch (65cm) retractable USB-C cable that expands when needed and tucks away once you’re done topping your devices up. That means you don’t need to worry about carrying extra wires with this power bank at hand – just toss it in your backpack, and you’re good to go. Additionally, the cable is tested for over 25,000 retractions and 10,000 bends, so it’s going to comfortably support your power needs for years to come.</p>
<p>There are also two additional ports with up to 165W max output, so you can charge a MacBook Pro and an iPhone simultaneously (delivering 100W and 65W respectively). In a setup like this, the power bank can take a 16-inch MacBook Pro from 0 to 43% in just 30 minutes. The informative smart display at the front shares real-time port status and power flow, keeping you in the loop about the charging situation at all times.</p>



<p>The 20,000mAh high capacity is built for demanding days, as it’s capable of supporting all-day business activities without searching for outlets. For reference, that’s enough power to fully power an 11-inch iPad Pro twice, a Galaxy S24 Ultra up to three times, or a 13-inch MacBook Air just over once. Recharging the power bank doesn’t take forever, either, thanks to its 100W max input that juices it back up to full in just under 2 hours. You’ll also appreciate how this thing is equipped with high-rate battery cells that are specifically designed for endurance, and can retain up to 70% health after 1000 full charge cycles. Translation? A longer lifespan, which ensures you won’t really need to replace the power bank anytime soon.</p>
<p>Security is taken just as seriously. Ugreen has packed the Nexode with 13 layers of protection to guard against high-temperature, low-temperature, overvoltage, overcharge, overdischarge, short circuit, and more. All things considered, if you’re looking for a reliable solution that lets you power all your essential devices – from laptops to smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and earbuds – on the go, this Nexode power bank can help. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7079/">It offers great speeds with a huge battery capacity, and you can now snap it up for just $70 at Amazon</a>. Both Prime and non-Prime members will also enjoy free delivery with their purchase, so you’re saving a bit on that front, too.</p>
