			<p>There was a time, in a bygone era full of hope and positivity known as the early ‘90s, when Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe was unprecedented champion of all sport video games. Sure, that title reign only lasted until 1992 when Sensible Soccer became the darling of the school playground, but it was long enough for Speedball 2 to become a classic of its fledging genre. Now, some 35 years later, Rebellion are attempting to put this aged champ on top with a series reboot, snappily titled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/speedball">Speedball</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Speedball - Console Launch Trailer | Xbox X/S, PlayStation 5 &amp; PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExuLkHNFNlg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From the start, let me just say that Speedball plays a darn good game of Speedball. Don’t let the snazzy 3D visuals fool you, Rebellion’s version is as fast and furious as you remember the original games being, maybe even more so. Speedball is a 6 v 6 ultraviolet conglomeration of American Football, Rugby and the 1975 cult classic film, Rollerball. Played from a top-down perspective, each enclosed arena is filled with traps to navigate – flamethrower turrets, spike pillars, explosives and more. It can get pretty hectic with players flinging the metal ball from teammate to teammate before beating the opposing goalie and lobbing the blood-soaked orb into the goal. Rules are minimal, players can tackle each other as much as they like. Heck, you even get points for injuring the opposing team, meaning you don’t even need to win with goals, just violence.</p>


<p>The players themselves are delightfully athletic, each capable of wall-running in that Assassin’s Creed style, flipping over obstacles, and leaping high above enemy tackles. Controls are incredibly responsive, so after just a short time you’ll be flipping over traps, before running along a wall, leaping from its surface, rolling back to your feet and finally launching into an offensive tackle with the best of them. In fact, Speedball goes out of its way to make you look good whilst playing it, even if you’re a new player that’s not entirely sure what’s actually going on. Thanks to a rather good tutorial though, you won’t be confused for long, as each element of the game is explored, from the opening whistle to the gore-splatted finale.</p>


<p>I say gore-splattered, because this sports game can get very nasty, particularly when you take into account Rebellion’s genius addition to the traditional Speedball formula, jet packs. Each player essentially has a rocket fuelled missile strapped to their back, allowing them to blast across the arena like a distinctly non-child friendly version of Buzz Lightyear who’s decided to flatten you. These super tackles add a satisfying element of risk and reward to the gameplay, you can dash across the entire arena to take out another player, but you can just as easily send yourself splatting headfirst into a wall. The crowd will love it either way, and so will you.</p>
<p>In terms of team selection, this is a who’s who of beloved players from the original games. Though this time every single team has a distinctive look and unique abilities. The highlight for me? As a devoted 2000AD fan the option of fielding a team of Mega-City One Judges was totally zarjaz. Also, does this mean that Speedball is definitively part of the Dreddverse? I certainly hope so!</p>

<p>Accessible and enjoyable with very little practice, Speedball is ideally suited for local play, with newbies soon able to provide a threat to even experienced Speedballers. With games over in a dinky five minutes, this is perfect pick up and play fodder. Outside of local play however, Speedball isn’t nearly as sure footed. The singe player league mode lacks in depth. Sure, you can hire new players, and ongoing injuries need to be accounted for, but otherwise this is just playing eighteen matches in a row by any other name. It’s basic, formulaic, and is lacking in imagination, failing to keep things fresh and surprising for the player</p>

<p>The same is true of the online mode. Online games play smoothly enough, though a lot of the fun is lost due to lacking the comradery of a couch session. You can set up a league between friends, but it’s all rather basic. An online global league mode, with brackets and winners each season and unique in-game prizes would certainly be a welcome addition, but that relies on having a large enough playerbase. Otherwise this is just a series of exhibition matches and little else.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> delivered more of what its passionate fans wanted, and for the most part, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-2026-roadmap-revealed">substantial 2026 roadmap</a> looks promising, but what about that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> port that was <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/uh-oh-borderlands-4-is-delayed-indefinitely-on-switch-2-just-a-week-and-a-half-away-from-its-october-3-release">pushed aside at the last minute</a>?</p>
<p>Well, considering the performance issues plaguing the game (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-blames-borderlands-4s-softer-than-expected-sales-on-troublesome-pc-release-gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-insisted-was-pretty-damn-optimal">especially the PC version</a>) at launch and how heavy to run it continues to be, we weren't super optimistic about it coming out and <em>also </em>being stable enough. Mind you, the Switch 2 has been running <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-still-excellent-on-xbox-and-switch-2-even-if-its-beginning-to-show-its-age">some genuinely impressive third-party ports</a> so far, but Borderlands 4 always felt like a tricky one to pull off.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">Variety</a>, we're now learning Take-Two and Gearbox have "made the difficult decision to pause development" on the troubled port. Note how the exact word used here is "paused" and not "cancelled" (publishers aren't afraid of throwing the latter one around), but if you ask us, we're thinking it may never come out. In any case, a final decision hasn't been made. It appears that, right now, the focus is on "delivering quality post-launch content for players" and fixing what's broken on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Maybe that ongoing effort will reveal the answers needed to find a viable path forward for the Switch 2 port, but as it stands, Nintendo players are better off playing through <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-first-20-minutes-of-borderlands-2-gameplay-on-nintendo-switch">that excellent collection of the first few games for Switch 1</a> and the surprisingly decent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> port, which also runs steadier on Switch 2.</p><p>Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis also told Variety that, regardless of what happens with Borderlands 4, the plan is to continue to collaborate with Nintendo. Up next, the company is looking to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pga-tour-2k25-review">PGA Tour 2K25</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/wwe-2k26">WWE 2K26</a> on Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Epic</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-saw-record-setting-third-party-sales-growth-in-2025-reaches-317m-pc-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> year-in-review post</a>, revealing new records for sales of third-party games (<strong>+57% over last year</strong>), total PC users (<strong>over 317 million</strong>), and monthly active users (MAUs; <strong>78 million in December 2025</strong>, when <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the giveaway of Hogwarts Legacy</a> added around six million users). That said, while playtime spent with third-party games <strong>increased by 4%</strong>, total engagement across all Epic Games Store titles <strong>dropped by 14%</strong>, signaling a decrease in first-party engagement of games like <strong>Fortnite</strong> and <strong>Rocket League</strong>.</p>



<p>Website GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/were-not-going-to-topple-steam-epic-games-store-head-steve-allison-heralds-the-path-of-co-existence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was able to interview Epic Games Store General Manager Steve Allison</a>, who admitted that the goal is not (and perhaps never was) to topple <strong>Valve's Steam</strong> platform, which remains the market leader on PC:</p>



<p><em>Steam is a huge part of the PC ecosystem. It's not going away. We're not going to topple Steam.</em></p>



<p>During the interview, Allison <strong>acknowledged the criticism the store regularly gets from PC gamers when compared to Steam itself</strong>. He also revealed that Epic decided to completely remake the Epic Games Launcher in October 2025; the new version, which should finally let users see their libraries load almost instantly, is expected to be released in May or June.</p>



<p><em>We get so much criticism. I hate reading it, but I also appreciate it. It's not untrue. We were building incredibly rapidly on top of a foundation that was originally designed just to support Fortnite and Paragon, and we've continued to build on a house of cards. [The Launcher] is really slow. It's built on this old framework… and we've poked at it and optimized it, and I think we've done the best that we could with that. So we decided in October last year to rip the whole foundation down and rebuild it.</em></p>



<p>When it comes to the future growth of the Epic Games Store, Allison points <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the mobile versions that launched in August 2024</a>, but also reckons there's a lot of room for improvement on PC:</p>



<p><em>Mobile will be a big vector of growth, but like I said, I think we have room to get to a hundred million MAU on PC over the next four years, and I think we have a lot of room to get to 20–30% spend share. So you'll see us being pretty aggressive on our spend share on PC.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Amazon Fallout TV countdown <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/locked-fallout-tv-show-countdown-timer-coincides-with-season-2-finale-but-fans-are-hoping-it-also-signals-a-fallout-3-or-new-vegas-remaster-shadowdrop">that some had hoped would announce a Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas remaster</a> turned out to be nothing more than another behind-the-scenes look at the show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, a countdown appeared on the official Amazon <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#main" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a> designed to look like a Fallout map. On it are locations in the Fallout map style which, when accessed, lead you to behind-the-scenes information on the show. For example, The Vault 33 outer door, from which Lucy first steps foot into the wasteland, is on the south of the map. The Caswennan, the airship that serves as a soaring fortress for the Brotherhood of Steel, is to the east. And, ahead of the debut of the Fallout Season 2 finale, in the top right was a locked point of interest alongside a timer pointing to February 4.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/04/fallout-main-1767786059781-1770198248593.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Amazon's website had a locked node with a countdown pointing to the end of Season 2. Image credit: Amazon Prime Video.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That got some fans’ hopes up that the countdown was leading to the reveal of the heavily rumored Fallout 3 Remastered, or the equally heavily rumored Fallout: New Vegas Remastered. It turned out to be neither. Instead, it’s yet another interactive node, this time for ‘The Penthouse’ at the top of the Lucky 38 casino, the lair of antagonist Mr. House.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/04/screenshot-2026-02-04-093255-1770197610415.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Amazon's interactive Fallout website is updated to unlock the countdown. Image credit: Amazon Prime Video.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Once the private domain of Mr. House, it overlooks the Strip with a commanding view of New Vegas, equal parts luxury suite and control center,” reads the official description. “Step back in time to this intersection of decadence and authority!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clicking through leads you to a 3D interactive representation of the Penthouse, which includes a short video interview with Mr. House actor Justin Theroux about the genuinely impressive set, photos of the Strip, and even a creature gallery. This is all great if you’re after some extra Fallout information, but not the best if you’d hoped for a new Fallout game. In truth, some had suspected this would be the case. At best, some had said, it would contain a tease for Season 3 of the show.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/04/screenshot-2026-02-04-092438-1770197530256.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sorry, no Fallout remaster announcement today.

Howard kept his cards close to his chest, and reiterated a point he’s been making a lot in interviews lately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I will just say that the Oblivion Remaster, we're really, really pleased with how well it did, it was a very long project too, and not just in how it was received, the ability to shadowdrop it, and the response to doing that,” he said. “I like to do that with games as much as possible.

But if you're not keen on splashing out on the <strong>$66.99 / $99.99</strong> replica or its cheaper cardboard equivalent, then you <em>might</em> be in luck.</p>
<p>If you happen to have a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_04_vr_kit">Labo VR</a> kit lying around gathering dust, then you'll want to dig it out in the coming days. According to <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/nintendos-virtual-boy-classics-will-be-playable-on-labo-vr-headsets/">GamesBeat</a>, a Nintendo Treehouse staff member has confirmed that the cardboard peripheral will be compatible with Virtual Boy on NSO.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hqtorp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Now just to be absolutely sure, we've reached out directly to Nintendo and will update this article once we get confirmation. But honestly, it kind of makes sense that Labo VR would be compatible, and hopefully this will make the prospect of playing Virtual Boy a little easier for current owners.</p>
<p>Released in 2019, the VR headset could be used with big-hitters like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. Nintendo has not opted to utilise it in recent years, but the cardboard variant of the Virtual Boy headset has definitely taken some inspiration. It will launch alongside the full-fat replica for a more affordable <strong>£16.99 / $24.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you plan on using your Labo VR kit, then you'll need to consider that the Switch 2 simply won't fit inside the peripheral. So you'll need to stick with the OG Switch, but Virtual Boy will thankfully be compatible with both systems.</p>

            <p>Generative AI has played "zero part" in Rockstar Games' creation of GTA 6, Take-Two CEOman Strauss Zelnick has said at the company's latest financial numbers get-together, where he also indicated the game's still on to initially release this November. Well, on consoles at least. Though, back in the AI front, the Z bloke also revealed that Take-Two have "hundreds of pilots and implementations" on the go involving the tech.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"On the topic of AI, I've been enthusiastic since the very beginning," Zelnick told RPS' ironed dress shirt-wearing corporate acquaintances at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/strauss-zelnick-generative-ai-has-zero-part-in-what-rockstar-games-is-building-with-gta-6">GamesIndustry.biz</a> in a chat around Take-Two's latest earnings call. "This company's products have always been built with machine learning and artificial intelligence. We've actually always been a leader in the space, and right now we have hundreds of pilots and implementations across our company, including within our studios. And we're already seeing instances where generative AI tools are driving costs and time efficiencies."</p>
<p>That said, the exec did make sure to stick to his established line on the controversial tech, emphasising that he sees it as a tool rather than some infernal magic box from which fully-formed creative projects can spew. "Do I think tools by themselves create great entertainment properties? No, there's no evidence that that's the case and it won't be the case in the future," he continued. "Specifically with regards to GTA 6, Generative AI has zero part in what Rockstar Games is building. Their worlds are handcrafted. That's what differentiates them."</p>
<p>This latest round of questions being pointed at Zelnick about AI follow Google's deployment of Project Genie, an AI prototype that lets people generate "interactive worlds" which work like playable games. Well, if by playable games you mean utterly shite clones and/or two minute glorified GIFs of a character walking around. Project Genie's rollout led the <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/numerous-video-game-company-share-prices-dropped-following-googles-project-genie-ai-rollout/">share prices of a number of game companies</a> - including Take-Two and Witcher developers CD Projekt - to drop, one would assume because plenty of shareholders and other money men are brainless fools who don't know what goes into making games.</p><p>Hence Zelnick and many of his exec kinspeople adopting positions which hedge their bets when it comes to adopting this sort of tech as a magic bean with the word' efficiency booster' written on it in crayon, if not a magic bean that does the whole job. At least GTA 6 appears to be packing none ahead of its initial arrival on November 19th.</p>
<p>Not that the game's without bubbling controversy. Legal proceedings between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-fired-unionising-gta-6-devs-following-discord-chat-about-new-company-slack-policy-claims-report">Rockstar and the developers they fired last year</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fired-gta-6-devs-suffer-setback-in-legal-fight-against-rockstar-as-uk-court-denies-request-for-interim-relief">rumble on</a>. The company have accused the fired staff of leaking info about the game, while the staff and their allies at the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain union have accused Rockstar of union-busting.</p>

            <p>Here is a question for the septuagenarians and older in the RPS readership, assuming any of you are that venerable: if some chortling time traveller had told you back in the 50s or 60s that the perpetually sizzling terror of nuclear apocalypse would one day become a nostalgic playground for videogames with two-headed cows and dogs named Dogmeat and swaggering cowboy zombies, what kind of period-appropriate blunt implement would you have clobbered that time traveller with?
</p>
<p>While you grizzled boomers get your gums into that vexing proposition, here's the trailer for AtomTeam's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atom-rpg-2">Atom RPG 2</a>, the floridly titled sequel to 2018's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atom-rpg">Atom RPG</a>. It's another turn-based, top-down affair in the spirit of the original Interplay-published Fallouts, and appears rich in bunkers, action points and raging, possibly mutant bears. It's also the work of a team based across Cyprus, Ukraine and Latvia, who probably have very different ideas about the nature and duration of the Cold War than the people behind Fallout.

Take part in numerous side activities: such as fishing, building, racing, and more, while expanding your influence and control over the land. Remember: your choices not only shape a resurrecting civilisation, but may also prevent a new apocalypse looming on the horizon... "

<p>For context, maybe read Sin's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/atom-rpg-trudograd-is-about-a-third-of-a-game-but-a-great-third">write-up of the original Atom RPG's standalone city expansion Trudograd</a>. She quite liked it, despite being unimpressed by the combat. She was more keen on the quest design and writing. An excerpt:
</p>
<blockquote>I've talked a writer into walking into a minefield. I gained a level after listening to some old women ramble on a bench. I've sucker-shot a top hatted millionaire with a crossbow, then taken a pastry of his corpse and eaten it. At one point during an interesting, text-based side mission that reminded me of the weird text adventure bits of Space Rangers 2, I failed to bluff a common guard, alerting a whole base to my presence, but subsequently bluffed his boss into surrendering the entire base without a fight.</blockquote>
<p>Developers AtomTeam are also the people behind <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2108180/Swordhaven_Iron_Conspiracy/">Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy</a>, which as you may guess, is more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> than Fallout, and emphasises lizards over bears.</p>
<p>Ho, rickety veterans of the Duck and Cover era! Have you decided what you're going to hit my hypothetical Tardis pilot with yet?</p>

            <p>That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-prime-videos-sixth-biggest-season-of-all-time">Fallout Season 2</a> finale was quite good even if some subplots barely moved during the second set of eight episodes, I'd say. It also made many of us eager to see what comes next (especially the teased new setting). Diehard Fallout fans, however, maybe were paying more attention to the mystery countdown <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#main">on the show's interactive map site</a>.</p>
<p>Alas, we got no news on those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-3-and-new-vegas-crossover-mod-not-getting-remastered">long-rumoured Fallout 3 and New Vegas remasters</a>, which are reportedly a ways off at the time of writing, but Amazon and Bethesda's parting gift is cool nonetheless. It may even be a cheeky unofficial tease of things to come if you're very high on copium, like me.</p>
<p>The final icon on the top right part of the map was revealed to be <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#/penthouse">Mr. House's penthouse</a> at the top of New Vegas' iconic tower. Unless we're missing something, no Easter eggs related to the potential remasters are to be found, though we're sure the most dedicated fans are on the case as I type this.</p>
<p>Instead, it's more of a cool interactive extra for fans of both the show and the 2010 RPG; a 3D model of the well-known location as seen in the show (it's packing some upgrades and new secrets). Those who are familiar with the game will instantly notice this 3D render feels shinier and more detailed (and not live-action at all). I wouldn't go as far as to say this is an in-progress chunk from the rumoured remaster (remake?) for obvious reasons, but it could give us a solid idea of how a touched-up New Vegas may feel like.</p>

<p>In any case, it's fun to see a big show's marketing returning to the early Internet days, where new movies and TV series were constantly promoted with neat interactive sites (and even flash games) on top of the more traditional promotional materials. If you find something else in this room, ping us, but we're just enjoying the vistas as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">we think about the show and game series' future</a>.</p>
<p>For now, it's been confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">Season 3 starts shooting soon-ish</a>, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> owners can look forward to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-announces-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-confirms-nintendo-switch-2-version-for-2026">port of Fallout 4</a> that should arrive in the near future.</p>

            <p>Rockstar's highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will not feature any Generative AI.</p>
<p>That's coming from Take-Two head Strauss Zelnick, who assured the GTA community that the controversial tech has "zero part in what Rockstar is building".</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Zelnick was talking with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/strauss-zelnick-generative-ai-has-zero-part-in-what-rockstar-games-is-building-with-gta-6">Eurogamer's sister site gamesindustry.biz</a> ahead of Take-Two's Q3 financial results, when the topic of AI came up. The company head said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/artificial-intelligence-is-an-oxymoron-theres-no-such-thing-says-take-two-boss">he has "been enthusiastic" about AI from the beginning</a>, and Take-Two's "products have always been built with machine learning and artificial intelligence".</p>
<p>Zelnick called Take-Two a "leader in the space", with the company currently having "hundreds of pilots and implementations" across the board, and that includes "within our studios". He added the company has seen instances where generative AI tools are "driving costs and time efficiencies", though he does not believe these tools in isolation can "create great entertainment properties". </p>
<p>This is when the conversation turned to Rockstar and GTA 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-fans-in-disarray-as-release-date-clock-reset-following-gta6-release-day-delay">which is expected to debut on 19th November</a> (a date Zelnick remains confident about).</p>
<p>"Specifically with regards to GTA 6, Generative AI has zero part in what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> is building," Zelnick said, adding the studio's "worlds are handcrafted" and that is what sets it apart from other studios.</p>
<p>"They're built from the ground up, building by building, street by street, neighbourhood by neighbourhood. They're not procedurally generated, they shouldn't be," Zelnick stated. "That's what makes great entertainment."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Zelnick's words come soon after Take-Two saw its stock price plunge to an 11-month-low after Google rolled out Project Genie 3, an AI tool which allows users to generate virtual worlds in 60-second bursts from text prompts.</p>
<p>As Vikki reported at the weekend, several companies in addition to Take-Two - including CD Projekt, Unity and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> - saw between 8-20 percent wiped off the value of their companies as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-companies-see-share-prices-plummet-following-the-launch-of-googles-very-limited-virtual-world-generator-project-genie">spooked investors seemingly went into the weekend thinking tech like this could replace the game development process</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">In a recent interview with Variety</a>, Zelnick was asked to comment on previous reporting from <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/397290/gta-6-a-wersja-pudelkowa-sprzedawcy-zwiastuja-smutna-wiadomosc-dla-fanow-fizycznych-wydan.html">PPE</a> which stated that, according to a source, the highly-anticipated release would come out without physical copies in an attempt to curb spoilers from folks obtaining these copies early.</p>
<p>Zelnick responded to Variety: "That's not the plan" - a brief but sharp rebuttal of the prior reporting. So if you're keen on getting your actual hands on a copy of GTA6 day one, you should be in luck.</p>

			<p>The <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> version of <strong>Borderlands 4</strong> has been officially <strong>canceled</strong>. The news was shared yesterday, when <strong>Take-Two Interactive</strong> deleted the game from its updated list of upcoming releases found in its latest quarterly report. <strong>Alan Lewis</strong>, a spokesperson for Take-Two, shared the following statement <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Variety</a>:</p>



<p><em>We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU. Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game. We’re continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have ‘PGA Tour 2K25’ and ‘WWE 2K26’ coming out for Nintendo Switch 2, and we’re incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to that platform in the future.</em></p>



<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was supposed to launch in October for Nintendo's new console</a>, just around a month after the PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X launches, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was delayed in late September</a> with no further date in sight.</p>



<p>However, in May, <strong>Gearbox</strong> founder <strong>Randy Pitchford</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-very-powerful-is-perfect-for-borderlands-4-says-randy-pitchford/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waxed praise on the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, <strong>calling it a perfect fit for Borderlands 4</strong>:</p>



<p><em>To have Nintendo Switch 2 in hand while we're making Borderlands 4 for Nintendo Switch 2 is really exciting. Usually, we'll have to port a game to a platform, but in this case, we're making Borderlands 4 for the Nintendo Switch 2. And I think that when you play Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2, you'll realize that with the cooperative experience and how we can use the Nintendo Switch 2 platform to connect with friends, share our game with friends, it's pretty astonishing how perfect this platform is for Borderlands 4.</em></p>



<p><em>The Switch 2 has been a joy to work with. It's very powerful. It's an incredible machine in a very tight form factor, and we love being on the bleeding edge with our graphics and the experience that we're creating. And the Nintendo Switch 2 makes all that possible. We don't feel like we're fighting the system. We feel like the system is enabling us and empowering us to make the best version of Borderlands 4 we can. As a game developer, it's awesome.</em></p>



<p>Clearly, something went wrong between May and September. At this point, <strong>publisher Take-Two may have deemed the port not worth the effort</strong>. In other news from Take-Two's quarterly financial call, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/more-grand-theft-auto-vi-marketing-beats-coming-in-summer-2026-while-gta-v-has-sold-over-225m-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the publisher is preparing to launch the marketing campaign for Grand Theft Auto VI starting this Summer</a></strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The next Xbox could be released next year]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/04/the-next-xbox-could-be-released-next-year/</link>
            <guid>1424938</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>AMD, the makers of the System-on-a-Chip (SoC) technology that powers the current Xbox and PlayStation consoles, have rather casually revealed that the next Xbox could be released as early as next year.</p>
<p>The information was revealed during the company’s Q4 2025 earnings call when AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said “Development of&nbsp;Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC is progressing well to support a launch in 2027.”</p>


<p>It is important to note that the good Doctor only said they could support <em>“a”</em> launch rather than <em>“the”</em> launch, but other leaks have suggested that Microsoft are aiming for next year,&nbsp; one would assume sometime near Christmas as usual.</p>
<p>What form the next Xbox will take is the subject of intense speculation. While they are clearly talking to AMD about some powerful hardware, documents revealed during the FTC trial when Microsoft purchased Activision revealed that they were aiming for a “hybrid console”.&nbsp; This could suggest a move towards streaming games that run off powerful server farms rather than having a top-range console at home.&nbsp; There are also concerns over the huge price increases in RAM and GPUs, a high-powered next Xbox could be very expensive, whereas a streaming machine would require less under the hood and would boost sales of Xbox Games Pass.</p>
<p>The idea of Microsoft even making a new console could raise a few eyebrows, it is fair to say they have been absolutely thrashed by PlayStation and Nintendo this generation. Console sales, meagre as they are, have had a 32% decline year-on-year. While never specifically stated, the low sales of Xbox consoles are clearly a contributing factor to Microsoft’s decision to start releasing its exclusive franchises, such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-launch-confirmed-for-may-coming-first-to-xbox-and-pc-and-later-to-ps5/">Forza</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/fable-is-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-ps5-and-pc-this-autumn-and-its-looking-great/">Fable,</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5/">Halo,</a> on PlayStation.</p>

<p>Xbox, and indeed PlayStation,&nbsp; also have the same issue as other tech manufacturers, such as Apple, in that it is much harder for customers to perceive any major changes between generations. It seems obvious that the next-gen consoles will run at 4K with decent frame rates, but apart from looking a bit prettier, there’s not much they can add. We already have SDD drives for fast loading, haptic feedback, and Dolby 3D Audio, and it’s not like the console manufacturers can do something snazzy like making the console fold in half like a phone.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to the idea of a hybrid console. Could the next Xbox be a portable device with a dock for playing at home? Microsoft have certainly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rog-xbox-ally-x/">been exploring that area</a> and it would keep costs down, boost sales of Game Pass, and give them a much-needed selling point to attract customers.</p>
<p><em>Source: <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-reveals-next-gen-xbox-could-launch-in-2027-ceo-says-semi-custom-soc-ready-to-support-launch-in-2027">TomsHardware</a></em></p>

		<p>Sometimes, you see a game that you just want to snuggle. Its characters look like they might be the plushest, most cheerful soft toys, while its vibes are so heartwarming and welcoming that you need to play it now, just to purge any stress you might have hanging around. That’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3866920/NAMAKORIUM/">Namakorium</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="NAMAKORIUM Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ixIOn5yz9qY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Namakorium is a sea-based multiplayer RTS, where you take control of a group of the Namako – that’s sea cucumbers to you or me – and have to clean up the ocean, getting rid of the pollution with up to three other players. It looks utterly enticing, with some Pokemon-like vibes on the go, and it’s undoubtedly overwhelmingly positive, with a great environmental message as well.</p>
<p>You have to balance your resources – that’s the food that you need to keep your cucumbers alive – build habitats and other buildings, before using an array of different Namako to tackle the different kind of pollutions littering the sea floor. That also seems to extend to giant, polluted Namako, who I guess you have to purify to. I’m not sure if that means having the other sea cucumbers nibbling away at it, but, we’ll have to check the game out to find out!</p>
<p>Namakorium has just entered Early Access, and there’s a nice 20% discount in place at the moment for those willing to hop into some cucumber-based pollution cleaning action. Developer Polyscape Inc. are listening to all of the early feedback and already have a route map in place for the game’s development as it heads towards a fully 1.0 release.</p>


<p>Namakorium also has a crowdfunding campaign that aims to promote the game globally which was launched on January 9, 2026. The campaign achieved and surpassed its funding goal in just a single day, showing just how high the global demand is for a game like Namakorium. The campaign is set to continue until February 28, 2026 and will be expanded on with new rewards and new stretch goals as more people sign up.</p>

            <guid>1424911</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The post-credits scene at the end of Fallout Season Two teases something huge from the games.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you just finished watching the finale of Fallout season two, hopefully, you hung around until the end for its post-credits scene. That’s because within it hides the blueprints for “Liberty Prime Alpha” — a name that will excite you if you’ve played the Fallout games, but may confuse you if you haven’t. Rest assured, though, because we’re here to tell you exactly why you <em>should </em>be eagerly anticipating its apparent arrival in Fallout’s third season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To cut to the chase, Liberty Prime is a giant robot originally built by the United States Army in the years before the Great War that turned America into the wasteland it is today. A 40-foot-tall metal monster packed with extreme power, including highly destructive head-mounted energy cannons and a seemingly endless supply of throwable explosives, it's quite the weapon of mass destruction. Think the Iron Giant, but nowhere near as friendly.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/03/fo4-liberty-prime-concept-art-1770135733764.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Liberty Prime concept art from The Art of Fallout 4 book.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Initially conceived in 2072 and planned for deployment against the communist forces of China in Alaska, Liberty Prime never actually made it into battle, despite being fully constructed, as a sufficient power source was never obtained. That doesn’t mean it would never see any action, though, as this colossus appears in both Fallout 3 and Fallout 4. Let’s take a look at what it got up to in those games, as well as theorise a little about how it could be deployed in season three of the show.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Fallout 3</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Liberty Prime would sit dormant for many, many years after the bombs dropped, until it was rediscovered in 2255 amongst the ruins of Washington, D.C., the setting of Fallout 3. For over 20 years, the Brotherhood of Steel worked away on restoring the war machine with mixed results, until its eventual revival in 2277. Its first taste of action would come in a battle against the Enclave, where it destroyed many of the shadowy faction’s forces as the Brotherhood laid claim to the fallen capital’s Jefferson Memorial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Brotherhood would repeat this tactic for another couple of weeks, with Liberty Prime too strong a foe for the Enclave to handle. But soon this tactic would prove predictable, and the giant robot would eventually be lured into a trap that would see orbital weapons descend upon it. Following its destruction, the Brotherhood attempted to rebuild it, but to no avail. Instead, its shattered remains would be left to rust deep in storage until the next person was bold enough to build it again.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Fallout 4</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A decade later, in 2287, someone would try to do exactly that. This time, a chapter of the Brotherhood headquartered in Boston decided that it needed the power of the walking superweapon to turn the tide in its battle for the Commonwealth. This effort would take many years to come to fruition, as Liberty Prime’s components had to be airlifted along America’s East Coast and pieced together in Massachusetts. Such a mammoth effort was required to combat the newly risen synth threat — an AI lifeform created by the scientific faction called the Institute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A newly improved Liberty Prime MK II, packed with a laser capable of carving tunnels down into the earth and the ability to deploy mini nukes,  then took to the streets of Boston. Depending on your actions at the end of Fallout 4, Liberty Prime can either be destroyed again or live to fight another day as it roams the Commonwealth in the service of the Brotherhood.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Fallout: Season Three</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So, this brings up the curious case of how Liberty Prime will be deployed in the Fallout TV show. Set in 2296, nine years after Fallout 4, the show could directly tie into the events of the Brotherhood’s Boston bust-up by having Elder Quintus claim components for Liberty Prime from the Commonwealth. However, considering his civil war antics and the death of Paladin Harkness, it seems unlikely his Boston brothers will consider Quintus an ally anymore. It’s also worth considering that the blueprints are for “Liberty Prime Alpha”, which is presumably a model that pre-dates the MK II version deployed in Boston, and perhaps even the original robot created for the Alaskan front. It seems possible that we’ll be seeing a brand new version of the iconic robot, designed especially for the show.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Declaring himself “Quintus the Destroyer”, it seems like the Knights of San Fernando chapter will be on a nuclear warpath next season. But who will be in his crosshairs? Will his mission be to wipe out the other chapters, or will the violence see The Brotherhood put on a collision course with the New California Republic?. Will season three’s apparent Colorado location be the backdrop for their war? The potential imagery of a looming Liberty Prime walking a warpath towards Denver could well be on the horizon. A mile-high robot in the mile-high city? We wouldn’t say no.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you think we’ll see a fully rebuilt Liberty Prime in Fallout season three? Or do you think the showrunners have different plans for The Brotherhood’s iconic massive robot?

<p>It's time to shoot some hoops</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The team-based competitive title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> has received two major updates since it hit the court last August, and today Nintendo has released the game's first update of 2026.</p>
<p>This one is a much smaller patch. It bumps the game up to <strong>Version 1.2.1</strong>, and apparently addresses some issues to improve the overall game experience. Here's the full rundown, so if you've been encountering these problems during gameplay, they should no longer be a problem once you've performed this update:</p>
<h3>Drag x Drive Ver. 1.2.1 (Released February 3, 2026)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>- Fixed an issue where the effect of defensive pressure on opponents’ halfpipe shots was smaller than intended.</p>
<p>- Fixed various issues to create a smoother gaming experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>This again follows two major updates. The previous one added Survival Tag across multiple modes and even released an update for the game's demo.</p>
<p>If you haven't already tried out this game on the Switch 2, check out our written review as well as our video review above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Drag x Drive may lack options with regards to online modes, and its controls take a bit of getting used to. However, if you can give up some time to engaging with this one, if you can get past the barriers in terms of controls and the early frustrations as you find your rhythm, you'll be rewarded with a unique and very well-made sports game that deserves to find an audience of dedicated fans. Add in some pals, and you've got a solid bit of fun for the price."</em></p>

<figure data-uuid="0f8fe0aa4ee94"><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0f8fe0aa4ee94/xenoblade-chronicles-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo, Monolith Soft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Rumours about a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> release have started to circulate online today after a possible "leak" on the casting platform Spotlight.</p>
<p>The page of voice actor Caitlin Thorburn (who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qvb7f9/caitlin_thorburn_just_updated_her_spotlight_page/">voiced multiple roles in the second game</a>) has reportedly been updated to reference a "Xenoblade Chronicles" project due out in 2026. She's apparently reprising her role as KOS-MOS, who previously appeared in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/xenosaga_i_and_ii">Xenosaga</a> series.</p>

<p>So that's what's supposedly been uncovered. As for the legitimacy of this, it is just a rumour for now, but <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/monolith-soft-development-and-speculation-st.51/page-55#post-2165560">apparently the profile</a> can only be updated and edited by the person who is the subject of the page. Of course, it doesn't necessarily guarantee anything and could also be a mistake.</p>
<p>If this is a sign of a new Xenoblade game (or a returning one in some way or form), this wouldn't actually be the first time something like this has happened. Xenoblade fans have been quick to point out how a similar situation happened ahead of the reveal of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>, when the Melia voice actor Jenna Coleman spoke about "another game" before an official announcement.</p>
<p>If we hear any updates, we'll let you know. Just keep in mind Nintendo or Monolith Soft haven't announced any new or returning Xenoblade Chronicles projects at this stage.</p>

            <guid>1424887</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Fallout</em> season two’s finale might not have paid off all the various story threads this season set up, but it did tease a location rarely seen in the games and featured the reveal of something big returning from <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>Fallout 4</em>. Spoilers below for the season in general and the finale episode in particular. If you haven’t watched it yet and don’t want to be spoiled, don’t keep scrolling!</p>  <p>After two seasons of following the Ghoul as he searched for his family, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finale-margot-enclave-cooper-janey-2000665411"><em>Fallout</em> season two’s finale</a> finally brings him face to face with…their empty cryopods hidden deep in a secret Vault below Mr. House’s Lucky 38 Casino. Dang. But inside his wife’s tube is a postcard for Colorado, giving him hope that his family is still alive in the midwestern state.</p>

 <p>So off he goes on a new quest to hopefully find his wife and daughter after a heck of a 200 years. During the credits, a billboard reinforces the idea that next season will, at least partially, be set in Colorado. What do we know about Colorado in the <em>Fallout</em> universe, and what can we expect?</p> <h2>Colorado In The <em>Fallout</em> Universe</h2> <p>Colorado is a state that has been mentioned a few times in past games and <em>Fallout</em> media, but has rarely played a big role. It, like most of the rest of the United States in <em>Fallout</em>, was mostly wiped out by the nuclear bombs dropped during the Great War. Colorado’s biggest appearance in the games thus far happened in<em> Fallout Tactics</em>, a game that isn’t wholly canon, but parts of it might be (it’s weird). In that 2001 tactical turn-based RPG spin-off, we are introduced to Vault 0.</p>

 <p><a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_0">Vault 0</a> is set in an expanded version of the real-life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_Mountain_Complex#Video_games">Cheyenne Mountain Complex</a>, a large underground U.S. military bunker designed to survive nuclear war and other massive attacks. Exactly what happens in <em>Fallout Tactics</em> isn’t really important, but Vault 0 and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex could play a part in season three. We know the Enclave is still around, and it would make sense for them to hole up in something like that to hide away from the rest of the wasteland.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, as pointed out by <em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/fallout-season-3-location/">PC Gamer</a>,</em> in the lead-up to <em>Fallout</em> season one, Amazon posted an hour-long video about the opening of Vault 33. <a href="https://youtu.be/o1YhcviJ7IU?t=761">And during the stream, an announcer says this</a>: “Unless you’re the President of the United States or something like that, and you have a mountain in Colorado to go under and direct the events of the world.” And who did Cooper Howard run into in this season and hand off the Cold Fusion capsule to? The president. I suspect Vault 0 or a version of it will play a role in season three.</p> <p>One other interesting thing to note about Colorado is that the original version of <em>Fallout 3</em> that was being developed by Black Isle Studios before it was canceled was going to be partially set in Colorado. Fitting that Colorado will likely play a big role in season three of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> show, given that it was previously featured in both the third <em>Fallout</em> game ever made (<em>Tactics</em>) and the original <em>Fallout 3</em> (Project Van Buren).</p>

 <h2>That Other Big (Wink) Tease</h2> <p>After all the credits, Amazon included a post-credits teaser scene featuring Elder Cleric Quintus and Dane back at the Brotherhood’s Area 51 base we saw earlier in the season. Chaos is continuing there after Maximus took off with the Cold Fusion capsule. Anyway, Dane brings Quintus a scroll. He tells the scribe that Quintus the Unifier is no more. Instead, he is now Quintus the Destroyer and unrolls the scroll to reveal a blueprint for Liberty Prime.</p> <p>We technically saw what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1qcvxny/surprised_no_one_is_mentioning_this/">appears to be Liberty Prime earlier this season</a> in a photo featuring Mr. House’s body double. But this is the giant democracy-defending robot’s first real appearance in the show. Or, well, he appears as a blueprint schematic. Close enough.</p> <p>This seems to be a new version of the big robot, named Liberty Prime Alpha, and is different from the mech that first appeared in <em>Fallout 3</em> and later in <em>Fallout 4</em>. I’m not yet convinced this ragtag chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel is going to be able to create its own Liberty Prime. Perhaps it’s buried away in Area 51? We’ll have to wait until season three to find out.</p>

<p>Following a delay last September</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="56cfcaf6b549d"><a title="Borderlands 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56cfcaf6b549d/borderlands-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: 2K Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last September, 2K Games and Gearbox Software announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> had been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/borderlands-4-has-been-delayed-for-switch-2-digital-pre-orders-cancelled">delayed for Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>The plan was to spend a little extra time to deliver the "best possible experience" on Nintendo's new system, but it appears the plan has changed. In Take-Two's latest earnings results (the parent company of 2K Games), the Switch 2 version has been removed from the company's release schedule.</p>
<p>Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis told Variety, the "difficult decision" has been made to "pause development" on this particular version of the game. The team at Gearbox is instead focused on delivering "quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game".</p>
<p>This decision <em>won't</em> impact other Switch 2 projects, and 2K will continue to collaborate closely with Nintendo. Upcoming releases for Switch 2 include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pga-tour-2k25">PGA TOUR 2K25</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k26">WWE 2K26</a>.</p>
<p>Before the most recent delay and cancellation of pre-orders, Borderlands 4 was meant to arrive on the Switch 2 in October 2025. This title was originally released on other platforms last September and while the shift to open world was praised, there were also reports of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/borderlands-4?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">console version's problematic performance</a> at the time.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/menace-early-access-review</link>
            <guid>1424842</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Within the first three missions of Menace, I am talking to my squads of snappy space marines as if they are action figures on my bedroom floor. "Fan out and move up. Good shooting! That was clean, girl." My roommates are probably used to me talking to myself when I'm playing video games at this point, but it speaks to how engrossed I got in this turn-based interplanetary war that I was already developing that kind of relationship with it. There's a lot still missing from the Early Access release. But the tactical, bug-blasting fun is already dialed in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Probably the biggest way in which it's obvious that this is an Early Access game is the overall lack of context. I know that I'm a Major on a military ship that suffered some kind of FTL drive accident that destroyed many systems and most of the crew, leaving me as the senior commanding officer. I know that we've wound up in an area of space called the Wayback that is home to a handful of interesting, competing human factions and also a species of giant alien bugs. It's not all that difficult to get a grasp of the basics.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Menace screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But I'm not actually sure why we're here, what the original mission was, what kind of faction we're representing, or what the Wayback even is. Why is it called that? How long have these other humans been here? There are references to some kind of in-game lore encyclopedia, but it doesn't seem to have been implemented yet. At the end of the day, none of this really gets in the way of my ability to shoot at things. But it does make the early game feel a bit aimless, and I find the setting interesting enough that I'd like to know more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not like Menace completely doesn't care about story, either. There is clearly something brewing here, as unfinished as it is, with tension between the Wayback factions and the marines playing out in voice-acted cutscenes every few operations. It's just unclear where it's going or what I'm ultimately building up to other than harder missions, better gear, and upgrading my ship. In about 35 hours, I didn't run into anything that seemed especially like the main plot. There is a steady escalation of stakes and difficulty, though, which at least does a good job of helping me feel like I'm not just spinning my wheels.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hit the Ground Running</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As a squad-based tactics game, man, I really like Menace. The pacing and action economy are so cleverly crafted to encourage you to play in more active and interesting ways. You can't just set everyone on ov erwatch and creep forward, for example, which is a rut I tend to fall into in similar games. There aren't a lot of passive or reactive abilities, so victory comes from making proactive choices. Moving up the field requires thinking about who still has turns left to spend, and how you can make sure your advance elements have adequate support if they run into trouble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Suppression is a huge deal, at least when fighting other humans, and this adds a feeling of authenticity to  every firefight. In actual warfare, they say hundreds of rounds get fired for every one that hits a target, and that's exactly how Menace works. It's often far more important to keep every enemy in line-of-sight pinned down than it is to inflict casualti es. That gives your second wave safety and freedom of movement to either charge in or flank and win the fight, and this creates a constantly engaging tactical loop. Your own squads who get suppressed will have their action points and accuracy penalized, but will also hunker down or hit the deck intelligently depending on the amount of heat they're under, further making them feel like real soldiers.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">This blends nicely with the fact that every squad is led by a named character you can recruit, level up, and customize. They all have distinct personalities and backstories along with a unique ability that defines them. There's sort of an over-the-top Jagged Alliance vibe, though a bit less goofy. Jacques, a private security contractor I hired from the Wayback, can regain action points when he's under heavy fire, so he thrives at the tip of the spear. Marta begins every mission with a major debuff that turns into a strong buff the more turns that pass, making her a clutch asset for closing out a long mission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And unlike in, say, XCOM, these flagship characters only die if their entire squad is wiped out and you can't get anyone over to them to render medical aid, so it doesn't feel like playing a little bit risky will rob you of your beloved blorbos. On the othe=r hand, accompanying each of them (excluding vehicle drivers, which are their own thing) are up to eight renameable squadmates with no dialogue or special abilities. And these guys are… kind of expendable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Manpower is a limited resource you have to manage on the strategic level, so you can't just go throwing background extras into the meat grinder all the time. But especially as you get more advanced medical facilities online that can rehabilitate casualties, the grunts kind of become a wager you can afford to risk by making aggressive plays. And this is such a clever way of getting me to command more actively and break out of my usual, turtle playstyle.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Alien Menace</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Encountering the alien bugs changes things up quite a bit. They're much harder to suppress, though heavy losses can force them to flee. And especially later on, some of them are so heavily-armored that your standard assault rifles are all but useless. They don't really take cover, and a lot of them only have melee attacks. But simply holding your ground and grinding them down at range isn't always an option. Having to switch up my gear and my thinking depending on what I was fighting, in addition to the wide variety of mission types, made me come up with new tactics constantly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Squad customization is also deep and satisfying. There is no standard currency in the Wayback, so all gear is either a mission reward or purchased using the barter system on the black market. But even once you do build up enough scrap bombs and alien guts to trade for the best stuff available, there's a supply budget on each mission that takes into account every piece of equipment and keeps you from simply buying your way to victory. I think this  could use some tuning, since it currently feels like the missions are getting harder a bit faster than my supply budget is increasing. It's almost there. Maybe just a nudge is all it needs.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Favorite Turn-Based Tactics Games</h3><p>Some of my favorite turn-based tactics games, in no particular order.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/LeanaVanadis/lists/lens-favorite-turn-based-tactics-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems like a lot of thought has gone into the various veterancy upgrades squads can earn from promotions, as well. They're pretty well-balanced, feeling powerful enough to be meaningful but not so game-changing as to trivialize combat on their own, like increasing evasion based on how many tiles you moved. Each has a clear role in mind, and almost none feel like they wouldn't be at least situationally useful. It's an area of progression where I can really tell developer Overhype Studios has a strong footing in what works and what doesn't about this genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The strategic layer is not quite as well-developed yet. There are a few different things you can buy with the components gained from completing each multi-mission operation. You have ship upgrades like the med bay and the recruiting office for managing manpower, along with armaments that can be deployed from orbit a limited number of times per mission. Then you have loyalty tracks with each of the three major Wayback factions that can unlock their unique buildings, which can do things like give you an extra chance at post-mission loot or allow you to call in supplies in the middle of a mission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They can be neat, but still feel a bit limited in both scope and depth. It's a good first iteration, but this is for sure somewhere I'd like to see more love  given to over the course of Early Access. There are also only three planets so far, which can start to feel a little samey after a while. More are in the works. Technical bugs have been relatively sparse, though my main file is afflicted by a fairly annoying one right now where my manpower counter seems to be permanently broken.</p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Menace is off to more than a running start already. The turn-based tactical action is some of the best I've played lately, and I love the distinct, voiced squad leaders, as well as both the variety of missions and enemy factions. The biggest missing piece is really story and context. It's hard to get too invested in what's going on in the Wayback when I'm not even really sure why we're here yet. But for Early Access, this is a truly impressive effort, and there's plenty of fun to be had already.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/menace-early-access-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>As we enter February, Nintendo has today announced two more titles for the Switch Online's Game Boy library.</p>
<p>Following the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far"><strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong></a> Yoshi reveal, Nintendo seems to be continuing the Yoshi celebrations with the release of the 1991/92 puzzle-themed Game Boy title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/yoshi">Yoshi</a>. Alongside this, Nintendo has locally released the 1990/91 platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/balloon_kid">Balloon Kid</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the official Nintendo descriptions for both titles and you can check out the trailer above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Yoshi™</strong></p>
<p>Yoshi is an action/puzzle game starring Mario's trusty buddy Yoshi, who has been imprisoned in an egg. Now it's raining Goombas, Bloopers, and Boo Buddies, and you have to help Mario stop the airborne invasion. As the critters fall, catch them on trays. Stack two of a kind and they both disappear, or capture the whole bunch in between eggshells. When the eggshells match, out hatches Yoshi and up goes your score! The action heats up as the characters fall faster and faster. To save the day, switch and shuffle, and don't let your piles get too high!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Balloon Kid™</strong></p>
<p>In the little town of Pencilvania, there lived a brother and sister who loved to play with balloons. Alice and her younger brother Jim would spend countless days filling the skies with their balloons. One day, Jim filled all of his balloons and tied them together to make a beautiful balloon rainbow across the sky. But suddenly, a strong wind came and carried Jim away.</p>
<p>As Alice, you must save your brother from peril. Float through eight different stages as you follow Jim's trail of balloons. Collect as many balloons as possible to earn bonuses. Test your piloting skills to avoid enemies, or let go of your balloons to face enemies on the ground. In BALLOON TRIP mode, compete for the highest score and move up the ranks. Take a big gulp of courage and give Alice a hand as she searches for her missing brother!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in case you're wondering, Japan is getting Yoshi and <strong>Balloon Fight GB</strong> this week. The second game, released exclusively in Japan in the year 2000, is a Game Boy Color version <a href="https://tcrf.net/Balloon_Kid/Balloon_Fight_GB">with some updates</a> such as a world map and the ability to save. You can see it in action in the trailer below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This title is an action game for the Game Boy Color released in 2000 on the Nintendo Power game rewriting system. You control Alice, who flies while holding on to a balloon, and chase after her younger brother who has been blown away by the wind. Clues to her brother's whereabouts are balloons left all over the stage. You will progress while avoiding various obstacles, including birds with sharp beaks and flying fish that appear from the sea. Sometimes you can even let go of the balloon and explore on land. In "Balloon Trip" mode, you can challenge yourself to see how long you can fly without hitting an obstacle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to revisit these titles on Nintendo's digital Game Boy library, you'll need to have an active Switch Online subscription.</p>

<p>The CEO of Take-Two Interactive has confirmed that no generative AI is used in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="114633">Grand Theft Auto 6.</a></p>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/strauss-zelnick-generative-ai-has-zero-part-in-what-rockstar-games-is-building-with-gta-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick discussed his take on generative AI, stating that while he is personally enthusiastic about the technology and its practical uses in terms of saving time and money, he does not believe these tools can create great entertainment on their own and affirms that there is no generative AI usage in the upcoming release in the Grand Theft Auto franchise. </p>



<p>He would go so far as to say that GenAI has no part in what Rockstar is building and that the worlds are handcrafted.</p>



<p>“Specifically with regards to GTA 6, Generative AI has zero part in what Rockstar Games is building. Their worlds are handcrafted. That’s what differentiates them,” he said.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-6-will-have-a-physical-release">GTA 6 Will Have a Physical Release</h2>



<p>In debunking a rumor, Take-Two confirmed in its quarterly earnings report that Grand Theft Auto 6 will have a physical release. Also, marketing is slated to begin this summer. The game remains on track for release on November 19, despite several delays.</p>







<p>Generative AI is on the rise in gaming. PlayStation recently announced plans to use the technology to create podcasts featuring video game characters. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-gen-ai-fake-podcast-playstation-characters/">here</a>.</p>

            <guid>1424773</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>next-gen Xbox console</strong> from <strong>Microsoft</strong>, which we know will <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-confirms-developing-custom-chips-microsoft-power-next-gen-xbox-consoles-pcs-handhelds/">be powered by a <strong>semi-custom SoC</strong> currently in development from <strong>AMD</strong></a>, is "<em>progressing well to <strong>support a launch in</strong> <strong>2027</strong></em>," said AMD's chief executive officer, <strong>Dr. Lisa Siu</strong>, during the <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1276/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-financial-results">company's 2025 fourth quarter earnings call</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>For 2026, we expect semi-custom SoC annual revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage as we enter the seventh year of what has been a very strong console cycle," </em>Dr. Siu said on the call<em>. "From a product standpoint, Valve is on track to begin shipping its AMD-powered Steam Machine early this year. And <strong>development of Microsoft's next-gen Xbox featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC is progressing well to support a launch in 2027</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Dr. Siu's comment about the Steam Machine isn't anything new, as it only corroborates what <strong>Valve</strong> has said regarding the release of the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">which have always had an <strong>"<em>early 2026</em>"</strong> release window</a>. It's her comments on the next-gen Xbox that are worth noting, which give credence to rumours we heard last year that also identified a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">2027 release window</a></strong> for the next-generation device. </p>



<p>Of course, her comment doesn't mean you should write 'next-gen Xbox release' in your 2027 calendar, because it will ultimately be Microsoft's call as to when the device launches. What her comments do mean is that if Microsoft is in fact ready to launch this next-gen device in 2027, then AMD is currently on track to support that launch.</p>



<p>Officially, we don't know a lot about this next-generation device. Microsoft and Xbox have hinted at what it will be like, with Xbox president <strong>Sarah Bond</strong> hinting that the device will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">a "<em>very premium, very high-end, curated experience</em>,"</a> while also adding that we can look to <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-be-best-of-both-worlds-between-pc-and-console/">how the <strong>ASUS ROG Xbox Ally</strong> operates in a space between console and PC</a> as to what Microsoft is trying to build with this new hardware.</p>



<p>Everything else we know about the device comes from reports and rumours, some of them supported by official comments, like how Bond calling it a "<em>very high-end</em>" device supports the rumour that <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/">it'll cost somewhere in the range of <strong>$1,000</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Or how allusions from Bond and Microsoft's head of gaming, <strong>Phil Spencer</strong>, about the device being a <strong>PC/console hybrid</strong> support rumours that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rumored-to-be-testing-steam-integration-within-microsoft-store-potentially-for-next-gen-xbox-too/">Microsoft is testing how it would put <strong>Steam</strong> on this new device</a>, which is further <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-features-xbox-game-dev-kit-point-next-gen-xbox-pc-console-hybrid/">supported by features added to software updates for Xbox development kits</a>.</p>



<p>Other questions about the console, like what <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-xbox-controller-with-dualsense-like-haptics-is-reportedly-still-on-the-way-for-next-gen/">features the controller will include</a>, whether it'll <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-digital-next-gen-sony-nintendo/">be a <strong>fully digital device</strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/">if it'll have <strong>backwards compatibility</strong></a><strong>, </strong>remain bigger questions for now. But at least we know that AMD is ready for it to arrive next year. Hopefully, Microsoft will be ready to launch next year, too, and we can learn more about what the company's plans are for its hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reports-a-9-overall-drop-in-xbox-revenue-for-q2-fy26-hardware-down-32/">as console sales continue to <strong>decline each quarter significantly</strong></a>. </p>
