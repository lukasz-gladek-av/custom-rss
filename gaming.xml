Once again, this was a PlayStation console exclusive, with a PC release, and—rather bizarrely considering—inclusion in Game Pass For PC. But still, nothing on Xbox.</p><figure id="" data-id="4cee181f19deed022924180b0b4820b8" data-recommend-id="image://4cee181f19deed022924180b0b4820b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's the widdle baby from Death Stranding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's the widdle baby from Death Stranding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4cee181f19deed022924180b0b4820b8" data-recommend-id="image://4cee181f19deed022924180b0b4820b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's the widdle baby from Death Stranding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, with the game’s fifth birthday arriving, it seems very likely some sort of exclusivity deal has expired, meaning the game was able to be surprise-launched on Xbox overnight.

In promotion of the event, Netflix released the first two episodes of the three-part docuseries <em>Countdown: Paul vs. Tyson,</em> showing a behind-the-scenes look at the lead-up to the bout. It didn’t take long before Paul was knocked out by Tyson...sort of.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="156" data-playlist="195891,196196,196452" data-current="195891"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21406.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Within the first six minutes of the docuseries, before we see more than 10 seconds of Paul throwing punches—and after watching Tyson pummel his trainer’s protective vest—we see Paul endure a fate he’s too young to have seen anyone else suffer: blowing on a <em>Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out</em> NES cartridge, hoping it will work. He unironically remarks that his failed attempts to tap the rust off of the ancient console to play the game “teaches you gratitude, kids, for the consoles we have today,” as if his life experiences are that far removed from the children he addresses. After a few bangs, TV screen taps, and surely some silent prayers to the Nintendo gods, the game starts, and Paul quickly experiences a simulation of what will likely happen when he steps into the real ring with the real Tyson—Iron Mike is nothing to fuck with.</p><p>The first taste of digital Tyson’s overpowered uppercut makes Paul acknowledge he needs to improve his speed and reaction time just before he lets out a frustrated yell after Tyson’s first-round knockout. Then, he was knocked out again. And again. And again. Paul intimated in the episode that Tyson’s boxing prowess only exists to his generation in the myth-building knockout compilations on YouTube, underscoring the generational divide that both makes this fight unnecessary and intriguing. <em>Punch-Out </em>gave him a small taste of just how unbeatable Tyson was in his prime—and maybe a glimpse into his future.</p><p><em>Punch-Out </em>was released in America in October 1987, two months after he became the youngest undisputed heavyweight champion, boasting a 31-0 record and striking fear in boxers trained to destroy people. He was a nightmare in the ring; <em>Punch-Out </em>made him a terror in everyone’s lives. The speed of his punches in the game were coupled with an infamously dangerous upper cut that was almost always a surefire knockout. People <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.espn.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=3729473&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=3729473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">videotaped themselves</a></span> beating Tyson just to prove to people they did it, like they were trying to prove Big Foot exists. There are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nes/s/KobHx8Gb9R&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nes/s/KobHx8Gb9R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit threads</a></span> as recent as 2023 of grown humans who still haven’t figured out how to beat 8-bit Tyson. The baddest man on the planet was once the hardest boss to beat in a game.</p><p>Admittedly, 58-year-old Tyson is a Jake Paul lifetime removed from his former boxing dominance and had to postpone this very fight with Paul after a health scare. While Gen Z and younger generations’ thirst for idol dismantling is palpable, there are older crowds who’ll watch the petulant troublemaker struggle to escape the first round in <em>Punch-Out</em> and hope real-life Tyson can duplicate his video game exploits one last time to give Paul the knockout he deserves. </p><p>The final <em>Countdown</em> episode streams on Netflix on November 12. <em>Countdown </em>narrator (and serial check chaser) Ice-T asks a question in the docuseries that kept repeating in my mind while watching Paul struggle against <em>Punch-Out </em>Tyson: “Why are both of them here demanding our attention at all?”</p><p>No matter the answer, I just wish they didn’t. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not so, according to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick. Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/take-two-interactive-sells-tales-of-the-shire-developer-private-division-strauss-zelnick-on-trump-election-1236202964/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Zelnick said that while he couldn’t offer a release date for GTA 6, the guaranteed megahit won’t cross paths with Borderlands 4. “I think it’s safe to say that we wouldn’t, and no one would, stack up huge releases unnecessarily,” Zelnick said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this mean for Borderlands 4’s release date? Well, in order for it to get out of the way of GTA 6 (assuming GTA 6 does indeed release fall 2025), and to fit in with the next fiscal year, it would either have to launch in the April to June 2025 quarter or the January to March 2026 quarter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If GTA 6 does release at some point between September and December next year, Take-Two will probably want at least a three-month gap between it and Borderlands 4, forcing Borderlands 4 into late spring to early summer 2025, or late winter to early spring 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 won’t be the only game desperate to avoid being dragged into the black hole GTA 6 creates within the video game industry. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, in development at 2K's Hangar 13, is also due out at some point in 2025. Then there are all the big games coming from other publishers. GTA 6 will probably be the biggest video game launch of all time, so no other game is safe from its gravitational pull. Even the might of Call of Duty, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-reportedly-a-black-ops-2-sequel-set-around-2030">set to launch yet another premium iteration around October or November 2025</a>, will be sorely tested by GTA 6.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Concept Art - PAX West 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Take-Two news, the company has sold indie publisher Private Division to an unknown buyer in the wake of shuttering Roll7 and Intercept Games, saying it wants to focus on its core and mobile businesses going forward.

Kojima Productions (Death Stranding) will continue to connect more and more players around the world, so please stay tuned.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Death Stranding Director’s Cut challenges players to reconnect a fractured society after the cataclysmic ‘Death Stranding’ event. This has opened a doorway between the living and the dead, leading to creatures from the afterlife roaming the fallen world marred by a desolate society. Carrying the disconnected remnants of humanity’s future in his hands, players take the role of Sam Bridges as he embarks on a mission to deliver hope to humanity by connecting the last survivors of a decimated America.</blockquote><blockquote>Director’s Cut is the definitive experience which also introduces a new ‘Ruined Factory’ location, a treacherous underground compound packed with fresh dangers. Sam also now has a wealth of new delivery assists, from cargo catapults and ramps, to a stabiliser which features thrusters that assist with cargo weight shifts and reduce the impact of landing when jumping from high areas. Melee combat has been amped up with the addition of more moves including a drop kick, whilst the new Maser Gun can stun enemies and short-circuit vehicles temporarily with electricity. Finding the perfect weapon loadout is now achievable thanks to the new firing range location, whilst the new Racetrack enables players to race and compete in time-attack competitions against other players who are connected online. Protagonist Sam Bridges can even ride Buddy Bots to traverse the wastelands with greater ease.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a busy time for Kojima and for Death Stranding. Its sequel, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, is due out as a Sony-published PS5 exclusive in 2025, and a movie based on the first game is in the works. Elsewhere, Kojima is working on OD for Xbox Game Studios, and Physint for Sony Interactive Entertainment. Could Death Stranding's launch on Xbox signal an eventual Xbox release for Death Stranding 2 further down the line?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
Roblox will make further changes to how its large audience of children interact with others on the platform, in response to growing safety fears. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updating-experience-guideline-policies-to-keep-our-younger-users-safe/3249079">latest steps</a> include a ban on users aged under 13 being able to access social hangout experiences in Roblox, beginning later this month. Additionally, though not until December, children will be blocked from seeing or playing experiences that have not been rated for their content.
</p>
<p>
Roblox says the change to kids being allowed into social hangout experiences will help "address user behaviour that can potentially pose a risk to our youngest users". 
</p>
<p>
In July, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">Bloomberg report highlighted the 13,316 instances of child exploitation</a> reported on Roblox in 2023 alone, and that two dozen people had been arrested for abusing minors following contact in Roblox. The following month, short-selling firm Hindenberg Research published further examples designed to highlight Roblox's failure to keep children safe, in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">report which labelled the platform as an "X-rated paedophile hellscape"</a> rife with "grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech". 
</p><p>
Roblox responded to that report by calling it "simply misleading", but last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-announces-policy-changes-for-pre-teen-users-amid-ongoing-accusations-of-child-safety-failures">announced plans to require parental permission for children under the age of 13 to access chat features by default</a>. Kids under nine will also need permission to play experiences rated with a maturity rating of "moderate". 
</p>
<p>
Now, children will be further restricted from accessing social hangouts - which Roblox describes as "things like vibe games, clubs, socialising and supportive spaces where the primary theme or purpose of the experience is to communicate (e.g. in text or voice chat) with other users as yourself" - as well as in "free-form user creation" where users can draw in 2D or write without this text going through Roblox moderation. 
</p>
<p>
From 3rd December, unrated experiences will become "unplayable, unsearchable, and undiscoverable by users under the age of 13", Roblox wrote, though users will still be able to access them via a direct link. 
</p>
<p>
For now, creators are being asked to rate experiences themselves, with enforcement beginning properly in 2025. In future, rating experiences will be "closely integrated" into the publishing process, Roblox said. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-hit-dress-to-impress-removes-hotdog-outfit-after-players-use-it-to-dress-up-like-male-genitalia">Roblox viral hit Dress to Impress removed a Halloween hotdog costume</a>, after players began using it to cosplay as male genitalia.

        <blockquote><p>The ground-breaking experience from legendary game creator Hideo Kojima, <em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut</em> also features the acting and voice talents led by a star-studded cast including Norman Reedus as Sam Bridges, Mads Mikkelsen, Lea Seydoux, Margaret Qualley, and Lindsay Wagner.</p><p><em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut</em> challenges players to reconnect a fractured society after the cataclysmic “Death Stranding” event. This has opened a doorway between the living and the dead, leading to creatures from the afterlife roaming the fallen world marred by a desolate society. Carrying the disconnected remnants of humanity’s future in his hands, players take the role of Sam Bridges as he embarks on a mission to deliver hope to humanity by connecting the last survivors of a decimated America.</p><p><em>Director’s Cut</em> is the definitive experience which also introduces a new ‘Ruined Factory’ location, a treacherous underground compound packed with fresh dangers. Sam also now has a wealth of new delivery assists, from cargo catapults and ramps, to a stabiliser which features thrusters that assist with cargo weight shifts and reduce the impact of landing when jumping from high areas. Melee combat has been amped up with the addition of more moves including a drop kick, whilst the new Maser Gun can stun enemies and short-circuit vehicles temporarily with electricity. Finding the perfect weapon loadout is now achievable thanks to the new firing range location, whilst the new Racetrack enables players to race and compete in time-attack competitions against other players who are connected online. Protagonist Sam Bridges can even ride Buddy Bots to traverse the wastelands with greater ease.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this year, Activision launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-could-be-cods-missing-link/1100-6521961/" data-ref-id="1100-6521961">Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</a>, the latest addition to the franchise's successful push into mobile gaming. However Warzone Mobile is already going to be losing support on older mobile devices starting later this month.</p><p>On November 14, Warzone Mobile's minimum specs will require iOS 17 or Android 13 or higher, as well as a GPU capable of bindless texturing. After that date, devices that can't meet those requirements will no longer receive updates or get access to the game's latest Season 1 content.</p><p>Users with older devices will still be able to play Warzone Mobile as long as version 3.10 has been downloaded and installed ahead of November 14. Unfortunately, this is a temporary reprieve. Activision's grace period will only extend six months before the revised minimum specs will be enforced for players who are still on the previous version of the game. The company also noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-mobile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-501123">Call of Duty Mobile</a> will be offering special rewards for players whose devices are no longer compatible with Warzone Mobile. Call of Duty Mobile includes its own version of battle royale separate from Warzone. </p><p>Call of Duty Mobile Season 10 began earlier this week with a lot of new content to celebrate the game's fifth anniversary. Among the additions is a new map, Krai, which has a narrative mission in addition to serving as the latest battle-royale environment. A new trailer for the game was also released.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWH80dGivyE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RWH80dGivyE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As part of the anniversary event, Call of Duty Mobile's latest battle pass includes new operator skins, weapon blueprints, CoD Points, and a battle-royale class called Teleport that lets players set a marker in place on a map that they can return to at any time with the teleport function. Additional updates and features will be added throughout Call of Duty Mobile Season 10.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-looks-glorious-with-ray-tracing-reality-redemption-and-other-mods-in-new-8k-video.1029558/</guid>

			<p>The recently released PC version of Red Dead Redemption doesn't feature any significant improvement over the PlayStation and Nintendo Switch ports, but thankfully, modders are already coming to the rescue, turning the new version of the glorious open-world game by Rockstar Games into the definitive edition of the game.</p>
<p>A new 8K resolution video put together by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Digital Dreams</a> shows how much mods like<a href="https://wccftech.com/reality-redemption-overhaul-mod-is-now-available-for-rdr-pc/"> Reality Redemption</a> and ReShade ray tracing can improve the game's visuals and make it feel closer to the proper modern remaster the game deserved but that Rockstar Games did not provide.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K100] Red Dead Redemption remastered with Mods and RAYTRACING | BeyondallLimits gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yhufsG0gXd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Essentially being the same game as the one released almost 15 years ago on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Red Dead Redemption, at the very least, runs extremely well on PC. An <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-comparison-8k-rtx-4070/">RTX 4070 GPU</a>, which is far from being a high-range GPU, for example, has no trouble running the game at 8K resolution with the help of NVIDIA DLSS, so any other mod coming in the future making big visual changes to the game shouldn't compromise performance even on lower-end machines.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation consoles, and Nintendo Switch. The game is also available on Xbox consoles via backward compatibility.</p>

<p>Following the announcement that a Death Stranding Director’s Cut will be coming to Xbox, Kojima Productions has also announced that the Death Stranding IP now belongs to the developer. </p>



<p>The announcement, which came via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/20241107-317236/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">automaton-media</a>, read, “In addition, KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS announced that the IP for this work will belong to the studio. They said that they will continue to connect more fans around the world in various forms of entertainment”.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is scheduled to release for the PlayStation 5 in 2025. However, recent news could suggest that the game could launch on day one on the Xbox platform and PC, too, if PlayStation didn’t get some form of marketing/exclusivity deal.</p>



<p>Regardless<span>, today’s announcement of the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-xbox-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Death Stranding Director’s Cut on Xbox</a>&nbsp;suggests that Death Stranding</span> 2 will eventually be released on Xbox and PC. </p>



<p>We’ll have to wait for an additional announcement of such details, with the most likely announcement coming at Geoff Keighley’s The Game Awards this December (granted, if PlayStation doesn’t have some exclusivity). </p>



<p>Death Stranding on the Xbox will be published by 505 Games.</p>

As a launch special, publisher 505 Games is offering Death Stranding at a 50% discount on Xbox.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the director's cut edition, which added enhanced graphical options, gameplay changes, and new content on top of the original game.

            <p>
Artwork and logos for Warcraft 2: Remastered have been spotted online, just a week away from Blizzard's upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-announced">World of Warcraft Direct livestream</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Next week's event, set to celebrate 30 years of the Warcraft franchise, will be streamed online next Wednesday 13th November at 6pm UK time. 
</p>
<p>
The timing of this leak, spotted by Wowhead after art turned up on Blizztracker, certainly suggests we'll hear more then. For now, the artwork shows characters aboard a piratical-looking sea vessel, under attack from fireballs. 
</p>
<p>
A remastered version of Warcraft 2 is a nice surprise, though perhaps not entirely unexpected following the launch of Warcraft 3 Reforged.

Blizzard's revamp of the seminal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-3-reforged-houses-a-fantastic-rts-but-blizzard-has-fluffed-the-remake">Warcraft 3 improved the game's visuals</a>, added missions from an original demo and made balance changes. Overall, though, it was largely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-3-reforged-is-the-lowest-user-scored-game-on-metacritic">panned on release</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Criticisms included its reliance on the original Warcraft 3's archaic user interface and main menu, and lack of polish for most cut-scenes. Its launch also saw the original Warcraft 3 client scrubbed from Battle.net - a particular bugbear for fans. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-addresses-fan-complaints-following-controversial-warcraft-3-reforged-launch">Blizzard apologised</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-changes-refund-policy-for-warcraft-3-reforged-to-allow-refunds-upon-request">changed its refund policy</a> as a result, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-details-shambolic-leadership-decisions-behind-blizzards-disastrous-warcraft-3-remake">the damage was done</a>.
</p>
<p>
It'll be interesting to see how Blizzard plans to remaster Warcraft 2 in response to all of that.
</p>
<p>While we wait, it's worth looking back at this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modders-are-building-a-warcraft-2-remake-in-warcraft-3-reforged">fan attempt to remake Warcraft 2 within Warcraft 3 Reforged</a>, thanks to the power of mods.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Take-Two Interactive have sold their publishing label Private Division to an unnamed party, along with five of Private Division's "live and unreleased titles". The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> publisher have also finally confirmed that they have shut down OlliOlli World and Rollerdrome devs Roll7 together with Kerbal Space Program 2 creators Intercept Games, months after performing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skateboarding-studio-roll7-is-reportedly-being-closed-down-by-parent-company-take-two">mass</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2-producer-confirms-mass-layoffs-contradicting-ceos-remarks">layoffs</a> at both studios.</p>
<p>"[W]e recently made the strategic decision to sell our Private Division label to focus our resources on growing our core and mobile businesses for the long-term," company president Karl Slatoff said in <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7">an investor call last night</a>. "As part of this transaction, the buyer purchased our rights to substantially all of Private Division's live and unreleased titles." Take-Two are holding onto <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked-2024">No Rest For The Wicked</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulslikers-are-going-to-love-ori-studios-new-arpg-no-rest-for-the-wicked">Soulsy early access ARPG</a> from the makers of Ori And The Blind Forest. </p>
<p>"We are grateful for the contributions that the Private Division team has made to our company and are confident that they will continue to achieve success in their new home," Slatoff added.</p>
<p>There's a bit more on the reasoning here in this <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-on-private-division-sale-those-projects-were-smaller-were-in-the-business-of-big-hits">GamesIndustry.biz interview</a> with Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick. The short version is that cool dystopian rollerskating games and sprawling engineer sandboxes do not make enough cash.  </p>
<p>"We're really best at these big AAA experiences," he said. "We have the biggest intellectual properties in the interactive entertainment business, some of the biggest intellectual properties in the overall entertainment business and to make sequels to existing beloved franchises as well as to create new hit intellectual properties is our mission.</p><p>"The team of Private Division did a great job supporting independent developers and, almost to a one, every project they supported did well," Zelnick went on. "However, the scale of those projects was, candidly, on the smaller side, and we're in the business of making great big hits."</p>
<p>Take-Two have had "strong second quarter results" for their fiscal year 2025, something Zelnick largely attributes in this week's investor call to "the continued success of the Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands franchises" (Borderlands, you might recall, recently had a movie adaptation, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">"benefited" Borderlands game sales</a> despite being a load of old rope). Zelnick anticipates "record" performance in 2026 and 2027, driven by the release of GTA 6, which Take-Two still have pegged for console launch in 2025 despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-could-slip-to-2026-under-rockstar-fallback-plan-according-to-reports">rumours it might slip to 2026</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017, Private Division was Take-Two's attempt to build an audience for more economical and adventurous "triple-I" games that combine the gloss of a GTA with relatively eccentric mechanics or stories. Take-Two aren't the only company to cut back on smaller experiments of late. Last month, Ubisoft confirmed that they had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/most-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-devs-have-moved-to-other-projects-ubisoft-confirm-following-report-about-rejected-sequel-pitch">broken up the team responsible for the well-regarded Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> (there were no layoffs).</p>
<p>In the wake of stagnating growth brought on by over-ambitious expansion during the Covid lockdown years, the investor-facing mindset appears currently to be: if it's not Assassin's Creed or GTA-scale, what's the point?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut is the first major former PlayStation console exclusive to release on Xbox consoles, as the latest game developed by Kojima Production has launched on Microsoft's consoles today.</p>
<p>As announced on X, the first entry in the series, which will continue next year with a new game, is now available on Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and the Windows Store. To celebrate this launch, which was made possible by Kojima Productions <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/20241107-317236/">reportedly now owning the IP</a> (Thanks, Automaton), the new version of the game will be available for 50% off the full price for the next two weeks. As of today, the open-world game by Kojima Production is also available on the Amazon <a href="https://luna.amazon.com/game/death-stranding-directors-cut/B0DL19P4JD?dm_i=74N0,SXSP,2EYVRT,3X552,1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luna + streaming service</a>.</p>

<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut is an enhanced version of the original PlayStation 4 release which launched in late 2019 worldwide. The new version of the game is undoubtedly the best way to experience Sam Bridge's story, as we highlighted in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut is without a doubt the best way to step into the shoes of Sam Bridges, at least for those that haven’t seen Kojima’s vision of a ruined America. What Kojima Productions brings to the PlayStation 5 are performance and additions that make the experience play better than ever, although what’s actually new to the game feels lacking compared to what’s come in other definitive Sony collections. With all of the additions and enhancements seamlessly integrated into the Director’s Cut, there’s little reason to consider playing the first draft of Hideo Kojima’s vision if you can get your hands on this new release.</em></p>
<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>The Final Fantasy VII PlayStation 5 Pro patch uses some of the console's features to deliver the best version of the game until the launch of the PC version.</p>
<p>From today, owners of the upgraded PS5 model will be able to enjoy the second entry in the remake project with a variety of improvements introduced by the 1.050 patch. The patch introduces <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Versatility Mode</a>, which targets 60 FPS like Performance Mode but offers a high resolution equivalent to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Im0BR2QmIk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graphics Mode</a> thanks to the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler. Additionally, the update uses the PlayStation 5 Pro High CPU Frequency Mode to offer a more stable framerate throughout the game.</p>
<p>Besides providing the details of the PlayStation 5 Pro patch, Square Enix also shared a few screenshots showcasing how Final Fantasy VII Rebirth looks on the system in Versatility Mode. You can check them out right below.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches worldwide today. With improved specs and the aforementioned PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, the system introduces improvements to over 50 titles that have already received their PS5 Pro patch. Even games that haven't received a dedicated patch can see improvements, as showcased by some <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-playstation-5-pro-test/">early tests</a> conducted earlier this week.</p>

Saving in Black Ops 6’s Zombies mode is only available to solo players, and you can only save one solo match at a time, which means if you leave the match without saving, there is no save to return to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MrRoflWaffles, who has 2.11 million subscribers on YouTube, set out to break his personal best of round 141 and to hit round 200 before the disastrous mistake put an end to the attempt.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">do NOT do this on round 147 in black ops 6 zombies 😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/QftwaSjISE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/QftwaSjISE</a></p>— Milo (@MrRoflWaffles) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrRoflWaffles/status/1854317500126626153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The disaster began when a confident MrRoflWaffles signaled his intention to save and quit then load back into the match. "This is how this works chat," he declared. "You quit the game, you reload in, and you try not to get bugs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MrRoflWaffles, perhaps moving too fast through Black Ops 6’s pause menu for his own good, accidentally selected ‘leave match’ rather than ‘save and quit.’ Despite the ‘leave game?’ warning pop up, MrRoflWaffles proceeded, putting an end to the run forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while, MrRoflWaffles’ chat couldn’t believe what they’d witnessed, with various messages of disbelief littering the screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Realization then kicked in, and, as you’d expect, MrRoflWaffles couldn’t believe what he’d done. “I left?!” he said. “What?! What?! What?! Are you kidding me?! You’re kidding me! You’re joking chat. Noooooooo!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“12 hours of my life,” MrRoflWaffles eventually sighed after a period of silence. “The bugs won. I’d rather have fought the bugs! I can’t believe I just did that. I’m in pain.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, who’s to blame? MrRoflWaffles for accidentally pressing the wrong button, or developer Treyarch for putting the 'leave match' and 'save and quit' buttons right next to each other in the Zombies pause menu? For his part, MrRoflWaffles said it was entirely his mistake, but called on Treyarch to make the leave match button a 'hold for three seconds' selection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I really want to blame Treyarch for putting the leave button next to the save button,” MrRoflWaffles said. “I want to blame them, but honestly this is my fault. I pressed the button.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/07/screenshot-2024-11-07-095630-1730977686676.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">MrRoflWaffles reacts in disbelief after accidentally ending his Black Ops 6 Zombies run.

But, alas, the game remembered.

Your immense love and interest mean everything to us. I was especially touched by the wonderful reception we received at gamescom, and it was incredible to see everyone creating such unique Zois during our 'inZOI: Character Studio' demo period.</blockquote><blockquote>Initially, we were uncertain about introducing 'Canvas' to the world, not knowing how many people would actually participate. However, the turnout was amazing, with an enormous number of uploads. Seeing so much engagement brought us immense happiness, and it was inspiring to see how deeply people connected with inZOI. Your feedback and insights made us realize the responsibility we have to provide players with the most complete experience possible.</blockquote><blockquote>This message is about that realization. After reviewing your feedback from inZOI: Character Studio and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have decided to release inZOI in Early Access on March 28, 2025. We apologize that we couldn't bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving inZOI the best possible start.</blockquote><blockquote>It's said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care required to nurture a child to adulthood is how I see our journey with inZOI — a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date reflects our commitment to building a stronger foundation for inZOI, so we can embark on this journey in the best way possible.</blockquote><blockquote>Until the release date, we'll continue working to improve any areas that need attention, striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation. Our goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for a long time to come. We'll keep you updated on our development progress, and we hope you'll join us on this journey toward inZOI's Early Access and beyond.</blockquote><blockquote>With love,</blockquote><blockquote>Kjun</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-first-preview-beautiful-and-full-of-potential-but-still-a-bit-hollow"><u>In IGN's preview if Inzoi</u></a>, we said: "The game’s world is extremely beautiful but somewhat empty in motion, permeated by a lack of grounding lore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>In addition to Xbox, the director's cut version of the game - described as the "definitive vision" of Death Stranding - is also available on PC and PS5. </p>
<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut "challenges players to reconnect a fractured society after the cataclysmic 'Death Stranding' event", the official blurb reads. "This has opened a doorway between the living and the dead, leading to creatures from the afterlife roaming the fallen world marred by a desolate society. Carrying the disconnected remnants of humanity’s future in his hands, players take the role of Sam Bridges as he embarks on a mission to deliver hope to humanity by connecting the last survivors of a decimated America."</p>
<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut on Series X/S includes support for Xbox Achievements. In addition, this version of the game also boasts features such as Photo Mode.</p>
<p>Those interested can scoop up Death Stranding Director's Cut for just £18 on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/death-stranding-directors-cut/9nqgn8tgnt8p?dm_i=74N0,SXRP,1MPOSW,3X2YT,1">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/">PC</a>. This deal is only available for a limited time, with the full price being £35. There is also an upgrade option for players who already own Death Stranding on PC. It remains full price on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA01968_00-DEATHSTRANDINGEU">PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p>Along with today's Xbox news, Kojima Productions also announced it now has full ownership of the Death Stranding IP.</p>

Last year, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-productions-announces-partnership-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie"> American film and TV production company A24 had partnered with Kojima Productions</a> to bring a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">live-action Death Stranding movie to life</a>.

</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> is also in the works. Subtitled On the Beach, we got another look at the upcoming game back in September. This included its very realistic photo mode and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">Sam Bridges' stop motion puppet companion</a>, Dollman.</p>
<p>At the same time, Hideo Kojima said he knew Death Stranding 2's release date already, but he refrained from sharing that news with the public. The developer said while he and his team were working "in preparation" for the release date, he could not confirm it until "some point next year".</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2s-release-date-wont-be-revealed-until-some-point-next-year">appears to still be on course for a 2025 release</a>, however. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has an upbeat outlook on this year's Borderlands film, and said that the  "disappointing" movie hasn't hurt the Borderlands video game series. In fact, it gave it a boost.</p>
<p>It's fair to say that the Borderlands film did not take off to the degree many had hoped and will not exactly go down in a Hall of Fame alongside the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-trailer-shows-our-best-look-yet-at-season-two">HBO's The Last of Us</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-series-passes-impressive-viewer-milestone-after-six-months">Amazon's Fallout</a>, both of which were praised by fans and critics alike.</p>
<p>Alas, for poor ol' Borderlands, this year's Cate Blanchett-fronted film was instead branded a "disaster" and "huge misfire" by viewers. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">one review called it a "lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud"</a>. Eesh. The adaptation generated just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">$4m across 3125 locations on its opening day</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-be-able-to-watch-the-borderlands-film-at-home-very-soon-it-seems">quickly getting shifted onto streaming services</a>.</p>

<p>Zelnick commented on the film's performance last night during an earnings call for Take-Two. When an investor asked about the project and how it contributed to the company, Zelnick stated Take Two didn't "really need to break out the contribution from the film because while it was economically positive, it wasn't material" to the company's results.</p><p>"Even though the film was disappointing, it actually benefited our catalogue sales," he continued. "So that is a sign that making a movie or a television show based on our very high-quality IP can drive catalogue sales and that can be a good thing."</p>
<p>That's not to say Take-Two is now going to go all in on film and television adaptations for its various IPs.</p>
<p>"All that said, we're really selective. And one of the reasons we have been so selective about licensing is we would really prefer that everything that comes out with our brands in it is really, really successful," Zelnick stated. "And we can't guarantee that, especially when it's out of our hands. So we have licensed other titles, we'll continue selectively… emphasis on the word selectively."</p>
<p>I now wonder what could be next...?</p>

<p>Earlier this year, founder of Borderlands developer Gearbox Randy Pitchford defended the studio's recent flops such as the film by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-randy-pitchford-defends-recent-flops-by-comparing-gearbox-to-the-beatles">comparing the company to The Beatles</a>. Writing on social media, Pitchford stated he was "going to keep making stuff" and subsequently brought the English rock band into the conversation.</p><p>As for what is next from the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-coming-2025-taking-players-to-an-all-new-planet">Borderlands 4 was announced back in August</a>. While the team at Gearbox has not announced a release date yet, it has said the game will be coming in 2025. It will be available across PS5, PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> publisher Take-Two has doubled down on the game's expected late 2025 launch window, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-recommits-to-autumn-2025-launch-following-delay-rumour">following earlier rumours that Rockstar could still delay</a> the game's arrival.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two's latest financial briefing last night pinned GTA6 to "fall of calendar [year] 2025", as previously expected. 
</p>
<p>
Other upcoming launches from the publisher include Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country - both of which simply have "fiscal 2026" launch dates. That means they'll arrive between 1st April 2025 and 31st March 2026.

<p>
Judas, the long-in-development next game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine, is listed with no firm launch window at all, meanwhile - it's simply down as "TBA". 
</p>
<p>
Back in February 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creators-next-game-judas-to-be-released-by-march-2025">Take-Two had the game listed as launching by the end of March 2025</a> - something the publisher is no longer stating. We got a quick look at the game in December 2022 at The Game Awards (it looked a lot like BioShock!) and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">saw a bit more in January of this year</a>, but have heard nothing more since.
</p>
<p>
Levine's last game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, launched in 2013 - over a decade ago.

<p>For now, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a> - also released a decade ago - continues to "outperform" sales expectations, specifically through "sustained engagement" (and spending) in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>. 
</p>
<p>"Sales of Grand Theft Auto V outperformed our expectations and to date, the title has sold more than 205m units worldwide," Zelnick said. "Grand Theft Auto Online also exceeded our plans, driven by sustained engagement with the summer content pack Bottom Dollar Bounties and an array of updates, including the new multistage Assault on ATT-16 [ph] mode and experience improvements such as a new anti-cheat system for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto Online."</p><p>Membership of the GTA+ subscription grew by 35 percent this year, Zelnick continued, as it added Rockstar classics such as Bully. Red Dead Redemption 2 has also continued to sell, and is now up to 67m sold since launch six years ago.</p>
<p>Zelnick previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-wont-be-on-a-subscription-service-on-day-one-because-take-twos-decisions-are-rational-says-ceo">not to expect GTA 6 to launch via any kind of subscription service</a>, such as Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, because Take-Two's "decisions are rational".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/07/take-two-sells-private-division-label-to-a-secret-new-owner/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Take-Two Interactive has announced the sale of their indie games publishing label Private Division, though hasn’t revealed who that is. Despite previous statements, they have also confirmed that developers Roll7 and Intercept Games were closed prior to the sale.</p>
<p>Details of the buyer will be revealed “relatively soon”, Take-Two Interactive Software CEO Strauss Zelnick told GamesIndustry.biz.</p>


<p>As part of the sale, the buyer now takes on all of Private Division’s catalogue of games and future projects, with the sole exception being Moon Studios’ action RPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/19/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-review-soulslike-action-rpg/">No Rest for the Wicked</a>, which entered Steam Early Access back in April. Other games, such as Weta Workshop’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/tales-of-the-shire-gets-a-new-march-25th-release-date/">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game</a> has gone with the publishing label.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, it was reported that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/02/take-two-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-studio-roll7-kerbal-space-program-2s-intercept-games/">Private Division was closing down OlliOlli developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games</a>, seemingly as part of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/17/take-two-layoffs-hit-5-of-staff-games-cancelled/">Take-Two’s cost-cutting measures</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Take-Two insisted that KSP2 would still receive updates, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">Zelnick publicly claimed</a> that the studios hadn’t been closed down. That statement was a big fat untruth, considering the WARN notices of job losses that were already available.</p>

<p>As for why they’re selling Private Division now? Zelnick just thinks indie games and smaller projects aren’t big enough to be worth Take-Two’s time.</p>
<p>Speaking to GI.biz, he said, “The team of Private Division did a great job supporting independent developers and, almost to a one, every project they supported did well. However, the scale of those projects was, candidly, on the smaller side, and we’re in the business of making great big hits.”</p>
<p>Take-Two, naturally, has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> in the pipeline.</p>

        <p>Along with basically every sci-fi universe of note</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
The dominion of hated Super Earth threatens to expand afresh as Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt toys openly with the prospect of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> cross-over games, beginning with tabletop wargame Trench Crusade and extending to, well, take your pick. Arrowhead's appetite for other licenses appears insatiable. It's the kind of sheer expansionism you'd expect from Earth's loathsome regime, whose "managed democracy" propaganda continues to enthrall thousands of hapless disposable imperialists. Pilestedt even wants to make a Fifth Element game! Milla Jovovich is spinning in her grave. Milla Jovovich isn't dead, you say? Well, that's good news at least.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Pilestedt pitched the Trench Crusade crossover last week in a Xitter reply. The debonair vultures of <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/helldivers-2-cco-wants-crossover-sickest-thing-imaginable/">Videogamer</a> subsequently swooped in and did an article about it, which Pilestedt <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1853793032249765932">has also replied to</a>. "Yeah, but these are just musings," he qualified, noting that stirring too many or the wrong kind of third-party license into the Helldivers world might "dilute the IP". 
</p>
<p>
While this might read like an attempt to stave off further reporting, Piletstedt simply couldn't help sharing "an extended list of IPs that I really would love to do a take on", which the jolly jackals of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-creative-boss-doesnt-want-to-dilute-it-with-crossovers-but-his-list-of-dream-choices-has-some-real-deep-cuts/">PCGamer</a> have seized in their slavering jaws. And now, we're writing it up too. What kind of creature is Rock Paper Shotgun in this particular Attenborough scenario? We are <em>bugs</em>, of course. We are a horde of alien insects, emerging triumphantly from our burrows to chew upon the carcass of this story. Without further ado, here's Pilestedt's list.
</p>
<blockquote><p>

- Aliens
</p>
<p>
- Starship Troopers
</p>
<p>
- Terminator
</p>
<p>
- Predator
</p>
<p>
- Star Wars
</p>
<p>
- Fifth Element
</p>
<p>
- Blade Runner
</p>
<p>
- Warhammer 40k
</p>
<p>
- Trench Crusade
</p>
<p>
- Mutant Chronicles
</p>
<p>
- Dropzone Commander
</p></blockquote>
<p>
You could argue that there are already bits and pieces of those in Helldivers 2 as it stands. Starship Troopers is, of course, the book-and-movie franchise Helldivers takes inspiration from. The game's satirical forever-war fiction is basically 40K but without the crenelations and waxen seals. The Terminator, Alien and Predator loom large in the design of Helldivers enemy factions. Still, I see a few untapped possibilities here that might take Helldivers in fascinating directions. Here's a brief list.
</p>
<p>
- Do a Terminator expansion where one of your team-mates could be a Terminator in a skinsuit. Most of my team-mates are trying to kill me anyway.
</p>
<p>
- If you're going to add xenomorphs, make it so they can abduct Helldivers and cocoon them, giving colleagues a window of time in which to rescue them before they're facehugged
</p>
<p>
- If you're going to do Warhammer 40K, don't just add Space Marines. Give us the option of turning ourselves into Dreadnoughts when we die. Also, endow each map with an ambient level of warp activity, with demons emerging if you commit too much heresy (e.g. by drop-podding your comrades)
</p>
<p>
- As for Starship Troopers, let us talk to the bugs using telepathy. It's what Edge would want, and it actually happens at the end of the  Verhoeven film. Spoilers, I guess!!!!!

			<p>As someone of a certain age, I’ve never really got into podcasts – a reaction not helped by the fact that everybody and their dog seem to have one nowadays. In fact I think I’ve actually been on more podcasts than I’ve actually listened to… That said, I can see the appeal of long form audio treatments of interesting topics, and especially the kind of spooky or dark content that works so well in that format. Dark and Deep takes the genre of conspiracy and haunted podcasts and weaves it into a disturbing and twisted tale with a truly unique artstyle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark and Deep Launch Trailer [ON STEAM AUGUST 13]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n7KP0nurg5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The central premise of Dark and Deep concerns the question of who is Samuel Judge, an IT specialist and loner who may be wrapped up in mysterious conspiracies. You play as the aforementioned Samuel and must unravel the increasingly weird situations you are thrust into whilst only relying on the hints revealed through enigmatic webchat conversations and snippets of the Dark and Deep podcast. What transpires feels like a fever dream that takes you from an argument over a stolen sandwich to deadly encounters with ghostly snakes and more.</p>


<p>Booting up Dark and Deep immediately strikes you with the singular vision of its distinctive artstyle. Solo dev Walter Woods has spent years immersed in the beautifully Gothic aesthetics of nineteenth century artist, Gustav Doré, and the result is as effective as it is unique. The environments you explore are made up of the monochromatic hash effects that characterise Dore’s style interspersed with more photo realistic modern offices and server rooms. This combination creates a techno-Gothic dreamy Hellscape that is perhaps Dark and Deep’s greatest feature.</p>


<p>Playing from a first-person perspective, exploration is mostly linear, aside from some puzzles that require a certain amount of backtracking. This approach works well to push you forward and the final build is much more focused and streamlined than the demo one I played a few months back. Aside from navigating the environments you will be blocked by some puzzles that require you to make use of a number of mysterious picture frames that you find and also drops of ember – bright shining orbs that power strange devices and move obstacles. A certain amount of platforming is needed to progress and it is here that the game sometimes falls down (or at least the character does…) as falling sends you back to the beginning of the section and can become frustrating –&nbsp;even with updates to improve collision detection.</p>
<p>The first of the frames you find reveals hidden objects and handholds on walls, whilst the next is used to destroy the skulking enemies who try to sabotage you by stealing ember. Later ones have other specific powers which I won’t spoil here and there a number of areas that force you to switch between them to progress. The overall loop is therefore set but the different frames do allow for a decent amount of variety within what could have been a very straight forward walking sim setup.</p>

<p>Storytelling here is kept to a minimum in order to ensure that you constantly feel on edge, but the mood is more of suspense than straight out horror. Throughout the levels you’ll occasionally come across computer desks which can be interacted with to read chat logs and listen to the eponymous podcasts. This slow drip feed of information is effective and even by the game’s ending there are questions left to ponder.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Dark and Deep is a focused and atmospheric title that doesn’t outstay it’s welcome. Most of this time is spent immersed in the unique aesthetic and it stands out amongst the many other copycat PT wannabes that flood the horror tag on Steam. The ending is interesting although some of the imagery felt too separated from the Doré influence and instead moved into more conventional folk horror. All in all, Dark and Deep is a well polished and fascinating indie horror that has a look and feel all of its own, and for that it deserves a wider audience.	</p></div>
