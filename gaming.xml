            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24178649/house-dragon-season-2-daemon-assassins-prince-blood-cheese<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ybfAFG"><em>House of the Dragon</em> has always been about how the smallest decisions can have unforeseen consequences, but rarely has that theme been as clear as it was in the season 2 premiere. In the show’s first episode back from break, Daemon Targaryen decides to take matters into his own hands with a plot that probably could have used a little more planning (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23380813/house-dragon-daemon-matt-smith-wedding-bad-guy">classic Daemon</a>). But while the book’s version of these events is fittingly brutal, the show’s approach is quieter, more human, and arguably a little more horrifying. </p>
<p id="EF2kKV">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This story contains spoilers for <em>House of the Dragon </em>season 2 episode 1.]</p>
<p id="Uxr3TR">In the book version of the story, the assassins at the center of this episode’s action are named Blood and Cheese. And while they don’t get these silly names in the show, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23404846/house-dragon-alicent-larys-feet-oh-no">they do get a level of horror and humanity</a> that the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23292279/house-of-the-dragon-mushroom-canon">book doesn’t have time to afford them</a>. The book versions are boogeymen, terrifying lowlifes who kill a handmaiden and a handful of guards, and seem gleefully cruel in the way they slay Prince Jaehaerys — tricking Queen Helaena into first naming her younger son for death before killing her firstborn instead. </p>

<p id="mvsODa">And while those versions of the characters are significantly more stomach-churning, the show’s approach feels much more appropriate thematically. Rather than the murderous wraiths of the book, who slip into the queen mother’s chambers, leaving a pile of bodies behind them, <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s assassins simply move through the castle unnoticed, a pair of hired hands of low status and low intelligence, functionally invisible to the royalty who own the halls. When they reach difficult junctures in the castle’s tunnels, or difficult choices, they panic and bicker and bumble. The Blood and Cheese of the show aren’t gifted killers, they’re just amoral men sent to do something too disgusting for anyone to have imagined possible. </p>
<p id="REsk9J">Adding to all of this is the sense of desperation that the pair’s meeting with Daemon seems to have instilled in them. According to showrunner Ryan Condal, the team wanted the set-piece to play out like a “heist gone wrong,” and as the scene stretches on, we can feel their worry set in, making them more reckless, cruel, and hurried in the process. While the show cleverly leaves Daemon’s final words a mystery, the pair’s fear over what Daemon will do to them if they fail is palpable.</p>
<p id="U7mmlp">“We know who Daemon is; I don’t think he necessarily directly ordered the death of a child,” Condal said in a roundtable. “But he clearly said, <em>If it’s not Aemond, don’t leave the castle empty-handed</em>.”</p>
<p id="wxXWsd">So when they can’t find their initial target, it makes sense that these two decide to settle for the first royal son they can find. It’s the kind of hurried decision that only these two brutes could make. And, in a scene that’s both grotesque and funny, the two assassins realize that they can’t even tell the two children asleep in their beds apart, and have to riddle their way through Helaena’s answer. The whole thing is a ridiculous farce from two people barely competent enough to pull any of this off. </p>

</p>
<p id="Jmpnea">All of this builds into the show’s fantastic slippery slope of assumptions. While the audience may know that Aemond’s slaying of Lucerys Velaryon in the skies over Storm’s End was an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419041/house-dragon-aemond-targaryen-death-dragon-sapphire-eye-villain-meaning">accidental consequence of not understanding his own dragon’s power</a>, for Daemon, it seems like an act of clear and predetermined aggression. He probably didn’t expect the assassins to come away with the head of a toddler prince, but he thinks letting two assassins loose in the Red Keep with less-than-clear orders is nothing more than a slight escalation.</p>
<p id="2U9X3S">These are the kind of spiraling, misinformed decisions that <em>House of the Dragon</em> builds its beautiful, flawed, and deeply human history out of. Sure, the show is elevated to the heights of fantasy, but it’s still fundamentally a story of broken, furious, and faulty characters making rash decisions and then dealing with the consequences — those consequences just <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23631284/house-dragon-season-2-plot-game-of-thrones-teaser-winds-of-winter">often happen to involve dragons and war</a>. </p>
<p id="7mb6j3">All of this is true to Martin’s vision, of course. It’s the same kind of storytelling he employs constantly in A Song of Ice and Fire, but while the original <em>Game of Thrones</em> series frequently had to cut down on the humanness of its story simply by virtue of its massive scale, it’s constantly thrilling to see how effectively <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23423671/house-dragon-season-1-review"><em>House of the Dragon</em> goes the opposite direction</a>, expanding on Martin’s written history in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> and turning these quasi-mythical historical figures into flesh-and-blood people and incredible characters, up to and including the lowlife assassins who don’t even need their silly little names. </p>

  <p id="T31SS8"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419614/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-release-date-cast-news"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> season 1 saw a lot of politicking. As factions and animosity grew in equal measure, the Targaryen family spent a lot more time fighting and yelling in the rooms of King’s Landing than they did riding dragons. But by the final episode, the dragons — and their use in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23415231/house-dragon-green-blacks-dance-dragons-explained">coming Dance of the Dragons</a> — take center stage. </p>
<p id="LhuYVo">And season 2 is picking right up where the last season left off, with a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23368925/house-of-the-dragon-kids-who-rhaenyra-alicent-daemon-jace-joffrey-aegon">House Targaryen</a> civil war on its way. Now, more than ever, how many dragons are on each side and who their riders are really <em>matters</em>. As we see in episode 10, even with the proper rider, dragon warfare can <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419108/house-dragon-aemond-lucerys-vhagar-battle">lead to calamitous consequences</a>. Season 2’s premiere sees Alicent trying to make this clear to Aegon — but, this is the Dance of Dragons, after all; there’s bound to be a bit of talon on talon. </p>
<p id="aewTaz">Especially since, as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23419263/house-dragon-daemon-singing-vermithor">Daemon (Matt Smith) noted</a> in the season 1 finale: Not all the dragons in Westeros are accounted for; there are “neutral” dragons, which are dragons that (for one reason or another) have no rider. In a war where dragons — and their varying strength, might, and size — impact who controls which part of the map, any dragons up for grabs are likely to be important. </p>
<p id="bwXhyL">So with season 2’s war underway, it’s worth taking a second to account for each of the dragons that <em>House of the Dragon</em> has set up so far, whose side they’re on, and who their rider is.</p>

<p id="CaTYBV">Riders: Laena (deceased), Aemond Targaryen</p>
<p id="IUzLFy">The oldest and biggest of the Targaryen dragons in Westeros, and the only living remnant of Aegon’s conquest, Vhagar was once ridden by Visenya Targaryen when she, her brother, and her sister united the seven kingdoms. Vhagar then passed to Baelon Targaryen, before being claimed by her most recent (previous to episode 7) rider, Laena Velaryon. After Laena’s death, the dragon remained riderless for only a short time before being claimed by Aemond Targaryen, whose dragon egg baby gift did not hatch. Despite Vhagar’s age, she remains one of the most fearsome and dangerous dragons in Westeros, and is now ridden by one of the Greens’ most ardent supporters. </p>
<p id="aGr15w">Vhagar and Aemond were directly responsible for Lucerys’ death at the end of season 1. Now, Aegon is eager to use Vhagar to blast his way through this civil war. Alicent (et al.) are not so stoked on that plan, and would actually prefer Vhagar be left in King’s Landing as much as possible for defense. </p>
<h2 id="xb1vSU"><strong>Sunfyre </strong></h2>
<p id="LYWQEJ">Rider: Aegon Targaryen</p>
<p id="ZdXcxv">A bright-gold dragon with pink-membraned wings, Sunfyre is the dragon of Aegon Targaryen and a swift flier, though far from the biggest of the Targaryens’ remaining dragons. Nonetheless, Aegon feels good about a Sunfyre and Vhagar team-up being enough to bring houses that haven’t declared for them to heel. </p>
<h2 id="xTSKTR"><strong>Dreamfyre</strong></h2>
<p id="bnKvTK">Rider: Helaena Targaryen</p>
<p id="tQxZgm">Dreamfyre is a pale-blue dragon, older but more slender than most of the others. She is claimed by Helaena Targaryen.</p>

<p id="ruhCZr">Caraxes is one of the largest and most dangerous of all the remaining Targaryen dragons, thanks in part to the fact that it’s seen war most recently.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-with-an-impressive-first-2-hours<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The list of impressive looking soulslike games on the horizon is long, with games like Phantom Blade Zero, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, and Wuchong: Fallen Feathers all having solid showings this summer event season. But there’s always been something extra special about Black Myth: Wukong. It’s stunningly gorgeous, the animations are incredibly fluid, it’s steeped in rich Chinese culture, and there’s just something immensely satisfying about playing as a Monkey King and beating up all sorts of mythical creatures with a giant extendable staff. While this isn’t the first time IGN has gone hands-on with the game, it is my own personal first time with it – and after two hours of playtime with the opening chapter, I somehow walked away even more excited for its August 20th release. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>IGN China has already done an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-the-first-hands-on-preview"><u>extensive preview</u></a> on what Wukong plays like on a late game build with many techniques, stances, and transformations already unlocked, which is great because my two hours covered pretty much the very start of the game. The first thing that I noticed as I started playing was how fluid and fast Wukong feels to control. Many soulslikes are built on a foundation of  slower and more methodical combat, but Wukong feels exceptionally quick and agile. From the beginning, there’s actually no block button. Wukong can twirl his staff to block projectiles, but as far as melee attacks go, everything must be dodged. To that end, there’s a Bayonetta-style dodge system where you can dodge up to three times very quickly, but after the third one, you’re punished with a lengthy recovery time to try and curb people from just mindlessly mashing the dodge button. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Wukong feels exceptionally quick and agile.</p></div><p>Perfectly timed dodges will reward you with extra focus, and once your focus bar has been filled, you get a focus point that allows you to chain a strong attack into your light combo string for a big chunk of damage. Later on, those focus points can also be spent on different types of special moves that you unlock in the skill tree, which we’ll get to later. </p><p>Wukong also has access to a number of spells that consume his mana. I only really got to play around with the immobilize spell, which as you can imagine, stops an enemy in their tracks and allows you to sneak in a few free hits before the spell’s effect wears off. Stronger enemies and especially bosses are affected by the spell much less, and sometimes they were able to shrug it off entirely. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even at just an early stage, combat was a fun dance of actively looking for opportunities to avoid enemy attacks and find openings to attack, keeping an eye on my focus meter so I could use a damaging heavy attack whenever I had a chance, while also managing my mana and cooldown for my immobilize spell. Eventually I got my first transformation, which turns Wukong into an absolute beast, with much stronger attacks, and a hugely damaging super attack that he can use out of a dodge if he manages to build up a focus point. One of his moves in this transformation is a lightning fast dash attack that made me feel like I had basically turned into the boss that I got the transformation from. </p><p>Later on I added another tool to my repertoire: the tower stance, which swapped out my chargeable overhead strong attack for the ability to stand on my staff and avoid damage on the ground as long as my stamina held out. If I managed to stay on the staff long enough for a focus point to charge, I could spend it to leap off the staff, flip it around, and come crashing down with a powerful strike that felt incredibly cool to pull off. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>These stances, along with my general combat abilities, could all be upgraded through a level-up system that works a lot like Sekiro’s. As you defeat enemies, you’ll gain Will, which builds up a bar in the top right of the screen. When the bar is full, you gain a Spark, which can be used to purchase upgrades from one of your various skill trees. Once you fill the bar and bank a point, you can’t lose it. You can even add that skill point whenever you want, not just at a shrine, which serves as Wukong’s version of a bonfire-like checkpoint. However, if you die before you manage to fill the bar, a portion of that experience will be lost in typical soulslike fashion. </p><p>Don’t let that trick you into thinking that Wukong is an easy game though, because it certainly is not. Enemies are aggressive, bosses are relentless and even more so in their second phases, and you only have a scant few restorative potions to keep yourself alive. I also managed to find a secret boss room behind a waterfall that took me to a dragon boss that just absolutely wrecked me. Fortunately, you can teleport from shrine to shrine, so you can come back to him much later down the road once you’ve upgraded your gear and added some more points into your skill trees. And speaking of gear, I didn’t manage to find all that much, but I did find enough to at least know that there are sets of armor that grant extra bonuses for wearing multiple pieces of gear from that set. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Enemies are aggressive, bosses are relentless, and you only have a scant few restorative potions to keep you alive.</p></div><p>The levels themselves were fairly linear with a couple of branching points that led to some sort of treasure or item pickup. The real star of the show, though, were the boss battles. Even in just two hours I fought against a wide variety of bosses, from a speedy wolf boss that I snagged my first transformation from, to a mule-kicking frog in human clothes, to an extremely difficult two-phased battle against a snake man. </p><p>All in all, I greatly enjoyed my time with Black Myth: Wukong. Even in just two hours of playtime, I felt like I got to experience a lot of combat progression and am excited to see how things continue to evolve as the game goes on. We won’t have to wait much longer to see how the full game shakes out, as Black Myth: Wukong releases on PC and PlayStation 5 on August 20. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/team-tremor-disqualified-from-dbdleague-after-refusing-to-rejoin-match-after-a-known-bug/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=team-tremor-disqualified-from-dbdleague-after-refusing-to-rejoin-match-after-a-known-bug<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="228" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">DBDLegue has confirmed that Team Tremor has been disqualified from Season 9 for failing to rejoin within a set deadline following the discovery and ruling on a specific bug that referees found had triggered in a previous match. </p> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">As DBDLeague Season 9 continues through June, the official body recently issued a statement explaining that Team Tremor, one of the competing teams, had been disqualified. To be clear, the official statement says that Team Tremor was disqualified for quitting the league’s voice chat and failing to rejoin within the given time limit. All this came about, though, because of a bug and the referee ruling around it. </p>
 <h2 id="h-team-tremor-quit-dbdleague-following-a-ruling-on-a-known-unhooking-bug" data-injectable="false">Team Tremor quit DBDLEague following a ruling on a known unhooking bug</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="true">The statement from DBDLeague was issued soon after Team Tremor was disqualified. It details the events as they occurred, showing how all teams were made aware of a bug that prevents <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-survivor-perks-in-dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Survivors</a> from unhooking each other if the Killer is too close to the hook. That bug was triggered during a Team Tremor match, and referees subsequently decided that a rematch was in order. Team Tremor would be penalized, though not that severely. </p>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">DBDLeague is clear that this decision was made in the interest of fairness. The bug is inconsistent and could have been triggered accidentally, which is why Team Tremor wasn’t penalized as harshly as it would have been in other instances and why a rematch was on the cards. </p> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Team Tremor, for whatever reason, quit the DBDLeague voice chat after hearing the decision and never returned. As a result, it’s been disqualified from Season 9. The players have been suspended indefinitely in an effort by DBDLeague to demonstrate the integrity of the Esport. </p>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/brnfrmawsh/status/1802294574640984259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ahren</a> posted a few videos showing the bug in action and Team Tremor being informed of the ruling. Multiple times, it was made clear to the team that they were not being accused of cheating or deliberately triggering the bug, but they quit and disappeared regardless. </p> <figure data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">DBDLeague is the closest thing to a <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead by Daylight</a></em> Esport that you’ll find. In it, teams of players compete to achieve the best performance against each other in groups of five, split up into a team of Survivors and a single Killer. Not all players jump into the same match together. Instead, one team’s Killer will play against another team’s Survivors, and vice versa, and the results of those matches decide who emerges victorious. </p>
 <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="false">The <em>Dead by Daylight</em> Esport scene has struggled to get off the ground ever since the game was released. Bugs and constant Perk and Killer tweaks from Behaviour Interactive have made it extremely difficult to establish fair competition for everyone. However, DBDLeague seems to be doing a great job in its ninth season so far. Rulings like this might be difficult, but they do show the severity with which any potential cheating is treated. </p>

<p>In our Lords of the Fallen review, Jason said, <em>“I desperately want to like Lords of the Fallen, but it’s the first game all year that’s actively annoyed me. I love the Soulslike genre more than any other, but this game took all of the lessons it could have learned since the original Lords of the Fallen and either forgot them entirely, or just misunderstood them so greviously that you’d assume it skipped a class.”</em></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is set 10 years after Dragon Age: Inquisition.</p>
<p>In a Q&amp;A session held on Discord and relayed by Shinobi602, the team confirmed several hitherto unknown aspects of the highly anticipated sequel, including the news that The Inquisitor will "definitely be part of the story".</p>
<p>We also learned a little more about how the game will be unfold, including news that, unlike Inquisition, there will be no power mechanic to block progress, locations can change based on your choices, and you can return to complete side quests – which are described as "handcrafted and story focused" – in locations you've already visited. The team also said that there will be no "fetch quests".</p>

<p>Furthermore, your origin story "will come into play a lot during the course of the game", "giving you opportunities to define who your Rook was and is, and lots of dialogue options".</p>
<p>The team also said that it has decided to drop the party size from three to two in order to focus on a "much more intimate experience" in which you'll have to balance the skills of your companions much more carefully than prior Dragon Age instalments.</p>

<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-creator-says-veilguards-approach-to-romance-isnt-a-huge-surprise-following-baldurs-gate-3">David Gaider recently shared his thoughts on Dragon Age: The Veilguard's romance options</a>. Gaider, who is the creator of Dragon Age and lead writer on the series' previous instalments, offered up a lengthy thread on social media platform X where he compared the romance approach to the popular Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>"I guess the move in [Dragon Age: The Veilguard] to 'all companions are romanceable by everyone' isn't a huge surprise, considering [Baldur's Gate 3], but - unsurprisingly - I have a few thoughts," Gaider said, before acknowledging the "fandom is pretty split on romance design".</p>
<p>For more, Chris went hands-on with Dragon Age: The Veilguard earlier this week, and he was rather taken with it. "Whisper it, but Dragon Age: The Veilguard has me thinking the unthinkable: it looks like BioWare is back," he wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard preview</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> creator Hidetaka Miyazaki is okay with you playing Elden Ring in co-op – even if you're using mods to buddy up "beginning to end".</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fromsoftwares-says-elden-rings-seamless-co-op-mod-is-definitely-not-something-we-actively-oppose-and-may-even-consider-ideas-like-that-with-our-future-games/">PC Gamer</a>, FromSoftware president Miyazaki was asked his thoughts on the modding community's efforts to tweak Elden Ring's features, including the Seamless Co-op mod that permits players to team up beyond mere boss fights.</p>
<p>Miyazaki confirmed that while the team intentionally designed a "casual" system wherein you could "drop in, defeat a boss, drop out", it does not "actively oppose or downplay" Tarnished who prefer to take on the horrors of The Lands Between with a pal by their side.</p>

<p>"It's definitely not something we actively oppose or want to downplay, wanting to go through the whole game together," Miyazaki said. "In terms of where we were with Elden Ring, it was simply a case of wanting that more loose, casual style – drop in, defeat a boss, drop out. It doesn't put any technical restrictions on the player, it just sort of lets them complete this focus and then move on, so to speak.</p>
<p>"That's not to say we won't consider other ways like you and your friend played, from beginning to end, total co-op – that's not to say we won't consider ideas like that with our future games."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-next-fallout-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Todd Howard, arguably the face of Bethesda Game Studios, recently sat down and spoke at length about the Fallout franchise – both the future and present of the series’ ecosystem. As you can imagine, one of the first questions to come up was regarding the next step in the series – the <strong>next Fallout game</strong>. However, Howard’s answer wasn’t necessarily one that would fill Fallout fans worldwide with hope of anything coming anytime soon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fallout-has-never-been-more-popular">‘Fallout Has Never Been More Popular’</h2>



<p>In an hour-long interview with YouTuber MrMattyPlays, Todd Howard took a deep dive into all things Bethesda Game Studios, touching on Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and Starfield. He revealed quite a bit about all the franchises under his belt, such as suggesting that the plan is to deploy a premium expansion in Starfield at least once a year moving forward.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Matty Interviews Todd Howard: Future Of Fallout, Starfield Year 2, Elder Scrolls VI Info, &amp; MORE!" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The most interesting portion of the conversation (for some, anyway) was when Todd Howard addressed the next Fallout game. He acknowledged that ‘Fallout has never been more popular’ than it is right now, and that’s mostly thanks to the success of Amazon’s Fallout TV show. He appreciated that millions of players have found their way into the ecosystem in recent months, but he still doesn’t believe there’s any need to move quickly and deploy a new Fallout game to answer the hype.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For other Fallout games in the future, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say sort of rushing through them, or we need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76, you know… We don’t feel like we need to rush any of that. Right now, the Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and story-telling. </p>



<p>I totally get the desire for a new kind of ‘mainline’ single-player game, but those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things, as well. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s Elder Scrolls or Fallout or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loves these franchises as much as we do.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fallout is a legendary post-apocalyptic series with more than twenty-five years on the market, and from an ambitious MMORPG to a diverse array of first- and third-person action RPG titles, the franchise has dominated the category it has spearheaded for so long. Fans are hungry for another single-player story, but it seems that they’ll need to wait several years for that to surface. It might have already been nine years since the last single-player game appeared in the series, but there’s plenty for Bethesda Game Studios to be working on right now that takes precedence over Fallout.</p>

It’s the type of game that would work perfectly on a handheld platform like the Switch and maybe even the Steam Deck. </p> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">Leading up to its release, <em>Magical Delicacy</em> has been confirmed for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch. It’s a game that I believe is perfect for handheld mode on the Switch, but I also realize that not everyone has that console. That’s why it would be nice if the game were Steam Deck compatible, so more people could enjoy it while getting comfy and cozy in the evening instead of strictly at a desk.</p>
 <h2 id="h-is-magical-delicacy-steam-deck-compatible" data-injectable="false">Is <em>Magical Delicacy</em> Steam Deck compatible?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Magical Delicacy Announcement Trailer - Whitethorn Winter" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YTvkuQZGYgI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">Yes, developer Skaule has confirmed that <em>Magical Delicacy</em> will be Steam Deck compatible from day one. A few fans reported having success running the demo soon after <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-game-in-the-access-ability-summer-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">June’s various game showcases</a>, so I reached out for confirmation. That’s how I know you, and I will be able to load this deliciously delightful game on our Steam Decks at launch.</p>
 <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">In <em>Magical Delicacy</em>, you play a young witch who has moved to a new town to train her skills by helping out the locals. As you meet more and more people around the town and help them through food or your flair for magic, you’ll unlock more and more of the location and uncover the town’s past and those who helped build its history. </p> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="743" data-injectable="true">The gameplay revolves around 2D platforming and ingredient gathering. You’ll unlock more recipes as you progress and must upgrade your kitchen to ensure you can cook everything required by the townsfolk. The game allows you to create a completely custom kitchen while still maintaining that sense of progression that will be key to making you want to push through to see the story to the end. </p>
 <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">It’s hard to deny that the Switch is the ideal place to play 2D platformers and Metroidvanias when games like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Well</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-metroid-dread/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Dread</a></em> run so well on it. I’m a huge fan of Valve’s Steam Deck because it allows other similar games to run in a handheld format even when the developer hasn’t released its game for Nintendo’s hybrid console. </p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="false"><em>Magical Delicacy</em> combines the thrill of progression from Metroidvianias and action from 2D platformers with the cozy themes of cooking and building a place to call home in a scary and new place. I can’t imagine playing it in any way other than handheld mode, and I’m sure I’m not alone. </p>

        <p>"Once an exploit is identified and confirmed, continued abuse for personal gain will not be tolerated."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games has banned over 600 accounts after players used "multiple exploits" to "cheat and exploit" the game.</p>
<p>In a brief but firm <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/an-update-on-auec-exploits-and-account-suspensions/6978548">statement</a> about the issues, senior director of player relations Will "Soulcrusher" Leverett said the team had now completed an investigation, resulting in over 600 suspensions and the removal of "the illicitly gained aUEC from the Star Citizen ecosystem".</p>

<p>"We've completed an investigation into multiple exploits within Star Citizen that compromised stability and negatively impacted the in-game economy," Leverett said. "As a result, we have resolved multiple aUEC exploits in 3.23.1a, and we've identified and suspended over 600 accounts involved in exploitative behaviours while also removing the illicitly gained aUEC from the Star Citizen ecosystem.</p>
<p>"Cheating and exploiting undermine the integrity of our game and the efforts of our dedicated backers who help us build Star Citizen. We take these actions seriously and assure you that we are continuously developing additional measures against cheating and exploitation. We will continue to prioritise triaging exploits with the highest urgency to isolate and address these issues as they pop up."</p>
<p>Leverett added that whilst exploits and issues are inevitable at "this stage of development", it was working closely with the community to identify, test, and report exploits.</p>
<p>"We've gained valuable insights through your issue council reports, and we thank you for that," Leverett concluded. "However, once an exploit is identified and confirmed, continued abuse for personal gain will not be tolerated and will result in action on our part.</p>
<p>"Once again, we're super appreciative of your efforts in flagging recent issues and your general support in utilising the Issue Council. We'll keep you updated as we continue to develop measures to ensure fair play."</p>
<p>Cloud Imperium Games' CEO, Chris Roberts, recently said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-is-finally-pushing-towards-the-finish-line">Star Citizen was pushing towards the "finish line" of a 1.0 release</a>.</p>
<p>"After many hard years of work towards a goal many thought was impossible, we are on the cusp of delivering one of the final pieces of technology that will enable a connected, shared universe that thousands of people can experience together at the same time," Roberts explained in his <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/19848-Letter-From-The-Chairman">latest Letter from the Chairman update</a> in March.</p>
<p>We recently reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-developer-hit-with-layoffs-amid-claims-of-a-highly-toxic-company">Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games had suffered layoffs</a> amid unrest due to relocation and accusations of a "highly toxic company". That hasn't stopped it from massing an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-but-has-raised-over-700m">astonishing $700m in crowdfunding, though</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, renowned YouTuber MrMattyPlays <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ew8LQFGNWU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> an hour-long video interview with Bethesda's Todd Howard, which touched on several topics, including the studio's latest game, Starfield.</p>
<p>Howard provided an update on the game's player base. Last we <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-13-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a>, in December 2023, the game had registered 13 million players. Now, it's increased by another million.</p>
<p><em>We now have&nbsp;three big franchises. Starfield has 14 million players, and the average playtime is still over 40 hours a player. It's just like a staggering amount of time in-game.</em></p>
<p>The conversation then shifted to <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-drops-new-content-creations-mod-kit-and-shattered-space-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shattered Space</a>, the first Starfield DLC slated for release later this year. Todd Howard revealed that it's an 'annual story expansion' that is around the size of Fallout 4's Far Harbor (which took around 15 hours on average for main plus side quests) and mainly takes place on a single planet, allowing to return to that seamless exploration Bethesda games are known for.</p>
<p><em>Something we had planned for, and one of the things that - I mean, it's great to everybody react to the trailer and the mood that we're trying to put out there, but one of the things that we always liked about it from the get-go and I don't think people realize is that Shattered Space, the bulk of that expansion pack, once you get to the city and the planet, it pretty much takes place there.</em></p>
<p><em>It allows us to build a landscape like we would traditionally do and have the city and the quests. That story takes place there, and the landscape, content-wise, we're looking at kind of like what we did with Far Harbor on Fallout 4. This is a scope that works for our development in doing this kind of annual story expansion type. </em><em>Really excited about that and it lets us kind of do some things the way we would in previous games and give people not completely that experience because it's still Starfield, but this new kind of alien world that you're able to explore and it takes place there.</em></p>
<p>MrMattyPlays asked Howard whether it was a reaction to the community's criticism toward the different kinds of exploration available in the sci-fi RPG. However, it sounds like Bethesda was already inclined to do so even before hearing from players.</p>
<p><em>When we were making Starfield, we struggled with how to make exploration fun on big, barren planets. We felt good with where we landed, knowing that it was not going to scratch the same itch for a lot of people that you would when you have a more bespoke landscape that you're exploring.</em></p>
<p><em> So it was for us, too. We wanted to build something like that and felt that this was the right way to go about it with something that had its own theme and tone that we could put you on a planet.</em> <em>One of the benefits of Starfield and its scope is it allows something like that within it while feeling natural, so it was our own reaction that we had as well.</em></p>
<p>Going back to the mention of annual story expansions for Starfield, Howard clarified:</p>
<p><em>I would say we want to, more or less. How long that continues, hopefully a very long time, but that's what we're planning for the one after this. So, there will be another one.</em></p>
<p>Are you excited to get back into the game with Shattered Space? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lore-behind-rusty-rabbit-is-absolutely-nuts<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Rusty Rabbit </em>appears to be an ordinary platformer on the surface, but dig just a little deeper and you'll find that this game has lore created by one of anime's most celebrated creators. Gen Urobuchi created the concept and script of this wild post-apocalyptic adventure, and it's no surprise the story is so deep when you consider this man is likely behind some of your favorite anime.</p>
<p>From <em>Psycho-Pass</em> to <em>Fate/Zero,</em> his portfolio spans across genres, and <em>Rusty Rabbit </em>definitely isn't the first video game he's worked on. Combined with the talented developers at NITRO PLUS, NetEase, and publisher SoFun, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> is a game that offers a comprehensive package both in story and in gameplay.</p>
<p>To that end, we got a preview of <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> at Summer Game Fest. While viewing a gameplay demo controlled by one of its developers, we also had the chance to talk to Urobuchi-san himself and learn more about the origins of this adventure title.</p>

<h2>It's a Scrapper's Life in <em>Rusty Rabbit</em></h2>
<p>Players take control of the rabbit hero, Stamp. He's a gruff, down-on-his-luck rabbit that scraps for a living in a harsh, post-apocalyptic world. Noticeably, the world -- enveloped by another ice age -- is one without humans as the apex species; after a series of events, the rabbits are now at the top of the food chain.</p>
<p>Though it was a hands-off demo, I was able to ascertain the gameplay loop of <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>. On one hand, you have the surface and town that acts as a hub of sorts, and on the other, Stamp goes underground to scrap junk found in ruins, all the while fighting enemies in his way.</p>

<p>The underground segments intrigued me, as its maps are laid out like a Metroidvania, which means there's going to be some complexity to the level layout. By extension, we can expect to find upgrades for our mech, so eventually you'll unlock things like a grappling hook to accompany starting weapons like a drill and shotgun.</p>
<p>After a brief demonstration of level layouts, we see Stamp take on a boss -- some kind of hellish excavator machine that's out for his blood. After what seemed like a chaotic ordeal, Stamp makes it out safe. If this fight was any indication, we can expect other bosses to operate like they usually do in Metroidvanias, using overwhelming attacks and patterns in an attempt to defeat the player.</p>

<h2>Gen Urobuchi on <em>Rusty Rabbit'</em>s Wacky Lore</h2>
<p>The main focus of my presentation and interview was about the lore, of which there is much to digest. Urobuchi-san is known for writing brutal stories where characters are expendable and no one's life is certain, so <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> is a pleasant departure from such themes.</p>
<p>For example, there's a creation myth in the world of <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>. Urobuchi-san describes it as this "Book of Genesis" for the game's world -- a story surrounding Peter Rabbit and an evil human named McGregor. Peter Rabbit leads his kind to salvation after defeating McGregor, thus leading to a new era for rabbits.</p>

<p>There's more than meets the eye to the world of <em>Rusty Rabbit,</em> and only by playing through will players discover the truth of the world. Of course, there's a story surrounding Stamp and the characters he meets along his way. Stamp has family issues and will have to contend with that as he scraps away in these ruins.</p>
<p>"The main story is actually quite poignant," said Urobuchi-san. "One of the core themes is this idea of what it means to age, and pass on. So, that alone would be really really heavy, and we didn't want the whole game to feel heavy, so we counter-balance that with adorable characters and comic relief."</p>
<p>There's also a great number of other characters showcased during the presentation, many of which are voiced by an all-star cast of Japanese seiyuu. The designs of said characters are colorful and their outfits convey their personalities well, even though we didn't dive into detail on exactly who they were. Promise of factions are sure to liven up the story as players progress.</p>

<h2>How Did <em>Rusty Rabbit </em>Begin?</h2>
<p>In a surprising pivot from lore, I learned more about <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s origins as a game itself. Urobuchi-san is clearly a multi-talented man, as development for <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> began with a prototype he conceived during the COVID-19 pandemic. This all began when I asked a simple question: why rabbits? Urobuchi-san holds up his phone to show me the wallpaper, showing me a rabbit and a steampunk mech.</p>
<p>"I actually enjoy messing around in Unity as a hobby. I found this sculptor's work of art and I saw this and thought 'Wow, I can make a doujin game out of this.'"</p>

<p>It's a wonderful thing when artists inspire artists, and this was the catalyst that went on to become <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>. Urobuchi-san went on to show me a prototype of <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> on Unity. I recognized the familiar, Metroidvania-like level design and of course, the rabbit. He explained the prototype was created via royalty-free assets on Unity.</p>
<p>"Thanks to that," said Urobuchi-san, "I was able to communicate my vision and ideas for a game to NetEase very easily because of how easy it was to assemble a prototype."</p>
<p>Eventually, this project became something more. Urobuchi-san is no stranger to game development (mostly on the narrative side), having written, directed, and supervised quite a few visual novels and video-game adaptations of his work, but <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> is something a bit different from the norm.</p>

<p>"I think discovering Unity and realizing I can actually develop something on my own was a huge leap in that direction," said Urobuchi-san.</p>
<p>Urobuchi-san pitched <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> to NetEase with this prototype, and it led to the project being recreated in Unreal Engine, backed by a full development team.</p>
<p>Everything about <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> is shaping up to be a surprise hit. The passion from Urobuchi-san and the game's developers is evident, and the premise of the lore has me hooked. I'm excited to find out more and find out just how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>

<p data-characters="241" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/after-10-hours-in-the-tiny-glade-demo-im-still-not-bored/"><em>Tiny Glade</em></a> has taken the cozy corner of the internet by storm since the release of its demo on May 30, with players sharing their builds and figuring out all of the tiny details over on Twitter and the game’s official Discord server.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="239" data-injectable="false">Today, though, marks a huge milestone for the two-person development team Pouncelight — <em>Tiny Glade</em> is now on over one million wishlists on Steam, and it comes as no surprise. So <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2198150/view/6209981461627839924?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what’s next</a> for Ana and Tom, the minds behind <em>Tiny Glade</em>?</p> <figure data-current-count="539" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tiny Glade has just passed 1M wishlists 🤯🤯 We always thought it'd be a _very_ niche game. We’re continuously surprised by the love &amp; attention, and we’re overjoyed that Tiny Glade found its audience in so many of you (or, should I say, that you found Tiny Glade!)</p><p>Thank you. <a href="https://t.co/5iFjnXqEPh">pic.twitter.com/5iFjnXqEPh</a></p></div>— Tiny Glade 🏰🌿 DEMO is out on Steam ✨ (@PounceLight) <a href="https://twitter.com/PounceLight/status/1802376539884962019?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Well, not least of all they’re hoping to clean their kitchen, and honestly I know the feeling. However, top priority is a break after the chaos they’ve faced since releasing the <em>Tiny Glade </em>demo. With nearly constant demo patches, they’ve definitely been busy making sure that everything runs smoothly.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-tiny-glade-steam-demo-extended-one-week" data-injectable="false">Tiny Glade Steam demo extended one week</h2> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true">Most importantly, they’ve decided to extend how long the demo will be live, giving players another week to dive in and start building their own tiny worlds. You now have until June 23 to download <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2198150/Tiny_Glade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tiny Glade</em> on Steam</a> and experience the joy that so many already have, and continue to on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="548" data-injectable="true">Sadly, the daily prompts provided by the Nok Nok audio pair Oda and Martin will be coming to an end. These prompts have proved hugely inspirational, allowing players to really test their building skills and come up with some gorgeous tiny builds.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="54" data-current-count="54" data-injectable="false">Over the last week, we’ve had the following prompts:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false"> <li><a href="https://x.com/search?q=%23tinyhouseonahill&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny House on a Hill</a></li> <li><a href="https://x.com/search?q=tinysecretgarden&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Secret Garden</a></li> <li><a href="https://x.com/search?q=tinyneighborhood&amp;src=typeahead_click&amp;f=top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Neighborhood</a></li> <li><a href="https://x.com/search?q=tinywizardtower&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Wizard Tower</a></li> <li><a href="https://x.com/search?q=tinymysteriousruins&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Mysterious Ruins</a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true">The final of these prompts is perhaps the best yet. Players have been tasked with building a <a href="https://x.com/search?q=tinytavern&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Tavern</a>, with Oda and Martin citing the need for somewhere to gather and celebrate all of the excellent demos experienced during Steam Next Fest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false">I first heard about <em>Tiny Glade</em> way back in 2022 and now that I’ve been able to experience the joy of playing it, I’m even more excited for the game to release fully later in 2024. I can’t wait to see how far <em>Tiny Glade</em> will go.</p>

<p data-characters="227" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Team C.U.T.S., a <em>Clock Tower</em> series and related games preservation group, has confirmed that the elusive <em>Clock Tower Commercial Sampler</em> demo will be included in developer WayForward’s upcoming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2794770/Clock_Tower_Rewind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Clock Tower ReWind</em> </a>release. </p> <p data-characters="541" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">The <em>Clock Tower Commercial Sampler</em> demo is one of three for the original <em>Clock Tower</em> that has received little to no coverage online until now. Team C.U.T.S. managed to acquire a copy of the demo when one finally came up for auction again,<strong> paying 92,000 Yen/$584.37</strong>. The team has since taken its time to explore everything in this unique build of <em>Clock Tower</em> for the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/someone-is-auctioning-off-a-nintendo-super-famicom-prototype-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Super Famicom</a>, dissecting exactly what it is. The team has worked with Limited Run Games and WayForward to ensure all <em>Clock Tower</em> fans can enjoy its contents forever.</p>
 <h2 id="h-clock-tower-rewind-will-include-all-three-demo-levels-from-the-commercial-sampler-thanks-to-team-c-u-t-s" data-injectable="false"><em>Clock Tower ReWind</em> will include all three demo levels from the <em>Commercial Sampler,</em> thanks to Team C.U.T.S.</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="The CLOCK TOWER Commercial Sampler" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KEps84To6EI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">Understanding the <em>Clock Tower Commercial Sampler</em> requires some background information. Thankfully, Team C.U.T.S. has published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEps84To6EI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">17-minute video</a> explaining how it acquired the cartridge, the rumors about it before it got a copy, and exactly what’s in the files. </p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">Interestingly, the <em>Clock Tower Commercial Sampler</em> isn’t an early build of the original game; it’s a custom build designed to give fans a taste of what they can experience in the full game. It features three demo levels with randomized elements that help convey the horror the full version can instill in a player. </p> <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true">Team C.U.T.S. dug quite deep and found that this version can access car endings and other main game files. So, despite it being a stripped-down version of the game and having a few variances in background images and music, it’s effectively three vertical slices of the final product. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Surprise!<br>We can now say we're part of an official Clock Tower release!<br>The Clock Tower Commercial Sampler, a three-level demo ver. of the game, will be included as a bonus in Clock Tower: Rewind!<br>Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/WayForward?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WayForward</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/LimitedRunGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LimitedRunGames</a> for letting us be a part of this release! <a href="https://t.co/euq664Yzfb">pic.twitter.com/euq664Yzfb</a></p>— TEAM C.U.T.S. @Anime Expo 2024 (@thefirstfear) <a href="https://twitter.com/thefirstfear/status/1802049907290968214?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true">The really great news from this discovery and subsequent delving through game files from the mid-90s is that all three of these demo levels will be included in <em>Clock Tower ReWind</em>.

 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="false"><em>Clock Tower</em> is widely regarded as one of the progenitors of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/whats-your-go-to-halloween-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horror in video games</a>, and it’s wonderful to see that these files, no matter how similar to the final release they are, have not only been preserved but are being distributed to fans worldwide. It’ll be interesting to see how these demo levels hold up against the originals once you can play them one after the other within the same ecosystem. </p>

<p data-characters="292" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been keeping an eye on<em> Palworld</em> reveals, you’ll undoubtedly have seen some of the new Pals coming our way with the Sakurajima update on June 27. Well now the Paldeck videos, released every weekend over on Twitter and YouTube, are providing deeper glimpses at some of those Pals.</p> <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="192" data-injectable="false">On June 16, in what seems like a wonderful Father’s Day gift to Palworld-playing Dads everywhere, Pocketpair showed off one of the Pals which has become a secure fan favorite — Croajiro.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-meet-the-newest-water-type-pal-in-palworld-croajiro" data-injectable="false">Meet the newest water type Pal in Palworld, Croajiro</h2> <figure data-current-count="492" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Paldeck_SP | No.090 CROAJIRO - Palworld | Gameplay | Pocketpair" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqRH0kDCVI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">In the Paldeck video, the little frog-like creature, obviously a Water type Pal although it’s unknown whether it is a dual-type, can be seen facing off against another new Pal, Chillet Ignis. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-showcases-new-pal-in-latest-paldeck-video-ahead-of-sakurajima-update/">Fire type Chillet Ignis was shown off yesterday, June 15</a>, in the other of this weekend’s Paldeck videos.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">It’s nice to see that we’re finally being given sneak peaks rather than recaps of Pals we’ve already become very accustomed to, as all previous Paldeck videos have been for Pals which we already know and have likely captured.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-croajiro-s-attacks" data-injectable="false">Croajiro’s attacks</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Pocketpair</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true">Among the scenes in Croajiro’s Paldeck video were attacks which are very familiar from other Water type Pals, as well as what we can expect when Croajiro is petted. The best part of the Paldeck happened at the end, though, with Croajiro casually wielding its stick against four Mossanda, killing them effortlessly. I doubt it will be that easy in-game, but it’s a fun image.</p>
 <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false">We were given a sneak peak of the next Paldeck video, too. Next week, on June 24, we’ll find out more about Katress Ignis. Though we already know it’s a Fire type, I’m interested to see what else we may gather from the Paldeck.</p>

<p data-characters="213" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Closing out the Latin American Games Showcase was an impressive new trailer for the gorgeous pixel-art hack-and-slash Mariachi Legends, with a mixture of live-action scenes and high-fidelity side-scrolling action.</p> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">You’d be forgiven for overlooking the Latin American Games Showcase last weekend. Let’s face it, with over a dozen unique showcases over the span of a few days, it is unlikely most audiences will catch them all, particularly when the shows are each focused on a specific niche.</p> <figure data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Mariachi Legends - Official Trailer | Latin American Games Showcase" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCHux28VA3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">But this show in particular was littered with beautiful works and inventive concepts, a description no less fitting of the presentation’s final game, <em>Mariachi Legends</em> from Halberd Studios, which was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mariachi-legends-metroidvania-mexican-trailer-summer-game-fest/">unveiled</a> at last year’s PC Gaming Show.</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">Opening to a hazy sunset, the trailer begins with a live-action sequence introducing the fictional town of Santa Mascota and the lead character, Detective Pablo Cruz, who has been assigned by Lady Death to delve into the Realm of the Dead and collect a mystical amulet that is compromising her rule over the underworld.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true">This is no simple task, as the group of beings known as the Mariachi Legends protect this dominion at all costs. In order to stand a chance against them, Pablo must don the powerful garment, La Sombra, which grants him otherworldly strength and abilities.</p>
 <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">With a transition to gameplay, it makes an immediate impression with its smooth and fluid animations, such as Pablo brandishing his pen and notebook with a flourish when taking investigation notes and trotting around with a swagger that closely resembles <em>Castlevania</em>’s <a href="https://64.media.tumblr.com/762a8ac61e339469f8e9a9cdabf57c25/tumblr_or39wwPi5M1so2951o4_250.gif">Soma Cruz</a>.<br>Although these two protagonists may share a last name and running animation, ironically what they do not have in common is being part of the Metroidvania genre.</p>
 <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">Unlike the studio’s previous work, <em>9 Years of Shadow</em>, which was a full-fledged metroidvania, Mariachi Legends describes itself as a branching beat-em-up platformer, with bounding, swinging, and dashing along platforms to navigate the game’s levels and an emphasis on extravagant combo-centric combat.</p> <figure data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">Pablo dual-wields a set of sabers and a pair of flintlock pistols, firing off point-blank barrages before effortlessly eviscerating his enemies in a spinning cyclone of carnage. He has a variety of special abilities as well, including a noxious face-cracker whip that melts flesh from the bone and morphing into a spectral skull enveloped in a sickly green flame to consume enemies whole.</p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">The end of the trailer blends more live-acton cuts with gameplay, this time to the kitchen to demonstrate the cooking component to the game. Pablo can spice up his special abilities by dishing up recipes he learns along his journey.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="false"><em>Mariachi Legends</em> will be available for Switch and Steam, with a 2024 release window listed on the store page.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/star-wars-fans-are-review-bombing-the-wrong-acolyte/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=star-wars-fans-are-review-bombing-the-wrong-acolyte<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="183" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A little over a week after the release of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-is-reviving-one-of-legends-best-lightsabers/">first two episodes of <em>Star Wars’</em> <em>The Acolyte</em></a>, an attempt at negatively review-bombing the new series on Rotten Tomatoes has begun. </p> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">Seeing anything <em>Star Wars</em>-related requiring more than one second after its release to gather an avalanche of negative reactions nowadays is already pretty surprising, but this story gets even better. It turns out that the review bombing campaign pretty much ignored the actual <em>Star Wars</em> <em>Acolyte</em> TV series, and accidentally ended up hitting other works whose creators were unlucky enough to name after the word “<em>Acolyte</em>“.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">The biggest victim is a 2008 Thriller called <em>Acolytes</em>, which is now sitting at 35% Audience Score after a barrage of negative <em>SW</em>-related ramblings.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="848" data-injectable="true">To be entirely honest, I’m yet to watch <em>Acolytes</em>, the movie, not the similarly-titled <em>SW</em> series, but I’m pretty sure that its only link with <em>Star Wars</em> is Joel Edgerton. I know he plays Owen Lars in one, and a serial killer in the other one — <em>Star Wars Episode III:</em> <em>Revenge Of The Sith,</em> I presume. I’m not sure, though. I have a hard time remembering what happened in the prequels because of all the damage I sustained from watching the prequels. Still, I’m leaving the trailer for <em>Acolytes</em> below to let you decide, anyway.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Official Trailer - ACOLYTES (2008, Joel Edgerton, Jon Hewitt)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViBLacRvmZg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true">And <em>Acolytes</em> wasn’t the only victim, as <em>The Acolyte</em>, a <em>Star Wars</em> fan film also saw a suspicious surge in the 1-star review department that completely destroyed its IMDb rating.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via <a href="https://x.com/Jay12678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Koos on Twitter</a></figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true">This is completely unnecessary because it’s just mean, but also because fan movies don’t fare really well in the ratings department, anyway. I believe that the best thing we can do to help restore the balance is to post the whole <em>The Acolyte</em> fan movie below:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="The Acolyte | Star Wars Fan Film | Red Komodo" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tp6hLP1Ry0U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">Sound off in the comments to let me know if it’s any good!</p> <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="false">You can now watch the first three episodes of <em>The Acolyte</em> — the real one, on <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/en-pt/series/the-acolyte/39RAA0bOYXQ0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney +</a>, and you can watch the unrelated and very hated <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/acolytes/umc.cmc.6v5sa4a6udo5ush5qz5tppbkx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Acolytes on </em>Apple TV</a>, if that’s your thing.</p>

            <link>https://www.destructoid.com/preview-pax-dei-a-grand-experiment/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=preview-pax-dei-a-grand-experiment</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/preview-pax-dei-%E2%80%93-a-grand-experiment.902826/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/preview-pax-dei-a-grand-experiment/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=preview-pax-dei-a-grand-experiment<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="278" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Pax Dei</em> was announced in March 2023 and officially enters early access on Steam on June 18, 2024. Ahead of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/pax-dei-release-date-editions-and-early-access-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Founder’s Packs going live</a> and players flooding the servers, developer Mainframe Industries invited me to take a look at the game and get a sense of its vision. </p> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">Calling <em>Pax Dei</em> an MMO would be underselling it. Once players load into the game, they’re able to choose their server, which is a chunk of the 400 square kilometer space available at launch. Each server or shard is a place where players can work together to build a settlement, but not in the traditional way you might think. </p> <figure data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Mainframe Industries</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-how-pax-dei-is-redefining-the-sandbox-mmo" data-injectable="false">How Pax Dei is redefining the sandbox MMO</h2> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Mainframe Industries CEO Thor Gunnarsson explained how the game works based on its closed alpha tests. In those, content creators were given access and sets of codes to send to their communities. This drew in thousands of players, each forming a community on a server where they set about building a town, village, or city and creating the infrastructure that they needed. </p> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="751" data-injectable="true">For example, an architect was usually appointed to design the buildings. This is a pretty intense job because every single item in the construction menu is modular and can be tweaked to fit your needs. I was shown a guild hall with a goat head looking off into the distance and a colossal castle built into a mountain. A community with a vision can achieve anything in <em>Pax Dei</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">However, to build, you need resources. This isn’t like <em>Minecraft,</em> where you can go into creative mode and grab what you need. Instead, players have to organize themselves into groups. Some will collect wood, others stone, and more still will raid dungeons in the dangerous Wilderness area where they can get gold and other rare materials. </p> <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="792" data-injectable="true">A settlement comes together over time as long as everyone in the community helps out. It reminds me of medieval England, or at least the way it’s often painted in books like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-read-the-kingsbridge-series-in-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pillars of the Earth</a></em>. Everyone has a role in a community because they want to help build something bigger. Peasants work farms and get food, hunters get meat for the tavern and skins for the tanners, miners get the precious building blocks for every home, and so on. </p>
 <p data-characters="566" data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true">While being a wood or stone cutter might not sound like the most enthralling online experience, it’s the fact that you’re helping build something that should get you excited. On day one, you might be the only miner, but three years later, you could have a mining company that coordinates stone for trebuchets for the war effort. You never know where your journey will take you, and you’re always able to swap for something else. I quite fancy being a traveling merchant myself, selling gossip on the side to nobles who have the coin to pay for it. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Mainframe Industries</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-pax-dei-s-grand-experiment" data-injectable="false">Pax Dei’s grand experiment</h2> <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="true">From the start, Gunnarsson calls <em>Pax Dei</em> “a grand experiment,” which sounds like the perfect description. When it’s released in early access, the game won’t be feature-complete because the developer wants to build it with the community that invests in and lives in its world. New features will be added based on a rough roadmap but also the desires of the community and the direction they take the game in. </p>
 <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">If, for example, players delve more into PvP and create an economy from the loot around it, then that system will likely get updated before more building mechanics or PvE quests come to the game. In a way, players are free to choose where they want to push the game most because Mainframe Industries is eagerly watching, wanting to enable more dynamic, community-driven gameplay that can exist without constant supervision. </p>
 <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">As a parent, this reminds me of setting out groups of toys as stations at which your kids can play. Much like <em>Pax Dei</em>‘s players, some kids will sit at a station and play before moving to another one, while others will bring chaos to the system and mix up the toys with a wider game. It’s all playing, fun, and creating an engaging world for those involved, but everyone is free to choose how they want to play with the tools available to them. </p>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">But this world isn’t all peace and prosperity. The Heartlands, areas where players build their settlements, are safe zones without combat. You can spend all your time in these areas if you don’t want to engage in combat, PvE, or PvP and have no interest in dungeons. </p> <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true">Leaving the Heartlands will see you enter the Wilderness, areas where PvP is allowed and there are NPC enemies to engage with. This is how you’ll gather meat from animals and loot from dungeons. In one alpha, players even collectively created a zone in the center of the map that was free-for-all PvP where you could test your builds and see how many players you could kill before dying. </p>
 <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">Keeping all this optional is actually more realistic than you might think. Throughout history, there were, of course, bandits and thugs on the road, but people stuck to their roles for the most part. This even applied to nobles and knights, meaning we’ll likely see in<em> Pax Dei</em> that PvP-focused players emerge to protect communities and do nothing else, offering their services so the rest of the group can go about their business safely. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Pax Dei | Early Access Announcement" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9kbu7qtYR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-the-eve-of-pax-dei" data-injectable="false">The EVE of Pax Dei</h2> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="720" data-injectable="true">If all this sounds a lot like <em>EVE Online</em>, that’s intentional. Gunnarsson and some of the other developers at Mainframe Industries worked on that game for many years and admire the emergent storytelling it plays host to. At one point, it was impossible to talk about games and not mention <em>EVE Online</em>‘s incredible tales of corporate espionage. Mainframe Industries is hoping for something similar for <em>Pax Dei</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true">While corporate takeovers are probably a long way off, <em>Pax Dei</em>‘s world is ripe for creative storytelling that occurs organically. You might venture into a dungeon and encounter a group of raiders from a neighboring settlement that you manage to kill and steal from. The next thing you know, there could be a bounty on your head, or you could equip better and better gear until you effectively own a dungeon, charging a fee for anyone who wants to attempt to loot it. </p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Gunnarsson gave me a great example of how something similar happened in one of the game’s alphas. A glitch gave players the ability to build walls along paths, so naturally, each server set up checkpoints to charge travelers for passing through each section of the map. Gatehouses and entry fees were thought to evolve in the game’s society over time, but this proved that players could and would do anything with the right tools when given half a chance. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Mainframe Industries</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-a-moment-in-time" data-injectable="false">A moment in time</h2> <p data-characters="609" data-current-count="909" data-injectable="true">To conclude my time speaking with Mainframe Industries, I was taken on a walkthrough of a server that had been preserved from its alpha state. The game will eventually feature regular server wipes, but this settlement has been saved for now as an example of the ingenuity shown by players in such a short space of time. A single architect, who happened to also be a professional architect, had designed the settlement and was effectively sucking up all the resources players brought them from around the world to put each structure together in a coherent way that would make for a nice flow through the area. </p>
 <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="397" data-injectable="false">There were furnished houses, a fancy hall, a guild hall, and several smaller structures that might be used for storage or the various industries a settlement needs to thrive. As the sun went down, lights lit up the distance. In <em>Pax Dei</em>, you can see across servers, meaning every light in the distance is a real player’s building plot or structure placed somewhere on the colossal world map. </p> <p data-characters="706" data-current-count="1103" data-injectable="true">Seeing this made me feel so incredibly tiny. Your character can spend hours chopping wood, but it’ll never be enough to create the grand projects seen in similar games like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bellwright-is-a-promising-start-for-a-settlement-builder-in-which-you-enact-a-rebellion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bellwright</a></em> or <em>Valheim</em>. You are insignificant by yourself, but together with others, you form a whole that actually stands a chance of making an impact. You won’t lose your precious city upon death because the overarching goal you share as a small community doesn’t live or die on your shoulders alone. As long as you’re motivated to keep building, others will join you, and you’ll make something admirable, threatening, or awe-inspiring together, depending on how your intentions as a community evolve. </p>
 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">While there are no firm details planned at the time of writing, war is definitely something that’s on Mainframe Industries’ mind. Pax Dei is a game built for petty feuds to transform into continent-spanning conquests. It’s just a matter of time before players get upset enough when someone destroys their settlement. </p>

<p>Shinji Mikami’s Dino Crisis hasn’t been seen since 2003 when the third (and currently final) core game in the series was released. Since then, it has remained one of the most-requested titles when it comes to remakes and remasters. In the Capcom Super Elections survey, fans were asked what series they wanted to see get a sequel, and Dino Crisis landed the winning spot with 80,769 votes.</p>



<p>In second place came Mega Man with 63,395 votes, then Devil May Cry with 60,371 votes.</p>



<p>One question asked users which Capcom games they liked the best, and in second place sat Dino Crisis, coming in closely behind Devil May Cry 5 and just ahead of Resident Evil 4.

<p data-characters="365" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Video game adaptations have a&nbsp;harder&nbsp;job than most TV shows. While they come with an audience built in, game-inspired series have to do more than&nbsp;simply&nbsp;appeal to&nbsp;fans of the original medium. They’ve got to attract longtime fans and lorehounds, all while simultaneously telling a story that can be understood by the uninitiated.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">While the task is difficult, it isn’t impossible. The <em>Fallout</em> TV show has shown itself to be a perfect example in this regard, earning praise from critics, <em>Fallout</em> fans, and general viewers alike. But what is it about the show that accomplishes what so many adaptions can’t? The secret sauce lies within a few of its classic narrative techniques, cleverly working in faithful nods to its source while creating a world for the general audience.</p>
 <p data-characters="112" data-current-count="112" data-injectable="false"><em>Note — major spoilers ahead. Don’t read further unless you’ve finished all of Fallout season one. </em></p> <h2 id="h-fallout-stars-a-fish-out-of-water-protagonist" data-injectable="false"><em>Fallout</em> stars a Fish Out of Water protagonist</h2> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">Lucy is a fantastic character but also an archetype you may have seen before. She is a vault dweller, one who has been lied to her entire life and has never seen the outside world. As such, she’s positive, chipper, and very, incredibly, ridiculously naive. By using a protagonist who lacks real-world knowledge, the writers get to do two things.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="719" data-current-count="1019" data-injectable="true">First, for those who aren’t fans of the IP, this gives viewers a way to learn about the world without&nbsp;it&nbsp;feeling like it coddles or&nbsp;like it’s&nbsp;an info dump.&nbsp;In the first episode, viewers&nbsp;are introduced&nbsp;to the idea of vaults,&nbsp;get to&nbsp;see how they work as a ‘utopian’ society, and witness how naive the character is as the brutality of the outside world comes calling. All of this is done with sick action sequences, entertaining comedy, and interesting visuals that show the ridiculous aesthetic of the vaults. None of this feels belabored or spoon-fed, as the knowledge is doled out as part of a character-driven narrative, giving new viewers a great way to learn without even knowing it.</p>
 <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">For fans of the <em>Fallout</em> games, the fish out of water protagonist provides a much different form of entertainment. <em>Fallout</em> focuses on dark comedy as a core component of its draw, and by giving fans a naive, happy-go-lucky protagonist, there’s some fun to have at Lucy’s expense. By knowing what’s to come, Lucy’s peppy persona is only that much funnier. She’s about to fall victim to the apocalyptic RPG’s hellish wasteland; it’s a joke we’re all in on. </p>
 <h3 id="h-old-information-builds-on-new-lore-in-the-fallout-universe" data-injectable="false">Old information builds on new lore in the Fallout universe</h3> <p data-characters="705" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">When trying to get a new audience into something like <em>Fallout</em>, a ton of work and screen time has to go into introducing new fans to the <em>Fallout</em> universe. We see this in Walter Goggins’ past storyline, dropping viewers into the world of 2077’s United States&nbsp;and introducing them to the retro aesthetics of the period, the political upheaval of the time,&nbsp;and Vault-Tec and its rampant growth. These are the things people need to know to understand <em>Fallout</em>, those things that players experience in the games time and time again. Still, how do you keep this interesting to old fans who have heard and witnessed this basic information a million times&nbsp;over&nbsp;in their playthroughs?</p>
 <p data-characters="625" data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true"><em>Fallout</em> manages this by wrapping&nbsp;deeper&nbsp;lore implications and new characters within this core framework. Every single person who plays the game knows Vault Boy. He’s iconic, the image players see time and time again, from the tutorials to selecting perks to the bobbleheads waiting to be found around the map. Hell, he probably shows up when players close their eyes after gaming for 10 straight hours. The unknown history of the creation and development of Vault Boy gives writers room to play, allowing them to write a storyline that offers a much deeper look at one of the core images associated with the series.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="973" data-current-count="1273" data-injectable="true">The iconic&nbsp;jumpsuit&nbsp;and the creation of the thumbs-up&nbsp;pose are core to fans’ visual memory of the game, and further history only adds interest. And while Walter Goggins’ rise and fall from the position of Vault Boy gives fans enjoyment through new lore, there’s more to it than that. Goggins’ story allows the writers to portray the all-consuming nature of the <em>Fallout</em> companies, willing to throw to the wayside those that no longer serve their purposes, giving players an unexpected tether to the plot. In many ways, Goggins’ Ghoul is probably the character long time players will resonate with most. Having spent over 200 years surviving in the wilderness, about the same amount of time the average <em>Fallout</em> player has spent playing every game in the series, players will feel some kinship to his badassery. By tying him in to both past and future storylines, players can always have a character to sympathize and experience the plot with.</p>
 <h3 id="h-callbacks-vs-revelations" data-injectable="false">Callbacks vs revelations</h3> <p data-characters="554" data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true">One of the more difficult problems to overcome in a series like this is the use of&nbsp;major&nbsp;plot points that are revelations to new&nbsp;viewers&nbsp;but expected outcomes to long-time fans. Players know how the past storyline is going to end. It’s kind of the whole point of <em>Fallout</em>: everything starts with the nuclear fallout. The buildup to Goggins’ realization of the true nature of the vaults,&nbsp;with most of them being experiments imposed on the residents by the CEOs of huge companies, is cool but nothing new to those who have played the games.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="609" data-current-count="909" data-injectable="true">At times like these, writers can appeal to these fans by giving them a good old ego boost. As viewers listen to the company heads describe the horrible experiments they wish to enact on people in each&nbsp;Vault, longtime fans get to feel smart, recognizing the Vaults that the CEOs are talking about. Many of these Vaults even appear in games, mostly in <em>Fallout 3, 4</em>, and <em>76</em>, meaning players will have more than likely blasted their way through them at some point. While new fans are interested in the reveal, longtime fans are rewarded for their IP knowledge and&nbsp;are given&nbsp;validation for knowing their lore.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="false">In the end, everything comes down to double meanings. The writers understand that their time is limited and that you have to be working with both audiences at all times. Luckily, gamers are nothing if not lore junkies, and the writers understood that, leaving enough goodies to keep players happy, even in those moments when outcomes are expected. It’s a difficult game to play, but the writers of <em>Fallout</em> did so with aplomb. Hopefully, we can see other video game adaptations follow in their footsteps.</p>

<p data-characters="476" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Star Wars: Unlimited’s</em> second set, <strong>Shadows of the Galaxy</strong>, takes players to the underbelly of worlds filled with smugglers, bounty hunters, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-acolyte-can-star-wars-fans-expect-any-big-cameos/">those who take matters into their own hands</a>. Shadows of the Galaxy brings many fan-favorite characters into the mix from series such as The Mandalorian, The Bad Batch, and The Book of Boba Fett. Players will be able to start buying and cracking open booster boxes or packs on<strong> July 12, 2024</strong>, when the set is released worldwide.</p> <h2 id="h-the-new-mechanics-of-shadows-of-the-galaxy" data-injectable="false">The new mechanics of Shadows of the Galaxy</h2> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">This set is filled with galactic criminals so it’s only appropriate that new mechanics are introduced to fit the theme. Three new mechanics are being added with Shadows of the Galaxy that will certainly spice up the meta. Units can be <strong>Captured</strong>, guarded, and rescued by other units, <strong>Bounties</strong> can be applied to units and claimed by opponents, and characters can <strong>Smuggle</strong> resources into play. </p> <figure data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Lucasfilm Ltd.</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-bounty" data-injectable="false">Bounty</h3> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">The Bounty mechanic adds various effects to units that trigger whenever the unit is defeated. Bounties can be attached to units via upgrade cards or can be found as an inherent ability with some units. Many bounty hunter characters gain bonuses when attacking units that actively have a bounty, making this a powerful mechanic to play around with.</p> <h3 id="h-capture-guard-rescue" data-injectable="false">Capture/Guard/Rescue</h3> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true">Three mechanics in one, capturing goes hand-in-hand with the new Bounty system in <em>Star Wars: Unlimited</em>. Using certain abilities or action cards, units can be captured and guarded by another unit. When the guard unit is defeated, the captured unit is Rescued or set free. Various actions allow rescuing units without needing to defeat the guard units. </p>
 <h3 id="h-smuggle" data-injectable="false">Smuggle</h3> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">Cards with Smuggle can be used as a resource and then played for their Smuggle cost later on. This allows high-cost cards to be put to use generating resources early on while still being able to be played later in the game once players can afford them. While it’s a simple mechanic on the surface, many synergies and triggers work with Smuggle to make it a competitive theme to build around. </p> <h2 id="h-the-best-cards-of-shadows-of-the-galaxy" data-injectable="false">The best cards of Shadows of the Galaxy</h2> <h3 id="h-10-razor-crest-reliable-gunship" data-injectable="false">10. Razor Crest – Reliable Gunship</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>The new Mandalorian units of Shadows of the Galaxy have many bonuses that activate when attaching upgrades to them. Since the Razor Crest can return discarded upgrades to your hand, it’ll certainly become a staple card in Mandalorian or Upgrade-heavy decks. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-9-wrecker-boom" data-injectable="false">9. Wrecker – BOOM!</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>Overwhelm is a powerful keyword on its own, especially on units with high power such as Wrecker. 5 damage from a low-cost ability is super valuable and can help create board advantage against some of the more bulky units in the game. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-8-unexpected-escape" data-injectable="false">8. Unexpected Escape</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>With the new Capture mechanic, this card will be a necessary inclusion in any deck. Even if it only rescued the captured unit, it would be worth it. However, being able to exhaust the guarding unit adds tremendous value for a 1-cost card. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-7-ruthlessness" data-injectable="false">7. Ruthlessness</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>Base damage is how you win a <em>Star Wars: Unlimited</em> game. Within Spark of the Rebellion, Sabine Wren and decks revolving around base damage have dominated the competitive scene. Ruthlessness will find its home in these top-performing decks and extend its viability into future sets. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-6-maul-shadow-collective-visionary" data-injectable="false">6. Maul – Shadow Collective Visionary</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>Maul is loaded with aggressive and defensive abilities alike. Ambush and Overwhelm with 7 power make him a threat that can close out games on his own. His ability to redirect damage to other friendly Underworld units makes him one of the hardest-to-kill units in the TCG. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-5-crosshair-following-orders" data-injectable="false">5. Crosshair – Following Orders</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>Shadows of the Galaxy brings additional methods of boosting unit power to the game. With three different unit traits, experience counters, upgrades, and his inherent action, Crosshair’s power can easily be increased. His exhaust action can quickly become a unit-deleter, and his 6 HP gives him a fair bit of staying power.</p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-4-choose-sides" data-injectable="false">4. Choose Sides</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>Swapping control of units has the potential to be the most broken ability in any TCG. Besides simply swapping a weak unit for a stronger one, players can trade units with bounties to their opponent so that they can claim the bounties for themselves. This card is one to revisit with every new set release, as the potential is limitless. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-3-ma-klounkee" data-injectable="false">3. Ma Klounkee</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>Bounce effects are one of the strongest mechanics in any TCG. Ma Klounkee not only enables the bouncing of Underworld units but has a built-in burn. For 1-cost, having two effects of any kind is extremely valuable. This card effectively duplicates the effects of Underworld units that have triggers when entering play. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-2-dryden-vos-offering-no-escape" data-injectable="false">2. Dryden Vos – Offering No Escape</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>With 7 HP and the Shielded keyword, Dryden Vos is tough to kill. Although his stats aren’t too impressive for a 7-cost unit, his ability that allows him to take control of a captured card for free can drastically change the board state. Along with other cards with similar effects, such as Choose Sides, stealing your opponent’s cards can become a viable strategy. </p><figure></figure></div> <h3 id="h-1-jango-fett-renowned-bounty-hunter" data-injectable="false">1. Jango Fett – Renowned Bounty Hunter</h3> <div data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"><p>Jango is one of the best units to take advantage of the new Bounty system. Within a deck filled with Bounty upgrades, Jango will have a high uptime for his +3/+0 Overwhelm ability. His card draw effect rounds out his kit and allows him to create both a card and board advantage for players. </p><figure></figure></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/productive-citybuilding-at-the-end-of-the-world/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>You play a “citybuilder” game, the city stays built, no? That’s been the tacit agreement since at least…what, 1989? Fires, meteor strikes, alien spider mechs all notwithstanding, you did the work, and so the work (mostly) stands, for as long as you would like it to at least. That’s remained the case even in our current age of climate anxiety, where “dystopian” has become the citybuilder’s prevailing aesthetic mode. There’s <em>Frostpunk</em>, set in the last surviving city during a new ice age, and <em>Endzone: A World Apart</em>, where electricity was so scarce as to verge on magical, but both nevertheless play out as exercises in accretion. The eponymous <em>Airborne Kingdom</em> decamped the earth’s surface altogether—and yet even it had a floating foundation you could just keep on adding buildings to, in defiance of both Icarian precept and the laws of aerodynamics.&nbsp;</p><p>Only with <em>Against the Storm</em>, which officially released late last year to great acclaim, has one of these games truly invoked the power of an apocalyptic setting to unmake its players’ creations. In doing so, it also activated a latent, dark potential of the citybuilder genre. What, after all, does the destructive cycle of climate change represent, if not more and more opportunities to build back better?</p><p><em>Against the Storm</em> is a <em>roguelike </em>citybuilder, you see. Roguelikes are defined by, if nothing else, their purgatorial gameplay loops, where the player is regularly forced to relinquish much of their gained ground in favor of starting over. In this case, that ground includes everything built on top of it. Think of high tide vis-a-vis sandcastles, and you’ll get the gist. For a citybuilder, this sounds almost definitionally counterproductive, but <em>Against the Storm’s</em> popularity — with<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/4115799931699652974?ref=remapradio.com"><u> 1 million-plus sales on Steam</u></a> and the coveted “Overwhelmingly Positive” aggregate rating — shows that players aren’t troubled much by these losses. After all, a self-sustaining settlement is only a minor goal, here. Indeed, whether the player achieves one or not, <em>Against the Storm</em> invites them to move right on to another level, guiding the eye away from short term stability of the built environment and towards loftier measures of success. You may take this, as I initially did, to mean someday putting a stop to the climate apocalypse. But <em>Against the Storm</em> pitches a different vision for success. “Ask yourself,” it seems to be saying. “How can you make the storms work <em>for you</em>?”</p><p>That's “storms” plural: in <em>Against the Storm</em>, the “Storm” operates on more than one valence. The most obvious one would no doubt be the “Blightstorm,” the cataclysmic affair that arrives every 40 years or so, engulfs the world, and marks the end of the game’s roguelike calendar. When the Blightstorm arrives, your villagers must abandon their outskirt settlements and ride it out in the Smouldering City, a volcano that functions as a keep that’s safe in the storm’s eye. As a “Viceroy,” it’s the player’s job to begin resettling the surrounding wilds anew once the storm passes, searching for ancient seals that will purportedly help put a stop to this cycle of destruction. You have until the next Blightstorm to reach one, after which the process repeats.&nbsp;</p><p>This state of affairs seems, at least initially, to be unreservedly dire.</p><p>The player, though, ends up contending much more directly with smaller, seasonal storm varieties, such as “Drizzle,” “Clearance,” and, well, “Storm,” that rapidly cycle through as they work directly on their settlements. Raincoats are the fashion staple of the humans (along with the humanoid beavers, foxes, lizards and harpies of your villages, who scurry about foraging, mining, crafting, and collecting precipitation to power their “rainpunk” machines. Drizzle is the planting season, and also when upgrades and blueprints for new buildings get doled out. The harvest season, Clearance, is fêted on arrival with gentle musical notes and god rays. During Storm season things get a bit dicier, with heavier downpours and litany of negative effects. Regardless of the season, the rain never stops, nor does the work. In this sense, there is <em>one </em>storm, and though its character is ever shifting, it remains perpetual. The challenge is then about adaptability and perseverance.</p><figure></figure><p>The Storm as the looming void on the horizon, the end of history, and also just an ever-present thing that you have to cope with? That, at least, is certainly evocative of the perpetual dissonance of life with climate change, where we simultaneously get <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/01/22/new-climate-projections-heat-rain-sea-level/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>“more frequent severe rain events,” and also “unknown drought risk</u></a>,” with deadly summers and pleasantly mild winters. It was a broad trend corresponding with rising global averages, until suddenly it was radio and TV hosts asking scientists if a specific storm was due to climate change, to which the scientists started replying: kinda? The idea of eco-anxiety is simultaneously a non-pathological response and also <em>treatable</em>. In modern parlance<em> —</em> the “new normal.”</p><p>Conventional wisdom holds that capital, in prizing steady, reliable growth, must surely detest entropy of this sort. An especially Pollyanna-ish supply-sider might even still try arguing that this is why free market solutions for climate change are on their way…well, any day now. This is where you, the Viceroy in <em>Against the Storm,</em> are situated, sans irony. While your nominal role is putting a stop to the Blightstorm, in practice, it seems to mostly involve trading goods and amassing wealth. Now, in one sense I think, <em>OK fine,</em> <em>fair enough</em>. If a ping pong video game was actually about achieving world peace, I'd probably expect to find out that the global order hinged on my paddle skills all along. Maybe I could suspend my disbelief in the restorative power of trickle-down economics. So I daisy-chain successful settlements together, supply to demand, demand to supply, until I’ve done enough to put an ancient seal within reach, and amassed sufficient goods to appease Neptune, or the ghost of Ronald Reagan, or whoever. (For whatever it's worth, <em>Against the Storm</em> <em>did not</em> appear in Steam's recent "Capitalism and Economy Fest” sale, for which the header art featured flying bills and Scrooge McDuck-level stacks of gold coins).&nbsp;</p><p>But in another sense, how “against” the storm is the Viceroy, really? This is more than a matter of the game’s bumper sticker-ready slogan of a title. (As a New Jerseyan, “Against the Storm'' immediately puts me in mind of “Stronger than the Storm,” the cringey ad campaign the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/feds-investigating-christies-sandy-relief-funds/story?id=21511567&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>Christie administration appropriated $25 million</u></a> in federal Hurricane Sandy relief funding for.) They seem to have a pretty good thing going, since the demands of the storm mean they’re continually being furnished with new workers and claims just waiting to be staked. The stormwater itself is essentially liquid gold (some of it literally golden): with a few simple upgrades and for the small cost of a little ambient toxicity, it can be used to supercharge the output of almost any production line. And the Blightstorm’s cyclical resets ensure that the player, as the Viceroy from without, is always working with a clean canvas, unburdened by most of the fussier responsibilities of urban planning like maintenance, rezoning, or retrofitting. They’re positioned, in fact, like private equity, leveraging their settlements towards future gains and banking dividends in the form of upgrades and decorations for their in-game house — whether or not the roguelike venture succeeds or ends up liquidated.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>One can <em>laissez-faire les bon temps rouler</em> in this fashion for quite a while, it turns out. After a few cycles and with a dozen or so settlements under my belt, I finished my first Bronze Ancient Seal only to find, after Blightstorming the map clean again, another Bronze Ancient Seal floating out in the forest. I completed a “Lead” Seal instead, which yielded: more Bronze and Lead Seals. (As I would eventually learn, at least six other types of seal lurked further out in the wilderness). I decided to stop what I was doing, and dug up a thread on the game’s subreddit asking if there was an ending in the works. In it, one responding user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Against_the_Storm/comments/18rao2z/is_there_an_eventual_ending_in_the_works/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>suggested</u></a>:&nbsp;</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p><em>Aside from the gameplay of the climb, the idea of locking all of the seals was big for me, because if you think about the nature of the cycle, and what it means for that world, it's incredible.</em>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->

<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
</p><p><em>The cycle starts off at 40 years, and it's been like that for centuries. The storm itself lasts for an indeterminate amount of time, but when it's done entire biomes have changed, so you know it ain't a week or two. It drowns the whole world in blight.</em>

</p><p><em>How many kids are born during the storm and don't live to see the end of it? How many elderly go into the storm knowing they'll never see the other side of it?

</p><p><em>But by the end, the cycle is over a century. People have a chance at having real lives. You're not able to save the whole world. The storm still comes. The blight still kills. But you make the whole world a better place, regardless.</em>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
</p><p>It’s a pretty stirring interpretation, but one that <em>Against the Storm</em> doesn’t put any of its own resources towards. The more honest answer, I think, is one the same user later appended, seemingly as an afterthought: “You got a whole as (sic) Prestige climb to finish, and then the Queen's Hand challenge. That's the actual end game. YMMV on how satisfying you consider that ending.”&nbsp;</p><p>So there you go. The challenge adds a run-based mode with perma-death and dash more narrative flavor, but it offers a feather in the cap, not closure. Small wonder then, all told, I started to find that the Blightstorm just wasn’t weighing especially heavy on my conscience. It is, after all, just a brief spiraling effect seen from above, followed swiftly by placidity. Whatever ostensible loss of life has just occurred, according to the game’s lore, it’s more like a toilet flush than an act of God. Hell, you can even trigger it whenever you want with the push of a button if you want to re-roll the overworld map. The storm leaves no visible devastation after it recedes, either. The hexes representing individual forest biomes are not razed, but reshuffled. There would be no sign of a storm having ever visited save the fact that the half-dozen tokens representing your settlements are gone. (As a bit of in-game text describes, they strike camp before the worst sets in.)</p><figure><figcaption><span>Satellite infrared image of Hurricane Sandy. Credit: NOAA</span></figcaption></figure><p>What it does do is provide the citybuilder with a perpetually replenishing supply of empty acreage for development. This brought to mind Naomi Klein’s book <em>The Shock Doctrine</em>, specifically its introductory chapter, which happens to be titled “Blank is Beautiful: Three Decades of Erasing and Remaking the World.” Klein describes a phenomenon whereby disasters (be they natural or manmade) often create fertile ground for cynical profiteering. Agents of free-market capitalism, applying the military principle of “Shock and Awe” to overwhelm and cow their foes with bombastic displays of power, seize upon these crises to sweep in, making audacious land grabs and foisting privatization on the still-reeling victims. Such vultures, Klein writes, “are convinced that only a great rupture — a flood, a war, a terrorist attack — can generate the kind of vast, clean canvases they crave.” (For my money, the Christie administration’s <a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2017/07/christie_pictured_at_island_beach_state_park_durin.html?ref=remapradio.com#incart_2box_nj-homepage-featured"><u>Beachgate</u></a> scandal remains the most ludicrously individualized version of this in microcosm.)&nbsp;</p><p>With each press of the storm button, I thought increasingly about <em>The Shock Doctrine</em>. I began to feel, acutely, like I was tinkering with some mail-order Junior <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Milton Friedman</u></a> starter kit, practicing how to pave paradise and fill it with microbreweries. I was acquiring monopoly money and a taste for the ephemera of late capitalism—an endless array of proximal goals, drip-fed unlockables, and superficial rewards. I thought about the government official Klein quotes who said, in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami, "In a cruel twist of fate, nature has presented Sri Lanka with a unique opportunity, and out of great tragedy will come a world class tourism destination,” presaging the forced relocation of coastal fisherman and the granting of their former land to corporate entities for resort construction. Or Jared Kushner, who, as I was writing this, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/19/jared-kushner-gaza-waterfront-property-israel-negev?ref=remapradio.com"><u>suggesting that Israel forcibly relocate the people of Gaza to the Negev desert</u></a>, noting that “Gaza’s waterfront property could be very valuable.” (Netanyahu’s Likud, for its part, released <a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2024/05/benjamin-netanyahu-unveils-regional-plan-free-trade-zone-rail-service-neom/?ref=remapradio.com#google_vignette"><u>a master plan for “Gaza 2035,</u></a>” a “Gaza-Arish-Sderot Free Trade Zone,” complete with AI art that can only be read as a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-world-if?ref=remapradio.com"><u>The World If</u></a>… meme but for the elimination of Palestinians.)</p><p>This is a pretty malign thing to charge a video game about cartoon lizards and beavers with, even in metaphor, I know. Hardly any entry in the adjacent 4X genre (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) would stand up to even the most half-assed humanitarian audit. But for most of these games, problematic genre conventions are lamentable things to mitigate or filter out through layers of abstraction. The <em>Civilization </em>series eventually, and somewhat ham-handedly, created a “cultural victory” condition to subvert its original focus on conquest. (Granted: one of the ways you could achieve it was by looting other civilizations’ historical artifacts, but there were at least diplomatic repercussions for doing so.) With <em>Civilization 6</em>’s&nbsp; <em>Gathering Storm</em> expansion, it also made natural disasters and rising sea levels the consequences of rampant industrialization, and the board game <em>Settlers of Catan</em> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/22/1245096795/catan-board-game-climate-change-pollution?ref=remapradio.com"><u>looks to emulate that feature</u></a> later this year. Of the citybuilders, <em>Frostpunk</em> made a commendable effort to individualize its citizens and graphically illustrate the sacrifices the player was asking of them. But <em>Against the Storm</em>, as a work of appropriation both figuratively and literally, has no better angels.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Frostpunk's approach to city-building</span></figcaption></figure><p>The game is, in many ways, a doppelganger of <em>Frostpunk</em> (<a href="https://twitter.com/markpopham/status/1186995263807864832?lang=en&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>the Wolf to its Klein, if you will</u></a>), cribbing liberally from the former's mechanics and conventions with little regard for the context they once operated within. <em>Frostpunk’s</em> iced-over settlements radiated out from their central generators, the foci about which all survival efforts hinged. <em>Against the Storm</em> imports these generators (here called Hearths), and deems that several buildings — especially residences&nbsp; — must be built within the orb of their warmth. Does the storm bring cold, too? It’s not entirely clear. Most production buildings aren’t subject to this heating requirement, nor is the settlement oriented around it. In fact, the Viceroy’s mandate is apparently to impose a grid-based system on the lands they claim, because <em>Against the Storm’s</em> settlements are uniformly rectilinear. And in keeping with imperial Roman form, they’re delineated by roads, which can be finished — perplexingly, considering all the rain — with copper (if I were a Viceroy, I would simply not further reduce the pervious surface area). The Fighting Pits in <em>Frostpunk</em> go from a somewhat weighty decision about how much violence you want to introduce to your fragile community to generic “Clan Houses” in <em>Against the Storm</em>, which flatly satisfy the Lizards’ need for brawling.&nbsp;</p><p>Uprooting these concepts from the context of their creation leaves them as empty signifiers, and in an attempt to fill them with meaning once again, <em>Against the Storm</em> turns <em>towards </em>the genre’s inherent colonialism and its ability to project ideology. Ushering it in behind the Blightstorm only compounds its potency—because historically, colonial expansion has always “uncannily syncopated the rhythms of natural disaster,” as historian Mike Davis observed in <em>Late Victorian Holocausts</em>. “If the southern African drought of 1877, for example, was Carnarvon’s opportunity to strike against Zulu independence, then the Ethiopian famine of 1889-91 was Crispi’s mandate to build a new Roman Empire in the Horn of Africa. Likewise Wilhelmine Germany exploited the floods and drought that devasted Shandong in the 1890s to aggressively expand its sphere of influence in North China.” These were the shock doctrine’s early adopters, and they provide the template for much of what the player gets up to in <em>Against the Storm</em>. The result is a work of colonial revanchism, with climate disaster providing the cover to reestablish beachheads for old hierarchies.&nbsp;</p>

  <p id="AulgJT">I finally saw <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24127886/challengers-review-zendaya-luca-guadagnino"><em>Challengers</em></a> this week. It immediately entered my personal echelon of the great modern <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23041486/best-sports-movies-good-watch-netflix-football-basketball-racing-fighting-boxing-mma">sports movies</a> (as well as a gripping, thorny romantic drama). The movie does a terrific job of using the <a href="https://www.mollybrooks.com/gals/comics/060_sports/index.php">existing powerful narrative structures and character archetypes in sports</a> to create a compelling story — the washed-up prospect, the fading star, the phenom who never got her seemingly fated shot at glory. </p>
<p id="lOkL8o">And as is my way, I purchased the relatively new tennis game <em>TopSpin 2K25</em> immediately after, returning to my roots as a (very bad) tennis player in my youth. In a surprising turn of events, the way I played <em>TopSpin </em>right after seeing <em>Challengers</em> sort of felt like writing fanfiction — and I realized that, without recognizing it, I’d been engaging with fanfiction in my own way for years.</p>
<p id="yPxkWG">In the character creator, I decided to make my tennis player one of the three central characters in the movie. Forget the boys — <em>Challengers</em>’<em> </em>most compelling star is Zendaya’s Tashi Duncan, a former teenage phenom whose knee blew up during a college match, ending her promising professional career before it started. But what if I could rewrite that narrative? What if her knee injury wasn’t quite so catastrophic, and she had another chance?</p>

<p id="u3kKi1">In my version of Tashi Duncan’s career, her knee injury still happens, but a full recovery is possible. My save file starts, in my head, at the beginning of that process, as she enters the tour lowly ranked, regaining her confidence and control over her body as I learn how to play this game. I gave her some kinesiology tape on her right knee<strong> </strong>and otherwise tried my best to style Tashi like she appears in the movie (I have limited apparel options this early in my career).</p>

<p id="cr7vAt">I’m in the early days of my career and having a great time. After a disappointing blowout loss in my first match (as Tashi got used to using her knee again and I got used to <em>TopSpin</em>’s controls and play patterns), I bounced back with an upset victory in the first round of my next tournament. Next up: an opportunity for revenge against the player who beat me in that first match.</p>
<p id="nL44Gm">I’ve never considered myself someone into fanfiction — I never begrudged anyone who was, I just never understood the appeal. But it all finally clicked while playing as my Tashi Duncan in <em>TopSpin</em>: Sports video games are often just their own form of fanfiction.</p>
<p id="vCl3aL">Once I came to that realization, my whole history with sports games clicked together. I’ve played so many of them this way. In Football Manager, I always set out with a specific goal, because the game has no natural win condition — maybe it’s to make Norway the premier soccer nation in the world, or to get tiny Boston United promoted to the Premier League. In <em>NCAA Football 14</em>, I created an alternate universe where North Texas was a national powerhouse. In the Out of the Park Baseball and Baseball Mogul franchises, which allow you to start a save file at any point in baseball history, my go-to save files are (1) eliminating baseball’s color barrier from the beginning and playing out careers with Negro League legends like Josh Gibson and Cool Papa Bell and (2) picking up in 1989 with my beloved Dodgers and seeing if I can avoid their awful slump in the ’90s, when I was a kid attending those games.</p>

<p id="r1t7a1">One of NBA 2K’s most exciting new features in the past decade has been the addition of its Eras mode, which allows you to replay the NBA’s most significant historical periods. Want to see what would have happened if Larry Bird and Magic Johnson were teammates, not rivals? You can make that happen. Want to see Michael Jordan play his whole career with the Wizards and not just the bitter end? Go for it!</p>
<p id="waG2fy">Even how I played these games as a kid fits into this new understanding of these games for me. Instead of my approach now, where I try to come up with a unique narrative or storyline to pursue, I would simply create self-inserts of myself in these games. Maybe I’m a star quarterback in Madden, or a 7-foot-tall center in NBA Live, or a baseball player that could actually hit a baseball — you know, fantasies. (Apologies to my former teammates on the Blair Blazers JV baseball team.) I was adding myself to my favorite stories… It just so happens that those stories aren’t purely fiction.</p>
<p id="BYawQ6">In turn, this changes my relationship with real sports — I have extra affinity for athletes who were crucial in my save files, and it’s especially fun to watch the real-life development of young players who I saw grow in the fast-paced world of sports video games, where you can speed into the future.</p>
<p id="UTBTM6">Sports games don’t have the prescribed narratives many other games do. Instead, you create them as you play. Like fanfiction, these games allow you to daydream about how things could be different from real life, or from a fictional story you are drawn to. I can’t actually participate in the professional sports leagues I follow in real life, but at home, I can create and enjoy new narratives adjacent to these worlds, and ones that I am a part of. And I would be lying if I said I haven’t hosted fake press conferences about my team where I am both interviewer and interviewee.</p>
<p id="GDqG5n">Anyways, back to my save file. Will Tashi Duncan (fingers crossed) eventually take home her own career Grand Slam, instead of having to live vicariously through the career of her clearly-no-longer-into-this husband? Can she reclaim her spot on top of the tennis world? I’m going to find out, and I can’t wait. </p>

<p>Since revealing the upcoming Indiana Jones game – ‘Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’, the team at MachineGames has been hard at work on the project, which is shaping up to be a passionate recreation of one of the most legendary film franchises ever made. In a recent article published <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/14/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on the Xbox Wire</a>, the team revealed the depth of research that went into producing an authentic representation of Indy in this highly anticipated game.</p>



<p>Amongst other things, the team at MachineGames got to check out unseen Indiana Jones footage from ‘the Lucasfilm archives’, checking out content that very few people in history have seen.</p>

<h2 id="h-doing-it-right">Doing it Right</h2>



<p>Indiana Jones is one of those franchises that can’t be recreated lightly. To that end, the folks at MachineGames have been poring over as much source material as possible, including having lengthy discussions with the writers responsible for creating the original Indiana Jones movies all those years ago. The squad also got access to exclusive unseen footage that never made it to air:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We managed to get access into some of the Lucasfilm archives as well, which for Indy fans has been an absolute dream come true, to get access to some of these things that perhaps not so many people have seen.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>MachineGames has also made the painstaking effort of recreating Indy’s iconic outfits and has plugged into the soundtrack with Grammy Award-winning artist Gordy Haab, who has collaborated with Lucasfilm Games for years.</p>



<p>Presently, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle doesn’t have a release date, but it’s expected to be released on PC and Xbox Series X|S in 2024.</p>

<p data-characters="284" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Rivers of London</em> series, by Ben Aaronovitch, was one of the first long fiction series I indulged in when I was younger, and it made me feel like magic was as real as physics. If you’re ready to embark on your journey, then you’ll need to know the proper reading order.</p> <h2 id="h-reading-orders-of-rivers-of-london" data-injectable="false">Reading orders of Rivers of London</h2> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/WHibe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The <em>Rivers of London</em> series</a> consists of novels, novellas, a short story collection, and graphic novels. The novels tell the main story, with the novellas providing context and world-building. The graphic novels and short story collections provide extra stories and hijinx into the world.</p> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="701" data-injectable="true">The graphic novels and short story collection don’t really add too much to the main storyline, although they add color and context to the world and its characters, as well as being great reads in their own right. You could always read all of the mainline novels and novellas and then visit the graphic novels after if you wish, to satiate your Rivers of London cravings until more installments are published.</p>
 <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="134" data-injectable="false">Note that the <a href="https://geni.us/WHibe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Rivers of London</em> series</a> is not finished. More of everything is planned, including a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG). </p> <h3 id="h-mainline-rivers-of-london-publication-reading-order" data-injectable="false">Mainline Rivers of London publication reading order</h3> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">Excluding the graphic novels but including the novels, novellas, and short story collection, this reading order goes over the main story of <em>Rivers of London</em>, with the novellas adding context and appropriate world-building. </p> <figure data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image: Destructoid, Ben Aaronovitch</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">As far as the main entries are concerned, the publication is the chronological order of events, aside from certain novellas. This means there are minimal benefits to messing around the with the reading order, and no one has come forward with a unique reading order for us to consider.</p> <p data-characters="135" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">This is the reading order I’m currently following, and is the most straightforward way to take in the wonderfully confusing plot:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="15" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0"><strong>Rivers of London</strong> (called Midnight Riot in the US)</li> <li data-index="1"><strong>Moon over Soho</strong></li> <li data-index="2"><strong>Whispers Underground</strong></li> <li data-index="3"><strong>Broken Homes</strong></li> <li data-index="4"><strong>Foxglove Summer</strong></li> <li data-index="5"><strong>The Hanging Tree</strong></li> <li data-index="6"><strong>The Furthest Station</strong> (novella)</li> <li data-index="7"><strong>Lies Sleeping</strong></li> <li data-index="8"><strong>The October Man </strong>(novella)</li> <li data-index="9"><strong>False Value</strong></li> <li data-index="10"><strong>Tales from the Folly</strong> (short story collection)</li> <li data-index="11"><strong>What Abigail Did That Summer</strong> (novella)</li> <li data-index="12"><strong>Amongst Our Weapons</strong></li> <li data-index="13"><strong>Winter’s Gifts</strong> (novella)</li> <li data-index="14"><strong>The Masquerades of Spring</strong> (coming September 2024)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="263" data-injectable="false">Reading the novellas alongside the novels in publication order is simpler, even if <em>What Abigail Did That Summer</em> is a little out of synchronization. But if you really want to enjoy <em>Rivers of London</em> in timeline order, alongside all the graphic novels, then read on.</p> <figure data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image: Destructoid, Ben Aaronovitch</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-full-rivers-of-london-and-graphic-novels-chronological-order" data-injectable="false">Full Rivers of London and graphic novels chronological order</h3> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">The following reading order is the ultimate reading guide for <em>Rivers of London</em> in timeline order. Reading the story in this way isn’t really recommended, and after I’ll tell you how I’d recommend you enjoy the chronological reading order of <em>Rivers of London</em>.</p> <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true">The short story collection for <em>Rivers of London</em>, <em>Tales from the Folly</em>, is dissected among this list, so its various stories are placed alongside the other titles in chronological order.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="38" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="1520" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0"><strong>Action At A Distance</strong> (graphic novel)</li> <li data-index="1"><strong>Nightingale: London 1966</strong> (Tales from the Folly)</li> <li data-index="2"><strong>Dedicated Follower of Fashion</strong> (Tales from the Folly)</li> <li data-index="3"><strong>Rivers of London</strong> (called Midnight Riot in the US)</li> <li data-index="4"><strong>The Home Crowd Advantage</strong> (Tales from the Folly)</li> <li data-index="5"><strong>Tobias Winter </strong>(Tales from the Folly)</li> <li data-index="6"><strong>Moon over Soho</strong></li> <li data-index="7"><strong>The Domestic </strong>(Tales from the Folly)</li> <li data-index="8"><strong>Whispers Underground</strong></li> <li data-index="9" data-injectable="true"><strong>The Cockpit </strong>(Tales from the Folly)</li>

 <p data-characters="67" data-current-count="67" data-injectable="false">There we have it! All 37 entries into the <a href="https://geni.us/WHibe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Rivers of London series</a>. </p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Although it may make sense to start reading it in chronological order right away, I would hold off doing that immediately. I’d strongly recommend you read <em>Rivers of London</em> first. This will introduce the characters and themes and preserve the mystery and the unknown that really pedals the enjoyment of that entry.</p> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true">After reading <em>Rivers of London</em>, you can then go back and read all the entries in chronological order if that’s how you’ll enjoy the series. You can read as many of the mainline stories until you decide you’re comfortable to start reading all the graphic novels and the short story collection to expand the world even further.</p>
 <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">With this knowledge at hand, I’d suggest you pick an order you’re comfortable with and get reading. Because once you start to get wrapped up in the Rivers of London world, there’ll be no stopping you.</p>
