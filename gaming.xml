		<p>MercurySteam has revealed that the Blades of Fire Epic Games Store exclusivity on PC will expire in May, with the game coming to Steam on May 14th, approximately a year after the game was released for PS5, Xbox Series XS, and PC via Epic Games Store. Alongside the Steam release, Blades of Fire will also get its 2.0 update which will bring a number of additions and improvements to the game. You can grab the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2091020/Blades_of_Fire/">Blades of Fire demo on Steam</a>, with progress carrying over to the full game.</p>

<p>The Blades of Fire 2.0 update will include:</p>
<p><strong>New Contents</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Steam Deck Support.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will also be an Adventurer’s pack included with the Steam version, though owners of Blades of Fire who have the game through Epic Game Store or on console will have to pay for that separately. In our Blades of Fire review, I said, <em>“Blades of Fire is a very good game, blending tough action RPG combat with a fun and unique weapon forging. The story is a little by the numbers and exploration does have a lot of back and forth, but the different regions and enemies look great and the narrative is elevated by Aran and Adso’s relationship.”</em></p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/i-hate-this-place</link>
            <guid>1433422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161927/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>The way I see it, there are three different versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_hate_this_place">I Hate This Place</a>. First, there’s the game as promised <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKD83Z1RbR0">in the trailers</a>: a survival horror with some general emphasis on resource management and gunplay, all elevated with some nice-looking cinematic storytelling.</p>
<p>Sweeping cameras slowly reveal the ominous presence of creepily deformed lab creatures. Moody pans pass over entrail-covered woodlands. And emotive close-ups show dramatic angles of the lead character, Elena, as she searches for her friend, Lou, who went missing in the opening. It’s all very appealing. Throw in a high-end voice-over and some occasional '80s synths, and you’d be forgiven for thinking I Hate This Place was going to knock your <strong>Stranger Things</strong> socks off.</p>
<p>But the truth is the trailers are pretty damningly misleading, and not a second of that narrative flair has made it into the game. Instead, the story is told via some fixed-camera early-'00s-era cutscenes that brought back memories of a simpler time in gaming.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161929/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I say all of this because I Hate This Place comes with a fairly hefty price tag ($29.99 USD / £26.49), and I feel it’s important to give realistic expectations. If you were to compare the game to the trailer, what you’d see is more of an echo, a ghostly shimmer of what was being promised elsewhere.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t make I Hate This Place <em>bad</em>.</p>
<p>As for versions two and three, well, the difference here belongs to that familiar old story – the late-night campfire tales of underpowered hardware struggling to run contemporary, seemingly demanding games. This here is a Switch ‘1’ game – and more often than not, it shows.</p>
<p>In fact, when I looked at some videos for other systems, I realised just <em>how much</em> I Hate This Place was suffering on the Switch. On more powerful hardware, the game looks pretty great. Elena’s torch casts accurate shadows from the legs of giant spiders. The shine of the spectral underworlds you visit to solve the mysterious origin stories of a number of ghosts looks great and suitably otherworldly and strange.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161931/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On Switch, however, I was often distracted by visual ticks during my six-hour playthrough. Elena’s shoes sometimes clipped through textures on the floor. Cutscenes suddenly jumped back to earlier moments in the story – or ended inexplicably short. Often, ghosts disappeared instantly as if someone had forgotten to add an effect.</p>
<p>I could go on complaining, but here’s the twist: despite the lack of finesse, I had a pretty good time. For me, too many of the big releases of the last year have felt as if they were going through the motions – but with I Hate This Place, I at least felt as if developers Rock Square Thunder were reaching for the sky.</p>
<p>The core gameplay — the twin-stick shooting and combat — won me over quickly. Sneaking around, creeping past monsters, and crafting new weapons and bombs to deal with any that got too close was fun. I soon found an enjoyable balance between being cautious and gung-ho. I enjoyed throwing Molotov cocktails at mutated creatures, watching them burn, and then picking them off with a few rounds of my newly crafted rifle.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161926/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether exploring swamps or mines, the challenge felt well judged, and each section lasted just long enough. The story — loosely based on a comic series about a haunted ranch and its surrounding wilderness — does a lot of heavy lifting. It grabbed my attention early on and showed enough creativity to win me over some more.</p>
<p>Less positively, though, in larger areas the performance often fell apart, dropping to a hauntingly low couple of frames per second. Some players will find this unforgivable, but for those like me who spent the best part of the last 10 years playing compromised ports, I coped with these moments well enough. Maybe that’s a testament again to the fun gameplay.</p>
<p>The last misleading element of the trailer concerns the crafting and the building. I’ve read some takes in the last few days that painted these crafting elements as more than they are, because in truth they’re very underdeveloped – seemingly remnants of ideas that had to be canned or simplified for whatever reason. For me, crafting more bullets, upgrading a weapon or two, and keeping bandages stocked was all I ever needed, and as someone not that bothered by exhaustive resource management, I was okay with that.</p>
<figure><a title="I Hate This Place Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161933/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, I can’t give I Hate This Place a higher score than the one below. The technical issues and a lack of finesse haunt almost every nook and cranny of its game world. But I also want to stress again that it’s often very fun, too. It’s not one I’d recommend full price on Switch, but if you can tolerate uneven performance and you enjoy scrappy, experimental survival shooters, there’s something here worth playing.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I Hate This Place is a game that oversells itself in the trailer and undershoots on the Switch, but still manages to be very enjoyable. The performance issues, visual compromises, and pared‑back crafting leave their mark on much of the experience, yet the core loop of sneaking, crafting, and blasting through strange supernatural threats has enough bite to carry it.</p>
<p>When the action flows, it’s easy to see what the developers were aiming for. It just depends on whether you’re willing to look past the rough edges to enjoy what <em>does</em> work.</p></section>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/crisol-theater-idols-review-steam-horror-shooter-spanish-2000667876</link>
            <guid>1433419</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Crisol: Theater of Idols</span></i><span>‘ richly illustrated world</span> <span>is deeply familiar to me. Maybe there’s a certain segment of players who’ll play it and note the same parallels I couldn’t help but draw. Though it bears a lot in common with a number of legendary games, like </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i><span>, this survival-horror title, which takes just as many cues from Spanish culture and folklore as it does from those legendary games, feels most in conversation with something entirely different: it reminds me a lot of the telenovelas I grew up watching on Univision.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Latine households have a few common staples. Adobo seasoning in our pantries. Daily variants of </span><i><span>arroz con habichuelas</span></i><span> with your protein of choice. A Bible of some sort, a crucifix, or related Christian imagery on the walls. Maybe a sticker that reads, “</span><i><span>Dios es amor.”</span></i><span> And, of course, a constant rotation of </span><i><span>novellas </span></i><span>in the evenings.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Novellas </span></i><span>are the height of drama and camp. There is a twist around every corner, and you’ll never miss it because these cheaply produced series will reuse the same loud sound effect to denote every dramatic development in the story. Think the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc7Cin_87H4"><span>Vine “boom,”</span></a><span> but every 15 minutes (charitably). Like any good soap opera, they’re often packed with too many characters to count, let alone recall at the drop of a hat. Depending on the genre–</span><i><span>novellas</span></i><span> can follow teenagers who </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVagT0B3cos&amp;list=RDvVagT0B3cos&amp;start_radio=1"><span>break into songs</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZc97aIDTUE&amp;list=PLlpTGFsKPu1k2_4mKo6Ou9iP9H6eNjRL-"><span>drug lords rising through the ranks</span></a><span>, and everything in between–these characters are usually tried-and-true archetypes, like the stumbling nerd or the doggedly loyal cadet/soldier/cop. And if there’s one thing these </span><i><span>novella </span></i><span>actors are gonna do, it’s ham things up.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>These programs, which have often enraptured the elders of my life, promised big performances, and it seemed like every other show my mother watched during these primetime slots featured booming voices, grand gestures, and </span><a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/news/a31651/10-best-novelas-of-all-time/"><span>more lies and betrayals</span></a><span> than one should be able to feasibly fit into a half-hour block. These shows and performances often oscillated between scintillating and corny, never anywhere in between.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I need you all to understand this, because I couldn’t shake the feeling while playing </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>that I was caught in a fever dream of a </span><i><span>novella</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>is a halfway decent survival horror title with some great creature design, but what it really is underneath all that is a good ol’ Spanish soap. One with plenty of dramatic twists, a few too many characters, and some of the most hammed-up performances a game has ever shipped with. I love its deeply Spanish, deeply flawed heart.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>, from the Madrid-based developer Vermila Studio,</span> <span>is a tragedy told in a handful of chapters. Each of them takes Gabriel, the game’s zealous protagonist and aforementioned loyal soldier archetype, to a corner of Tormentosa, an island and colony caught in a torrential downpour. It is also caught in a religious civil war by the time that Gabriel washes up on its shores. It’s a conflict that calls for Gabriel to battle the forces of the sea god with weapons blessed (maybe even cursed, actually) by the sun god and which use his own blood as ammunition.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000667878" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667878"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667878">Vermila Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I enjoyed this aspect of </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>, though I wouldn’t call it my favorite part of the equation. I dig the metaphor, which calls into question the sacrifices that organized religion typically demands, especially of its most ardent followers. How much is Gabriel willing to bleed to see his god back in power? What actions is he willing to take, regardless of his own moral standing, to see his will done? These are questions that are blunted by the kind of game </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>is–you can’t opt out of combat here–and the answer to both proves to be: </span><i><span>a lot</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Each of Gabriel’s weapons is, both literally and metaphorically, blood-starved, and he is plenty happy to give them everything for his cause. It is always just a smidge spine-chilling to hear or see the spikes that pierce Gabriel and drain him, as well as literally just see his blood in the cartridge of his weaponry. His opponents are similarly visually arresting. Wooden statues derived from Catholic imagery (the religion is never name-dropped but sure is heavily alluded to) lumber through the streets waiting to be carefully dismembered by precise shots of your pistol or rifle, but I could often fall back on a shotgun to blast these things to splinters and assure they’d stay down. Eventually, these enemies grow to encompass other bits of religious imagery and architecture as you encounter towering golems lined with stone faces and monstrosities born from stained glass.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Regrettably, though, </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s combat is just fine. Shots land with a satisfying heft and it’s awesome to occasionally take out a leg or a knife-wielding arm and buy yourself a few seconds to consider your next move. Beyond this, though, enemies require very little thought, especially after you’ve netted a few upgrades, and the overwhelming amount of healing afforded to you on a normal playthrough chafes against and neuters the sacrificial effect of the central blood mechanic. I quickly became numb to the notion of refilling my weapons and depleting my HP because I was either flush with syringes, or knew that the game was hiding some form of healing right around the corner.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Here, the game dovetails back into the campy territory of those previously mentioned </span><i><span>novellas. </span></i><span>Remember that Vine boom I referenced earlier, and the repeated deployment of a dramatic audio cue? </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>has its own “haunting” series of sounds it will frequently play, only these sounds are triggered by the act of draining dead carcasses, often of animals, for blood/ammo. Tormentosa’s streets are littered with the cadavers of chickens that can be drained of their blood…only </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>takes this opportunity to then play a hilariously faint cuckoo, which happens </span><i><span>every time </span></i><span>you drain the blood from the poor birds. A dead pig will squeal. A horse-like beast might bray. Though I can’t speak to the intention, it definitely comes across as a comic beat rather than a dramatic one.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>occasionally blurs this line between corny melodrama and unintentional comedy to mixed results. While Gabriel is straight-laced and bottoned-up, he eventually gains an ally, called Mediodia, who provides exposition and comic relief in equal measure. The performance here (especially in the native Castellano Spanish, which </span><i><span>should </span></i><span>be the default voice track of the game) and her back-and-forth with Gabriel makes her come across as a goblin-like, torturous little sister. It’s disarming hearing them banter moments after a new development in the story or tense encounter against </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s enemies, but such is the dramatic range of a typical </span><i><span>novella </span></i><span>chapter, which might follow up a subplot about infidelity or grief with a recurring sight gag or a detour into a humorous B-plotline. It is about as novel as it is jarring.</span></p> <p><span>Consider, then, how it comes across when these moments of camp and levity, intended or not, smash up against </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s main plotline, in which one religious sect has violently persecuted another and you are attempting to overthrow a god with a blood-tinged armory, all the while unraveling the conflict that has plagued Tormentosa, recounted through flashbacks–which play out as vignettes with faceless, sanguine red silhouettes– illustrating the island’s violent and dramatic implosion.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000667877" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667877"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667877">Vermila Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Lest you think I find all of its </span><i><span>novella </span></i><span>qualities grating or otherwise dubious, I do think that </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s penchant for drama brings out the best in its performers. It is rare to hear an entire cast of Spanish speakers in a game where that audio track is not just a haphazardly produced dub. Here are performances built upon the strength of our language, given by actors with the ability to properly enrich the words on the page with texture and specificity. It is even more thrilling to have them unreservedly go for it. The voice actress for Dolores, a particularly menacing foe who stalks Gabriel throughout the game, is a standout “big” performance, but many others fare pretty well here too, including the protagonist’s VA. Arroyo, one of the game’s more obvious baddies, and even the sun god have incredible presences, even if they are heard more than they are seen.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Not every performance is as stunning though, and quite a number of them get lost in the shuffle. </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s acts are dense with their own ensembles, and characters within them are usually working against one another. In the seemingly unending deluge of conflicts on Tormentosa, some more complex than others, it can be a little harder than usual to nail down motivations and characters worth rooting for, or even simply tracking throughout the narrative. I typically felt adrift in </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s smaller stories, only to be reeled back in when the narrative shined a light on one of its grander performers and more dramatic material.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In a word, </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>is uneven, and that’s the most </span><i><span>novella</span></i><span>-ass thing about it. See, the thing about </span><i><span>novellas </span></i><span>is that though they attempt it all–comedy, melodrama, camp, action, steamy romance, and thrills of all sorts–they also kind of fizzle out by their end. The balancing act is tough to maintain so consistently. </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s ambitions seem to lie all over the place, but despite that, it still brings out top-notch performances. I was hooked on its drama plenty enough to blast through Tormentosa’s clubs, caverns, and cathedrals. And it is a competent enough survival-horror title to thrill and occasionally provide a good scare along the way, even if it feels at times like its action and horror is pulling its punches. But for all its missteps, I couldn’t help but love </span><i><span>Crisol</span></i><span>‘s authentically Spanish heart, and I can’t help but desire more of it. From </span><i><span>Crisol </span></i><span>and from games at large.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Lego's new Pokémon sets are right around the corner, launching on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, A.K.A. Pokémon Day.</p>
<p>If you're a little unsure as to whether these sets are right for you, Lego reviewer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoCatarino">Tiago Catarino</a> has recently got his hands on every available product, including Eevee, Pikachu, and Charizard/Venusaur/Blastoise.</p>
<p>If that's not enough, we also get a good look at the pre-order bonus Kanto Badge set, and the Lego Insiders Mini Pokémon Center set. There are other videos available online for each individual set, but this is one gives us a glimpse at all of them in one go – nice.</p>
<p>It's a pretty decent showcase of the new sets, overall. For example, we're pretty confident that the <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Fpikachu-and-poke-ball-72152&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">PIkachu</a> set (£179.99 / $199.99) just isn't for us – it just looks a bit weird, don't you think? <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Fvenusaur-charizard-and-blastoise-72153&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">The Starter Evolutions</a> looks pretty incredible, but you'd expect that for the ludicrous price of £579.99 / $649.99, right?</p>
<p><a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Feevee-72151&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Eevee</a> looks okay though, and at £54.99 / $59.99, it's definitely on the more affordable end of the scale. Though to be honest, referring to any Lego set as "affordable" is probably a bit of a stretch these days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can also pre-order the new <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Focarina-of-time-the-final-battle-77093&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Ocarina of Time - The Final Battle</a> set right now for £99.99. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/video-get-a-closer-look-at-legos-new-zelda-ocarina-of-time-set-in-this-first-review">Tiago Catarino also got his hands on this set recently</a>, and we have to admit, it looks pretty sweet.</p>

			<p>While <strong>CAPCOM's</strong> <strong>RE Engine</strong> gathered a controversial reputation in the past few years due to the spotty performance of <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a></em> and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/"><strong>Dragon's Dogma 2</strong></a></em>, the game engine fares significantly better in more linear games. Among the games that does not suffer from any major performance issues caused by the engine itself is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/"><strong><em>Resident Evil 4</em> remake</strong></a>, but a <strong>recent update</strong> to the PC version has essentially put the game in a <strong>worse condition than it was at launch</strong>.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Updating years old software with new DRM is stupid,"</em> noted <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Digital Foundry’s</strong> Alex Battaglia. The tech expert's analysis confirms that on a Ryzen 5 3600/RTX 4070 Super build, the introduction of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Enigma Protector DRM</strong> has gutted <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CPU game throughput by 40%</strong>. While the gap shrinks to 20% in the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Village</em> fight due to the AI powering the enemies, which introduces a different bottleneck, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">impact remains constant</strong> in other scenarios.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>This isn't an isolated incident for the Japanese publisher. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">C</strong>APCOM has recently made similar moves with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Revelations</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil 5</em>, sparking a wave of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">anti-consumer backlash</strong> across the community. As YouTube user @chemeergency put it: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Retroactively implementing new DRM over old DRM is insanely anticonsumer."</em> And it's not doing the publisher any favors, either, as some may be more inclined to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">go with the pirated version</strong> for better performance.</p>



<p>With <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a></em> on the horizon, some may wonder if the latest entry will be similarly impacted. However, the game is <strong>confirmed to use Denuvo on PC</strong>, complete with the standard five-activation limit. While <strong>Denuvo</strong> has its own issues, its <strong>impact on performance is lighter</strong> than <em>Enigma Protector</em>. Hopefully, <strong>CAPCOM</strong> will realize that protecting three-year-old games at the cost of the player experience is a losing battle by the time the <strong>ninth entry</strong> in the series requires a DRM update.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/reanimal-review/</link>
            <guid>1433380</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Let’s address the elephant in the room first: Tarsier Studios created two exceptional <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> games, but not the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/08/little-nightmares-3-review/">third instalment</a> in the series, which was handed to Supermassive Games. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/reanimal">Reanimal</a> is, quite clearly, Tarsier’s vision for Little Nightmares 3 and a darker breed of horror.</p>
<p><iframe title="REANIMAL | Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bpi4lx9Lsl4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Little Nightmares games were, true to their name, little nightmares — unsettling, occasionally grotesque, yet reminiscent of Brothers Grimm fairy tales, where children are shoved into ovens. Reanimal, despite its visual similarities, is a different beast entirely. Its atmosphere is far more oppressive, leaning heavily into visceral body horror. Deformed giants convulse and contort into scuttling crab-like creatures that snap the necks of the protagonists. Boneless corpses hang from trees, slithering down trunks and pursuing you like filthy, limp serpents.&nbsp; It is unrelentingly unsettling.</p>


<p>The game follows a brother and sister navigating a nightmarish island they once called home, attempting to rescue their friends from the twisted horrors stalking the shadows. The tone is established immediately: the brother steers a rickety boat through thick fog in search of his sister. Her lifeless body is discovered floating in the sea as distant bells toll ominously. It takes agonising moments to revive her; she splutters seawater and whispers faintly as consciousness slowly returns. It is a bleak and unforgettable opening.</p>


<p>The boat itself becomes integral to the experience, as Reanimal presents a much broader world with light open-world elements. Subtle visual and audio cues gently propel you towards the next objective, yet there are ample opportunities to wander off in search of collectables — though you are arguably more likely to stumble upon something horrific that will end your journey abruptly. This expanded scale allows Tarsier to fully embrace a more cinematic presentation. The camera pans and swoops dynamically as you traverse the island, zooming out to emphasise scale and zooming in for intimate moments. It is, paradoxically, quite beautiful for a game so saturated with decay and death.</p>
<p>Exploration is central to progression. Locked doors require keys and grotesque whale-serpents demand eyeballs, the usual necessities in such a world. Stealth and chase sequences will feel familiar to Little Nightmares veterans, and the puzzles are generally logical, with one notable exception that left me utterly flummoxed. I ultimately brute-forced my way through by attempting nearly all sixty-four possible switch combinations.</p>

<p>Comparisons with Little Nightmares are clearly inevitable, but two other titles came to mind as I wandered through this macabre landscape. Early in the game, you arrive at an abandoned town whose visual storytelling and sound design evoke the oppressive atmosphere of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill">Silent Hill</a>. There is a constant sense that something lurks just beyond sight. It is not traditional fear that defines these moments, but suffocating dread — the lingering weight of catastrophe embedded in every building, open book, and broken shopfront.</p>
<p>The second game it brought to mind was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, and not merely because of a shoreline strewn with whale carcasses. Reanimal ventures into deeply unexpected territory, both physically and psychologically. It is the first game since Kojima’s masterpiece that compelled me to set down the controller and step away, needing a moment to process what I had just experienced. Let me be absolutely clear: Reanimal is absolutely not for children, some scenes are truly disturbing.</p>
<p>Tarsier also deserves praise for crafting a horror experience that largely sidesteps genre clichés. There are no possessed dolls, no crackling televisions broadcasting cryptic images, and almost no jump scares. Instead, the game offers Lynchian body horror infused with British folk sensibilities and fragments of childhood anxieties. As kids, many of us were warned about strange men offering sweets from a van, and that horrific scenario is played out in Reanimal.</p>

<p>At roughly eight hours in length, the game feels perfectly paced — long enough to tell its story without overstaying its welcome. New gameplay elements, including light combat, are introduced gradually. The game can be played solo with an AI companion, in local co-op, or online. Having experienced both solo and local co-op modes, I can confirm that the AI partner performs admirably, illuminating dark paths when needed and responding reliably to player commands.</p>
<p data-start="4587" data-end="5046">My only minor criticism is structural familiarity. Much like Little Nightmares I and II, the game follows a largely episodic format. Each area introduces a looming antagonist glimpsed fleetingly in the background, followed by escalating encounters and chase sequences before their eventual defeat. While Reanimal introduces new mechanics like driving and scuba diving, the overarching rhythm may feel somewhat predictable to returning players.</p>

		<p>Just a fortnight after the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/highguard">Highguard</a>, developer Wildlight has laid off the majority of the studio’s employees.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to press, Wildlight confirmed the layoffs:</p>


<p><em>Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game.</em></p>
<p><em>We’re proud of the team, talent, and the product we’ve created together. We’re also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community.</em></p>
<p>Prior to this, Level Designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-graner-a37262114_alex-graners-resume-activity-7427480816940892161-hmDh">Alex Graner</a> took to LinkedIn to start their search for new employment, saying, “Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today.” However, it sounds like there is still content that can still be released through the coming weeks and months. Graner continued, “This one really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for Highguard.”</p>

<p>Tech Artist <a href="https://xcancel.com/Joshiepoo25/status/2021732021127852097">Josh Sobel</a> was also affected, taking to social media to say, “It was the best team I’ve ever worked with, and I’ve never put so much of myself into a project before.” They added, “I don’t think gamers really understand just how special this group of talented devs was. There were stumbles, as any new team would face, but our ability to execute on goals and pivot at a moment’s notice was unmatched. I am devastated that this team as a complete unit can no longer be.”</p>
<p>Highguard seemingly always had a major uphill battle to survive in a brutal gaming environment. Any kind of PvP live service shooter has to compete with the likes of Fortnite, Call of Duty, Apex Legends and beyond, and while something like Arc Raiders has shown that you can still muscle your way into finding an audience, this feels like the exception to the rule at the moment. Riot Games just launched fighting game 2XKO in January and has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/10/2xko-development-team-reduced-a-few-weeks-after-its-full-launch/">also almost immediately pared back the team and made layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>While Wildlight had the huge opportunity of revealing the game at The Game Awards, this massively backfired for the studio. The game was featured as the final announcement of the show, reportedly as a favour from Geoff Keighley who simply liked the game and the studio (which was founded by former Respawn developers). The game was quickly branded as being a “Concord 2” and clearly had convincing to do, but then pretty much every online game gets that label a moment. Unfortunately, the gameplay reveal trailer and deep dive didn’t really manage to turn perceptions around.</p>
<p>Launching on 26th January, Highguard saw 97,000 players try the game out on Steam, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/">SteamDB</a>, but within days that had dropped to around 10,000 and has now had daily peaks closer to 4,000. Obviously this is just a snapshot of the PC audience and it could be larger on console, but it’s indicative of the game’s slide. Within that time, the studio had tried to quickly react to add things like 5v5 play alongside the 3v3 from launch, and shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highguard-just-launched-but-it-already-has-a-2026-roadmap/1100-6537653/">a 2026 roadmap</a>, but it hasn’t been enough.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, we enjoyed our first look at Highguard. Dom said, “Highguard’s first steps into the PvP arena are confident and unashamed, despite what the angry voices on the internet might tell you. The slightly odd mix of Apex Legends, Rainbow Six and He-Man actually makes for a good time, and there’s so much room for more to happen here. That will take time, and I hope that it finds the audience it needs to thrive.”</p>

<p>Announce the game, already!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7d3a145cddbe0"><a title="Black Flag" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d3a145cddbe0/black-flag.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>A curious new listing for an <strong>Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remaster art book</strong> has appeared on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1835417701?tag=nlife-21&amp;ascsubtag=nlife-21" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon UK</a> in what may be the clearest indication yet that Ubisoft is gearing up to release an updated version of its swashbuckling classic.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-appears-at-amazon-now-up-for-preorder">IGN</a>, the listing states that the book is scheduled for launch on <strong>24th March 2026</strong> and is being published by Titan. Its price is currently £29.95, a 25% reduction on its £39.99 RRP. There are few additional details at this stage, and even the use of the word 'Remaster' is seemingly at odds with the '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced">Resynced</a>' moniker we've been hearing for a while now.</p>
<p>Still, this definitely seems to be a thing, and is yet another indication that a reveal may be imminent... sort of. A lot of things are up in the air at the moment since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">Ubisoft announced major restructuring</a> at the company. Seven games currently in development have been delayed, so it's unclear if Resynced is included in the lineup.</p>
<p>We should hear more from Ubisoft later today regarding its plans when it releases its Q3 financial report, so we'll be sure to update you on that as soon as we can.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Black Flag Resynced has already been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-has-been-rated-by-pegi">rated by PEGI</a>, while its main star, actor Matt Ryan, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-actor-drops-the-biggest-remake-hint-yet">dropped a major hint</a> while speaking with a fan, stating "you may have to beat it again".</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Crimson Desert Overview Video Focuses on the Game’s Non-Combat Activities]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-crimson-desert-overview-focuses-non-combat-activities/</link>
            <guid>1433371</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, South Korean developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> has released the third and final <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> overview video. While the previous overviews were focused on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-medieval-combat-to-combat-mechs-new-crimson-desert-gameplay-overview-highlights-the-story-pywel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-second-features-overview-combat-depth-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">combat</a>, this time the footage puts the spotlight on the game's non-combat activities.</p>



<p>The heart of the player's journey in Crimson Desert will be <strong>in the Greymane Camp</strong>. After losing their homeland, Paelun, to the Black Bears, the faction established this stretch of land in Hernand as their new base of operations.</p>



<p>Although the camp has humble beginnings, owing to the ragged state of the Greymane band at the beginning of the game, it is designed to evolve. <strong>Players can invest the funds and resources they gather on their travels to upgrade the camp's facilities over time</strong>. It is not just a resting point, either, but also a survival hub. Players can cook meals to maintain health, purchase provisions, and engage in farming and ranching to produce essential resources when the wilds of Pywel are unable to provide them. Cooking was also presented in the video as an essential activity rather than a sideline: <strong>hearty meals cooked at the bonfire provide crucial health, spirit, and stamina buffs</strong>.</p>



<p>Perhaps most intriguing of all is the Companion System. As the camp grows, scattered Greymanes (some actively recruited by the players, others arriving on their own) will join to regroup. <strong>These are not static NPCs, according to the developers; they can be assigned roles or deployed on missions across the continent</strong>. Whether gathering wood and ore or thinning enemy ranks in distant, blockaded regions, <strong>these companions actively contribute to the war effort</strong>, even when the player character is miles away.</p>



<p>The villages and cities of Pywel teem with activity. As well as the usual blacksmiths forging weapons and tailors outfitting players for their travels, these hubs offer a glimpse into the region's daily life. <strong>Residents will offer commissions ranging from delivering goods and tracking missing persons to providing protection against bandits</strong>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Crimson Desert Features Overview #3: Life in Pywel" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ATPfgrNZos?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>We also learn from the overview video that <strong>Crimson Desert features a robust crime system</strong>. Harmful actions against innocents can turn both residents and guards hostile, so layers who choose the life of an outlaw may find themselves forced to fight their way out of towns, pay hefty fines, or even serve time in jail.</p>



<p>We're now exactly one month and one week away from the <strong>March 19</strong> release date.

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>

<p>An emu is a large, flightless bird that’s endemic to Australia. They have long necks and legs and closely resemble an ostrich.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-contexto-game-after-1243">When Is The Next Contexto Game After #1243?</h2>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is a tough proposition, no matter how experienced you are. The February 12, 2026, Quordle has four new words for you to find, and this guide has hints and a helping hand to have you be four for four.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="block-44882c9d-d6a6-4e4f-9b1a-8312ae0b3036">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone and region, meaning the next game will start on February 13.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kojima and Zampella Almost Created a First-Person Metal Gear Solid Game]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-person-metal-gear-solid-game-kojima-zampella/</link>
            <guid>1433359</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima recently took to the stage at DICE in Las Vegas to reveal something long-forgotten. Shortly after the release of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots in 2008, he ‘had many discussions’ with the late Vince Zampella about creating a first-person MGS game.</p>



<p>The title, which has understandably never seen the light of day, would have represented a major pivot for the Metal Gear franchise. While it has featured snippets of a first-person perspective in some sequences, we’ve never had a <strong>dedicated </strong>first-person title in the series.</p>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/metal-gear-solid/" id="162">Metal Gear Solid</a> 4: Guns of the Patriots launched to a positive reception way back in 2008, emerging as a core PlayStation 3 title with immense cinematic potential. It represented a penultimate point for Kojima, as the next title, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, would be his final major release in the series before leaving Konami.</p>



<p>In 2008, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/vince-zampella/" id="3380">Vince Zampella</a> was busying himself with the development of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, the sequel to 2007’s Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. This would have been when he was the CEO at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/infinity-ward/" id="1999">Infinity Ward</a>, and up to a year and a half before he was unexpectedly let go from the company.</p>



<p>In April 2010, Zampella founded <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/respawn-entertainment/" id="2483">Respawn Entertainment</a> and went to work developing Titanfall.</p>



<p>But in a new segment at DICE, Hideo Kojima spoke fondly of the late Zampella, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-head-vince-zampella-killed-in-crash/" id="167252">who died just before Christmas</a> in a car wreck in California. In a post on social media from Geoff Keighley, it was confirmed that Kojima and Zampella had ‘many discussions’ about creating a first-person Metal Gear Solid game, building on the success of MGS4.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At DICE, Hideo Kojima revealed that he had many discussions with Vince Zampella about creating a first person Metal Gear Solid game together after the release of Metal Gear Solid 4. <a href="https://t.co/hhjbCqG7T2">pic.twitter.com/hhjbCqG7T2</a></p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/2021671381382181056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Nothing more was said on the matter, but it’s safe to assume that a first-person Metal Gear Solid game would have drastically shifted the game’s perspective in more ways than one. In the comments under Keighley’s post, die-hard MGS fans stressed that the franchise ‘only works’ as a third-person shooter.</p>



<p>Kojima also confirmed that Zampella helped him to establish Kojima Productions after parting ways with Konami around 2015.</p>

            <p>Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel's cat breeding roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a> came out earlier this week to an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mewgenics-review-a-roguelite-where-sacrificial-arse-maggots-and-frightful-defecation-are-the-keys-to-success">overwhelmingly positive reception</a> and plenty of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-sells-over-150k-copies-in-first-6-hours-this-is-beating-expectations-by-quite-a-lot">early success</a>. However, one aspect of the game has left folks on the fence - this <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/252481/mewgenics/credits/windows/?autoplatform=true">list of pretty... complicated internet personalities</a> who've voiced the copious amounts of meows emitted by in-game cats. So, to get a better picture of how those cameos came to be, I reached out to developer McMillen.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the people included that some potential Mewgenics players on social media - principally in <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mewgenics-has-some-problematic-meows-ethan-klein-hila-klein.1431916/">this thread</a> that's been hanging out near the top of ResetEra, the past couple of days - have voiced unhappiness over.</p>
<p>The presence of YouTubers Ethan and Hila Klein of h3h3Productions has drawn criticism from those who don't agree with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFznOHunD_c">their</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytOl5hbTrCY">views</a> on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Mewgenics also features a voice performance from Matan Even - that's the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23502321/game-awards-bill-clinton-rabbi-kid-matan-even-hong-kong/">15-year-old stage invader from 2022's Game Awards</a>, who <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-kid-who-crashed-the-game-awards-was-on-inforwars-when-he-was-12/">appeared on far right conspiracy podcast InfoWars</a> when he was 12. There's also Christine Chandler - an autistic trans Youtuber who has been the subject of considerable online bullying. She was arrested on a charge of incest in 2021 that was dismissed in 2023.</p>
<p>According to McMillen, the list of cameos is a kind of cross-section of internet culture during the game's development, with an emphasis on featuring people from across the ideological spectrum. "When we added most of the people on the list it was ages ago, like Ethan was included a good four years back," he told me over email.</p><p>"I wanted the game to feature a huge array of iconic voices I’ve been hearing echoing across the internet for most of my time making games," McMillen added. "As some probably noticed I was [pretty] all over the place when it came to cameos and did my best to include and keep ones that clashed or kinda counterbalanced each other.</p>
<p>"The inclusion of Ethan and Hila was counter balanced by iDubbbz and Anisa," he pointed out. For context, iDubbbz and Anisa are Youtubers and streamers who have <a href="https://x.com/overzealots_/status/2018074085964575102">publicly</a> <a href="https://x.com/AnisaTheGreasy/status/1716214668669436177">supported</a> Palestinians during Israel's invasion of Gaza. iDubbbz and Ethan Klein are former friends who are now locked in a <a href="https://dailydot.com/idubbbz-content-cop-ethan-klein/">public feud</a>, after iDubbbz released a 'Content Cop' video criticising Klein for his stance on Israel.</p>
<p>"I made sure to contact both to make sure they were ok with the others' involvement so it didn’t feel like a weird gotcha on release," McMillen explained. "They were both very adult about it and said they had no issue with the other being added and I really respected that, since I know they have been publicly feuding for a while now. It’s hard to explain without revealing aspects of the game people haven’t really experienced yet, but the inclusion of people with clashing ideologies felt appropriate.</p>
<p>"I understand we live in a time where a meow from someone who has different beliefs as you is scary and frustrating, confusing and controversial..." McMillen continued, "but it felt interesting so I decided to explore it. Also, I should probably point out that I don’t share the same opinions as, well probably any of the people we included, if I only included people who share the same exact opinions as me, I’d be the only one meowing in the game. I included Chris but also liquid Chris (those who know, know)...I didn’t [realise] Matan was controversial, I mean a lot of these people are characters doing bits.</p><p>"It’s sad that some people might read this or other articles and be so put off by the idea of an inclusion of someone they don’t like so much that they will never play the game," he concluded, "but I’m not sure someone who would be that upset by a 'problematic meow' would really enjoy the game that much anyway. Honestly the thing that bothers me the most about all this is, if a cat appears with the voice of someone you hate...you can literally throw it in the trash...or worse! People need to get more creative with their hate!"</p>
<p>McMillen also pointed out that once Mewgenics has full mod support, modders may well have a go at offering players the means to remove any meows they aren't fans of, and possibly add in their own custom meows.</p>
<p>In our review of Mewgenics, Callum wrote that "McMillen and Glaiel’s brand has long been stapling together obsessive gameplay loops with juvenile potty humour and more than a sprinkle of morbid horror." He noted in conclusion that "Whatever happens, I know I'll come back with a corker of a story. And it’ll almost certainly involve poo." That spirit definitely seems to have carried over to the voice-casting, too.</p>

            <p>There was a conspicuous absence during the Diablo anniversary 'spotlight' broadcast yesterday: no mention of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> release for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> or for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a>: Resurrected.</p>
<p>This was something I had intended to find out about when I visited Blizzard headquarters a couple of weeks ago, while exploring these 'spotlight' announcements under embargo. But when I raised the question of a Switch 2 release in a group Diablo 2: Resurrected interview, it was commandeered by a Blizzard PR who explained to me the company had nothing to say on the matter - either about a Switch 2 version of Diablo 2: Resurrected or Diablo 4.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Diablo 2: Resurrected is available for Switch 1, but people are eager for a Switch 2 version to make use of the newer hardware's greater power.</p>

<figcaption>Yesterday's big Diablo 'spotlight' broadcast.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnAsWN-6hvw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Why the silence? I would be amazed if Blizzard was <em>not </em>doing Switch 2 versions of either game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hands-on-with-diablo-3-on-nintendo-switch">Blizzard had great success bringing Diablo 3 to the original Switch</a> hardware, after all, so a precedent is already there. And I don't see that Diablo 4, a three-year-old game, does anything too demanding for Switch 2 to cope with. The exception is the always-online nature of the game, whereby you log-in to Blizzard's Battle.net servers to play. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-proper-switch-2-version-coming">Blizzard is bringing Overwatch to Switch 2 this year</a>, which works in the same way.</p>
<p>As for Diablo 2: Resurrected, an upgraded Switch 2 version simply makes sense, especially in light of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-announces-diablo-warlocks">Blizzard's recent warlock class release</a> and apparent ongoing active development of the game.</p>
<p>But there's a bigger reason why I think Switch 2 versions of Diablo are an inevitability, and it has to do with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hearthstone-isnt-on-console-switch-or-steam-deck-but-increasingly-likely-to-happen">what Hearthstone's executive producer Nathan Lyons-Smith said</a> during a different interview on the same Blizzard trip. While talking about a possible Switch 2 or Steam Deck release, he said, "In the future as we explore console and handheld, we'd probably go as wide as we could. Certainly we have a different owner now than we did three years ago and they're more invested in Xbox and 'anything's an Xbox'. Their high-level goal [being] games playable anywhere."</p>

<p>That's a point worth underlining: it's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">three years now since Xbox owner Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard for a colossal sum of money</a>, which is more than enough time to impress itself and its values upon Blizzard. And Microsoft's big current gaming push is, as Lyons-Smith mentioned, having Xbox everywhere, be it on PlayStation 5, PC, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">the Asus Rog Ally X handheld it collaborated on</a> recently. The Play Anywhere pitch is that you buy an Xbox game once and can play it on any device Xbox exists on. Surely that expands to Switch 2, too?</p>
<p>By the way, Diablo 2: Resurrected was added to Steam and Game Pass yesterday as part of the big 30th anniversary announcement, which feels like a related footnoted under this same idea.</p>
<p>I think it's only a matter of time before we see Diablo 4 and Diablo 2: Resurrected on Switch 2; perhaps even the Blizzard silence could be interpreted as a hint such things are in development. But if not now then when could such an announcement happen? Well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-3-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch">the Diablo 3 Switch 1 announcement happened around Gamescom 2018</a>, an event Blizzard tends to favour, which takes place in August. But I think it's more likely Blizzard is keeping its powder dry for its own show, BlizzCon, in September. Time, I suppose, will tell.</p>

            <guid>1433320</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>What would come next after you’ve successfully taken down the biggest drug cartel in the galaxy, saving humanity ? Well, fame for you and your talking alien guns, some degree of fortune, your sister ending up in more trouble with aliens, and plenty more stabby bounty hunting, if the opening to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/high-on-life-2">High on Life 2</a> is anything to go by.</p>
<p><iframe title="High On Life 2 OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtTLjkB0vbo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Through the first few hours of the game, it’s clear that High on Life 2 is picking up where the first game left off in terms of style and tone. Kenny the gun doesn’t make a return, obviously, and I feel that helps to take some of the edge off the improvisational humour. If that didn’t quite gel with you from the first game, it’s toned down a touch for the second and rebalanced to make some of the excesses feel a bit more optional. That said, this is still a motormouth first person shooter where your sentient guns are constantly jabbering away, where there’s long, drawn-out skits, and a cavalcade of bizarre alien characters, places and worlds.</p>


<p>You do have a bunch of returning characters, though, including Sweezy, Gus and Knifey remaining a part of your gang at the start of the game. It means you have a bit of rapid fire, shotgun-like blasting and brutally stabby melee in your arsenal right from the off. You can also drop Sweezy’s time bubble and shoot Gus’ blade disc as special abilities, while Knifey means you can latch onto grapple points to move around the fights rapidly. It provides a good foundation for what comes next, with new guns and more movement abilities.</p>
<p>Turns out some aliens still want to make humans into drugs, and as that’s revealed to you, you end up with a bounty being put on your head, forcing you to ditch your bounty hunter armour and start from scratch as an outlaw. But you do get a new skateboard, which is pretty neat.</p>


<p>As well as being a less strenuous replacement to sprinting everywhere, the skateboard has very simple controls and adds another aspect to the already fluid traversal. There’s a lot of the world that you can now grind along, latching onto handrails, sky rails, poles, wall edges and more with Knifey and then just rumbling along them. Spot a ramp and it can be used to launch you into a double jump, while halfpipes are easy to escape by just tapping a button to jump out of them.</p>
<p>It needs to be low effort, because it also ties into the combat in High on Life 2, which still provides countless goons for you to battle through, now coming from different bounty hunter gangs catching up to you. These encounters will often lock you down for an arena-style battle, each now with rails to grind around and keep you on the move. You don’t have to skateboard if you don’t like, and there’s still a lot of momentum through a fight as you dodge, shoot, use abilities and get stabby with finishers, but grinding on a rail can help you close or grow the gap to enemies pretty rapidly.</p>

<p>You’ll find a familiar structure to the game here, now with multiple hub worlds that then lead off to the different levels as you track down the bad guys. There’s some pretty wild diversions along the way, though. Even with the first baddie you’re after, you need to find a way to first get onto his cruise ship, which means befriending a lovelorn Gatlian through a long and messy drinking montage. Once you’re on the ship? Well, then there’s a murder mystery evening for you to try and solve, interrogating the other people taking part in the game, finding clues and piecing together the story.</p>
<p>If there’s one early criticism I have of this design, it’s that I wish I just had a compass with a marker on it to give me a direction. There’s a constant battle in game design between maps, objective markers and stripping everything away, and High on Life 2 will create a sparkly path for you to follow with a tap of a button… but that line disappears a few seconds later, and its pathing can be a bit obtuse to get you back to a main route. In this case a compass or a pointer on the threat radar feels like a better solution to give you a heading without spamming the sparkles.</p>

<p>We’ve still got the bulk of the game to go, but it already feels pretty clear where this game will land for people. If you enjoyed the first game and still adore Rick and Morty’s ad-libbed humour, then this is absolutely for you. This brings plenty more of that same tone, but there’s a sprinkling of new ideas and fun diversions that could make it appeal more broadly.</p>
<p><em>We’ll keep plugging away at the game over the next couple days to deliver our final scored review. Cheerio.</em></p>

<p>As described in the official patch notes (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-today-2-4-0-update-out-now-patch-notes/">Nintendo Everything</a>), the new widget is a "compact size equivalent to four icons", so it's not going to take up a massive chunk of space on your home screen. Naturally, all you need to do is update the app via the Play Store/App Store, and you'll be good to go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Added a new size to the calendar widget.<br>
- We’ve added a compact size equivalent to four icons to the daily rotating calendar widgets featuring various characters.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, <strong>Tomodachi Life</strong> can now be selected as a game series you're interested in. To do this, navigate to your account settings screen on the bottom right, tap on 'Home', then 'Your Favourite Characters/Game Series'.</p>
<p>With the impending release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> on <strong>16th April 2026</strong>, this might be a good way to keep up to date on minor announcements or videos.

            <p>Wildlight, the studio behind recently released shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a>, have confirmed that they've "parted ways" with an unspecified number of staff. This confirmation follows a former Wildlight level designer affected by the cuts claiming in a LinkedIn post that "most of the team" at the studio have been laid off.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-graner-a37262114/">the post</a> from senior level designer Alex Graner reads. "This one really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for Highguard." A number of other former Wildlight staff, including social and community lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427506515303063552/">Alex Ackerman</a>, lead tech artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/josh-sobel-86232439_today-i-was-laid-off-from-my-job-at-wildlight-activity-7427497173774225409-BbWe">Josh Sobel</a>, and lead producer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427563501134430209/?originTrackingId=lW1r0Ee1d6ngvaLbXVUkWQ%3D%3D">Hunter Hudspeth</a> have since shared their own posts about being let go. The latter wrote that "things are winding down at Wildlight".</p>
<p>Wildlight subsequently issued the following statement addressing the layoffs to <a href="https://x.com/WildlightEnt/status/2021745168387596450">social media</a>:</p>
<blockquote>"Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game. We’re proud of the team, talent, and the product we’ve created together. We’re also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community.</blockquote>
<p>No exact numbers of staff laid off have been provided. In a quick scan of LinkedIn this morning I've spotted 18 posts from developers acknowledging they've been let go.</p><p>

Highguard released on January 26th, a little over two weeks ago as I write this. The subject of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-devs-say-it-was-always-the-plan-to-go-dark-after-its-reveal-a-la-apex-legends-launch">rather inane discourse</a> about a lack of marketing following its reveal at December's Game Awards, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-impressions">our James' verdict</a> on the shooter was that it offers a perfectly decent time, if not one that knocks your socks off at this point.
</p><p>
"At its best, Highguard is also subtly effective at recreating the best bits of its myriad inspirations," he wrote. "For me, the highlights tend to be matches that have the feel of a great <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> game: involving and demanding of attention, where enduring the momentum of an apparently superior team opens up chances to turn the tables, be it through sheer grit or the perfectly-timed deployment of magic skills."</p>
<p>Solidarity to everyone affected by these layoffs at Wildlight.</p>

<p>Here's the exact time that Season 7 will get underway in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 10pm (Wed) PST / 11pm (Wed) MST / 12am CST / 1am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 6am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 7am CET / 8am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 3pm JST / 2pm AWST / 5pm AEDT</li></ul>

<p>As ever, there are some Pokédex restrictions on which 'mon you can take into battle with you in Season 7. Just like last time, only Pokémon numbered 001-232 in the Lumiose 'dex and 001-132 in the Hyperspace 'dex will be allowed to compete, all of which will be set to level 50 for the duration of the battle. Oh yes, and you can only stick one Restricted Legendary Pokémon on your bench, too — so no super teams, okay?</p>
<p>As we say, there are still a few days of Season 6 remaining before all this kicks off.

On January 21, the French publisher said it was implementing a "major organizational, operational, and portfolio reset."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was a move that included several game cancellations and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-proposes-layoffs-at-massive-entertainment-and-ubisoft-stockholm">layoffs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;alongside the promise of more cost-cutting. Ubisoft now comprises five separate "creative houses" under which its various franchises will live. For instance, all of the company's core franchises—Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six—have been placed into one (Tencent-backed) creative house, while Just Dance and Miner Tycoon will reside in another.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft founder and CEO Yves Guillemot said the restructure is part of the company's plan "to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth over time." Ubisoft shares&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/22/ubisoft-shares-plummet-after-assassins-creed-maker-cancels-six-games.html">dropped immediately after the announcement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and employees, too, were left with plenty of questions—specifically, about how Ubisoft's new organizational structure will lead to the fabled land of "sustainable growth." It's a phrase that has been kicked around by corporate execs like a tattered old football in recent years, usually when announcing layoffs or studio closures. But what, if anything, do those two words actually mean?</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wildlight-entertainment-reportedly-lays-off-staff-within-weeks-of-first-game-s-launch" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: Wildlight Entertainment confirms layoffs two weeks after Highguard launch</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"'Sustainable growth' is definitely a buzzword that gets used broadly and can mean many things depending on the company," DFC Intelligence founder and analyst David Cole tells Game Developer. "But in the game industry today it reflects a real structural shift in how large publishers operate."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sustainable growth—the buzzword—is part of the industry's big problem, says F-Squared video game consultant Michael Futter. "Because public companies, especially in our industry, have drastically over-prioritized shareholders among other stakeholder groups, sustainability is rarely attainable. The economy is in shambles and these companies are still talking about sustaining growth instead of sustaining their business. These are two different things."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But&nbsp;investor and New York University professor Joost van Dreunen says that Ubisoft—following a series of struggles, both internal and external—has "few other options than" a dramatic overhaul. "To put this in perspective: on an average trading day, Take-Two's market value fluctuates more than what Ubisoft’s is worth in its entirety," adds van Dreunen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cole says that video game companies are typically separated into two functions: publishing and development. The publishing arm is squarely focused on the marketing, distribution, and monetization of Ubisoft's intellectual property; the development arm is concerned with "the complex and costly process of building the game itself," Cole says.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mattel-acquires-control-of-mobile-studio-mattel163-from-netease" target="_self" data-discover="true">Mattel acquires control of mobile studio Mattel163 from NetEase</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft has historically been "one of the most development-heavy publishers in the industry," Cole continues, "with a very large network of internal studios and thousands of staff tied to ongoing production." But production budgets are massive now, and timelines are ever-growing, which means that huge production teams are hard to sustain. "That scale can be a strength creatively, but it also creates significant fixed cost and operational complexity when the release pipeline slows or projects get delayed," Cole says. He expects the industry to move towards a production model that's more closely aligned with film and television production, in which teams are assembled on a project-to-project basis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is not what Ubisoft is doing, exactly, but the shift towards "creative houses" is a more modular way of developing video games. Everything is still internal, but groups are now more strictly project-and franchise-based. It means that third parties, like Tencent, can invest in certain franchises but leave other parts of the company untouched.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In that context, Ubisoft's restructuring reflects a broader industry reality," Cole says. "Publishers are under pressure to reduce fixed overhead, improve execution, and rely more on an ecosystem of dedicated third-party partners in order to operate more efficiently. The companies that succeed will be those that can balance creative control with a leaner, more modular development model."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-appoints-zynga-veteran-bernard-kim-to-its-board-of-directors" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity appoints Zynga veteran Bernard Kim to its board of directors</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;The creative houses structure is essentially pre-packaging Ubisoft for sale&quot;">"The creative houses structure is essentially pre-packaging Ubisoft for sale"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reality of the separate creative houses, too, means that Ubisoft's franchises are easier to sell off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The creative houses structure is essentially pre-packaging Ubisoft for sale," van Dreunen says. "By creating autonomous divisions with clear P&amp;Ls, they’re making it easier for acquirers to cherry-pick the valuable parts, like Rainbow Six or Assassin's Creed teams, without absorbing all 17,000 employees."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amanda Farough, F-Square co-founder and video game consultant, feels the same way.—Ubisoft needed money from Tencent, which explains why it chose to fragment its business.. "The move to split off some of the more valuable IP was a convoluted way to have their cake and eat it, too," she explains</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Dreunen expects "selective divestitures first," then "either full privatization by the Guillemot family or acquisition by a strategic buyer that can absorb the profitable divisions. The real question is whether this happens before or after another disappointment forces their hand. Either way, whether it's Tencent buying Rainbow Six or Sony grabbing Assassin's Creed, I’d expect Europe and North America's indie scene to benefit from an exodus of senior talent."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft did not deny the possibility of selling off one of its newly structured creative houses,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-internal-town-hall-fails-to-reassure-employees-on-its-future/">per a recording of a Ubisoft Town Hall outlined by Insider Gaming</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Ubisoft chief financial officer Frederik Duguet said during that call that divesting a creative house isn't the "first route," but noted that if, "in some years," a house was not profitable, the executive team "will look at the root cause."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If we open the perspective, and the options, if we find a powerful and motivated partner, and we agree on long term vision, and it comes with an important cash injection, with the force to invest in the future of the brands, if this is good for the house or Ubisoft, it is something to consider," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft's split into these different creative houses is a way to provide "focus and efficiencies," too. Van Dreunen provides an example—the music publishing industry, wherein it's common for publishers to have different labels for different genres. "This focus improves the quality of their output," he says. "It also mitigates risk across the organization. When one division fails, it doesn't drag down the others, limiting its impact."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And success rates of video games are a major concern. Players are spending huge amounts of time on video games that are years old. There are more video games than ever, but companies are seeing declined revenue. Investor and Epyllion CEO Matthew Ball tells Game Developer that "most large publishers have faced declining batting averages." Fewer games are hits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The term 'tentpole' comes from Hollywood whereby a movie studio might release, say, a dozen titles, some of which lose money, some of which make some profits but not enough to recoup other losses, but one or two of which can 'hold up' the entire tent," he says. "Overall, publishers have found that too many titles sit in those first two groups than they expected, and their losses are too great for the winners to hold up the tent. It’s for this reason that nearly all publishers thinned their development pipelines to focus on fewer at-bats."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Ubisoft, he says, this is evident with its recent game cancellations, like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.jordanmechner.com/en/latest-news/#winter-days">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "Publishers such as Ubisoft are looking to reset and refocus their entire investment programs to what they consider to be a more sustainable forecast and set of assumptions," Ball says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Expensive video games that take a lot of time to be made and cost a lot of money need to be hits—the high production costs demand more, and games aren't often reaching the heights required to meet those expectations.&nbsp;Ubisoft is hoping that its major restructure will lead to more of those hits, and it's drastically cutting costs until it does.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Part of the effort is a public bloodletting and an implied mea culpa to investors who have begun to consider selling their shares, further depressing the firm’s valuation, and part of it is a restructuring aimed at revitalizing internal processes and, possibly, breaking bad habits," Cole says. "Ubisoft's failing is not a function of a lack of resources or talent, suggesting that an organizational refresh might be exactly what it needs to get its groove back.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft's employees, whose lives are heavily impacted by the executive failures, are not necessarily convinced. An </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-internal-town-hall-fails-to-reassure-employees-on-its-future/">Insider Gaming report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> suggests that a recent Town Hall meeting in which Guillemot and other executives answered employee-submitted questions did not go well—specifically, the return-to-office mandate that some employees see as a way to shed employees. Guillemot said the "only objective is to get Ubisoft back on the right path as soon as possible, to share success and profits," per Insider Gaming's recording of the meeting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Two Ubisoft Paris developers told Game Developer earlier in February that workers are incensed by the restructuring and subsequent impact on games, studios, and employees. Those employees&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-union-representatives-call-for-resignation-of-ceo-yves-guillemot">called for the resignation of Guillemot</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Five unions covering Ubisoft employees are now encouraging staff to&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-s-time-for-real-accountability-ubisoft-unions-call-international-strike">strike for three days</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;from February 10 to February 12.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's time for our management to understand that they cannot do whatever they want, whether with public money or the work of hundreds of people," the unions wrote in a joint statement. "Without us, Ubisoft would never have conquered and transformed video games as it has done. We are history, we are Ubisoft."</span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/analysts-dissect-ubisoft-cost-cutting-and-the-farcical-fascination-with-sustainable-growth-]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Blizzard bringing a new playable character to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a>: Resurrected - the first new character the game has had in 25 years - could be the start of an era of active development for the classic game, potentially seeing it evolve like a modern game does.</p>
<p>To recap quickly: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-announces-diablo-warlocks">Blizzard shadow-dropped the warlock for Diablo 2 last night</a> as part of a paid expansion release and a wider 30th anniversary celebration for the Diablo franchise. Not only was this unexpected but it's a 'testing the waters' moment; should the warlock go down well, Blizzard will take it as a green light to explore more of this kind of thing going forward.</p>
<p>"We are excited for the opportunity we have right now to see what the community says about what we're making," said Timothy Vasconcellos, lead designer on the Diablo Legacy team, during a Diablo 2 interview at Blizzard headquarters a couple of weeks ago, which I was a part of. "And if we're trusted with that legacy and if it's a positive reception and they say: no you guys actually did do this very intricate dance preserving the 1999 game, then maybe we can think about how we pursue those opportunities in the future. But we have to nail that otherwise we kill the game in trying to progress it forward."</p>

<p>"We still have millions of people who play Diablo 2 - millions of them," lead producer Matthew Cederquist added, with a heavy emphasis on the "millions". "We saw the 30th anniversary of the franchise itself as a really great opportunity to surprise and delight. I don't think anyone expects a new class and all these features in Diablo 2, and I think that's going to be a moment that's like, 'I'm sorry, what did you say? You did what?' People won't believe it until we put it in their faces. And I sure hope it's as epic to the players as we find it. But is it a declaration of something new [going forwards]? We're going to have to see what the players say."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We don't want to mess up the Mona Lisa. We're not going to give her some sunglasses and a new hairdo"</em></blockquote>
<p>Understandably, bringing a new class to a treasured game like Diablo 2 was a nervy moment for the team. To my eyes, which aren't particularly accustomed to Diablo 2, the warlock feels at home in the game (I had a chance to play it for half-an-hour or so). Blizzard said a lot of effort went into making the class feel like it was designed in the year 1999, which I think it does. The team at Blizzard, more than anyone, perhaps, is aware of what's at stake if it messes around with the recipe too much.</p>
<p>"We don't want to mess up the Mona Lisa," Cederquist said. "We're not going to give her some sunglasses and a new hairdo. But at the same time, does it feel weird [adding a new class]? No. Do we have to honour that legacy of what was created? Yes."</p>

<p>Incidentally, the versions of the warlock differ in the Diablo games it's coming to - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, Diablo 2, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a>. Broadly, there's a lore-based thread running through them, with all three telling a connected story of the warlock appearing in the world of Sanctuary. This starts in D2 and runs through Diablo Immortal and then Diablo 4. Diablo 2's warlock take also pulls on the game's more hardcore appeal, especially in the demon taming skill tree, which is unique to D2, whereby you can tame demons and have them fight with you as pets or consume them for bursts of power. It's fiddly but incredibly satisfying to do.</p><p>Should the community like the warlock, then, and want more, it will lead to a broader exploration of what Blizzard can do with Diablo 2. This might involve meaningful reworks of classes already in the game, for example, although were this to be the case, Blizzard wouldn't spring it on you like it did the warlock. "Let's say if we wanted to change Barbarian for some reason: I wouldn't want to surprise people with that," Cederquist said. "That is working with the community hand in hand, to listen to their feedback about the changes that we would make if we wanted to."</p>
<p>There's a bigger concern with this, though, and it's what happens to the preserved and restored Diablo 2 experience that millions of people clearly still enjoy? It's not a classic experience any more if it's changed. To this end, we've reached a divergence point. There are now, effectively, two versions of Diablo 2: Resurrected. There's a progressive version represented by Reign of the Warlock, which is the paid expansion the warlock is a part of, and there's the classic version known as Diablo 2: Resurrected.</p>
<p>"It's the reason why we separated out Reign of the Warlock and whatever future stuff we have, so that we do have the opportunity to change with feedback, but also preserve what people love in Resurrected, and all that data set is totally split," Cederquist explained. "Resurrected is going to time-stamp. If you don't want to play a warlock for whatever reason and you hate loot filters, you can still have Resurrected and it's going to stay there. If we make any future changes to any classes or whatever, it's going to happen in that Reign of Warlock space."</p>
<p>It's a big week for Diablo 2, not only with the addition of a new class, but also because it was released on Steam yesterday and on Game Pass (the Reign of the Warlock expansion is not included on Game Pass). There are already "millions" of people playing the game, as Cederquist said, and these releases potentially widen the game to millions more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Aside from <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing the new sales milestone of <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong></a>, the <strong>Embracer Group</strong> also just revealed the final launch date of the <strong>Gothic remake</strong>. The game will need a little more polishing time, the group said, and is now set to ship globally <strong>on June 5, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>As you might recall, a public demo <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-in-the-works-maybe-meanwhile-heres-a-playable-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released six years ago</a> as a test to gauge interest in the remake. The reception was positive, despite some criticism of certain aspects of the demo, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>led the Embracer Group to found Alkimia Interactive</strong></a>, which has been working on the Gothic remake ever since.</p>



<p>More than a simple HD "Remaster Plus", <strong>this should be considered a complete reimagining</strong>. The studio recently shared several stories from the development trenches in a "Making Of" series. For example, they faced a fundamental challenge from the start: determining which elements should remain unchanged and which needed expansion or modernization. The original Gothic's strengths, such as immersive open-world design, memorable characters, and systemic interactions, had to coexist with solutions to plot holes, inconsistencies, and unfinished content. To help with that, <strong>Alkimia hired Mattias Filler, a writer from the original Gothic games</strong>, to provide an authentic perspective and tackle those longstanding issues.</p>



<p>Here's an overview of how the folks at Alkimia overhauled the original Gothic in each of the game's main areas:</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="art-new-content">Art Direction and New Content</h2>



<p>Early in development, the team <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/alkimia-interactive-delves-into-its-approach-to-art-in-the-gothic-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided against creating an HD version of the original's art style</a></strong>, instead pursuing believable, realistic visuals, albeit with a dark fantasy edge. The art direction also<strong> draws heavily from Baroque painting across multiple eras</strong>. References cited by Alkimia include <strong>Caravaggio's chiaroscuro</strong>, Spanish tenebrism of Velázquez, the landscape work of Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin, Flemish Baroque color contrasts from David Teniers the Younger, and Hubert Robert's atmospheric ruins. The team also incorporated influences from the nocturnal scenes of Romantic painter Petrus van Schendel.</p>



<p>The Gothic remake <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">includes approximately 20-25% new side quest content</a></strong> while expanding original quests with additional options and solutions. Previously empty or underutilized locations received new content, dungeons have been made more interesting, and hidden paths to Gomez's castle offer alternative entry points. <strong>Cut content from the original game is being restored and reimagined where appropriate</strong>.</p>



<p>The writing <strong>maintains Gothic's signature rough, conversational tone</strong>. It's dialogue written the way people actually talk in pub discussions or pen-and-paper RPG sessions, rather than formal medieval speech. The English localization received particular attention because previous versions failed to capture the iconic tone of the German, Polish, and Russian translations.</p>



<p><strong>The narrative has also grown significantly</strong>, with the team working to fix the aforementioned plot holes, improve pacing in later chapters, and give more depth to storylines that felt rushed in the original. <strong>One major expansion involves Orc culture and player interaction with it</strong>. Where the original treated Orcs primarily as enemies to kill after brief story interactions with Ur-Shak and Tarrok, the remake explores their role more deeply, recognizing that the Orc War is the entire reason the prison colony and magical barrier exist in the first place.</p>



<p>The team even <strong>developed a complete Orcish language for the game</strong>, designed to sound harsh and aggressive with trilled "Rs," "ch," and "tz" sounds. The language's grammar was inspired by East Asian languages such as Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese, keeping words short (one to three syllables) and avoiding articles, grammatical gender, tense markers, and plurals.</p>



<h2 id="simulation-systems">Simulation Systems</h2>



<p><strong>Major story moments now trigger visible changes in the world</strong>, including altered environments and updated NPC routines that reflect the narrative shifts. This addresses one of the original game's problems, where monumental events had very little impact on daily life. Alkimia also said that the Gothic remake <strong>addresses the original's diminishing player freedom in later chapters</strong>. The developers have strived to ensure that multiple paths and choices remain available throughout the game, rather than funneling into a linear conclusion, which would be quite contrary to the game's overall design goals.</p>



<p>The game <strong>employs a full-world daily routine simulation that runs constantly</strong>, even when the player isn't nearby. When approaching NPCs (non-playable characters), <strong>they spawn exactly where they would be based on their schedules</strong>, so players can now encounter templars traveling between the Sect Camp and Old Mine, something impossible in the original.</p>



<p>NPCs also <strong>react systemically to player actions, witnessing crimes, responding to trespassing, and interacting with thrown objects</strong>. New dynamic events include Baal Parvez preaching in the Old Camp to recruit for the Swamp Camp, with nearby diggers stopping their tasks to listen. Characters carry objects, react to weather, and discuss recent events and rumors among themselves.</p>



<h2 id="gameplay-evolution">Gameplay Evolution</h2>



<p>The armor system in the Gothic remake moves away from fixed guild armor sets to a customizable upgrade path. <strong>Players can improve camp-specific armor with different visual elements and defensive properties</strong>, for example adding wolf fur for arrow defense or mobility enhancements while maintaining the aesthetic of their chosen faction.</p>



<p>New abilities expand exploration possibilities beyond the original. <strong>Climbing functions similarly to The Legend of Zelda</strong>, but is limited to specific areas. <strong>Diving is now a proper skill that improves with practice</strong>, allowing players to interact with underwater objects, pick up loot, and explore extensive submerged areas.</p>



<p>The developers emphasized the game's difficulty, <strong>encouraging players to consume items through challenging encounters rather than hoarding resources</strong>. Combat remains unforgiving like in the original, and players can still attempt "silly things" like fighting powerful enemies from the start, staying true to Gothic's philosophy of not holding the player's hand.</p>



<p><strong>Exploration emphasizes the feeling of being lost</strong>, especially at night when darkness becomes oppressive even with torches and light spells. The conversation camera system uses preset shots with environmental checks to avoid clipping through walls or characters, with fully planned cinematography for important scenes.</p>



<p><strong>The Gothic remake implements a dynamic trading system in which merchants passively trade items among themselves</strong>, converting goods into ore to maintain market liquidity. This prevents the player from becoming the central bank and controls material abundance. The studio's economic designer analyzed the original game's patterns to understand its intended progression, identifying where the economy broke down in later chapters. The goal was to delay economic collapse until chapter six through active management, though complete stability is impossible in a closed economy with the player as the only active agent. <strong>Crafting recipes will evolve with player investment</strong>, and the act of crafting itself provides value by converting excess materials into ore while reducing inventory clutter.</p>



<p>The dynamic weather system includes <strong>varying sun intensity and color, cloud cover, rain with fluctuating intensity, storm probabilities, growing waves during storms, lightning illuminating the night sky, and lingering post-storm fog</strong>. The music system uses layers and cues that change based on in-game events rather than a single master track, ensuring players don't tire of the soundtrack during extended play sessions. The composer approached each scene as painting pictures, assigning instruments to visual elements and experimenting with melodies and harmonies to convey specific emotions.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most interesting part of the whole Making Of series is the claim that they've consciously created an art style and systems <strong>"not just for one game, but for an entire new series within the Gothic franchise"</strong>. It definitely sounds like they'd like it to serve as a foundation for future entries beyond this remake, although of course, the necessary requirement will be the successful release of the first one. </p>



<p>It won't be long until we can find out for ourselves. Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>Jason Momoa will star in the live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film adaptation from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/jason-momoa-helldivers-release-date-1236715868/">Deadline</a>, Momoa - who is no stranger to video game adaptations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">with Minecraft</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-jason-momoa-and-wrestler-roman-reigns-tapped-for-street-fighter-roles">Street Fighter already to his name</a> (there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aquaman-jason-momoa-set-to-star-in-just-cause-movie">even some Just Cause talk several years ago</a>) - will join Fast and Furious director Justin Lin on the film, which is based on Arrowhead's delightfully chaotic space-based shooter.</p>
<p>While further specifics on who Momoa will play in Helldivers remain unknown, it was confirmed the film will release next year, on 10th November.</p>
<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January 2025, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p>
<p>Lin's involvement was then confirmed in December. Some were disappointed to learn that Lin is not a gamer himself, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">the director actually used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film</a>. Arrowhead went on to show its support of Lin, stating it trusts the Helldivers film director, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-trust-justin-arrowhead-ceo-responds-to-helldivers-2-community-asking-for-film-director-to-play-the-game">shutting down any comments suggesting the director should at least try the game before taking on the adaptation</a>.</p>

<p>As for Momoa, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2026s-street-fighter-movie-gets-first-look-trailer-and-it-includes-a-great-reference-to-the-series-most-famous-bonus-stage">he is playing Blanka in Street Fighter</a>, which is set to release on 16th October.</p>
<p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>
