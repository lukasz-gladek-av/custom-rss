            <p>If you want to toss a coin to your orchestra, you will soon be able to do just that, as CD Projekt Red has announced ticket sales for The Witcher in Concert will go on sale imminently.</p>
<p>The Witcher in Concert is a celebration of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>'s 10th anniversary, because it really has been that long (and yet, I haven't aged a day). It will "bring to life the open-world RPG's timeless score with a live orchestra performance". As with other video game-based concerts, gameplay will accompany the music as it swells from the orchestra.</p>
<p>The concert tour itself will kick off during this year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> event in Cologne, before traveling across Europe. That includes here in the UK, with the concert coming to London on 5th November, before it heads to Manchester on 7th November.</p>

<p>As well as the UK, the tour has stops in Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Sweden all scheduled. Further tour locations will be announced at a later date, including ones across the pond in North America.</p>
<p>"I can't believe it's been 10 years since we first introduced The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to the world! Music is such an important part of our games, and to see the community respond with such enthusiasm for what we created has been truly incredible," said soundtrack co-composer Marcin Przybyłowicz.</p>
<p>"From everyone's favorite 'le le les' to the tracks we used to underscore the most heartfelt moments, every single composition was a joy to create, and I'm looking forward to sharing it with people around the world."</p>
<p>Those interested are able browse the current list of venues and purchase tickets through The Witcher in Concert <a href="http://thewitcher.com/concert">official website</a>. Ticket sales go live on 24th January, so this Friday, however a pre-sale will begin 48 hours prior to this date for those who sign up to the concert's newsletter. So, I guess that means now. Get tossing those coins! (only if you want to, of course).</p>

<p>As for what's still to come for the Witcher series, CD Projekt lifted the lid on its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">next video game entry at The Game Awards in December</a>.</p>
<p>Known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, the upcoming game stars Ciri as the main protagonist, and will be another third-person action-RPG just like The Witcher 3. Oh, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">Doug Cockle is returning to voice Geralt of Rivia</a>, who will indeed be present in the game in some form.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>S-Game has released a new trailer for forthcoming action game Phantom Blade Zero, but it remains without a firm release date.</p>
<p>The new trailer celebrates 2025's Year of the Snake with a fresh gameplay of a boss battle and a look at new snake-themed weapons: the sword-whip Soft Snake Sword, and twin swords White Serpent and Crimson Viper.</p>
<p>The trailer also states a release date will be announced this year, as the developer is continuing to tweak and finalise the game.</p>

<p>In an email to Eurogamer alongside the trailer, S-Game stated the playable demos from last year proved Phantom Blade Zero is already a "polished title", but it's using Unreal Engine 5 to "push the boundaries even further" after a "significant" boost to the budget.</p>
<p>It also confirmed enhanced visuals will be supported on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero was announced by Sony in 2023. Developed by S-Game, it's a hack and slash action game fusing traditional techniques and philosophies of Chinese martial arts with inspiration from the Hong Kong action films of the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>This new trailer shows a battle against boss the Seven Judgments - a sort of puppet master with clones. It's a further example of the game's parrying and dodging mechanics, as well as its high difficulty.</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-is-speedy-stylish-and-absolutely-not-a-soulslike">hands-on with Phantom Blade Zero</a> at last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> and came away impressed by its hugely satisfying combat. Just remember: as the developer said, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-has-dark-souls-inspired-non-linear-map-but-developer-still-insists-its-not-a-soulslike">absolutely not a Soulslike</a>.</p>
<p>S-Game CEO Liang Qiwei (known as Soulframe) stated last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-producer-says-foreign-themes-can-be-an-advantage-rather-than-a-barrier-for-a-global-audience">authentic cultural themes are important for games</a> and shouldn't be diluted for a global audience, as the Chinese developer chases the same success as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
In the UK, May has hitherto been a month of innocent delight and sacred observance, with no less than two bank holidays. On May Day - a festival of ancient origins that shares a date with International Workers' Day - the youths of the village garb themselves in daisies, erect huge candy-striped maypoles, and dance around them in an effort to get all entangled and possibly end up kissing. NO MORE. For May is now the month of DOOM. It marks the coming of a new Dark Age.</p>
<p>Which is to say, it's when we'll get to play id Software's cacodemon-booping FPS <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, going by a leaked release date ahead of tomorrow's Xbox Developer Direct. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The date in question is 15th May, according to a now-pulled article published by French website Gamekult and passed along by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-spotted-ahead-of-xbox-developer-direct">Eurogamer</a>. I can't confirm this, obviously, but chainsawing the month neatly in two is classic Doom behaviour. Hopefully, we'll get the last word tomorrow. The Dark Ages is one of four games that are publicly slated to appear. The others are Clair Obscura: Expedition 33, South Of Midnight, and a mystery surprise guest. Could be that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">hypothetical Oblivion remaster</a>, though Windows Central are <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-2025-predictions-and-overview-microsofts-most-promising-games-line-up-in-history-meets-a-platform-under-duress">mongering the rumour</a> that it's the return of an ancient Japanese franchise of some kind.
</p>
<p>
As for what you'll do in the new Doom - there shall be no maypoles and kissing. There shall only be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-the-dark-ages-comes-rampaging-in-on-a-chainsaw-shield-next-year">chained maces, powdered skulls, and medieval mechs</a>. You'd better <em>hope</em> there are no maypoles and kissing. I'm pretty sure Doomguy could find any number of applications for a maypole, and none of them would be innocent or delightful.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Halo has a history of embracing wacky game modes, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> players are seeing that tradition continue this week with a new playlist of game modes. "Action Sack" is a returning playlist for the series. It first appeared in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-3">Halo 3</a> as a rotating set of modes that would see you quickly cycling through various deadly minigames, from chaotic rockets-only nukefests to panicky punch-ups with ammoless pistols. This time, the playlist includes a familiar geometric hazard that has seen the death of many a bean: the "hex-a-gone" level from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you've not experienced the adrenal pleasure of a Fall Guys tournament, the goal of this particular minigame is to hop from one perilous tile to the next, escaping each tile as it falls after being used. There are several floors of tiles. Fall into the void, and you're knocked out. It's a pure playground game made manifest in bright colours and bouncing beanpals. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYVNStX1OXA">what it looks like in Fall Guys</a>. </p>
<p>As for how it showed up in the multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>, Halo Infinite's Forge mode allows players to create their own modes and minigames. So, of course someone imported this battle-royale-in-miniature. Here, up to 16 Spartans can recreate the twitchy standoffs and desperate divebombs of the game I like to call Heinz' Total Wipeout. It's been a custom mode for a while now, but Halo Studios has now deemed it playful enough to include the mode in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9JfHeLHiNeA">official Action Sack playlist</a>.</p>
<p>It'll sit alongside some other fun nonsense. Goose Hunt sees players driving around a dangerously exposed circular track on Mongoose quad bikes, while one player launches rockets at the drivers. Maze Craze will have you running around an intentionally confusing maze, trying to hide from the one murderous player with a gravity hammer. You can see the other modes in the playlist in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1240440/view/739253661966795641">a post on Steam</a> from the developers. </p><p>All this comes shortly after they formalised another goofy returning mode - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1240440/view/525331314946082049">Castle Wars</a>. This sees two teams standing off in opposing castles with only one direct approach between them. Think of these maps as the spiritual successors to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-making-of-facing-worlds-unreal-tournaments-most-popular-map">Unreal Tournament's Facing Worlds</a>. They are battles of attrition, and result in many a sniped head. In terms of level design, they should not work at all. And yet... and yet... </p>
<p>I have a lot of time for Halo's player-driven kookiness. As happens within modding scenes, these fan creations can become so popular and well-loved that they get officially folded into the games. The zombie-dodging Infection mode, which sees players fend off a slowly growing team of undead sword-wielding players, was once just a set of playground rules in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-2">Halo 2</a> matches, for example. That's probably unlikely for a borrowed novelty like Hex-A-Gone. But I'm glad we still get to see the spirit of modding survive in a popular shooter.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Origins once again asks you to command an army and dominate the battlefield. You need to do this over many hours of gameplay, and Dynasty Warriors Origins has a few chapters to overcome—along with thousands of enemies.</p>



<p>Dynasty Warriors Origins is another exercise in hacking and slashing until it can be done no more. Moving from one arena to another, mercilessly chopping down hundreds of opposing forces. Developer Omega Force has done a good job with Origins as it’s currently the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-dynasty-warriors-origins-metacritic-score/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-rated Dynasty Warriors game</a> in history!</p>



<p>A refreshing overhaul of gameplay mechanics, a deeper story, lots of fun <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-dynasty-warriors-origins-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achievements</a>, and some of the most spectacular combat to date make Origins a strong entry. If you’re wondering how much action there is, let’s check out every chapter in Dynasty Warriors Origins and how long the game is.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-dynasty-warriors-origins-chapters-are-there">How Many Dynasty Warriors Origins Chapters Are There?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lead and conquer. Credit to Omega Force</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five Chapters for each of Dynasty Warriors Origins’ campaigns. </strong></p>



<p>The chapters themselves aren’t named, the dev choosing to stick to generic numbers instead. <a href="https://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw_origins/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Origins</a>‘ longevity comes from multiple playthroughs required to see and complete every mission. This is because you eventually come to a crossroads in the main campaign.</p>



<p><strong>Two of the five chapters are shared across the three campaigns</strong>, and you’re forced to <strong>choose your side in Chapter 3</strong>—leaving certain stones untouched until another journey through the conquest.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-missions-in-dynasty-warriors-origins">How Many Missions in Dynasty Warriors Origins?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 70 main story missions and 48 side missions in total if you replay Dynasty Warriors Origins multiple times and take sides with different factions at the point of no return.</strong></p>



<p>This is where we get to see a true test of your mettle. It’s a lot of content and requires many hours, but doing so is your best way of seeing all Origins has to offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-dynasty-warriors-origins">How Long is Dynasty Warriors Origins?</h2>



<p><strong>Your initial Dynasty Warriors Origins playthrough should take around 20-40 hours.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll likely wander off the beaten path because of how much side content there is. But based on Omega Force’s comments, and the consensus around Origins, this is a solid figure for your first playthrough. However, as I’ve said, there are well over 100 missions to complete, a ton of special weapons and items to find, and powerful abilities to unlock.</p>



<p>Completionists are looking at well over <strong>100 hours of epic Dynasty Warriors Origins content to see and do!</strong></p>



<hr>



<p>We are not done with our Origins guides yet: Check out if the action title has any <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-multiplayer-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer or co-op content</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-dramatic-success-in-dynasty-warriors-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to get Dramatic Success</a>.<br></p>



<p>How likely are you to go to the ends of the Earth to see every piece of Dynasty Warriors Origins content? Is there anything missing you hope is either added in an update?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/how-big-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-map/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-big-is-the-map-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-answered.1088523/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-big-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-map/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is enormous. It boasts an open-world environment that players can explore at their desired pace, and it’s packed with secrets waiting to be discovered. From a massive medieval city to crumbling ruins, and from picturesque hamlets to bandit camps, you’ll never run out of things to uncover in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>Fans of the series <strong>know </strong>it’s a sizeable game, but how big is the map in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</p>



<p>Read on to find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-map-s">Map(s)</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 starts with players exploring a region called ‘Trosky’. Like in 2018’s Kingdom Come Deliverance, this is a faithful recreation of a real-world territory, and the towns scattered around the starter map all exist.</p>



<p>Trosky is fairly big, and it incorporates forest regions, a large central castle, winding rivers and hills, and a scattering of smaller villages, mills, and towns. The largest town on the map is Troskowitz, which is where you’ll find most of your traders.</p>



<p>To give you an impression of how big Trosky is in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, I had logged 35 hours in the game before I felt ‘ready’ to move on, satisfied that I’d done everything possible…</p>



<p>… And then I came back to the region later to find more objectives and locations to trawl through.</p>



<p>To learn more about that journey, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/">my full preview of the game</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-map-size-huge">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Map Size = Huge</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 <strong>really </strong>opens up when players get to the Kuttenberg region. Again, this real-world location is perfectly represented in KCD2, and every town that you visit <strong>exists </strong>in Czechia.</p>



<p>The Kuttenberg region is staggering in size and is made up of more than a dozen towns and villages. The heart of this region is Kuttenberg, a sprawling city that plays host to some of the game’s most major sequences and missions. At first blush, you’ll be blown away by Kuttenberg – it’s an imposing medieval city with branching alleys, dozens of stores and taverns, and many people to meet.</p>



<p>The Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 map is ‘fogged’ by default, requiring players to travel to actively uncover the map. This means that you’re constantly finding new locations and villages, up until the point where you’ve found everything – and even then, it doesn’t end.</p>



<p>I feel as though you’ll always bump into another NPC with a tip on a hidden location or a point of interest.</p>



<p>If you’re an explorer, you’re in luck – the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 map (or maps, if you’d prefer) is enormous.</p>



<p>Before you leave, check out my guide that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-a-sequel-answered/">explains more about the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 story</a>.</p>

		<p>Heart Machine certainly know how to make an artistically satisfying game. The first game in the Hyper Light series, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/08/hyper-light-drifter-special-edition-review/">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, blended neon colours, gorgeous pixel art and tight action gameplay to create something that immediately stood out from the rest of the indie pack.&nbsp;They followed that up with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/07/solar-ash-review-ps5-ps4-pc/">Solar Ash</a>, taking their penchant for awe-inspiring, idiosyncratic visuals and moving them to 3D. Once again, this showcased the strength of their world-building and action-heavy gameplay.</p>
<p>Hyper Light Breaker then, bears the heavy weight of expectation. As it launches into Early Access, fans of the series will no doubt delight in the world that’s been built here, but there’s a number of things that fundamentally need to change before it reaches full release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyper Light Breaker | Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClJaGZI-P78?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hyper Light Breaker is an open-world, procedurally generated Roguelite. As the genre dictates, that means there’s slow, incremental progress, starting off with next to nothing, making multiple runs into the game’s open world, and building up your character’s arsenal and abilities so that the next run will go just that little bit smoother. Hopefully, you’ll make it just that little bit farther.</p>
<p>There’s a reason that this is the gameplay style of choice right now: it’s rewarding, it’s challenging, and it can create longevity without needing an extensive narrative to drive it. Hyper Light Breaker takes the basic form of a Roguelite, but then layers its own quirks and design decisions on top, some of which work, and some of which don’t.</p>


<p>The first design decision is that Hyper Light Breaker is hard. Some of the difficulty seems to be because the team at Heart Machine expect, or perhaps hope, that you’re going to play in co-op with your friends. Damage and armour don’t scale here, and you can split enemies’ attention, so, when you factor in a couple of extra pairs of hands, it becomes wholly more approachable.</p>
<p>Co-op definitely lifts the whole experience – doesn’t it always? – but it also serves to highlight that the beautiful world that’s been built here feels a little lifeless. There’s no Indigenous wildlife that doesn’t want to kill you, no sounds of nature, and for all of the visual splendour it’s not carried by the life within it. Even the excellent synthwave soundtrack drops out too much, leaving you to drift far too often in an aurally and visually frozen piece of artwork.</p>
<p>So Hyper Light Breaker is populated by vicious and utterly lethal things. The enemies here, slimes, clawed demi-humans or giant ogres, are all, without fail, tough as nails, and, when you’re starting out at least, they offer more than just a challenge, they offer a sense of unfairness.&nbsp;I spawned into one map in a zone that always had enemies in it and time and time again they caught me out, whittling a third of my health away before I’d even really begun. A big part of that is that the visibility of incoming enemies can be difficult to parse at times, and the enemy units can be so fast they’re practically a blur.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that the combat isn’t good. On a fundamental level, the swift dodging, attacking and parrying feels really good, and can look visually spectacular when you factor in the different skills that open up for you. However, when you’re losing health from a bad guy you’ve barely even had time to see, it robs the game of both balance and fun. That’s compounded by some weaponry lacking impact, and a woeful lack of ammo for your ranged weapons.</p>
<p>Things do progress, and they do improve, but in Early Access you currently have to wade through some seriously testing moments before you get to them.</p>

<p>All of the game’s combat action takes place out in The Overgrowth. Each run sees you collecting Prisms, equipment and upgrades before attempting to take down three Crowns – three challenging area bosses – and then going after the Abyss King. The character designs are a massive highlight, especially for the boss creatures, and I really just wanted the chance to look at them, rather than immediately having my body crushed into a million tiny bits.</p>
<p>Some of your upgrades are permanent, and some of the items you collect will stay with you from run to run, though Heart Machine have added in weapon durability that sees many of your items disappear after a couple of runs. What that means is that progress is glacial in comparison to other Roguelites out there.</p>
<p>Your central hub, The Cursed Outpost, stands as a place of rest and respite, as well as playing host to your upgrade trees and different merchants whose wares might help you last a little longer. These need unlocking and coaxing into giving you the best stuff, and you upgrade them with the same consumables you use to upgrade your character. It creates a dissonance between the two, and further feels as though the game is unnecessarily trying to extend your time with it.</p>

<p>Despite all of this, Hyper Light Breaker is still rather moreish. A sick fascination with dying might be required for entry right now, but the world is incredible, the action sharp and varied, and it really comes alive in co-op. I hope that Heart Machine have the time and commitment to pour into it, as a few tweaks to the formula could utterly change the way it feels, and remove some of the current frustrations it seems so ready to dole out.</p>

			<p>Phantom Blade Zero, the exceedingly promising Soulslike game in development at Chinese studio S-GAME, has been shown again today with a gorgeous new gameplay trailer dedicated to the Year of the Snake celebration. The footage, which demonstrates the visual improvements that have been made since the last build, shows a new boss fight against the so-called Seven Judgements.</p>
<p>According to S-GAME, these foes will fight in a sword formation, with one of them coordinating the entire formation. The Seven Judgements were once righteous warriors who used this formation to slay countless powerful enemies but have since become puppets corrupted due to the bloodlust caused by the Transcension process. Six of them wear white robes with a dark hollow in the place of their faces, while their leader, Decree, wears blue with a similar hollow face, faintly glowing.</p>
<p>Players will have to deal with multiple enemies simultaneously while looking for opportunities to attack Decree, the heart of the formation, to complete the first stage of this Phantom Blade Zero boss fight. However, things are rather complicated due to several mechanics. For example, whenever Decree takes damage, the others sacrifice their own health to heal him. Moreover, if there are less than three disciples left, Decree will use his health to revive them. The collective health pool of all these enemies remains the same, meaning that the player must reduce them in one way or another. S-GAME says these Disciples are controlled by a group AI and can launch multi-directional attacks.</p>
<p>After the first phase, three Disciples climb onto platforms and use red strings to manipulate a puppet called Tyrannical Decree to attack the player. In this phase, enemies have a wide range of movement and swing across the arena with pendulum-like movements guided by the red strings.&nbsp; Their attack patterns are completely different from the previous phase and will require precise timing for counterattacks. Chasing them recklessly is not advised, as it can disrupt your rhythm and result in ineffective attacks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Blade Zero - Year of the Snake Gameplay Trailer 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ogm8X8SSyxs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this new Phantom Blade Zero gameplay trailer, S-GAME also introduced new snake-themed weapons. White Python and Red Viper are a pair of swords of different lengths shown in the first phase. The White Python is a long sword with wide, sweeping attacks, while the Red Viper is a short sword designed for precision strikes. The two swords can also be used in combination, such as the long sword propelling the short sword to attack. The Venomous Softblade, shown in the second phase, is a flexible sword that excels at countering and deflecting attacks.</p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero is currently in development for PC and PlayStation 5.

            <p>"Your grace, the act of assigning blame is often as satisfying as resolving the issue itself," opens brilliant little browser <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> <a href="https://sheepolution.itch.io/vox-regis">Vox Regis</a> by Sheepolution. From your tower, you gaze down at four factions, each with their own members and complaints. If any one faction gets too large, they'll rebel against you. Luckily, you're very good at speeches, which you can use to blame all the realm's ills on other people. "It was the lion faction! They raised taxes!" you shout and point with one hand, holding a big bag emblazoned "taxes I done stole from the people" with the other. It worked! Now, the members from the other factions that are personally annoyed about taxes will come cull the lion faction down to a more manageable size. Bloody love a bit of politics, me!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The goal is Survive for five years (minutes) using as few speeches as possible, while stopping any faction growing to 30 members, at which point they'll give you the ol' rusty-pitchy-forky-bowelly, a famously terrible fate worth avoiding. As you watch from above, you'll see neutrals bumble through the town gates and eventually join factions. It's actually very fun just to watch them, but obviously you'll get forked up if you don't act.</p>
<p>I notice the frog faction getting too populous first, so I blame them for bandit attacks. Soon, their surplus members are but red stains, as tiny and insignificant as a speckled fart from the death throes of a ketchup bottle. It's actually quite intensive, too. I keep switching tabs to write notes and end up dying each time. The limited speech goal makes it, I think: you're always flittering around between the factions, doing little bits of math to work out where your rabble-rousing proclamations will be most effectively target. Also, just a brilliantly clever use of the first person - as noted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/molleindustria.org">‪Paolo Pedercini</a>‬, who brought this one to my attention. Enjoy!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Each year, the Game Developers Conference (GDC) release the results of their State Of The Game Industry Survey, which collects responses from over 3000 developers. The 13th annual survey - which you can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/pel5295n7j0on8zscomjh/AJPBdLSZVQYicWY6GHf1EyY?dl=0&amp;e=1&amp;preview=2025+GDC+State+of+the+Game+Industry+report.pdf&amp;rlkey=tr7vkhg7o0gqrib3odacggjpy&amp;st=5h2e5e2l">find in full here</a> - queries respondents on topics including layoffs, generative AI, the live service boom, and funding. As is the nature of our times, it's a big grim salad with a few bright crouton sprinklings. From the report's introduction, which does not mention croutons even once:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>It feels like the last 12 months have seen their share of fortune and heartbreak. Industry layoffs have continued, to the point where one in 10 developers say they’ve lost their jobs in the past year. More studios adopt Generative AI, even though it’s increasingly unpopular among developers. Working hours are going up, investment opportunities are shrinking, and recent severe weather events… are drawing attention to the growing impact of climate disasters.</p>
<p>But the game industry is resilient, as are its developers. PC development has skyrocketed, more studios are prioritizing game accessibility, unionization support holds steady, and Hollywood continues to see the value in adapting games for the big (and small) screen.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's rare to see a week pass where we don't hear about job losses in some form, but even so, that one in ten figure hits especially hard. Narrative roles were hit worst at 19%, compared to 6% working in business and finance. The most common reasons given were restructuring, declining revenue, and market shifts/industry trends. In last year's survey, 53% of respondents had not been impacted by layoffs, either personally or at the company they worked for. This year that number fell to 43%.</p>
<p>19% of developers told GDC that they were given "no reason" for layoffs at their company. "If you lost your job, have you been able to find a new one?" asked the survey for an 'in your words" section, which collects direct quotes from respondents. "The games industry is killing me," was one developer's reply. Otherwise, the survey doesn't contexualise these layoffs against figures of new hires in the same period, although there's possibly a throughline here between the 56% of developers that say they’ve invested money into their own games versus the 28% who have "publishing deals and project-based funding". </p><p>This climate of layoff fatigue is paired with a growing apathy towards generative AI tools, often touted as the industry's future. "Game development is supposed to be art and an expression of one’s imagination, not an AI-generated concept with no real thought process," reads the quote from a respondent that leads the section on Generative AI tools. A majority of developers (52%) surveyed said they worked at a company that uses such tools. 16% of respondents said their company has a policy against using generative AI tools, compared to 9% where their use was mandated.</p>
<p>Almost a third of respondents felt Gen AI was having a negative effect on the industry: 30%, up from 20% last year. 13% felt the impact was positive, down from 21%. "When asked to cite their specific concerns, developers pointed to intellectual property theft, energy consumption, the quality of AI-generated content, potential biases, and regulatory issues," reads the survey.</p>
<p>"When asked what applications they saw for the use of Generative AI in the game industry, developers pointed to tasks like coding assistance, concept art and 3D model generation, and automation of repetitive tasks (developers made similar suggestions in our 2024 survey)," reads the report. "But the word used most frequently in their responses was 'none'."</p>
<p>I should acknowledge that the rhetorical device they've used at the end there - paired with the above opening quote - is obviously very skewed on one side of the argument. Then again, it's also the side of the argument I'm on, and is therefore good. Objectivity is for little weenies.</p><p>There are a few positives thankfully, as the report highlights up top. "71% of developers think their company’s DEI and accessibility efforts have been at least slightly successful, while 51% feel the same way about their company’s sustainability efforts". Additionally, union support has remained consistent from last year, with 58% of respondents in favour - a figure that may go up, given that this was the first year since the survey began that the number of developers working 40 hours or less per week decreased.</p>
<p>PC development is also looking healthy, with 80% of developers surveyed currently making games for our lovely thinking tellies, up from 66% last year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As promised, S-Game has released a new gameplay trailer for Phantom Blade Zero. The studio had said it would release an trailer today to celebrate the Year of the Snake. In case you didn’t know, 2025 is the Year of the Snake in the Chinese and Japanese calendars.</p>



<p>Watch the video below:</p>

<iframe title="Phantom Blade Zero - Year of the Snake Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZX1k0z2pPY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Made in Unreal Engine 5, the visual quality of the game is impressive. The lighting and combat animations have definitely been given a hefty boost since the last trailer for the game.</p>



<p>Players are increasingly looking forward to Phantom Blade Zero. The game ended up being sponsored by PlayStation, which certainly helps to raise expectations for it. Phantom Blade Zero is a spiritual successor to Rainblood: Town of Death, a game created in RPG Maker.</p>



<p>Over the years, Rainblood became an IP called Phantom Blade, which has sold more than 20 million units. Now, S-Game is seeking its place in the AAA gaming ecosystem with this new venture.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-story-of-phantom-blade-zero">The story of Phantom Blade Zero</h2>



<p>Phantom Blade Zero will have a semi-open world and the story has already been revealed. Check out the synopsis below:</p>



<p><em>In Phantom Blade Zero, you are Soul, an elite assassin who serves an elusive but powerful organization known simply as “The Order”. He was framed for the murder of The Order’s patriarch and seriously injured in the ensuing hunt. A mystical healer managed to save him from death, but the impromptu cure only lasts 66 days. He must discover the mastermind behind it all before his time runs out, facing powerful enemies and inhuman monstrosities.</em></p>



<p>Kenji Tanigaki, the action director of the Samurai X films, acts as action director for Phantom Blade Zero. This alone explains how the moves are so acrobatic and realistic.</p>

Humanity creates forbidden biological weapons: Gears. Those Gears eventually stand against humanity in a rebellion. Although they manage to overcome in the struggle for <a title="Genres > Survival [370 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> known as the Crusades, humanity’s losses are so great that even after several decades pass, their emotional wounds remain unable to fully heal.

Even with the world at peace, it took many years for such a ceremony to come to fruition. Despite the complex array of emotions surrounding it, the wedding ceremony is met with blessings. When suddenly, a mysterious girl appears… The fated child inheriting Gear blood–and the mysterious girl who despises Gears. Their meeting would shake the world.</p><!-- AD: content -->

<p>There’s still a future for Mortal Kombat 1. In a <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1881825221369528644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">multi-post thread</a> on Twitter on Tuesday evening, Mortal Kombat created Ed Boon talked about the state of the game while quickly mentioning future DLC plans for Mortal Kombat 1.</p>



<p>First thing’s first, Boon announced that Mortal Kombat 1 has sold more than 5 million copies since its September 2023 launch. On top of that, the game continues to remain in the top 15 games on PlayStation 5 in terms of weekly active users.</p>



<p>Boon also mentioned the release of the game’s Conan the Barbarian DLC that launched on January 21 as the game’s 11th DLC fighter. A 12th fighter, the T-1000 Terminator, will be the next addition to the game’s roster.</p>



<p>As far as future fighters go, there has been a lot of rumors surrounding DLC wrapping up for the game after the lackluster sales of Kombat Pack 2 and the Khaos Reigns expansion. While Boon didn’t mention another Kombat Pack or story expansion specifically, he did say that there was more to come for players.</p>



<p>“With Conan getting into player’s hands, we are excited to keep trucking forward with future DLC,” he posted. </p>



<p>The end of Mortal Kombat 1 DLC began thanks to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known franchise leaker</a>. According to their claims, says that plans for Kombat Pack 3 and a second story was cancelled at NetherRealm studios. He did say, however, that it was possible for “a kameo or two” to be added to the game after Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 due to the work that had already been done. </p>



<p>NetherRealm hasn’t fully addressed those claims.</p>



<p>What do you think of more future Mortal Kombat 1 DLC being a hinted at? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> has announced another wave of price hikes across its various membership tiers - including a Premium subscription bump to $25 a month, among other things - but, for the time being at least, most European countries won't be affected by the charges.
</p>
<p>
The news comes as Netflix <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">celebrates its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history</a>, with 19m new customers having joined the streaming service in its most recent fourth quarter - something it attributes to a combination of live sports and original programming, including the second season of Squid Game, which has already amassed more than 165.7m views.
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, Netflix says it's expecting to generate higher than forecast revenue in 2025 - and that will, in part, be fuelled by a fresh round of price increases. These are specifically targeting the US, Canada, Portugal, and Argentina, coming into effect today.
</p>

<p>
"As we continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members," the streaming service wrote in its message to shareholders, "we will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can re-invest to further improve Netflix."
</p><p>
To that end, prices are rising across "most" plans. Netflix's ad-supported tier is increasing from $6.99 USD to $7.99 a month, while its standard ad-free subscription is getting a bump from $15.49 to $17.99 per month. And as for the streaming service's premium tier - currently the only way to watch its content in 4K - that'll rise from $22.99 to $24.99 a month.
</p>
<p>
For now, there's no word of price increases beyond the four currently announced countries, but - based on Netflix's previous behaviour - there's a fair chance it won't be too long before they come into effect across additional territories too.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/rip-eas-origin-launcher-we-knew-ye-all-too-well-unfortunately/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>After 14 years, EA will retire its controversial Origin game distribution app for Windows, the company<a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/"> announced</a>. Origin will stop working on April 17, 2025. Folks still using it will be directed to install the newer EA app, which launched in 2022.</p>
<p>The launch of Origin in 2011 was a flashpoint of controversy among gamers, as EA—already not a beloved company by this point—began pulling titles like<em> Crysis 2</em> from the popular Steam platform to drive players to its own launcher.</p>
<p>Frankly, it all made sense from EA's point of view. For a publisher that size, Valve had relatively little to offer in terms of services or tools, yet it was taking a big chunk of games' revenue. Why wouldn't EA want to get that money back?</p>
<p>The transition was a rough one, though, because it didn't make as much sense from the consumer's point of view. Players distrusted EA and had a lot of goodwill for Valve and Steam. Origin lacked features players liked on Steam, and old habits and social connections die hard. Plus, EA's use of Origin—a long-dead brand name tied to classic RPGs and other games of the '80s and '90s—for something like this felt to some like a slap in the face.</p>

                <p>Late last year, Microsoft signaled its plans to make Edge the preferred browser for PC gamers with the first look at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wants-edge-to-be-your-gaming-browser-with-edge-game-assist/1100-6528001/" data-ref-id="1100-6528001">Microsoft Edge Game Assist</a>. It's a version of Edge that was specifically made for gaming, with browsers and windows that appear on top of games so players can access strategy guides and tips as needed. Now, Microsoft Edge Game Assist is out of the initial testing phase and available for all to use.</p><p>Game Assist appears to have been modeled on Steam's overlay browser. It can also detect when a handful of supported games are being played and offer relevant info on a side panel. The games that are currently supported include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-rivals-review-i-can-do-this-all-day/1900-6418329/" data-ref-id="1900-6418329">Marvel Rivals</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. However, those aren't the only titles that can be played. Any game can be used in this mode, but only the supported games will have automatic guides readily available. The video below demonstrates how the Game Assist is supposed to work.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZadyqM7Gxs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NZadyqM7Gxs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players can access this feature by going to Microsoft Edge and opening up the Settings and more to find the Game Assist widget. Once installed, the Game Assist feature will be available in the Game Bar. Because the Game Assist shares date with Edge's browser data, players' favorites, browsing history, and cookies will all remain the same. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348858/microsoft-edge-game-assist-game-bar-browser" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Game Assist is still technically in a preview state and support for more titles will be added in the future. It's another facet of Microsoft's ongoing gaming ambitions, which include plans to bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-app-just-added-400-pc-games-and-microsoft-wants-more/1100-6528393/" data-ref-id="1100-6528393">all PC games with Xbox features into the Xbox app</a>. Late last year, Microsoft also launched a test pilot program for Game Pass Ultimate members <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-adds-a-nice-new-feature-but-only-for-testers-right-now/1100-6528390/" data-ref-id="1100-6528390">to stream some games they own</a> on Xbox consoles.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/in-defense-of-techwear.1088334/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span>Enfin levé</span><span>|</span><span><p>A photo from an Enfin levé release</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>As someone who has spent an embarrassing amount of money on clothes over the years, and as a result delved fairly deeply into some weird online communities surrounding them, I would like to use this website to mount a spirited defence of a fashion style I have long been very into, but which has lately fallen on some hard times. It's known as techwear.</p><p>Thanks to dropshippers, their social media ads, algorithms and just the outright misappropriation of the label over the years, many of you who have heard the word "techwear" as a passer-by probably associate it with a type of clothing that can best be described as landing somewhere on the design spectrum between Mall Ninja and a Tetsuya Nomura Character. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/8nmha7/is_anyone_else_into_techwear_fashion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Something like this Reddit thread</a>:</p><figure><figcaption>This ain't it</figcaption></figure><p>Think cargo pants with 17 pointless straps hanging off them, sci-fi face masks that look physically impossible to wear, jackets covered in big kanji characters. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=0b79686cda84ea15&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU1030AU1030&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIKT_mcy481Uule0HTkclsK_8dBHQg:1737093511795&amp;q=techwear&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J03RPjGV0MznOJ6Likin94pT_oR1DTSof42bOBxoTNxGMwEeUq17XDDUMegSIEO3KFroRcVZLfatAKBzHB2GC9DT8lE2xPXAjr-j38xxSTkMPHMlB-oQCnrLCflDrY1so-WFd_yuZCQztuM9KT0nCzigcsiQkoxVYxZIkz1iLkRqpOfohQ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi699jNifyKAxW4zjgGHac9JpoQtKgLegQIEhAB&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1271&amp;dpr=1.5#vhid=iy68AYf5F_ymKM&amp;vssid=mosaic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google "techwear" right now and the image results will give you page after page</a> of bad <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> cosplay, loads of kids dressing like they've been conscripted into a war against the machines.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="HOW TO DRESS #TECHWEAR" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g58kCABKy_I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But that's not techwear. Or at least it's not techwear as it was originally pioneered and intended. Techwear is, at its core, something much simpler. The most common definition--it doesn't have a wikipedia <em>or </em>dictionary entry!--tends to be something like<a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Techwear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> this Aesthetics Wiki post</a>, which says the trend "mostly grew out of a shared obsession with the craft and innovation of functional, durable, all-weather clothing".</p><p>Think clothes that look good, but are also packed with technology and innovative design expressed everywhere from materials to fabrics, which are often waterproof and/or windproof. Techwear normally also has design features like multiple pockets and cuts (like gusseted crotches) that allow for comfortable movement. In practical terms, techwear is supposed to be clothing that you can wear <em>anywhere</em>, in almost any conditions, from a rainy walk in the countryside to a train platform in the middle of winter to an office to a party.</p><p>Sounds great, right, or at least useful? That's how I got into it! Well, that's not strictly true: I first got into techwear when, having been a streetwear guy for most of my adult life,<a href="https://www.designboom.com/design/the-2014-nikelab-acg-collection-17-12-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in 2014 I saw the announcement for a new line called Nikelab ACG</a>, which blended Nikelab (Nike's premium fashion clothing) with ACG (the company's traditional label for rugged, outdoor gear). I was instantly in love with the whole thing. The futuristic look, the practicality, all of it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Nikelab ACG's 2014 debut brought techwear into the mainstream, and debuted pieces like this 2-in-1 system jacket that is still sought after today</span><span></span><span>Nike</span></figcaption></figure><p>I quickly learned why it was so good: it was a collaboration between Nike and Errolson Hugh, the co-founder of techwear pioneers Acronym, a label as famous for its cutting-edge fashion (and iconic pieces like<a href="https://www.grailed.com/drycleanonly/acronym-j1a-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the J1A jacket</a> and<a href="https://acrnm.com/P10-E_FW2122#a-image_12622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> P-10 pants</a>) as its exorbitant prices, which routinely run over $1000 for a single item. This Nikelab ACG stuff promised to be (relatively) more affordable, and over the next decade--with Acronym and other pricier techwear stuff out of reach--I collected as many pieces from the collection as I could. And while the aesthetics may have got me in the door, the practicality of having jackets with such useful pockets and trousers that had the pragmatism of cargo pants without the stigma kept me around.</p><p>Acronym isn't alone in the techwear space in charging lofty prices; other notable labels like<a href="https://enfinleve.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Enfin Leve</a>,<a href="https://arcteryx.com.au/collections/veilance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Veilance</a> and<a href="https://www.adidas.com.au/y_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Y3</a> are similarly priced, making them inaccessible to most people. That's why I went after the Nikelab ACG stuff so hard, and is also why I've spent much of the last decade lurking around online communities finding cheaper (and sometimes <em>much </em>cheaper) alternatives.</p><figure><figcaption><span>I picked up this ridiculously versatile Nikelab ACG trench around six years ago now, and I think it looks as good today as it did back in 2018</span><span></span><span>Nike</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of which there are loads. The scene might be somewhat famous for being expensive--all that tech and workmanship and, let's be real, exclusivity comes at a price--but you don't need to spend $1200 on a pair of cargo pants to get in on the action. There's plenty of technical crossover with other brands that will let you make use of loads of features and look good at a fraction of the price. Uniqlo has a ton of stuff that is surprisingly technical, for instance--<a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/au/en/products/E464024-000?colorCode=COL09&amp;sizeCode=SMA002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Blocktech Parka is almost a techwear cliche</a>, as is anything with the company's AIRism tech, up to and including the essential oversized tee.</p><p>A particular lower-priced favourite of some of us at Aftermath is<a href="https://www.orbitgear.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Indonesian label Orbitgear</a>, who are making stuff by hand from their studio in Jakarta and offering loads of amazing gear at much more affordable prices. Both myself and Chris Person have Orbitgear bags, and I just bought a <em>very </em>nice pair of shorts for $100 where a similar pair made by Acronym (albeit with slightly nicer fabric, of course) would have run me well over $600.</p><p>Making techwear even more versatile (and sometimes more affordable) is the way you can break it down into subgenres, or examine associated trends that sit pretty close to it on the venn diagram of fashion.<a href="https://www.grailed.com/drycleanonly/what-is-gorpcore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Gorpcore, a relatively current streetwear trend of dressing like you're about to go climb a mountain even though you're at the mall</a>, cuts very close to techwear because it often shares many of the same priorities, like space-age fabrics and climate versatility. Flagship gorpcore brands like Nike ACG, Salomon and Arcteryx are popular in the techwear scene.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Veilance is one of the few brands in the space with specific women's collections</span><span></span><span>Veilance</span></figcaption></figure><p>See also 'Grayman", a techwear subgenre that is particularly focused on visual simplicity and formality. Recognising that general techwear stuff like Acronym and Enfin Leve can sometimes go a little too hard on pockets and the tactical look, Grayman emphasises a cleaner look. <a href="https://www.tchwr.com/2019/11/22/low-key-high-tech-perfecting-the-grayman-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can find some examples here</a>, and while labels like Veilance feature heavily, once again you can find a lot of much cheaper alternatives at Uniqlo (basically any office clothing with "stretch" in the name).</p><p>Even activewear can take part. Lululemon stock a ton of technical clothing, especially their menswear section, which features stuff like<a href="https://www.lululemon.com.au/en-au/c/men/bottoms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> stretch pants for the office</a> and business shirts that feel and move more like soccer jerseys. I've also become a big fan of Australian cycling apparel brand MAAP, not because I'm a serious cyclist,<a href="https://maap.cc/collections/off-bike-man" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> but because their off-bike stuff has a great technical slant</a>, with lots of nice cuts, materials and practical benefits.</p><p>Techwear's appeal and versatility even goes beyond the real world. Errolson Hugh designed Adam Jensen's jacket in <em>Deus Ex</em>, for example,<a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/death-stranding-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> while also doing so much work on Kojima Productions' <em>Death Stranding</em> that he makes an appearance in the game</a> (and is reprising all this for the upcoming sequel). Ukrainian techwear label Riot Division worked on jacket design for <em>Ghostwire Tokyo</em>, and if you're a fan of <em>Mirror's Edge</em> and its sequel they're leaning <em>very </em>hard on the style.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...when we did clothing for Deus Ex and Death Stranding, we actually ended up designing the clothes as if they were real. We used the exact same process as we would for something we would actually manufacture. It just translates super easily.</p><cite>Errolson Hugh, <a href="https://bdgastore.com/blogs/blogdega/in-conversation-with-errolson-hugh">Bodega</a></cite></blockquote></figure><p>I love these clothes. I love the knowledge that I can put something on in the morning and know I'll be able to wear it wherever I go that day and whatever the weather. I love the fact that so many of the most famous brands and their pieces are almost timeless, meaning I can buy something in 2015 and it still looks incredible in 2025 (which is especially useful when you spend $400 on pants, you want to get some use out of them!).</p><p>I think it sucks that the term “techwear” has gotten so lost in the wash; not only does most of the stuff being labelled or known colloquially as "techwear" these days actually<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-is-warcore-streetwear-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> belong to a style known as "warcore"</a>, but because most of it is fast fashion junk that has no technical benefit whatsoever, as it's missing everything from waterproofing to breathable fabrics. The whole point of the word is that it's supposed to be technical!</p><p>Things have gotten so bad that I'm almost embarrassed to say I'm into techwear when I'm among people who don't know what it actually is. An example: we had a Kotaku meeting a few years back where I said I liked it out loud, and people <em>laughed at me</em> because they were picturing me, a man in my 40s, wearing a pair of pants with straps hanging between the crotch and waving a lightsaber around. To be fair that <em>is</em> very funny, but also wholly inaccurate, hence this spirited defence!</p><p>I'm not saying you need to dress like this, or even try it out. I just wanted to use my website to set a little record straight, say that it's nice to own nice clothes that do lots of things at once, and that I should be able to talk about that without people thinking I'm an extra in<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Ends_with_You" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>The World Ends With You</em></a>.</p><p>Though if you <em>do </em>want to learn more about it, or even just see some cool examples of the style in action in the real world and not as a stereotype,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/neogrotesk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Sam Sundberg has a <em>great </em>Instagram account</a>, as does<a href="https://www.instagram.com/bluekros/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> bluekros</a>, and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC-X1H9W7II" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Antwon's YouTube channel is also invaluable</a>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Hideo Kojima modelling a very technical Arconym jacket released in 2024 as a collab with Death Stranding 2</span><span></span><span>Acronym</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-hamlet-review"><h3>Grand Theft Hamlet Is A Funny, Touching Take On Shakespeare</h3></a><p>‘We’re putting on a play inside a game, but the game is a kind of play, because we’re playing’</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Netflix announced it will charge users anywhere from $12 to $24 more a year depending on their subscription tier. Even viewers who are already watching ads will have to pay more to see their favorite shows. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193799" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Netflix's Junji Ito Anime Fails To Break The Terrible Horror Adaptation Curse" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="126" data-playlist="193799,195369,193739" data-current="193799"><div><p>Netflix's Junji Ito Anime Fails To Break The Terrible Horror Adaptation Curse</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193799/193799_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193799/193799_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193799/193799_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193799/193799_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19252.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced the price hikes</a></span> alongside its latest earnings call which revealed there are more than 300 million subscribers to the streaming platform across the globe, including 19 million more users in the last quarter alone. Now they’ll all be greeted by a higher monthly price tag the next time they renew.</p><p> Here are the price changes for each of the plan tiers:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Standard with ads: from $7 a month to $8</li><li>Standard (no ads): from $15.50 to $18 </li><li>Premium (4K streaming): from $23 to $25</li></ul><p>“As we continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members, we will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can re-invest to further improve Netflix,” the company wrote in its latest earnings report. This is the second time the company’s raised prices in recent years. In 2023, Netflix bumped the discontinued Basic plan from $10 to $12 and the Premium plan from $20 to $23. </p><p>Tuesday’s announcement, however, marks the first time Netflix has increased the price of the ad-supported tier since it was introduced in November 2022. The more streaming changes, the more it turns back into regular, pricey old cable TV. The price hikes come after the launch of <em>Squid Game</em> season 2 and a live boxing match between influencer Jake Paul and former heavy weight champion Mike Tyson. Season 5 of <em>Stranger Things</em>, meanwhile, is likely headed to Netflix sometime later in 2025. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
