<p>The notes don't go into too much more detail than that, though, as you can see the whole list of patch notes below:</p><h2>Patch contents</h2><ul><li>Improved handling of playable characters</li><li>Soundtrack addition and adjustments</li><li>Text adjustments</li><li>Balance adjustments</li><li>Added character scenarios</li><li>Bug fixes</li></ul><p>These patch notes also came with some warnings about the PC version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>. There is an issue where the game won't boot up on PC. However, this can be resolved by opening the Properties menu for Elden Ring Nightreign from your Steam library, navigating to the Installed Files submenu, and selecting the Verify Integrity of Game Files option.</p><p>Then, once the game is booted up, some PCs "using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops." Bandai Namco has not clarified which graphics cards in particular are affected or how severe the frame rate drops are, but says it is "currently investigating the cause." It's recommended that players set the graphics settings to Medium or Low and install the latest graphics-card drivers to avoid these performance issues in the interim.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches today for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

Ahead of its launch, publisher Bandai Namco has released a new trailer for the game that is a must-watch (probably not for a reason you can guess).</p><p>Titled "Bring Me To Life Trailer," this Nightreign trailer utilizes Evanescence’s popular song, "Bring Me To Life," to great effect to create something that’s more like an AMV (anime music video) or something you’d see on VH1 or MTV in the early 2000s. Perhaps it’s because I’m a millennial (born in 1995, so just barely), but this trailer just feels right.</p><p><strong>You can check it out for yourself below:</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ot6j_qqYQaM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ot6j_qqYQaM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>If you’ve been watching Nathan Fielder’s <em>The Rehearsal</em> on HBO after <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-feature/2025/05/11/equal-parts-boring-and-intense-visiting-the-set-of-the-last-of-us"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> finishes up on Sunday nights, you might have already had “Bring Me To Life” on your mind for reasons I won’t spoil here – you should watch <em>The Rehearsal</em> if you aren’t already. While it was fun to imagine Fielder had something to do with this trailer’s existence, a Bandai Namco source confirmed that’s not the case.</p><p>While waiting for the game to download, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Elden Ring Nightreign review</a> to find out why I gave the game an 8 out of 10.</p><hr><p><em>Are you picking up Nightreign tomorrow?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/28/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-its-developer-cliffhanger-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>EA has shuttered Cliffhanger Games and canceled the team’s upcoming Black Panther game. This marks the third round of layoffs at the publisher this year.</p><p>Black Panther was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/07/10/black-panther-game-announced-by-ea">first announced</a> to be in development in July 2023 as part of a three-game partnership between EA and Marvel. The first game revealed for that initiative is an upcoming <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/09/20/motive-studio-announces-single-player-iron-man-game-as-first-part-of-new-eamarvel">Iron Man title</a> developed by Motive Studios, the team behind the 2023 Dead Space remake and Star Wars Squadrons. Black Panther was the second title; the third game has yet to be announced.</p><p>EA formed the Seattle-based Cliffhanger Games to develop Black Panther. At the time of its reveal, Black Panther was very early in development; Cliffhanger was still hiring staff. Because of this, we know very little about what the game would have been beyond what Cliffhanger described at the time as a “single-player story-driven third-person action-adventure game.” It also would have been the character's first solo starring role in a video game, having previously appeared in supporting roles.</p><p>In an unfortunate twist of fate, Cliffhanger was led by Kevin Stephens, formerly of Monolith Productions. Cliffhanger’s staff also partly consisted of former Monolith talent who worked on Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Monolith Productions was shut down by Warner Bros. in February and had its own superhero game, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2021/2021/12/09/monolith-open-world-wonder-woman-game-in-the-works">Wonder Woman</a>, canceled.</p>

</article>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-studios"><em>IGN</em></a> reports that Cliffhanger’s staff were informed of the shutdown via an email from EA Entertainment president Laura Miele. She explained that the closure was part of EA’s larger goal to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities” as the publisher aims to focus on developing a small batch of franchises: Battlefield, Apex Legends, The Sims, and Skate. Despite this initiative, Miele’s email also states that Motive’s Iron Man, Respawn’s third Star Wars Jedi game, and BioWare’s next Mass Effect title will remain in production. EA Sports, which is a separate division from EA Entertainment, is also said to be unaffected by today's events.&nbsp;</p><p>Employees working in EA’s mobile and central teams were also impacted. Miele states EA will work to find new positions for affected employees in other parts of the company. It is unclear exactly how many employees have lost their jobs, though <em>IGN </em>believes the number is less than 300.</p><p>This news follows the round of layoffs that hit the publisher last April, which included 100 employees at <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/30/update-respawn-suffers-layoffs-amid-team-adjustments-cancels-two-early-projects">Respawn Entertainment</a>. This resulted in the cancellation of incubation projects that included a Titanfall title. BioWare also saw layoffs in January due to a restructuring aimed at focusing all resources on developing the next Mass Effect. In February 2024, EA laid off <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/02/28/ea-lays-off-670-employees-cancels-respawns-star-wars-fps">over 650 employees</a> and canceled an upcoming Star Wars first-person shooter by Respawn. That particular round of layoffs saw CEO Andrew Wilson state that the publisher was “moving away from the development of future licensed IP that we do not believe will be successful in our changing industry.” &nbsp;</p><p>Black Panther fans now only have <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/20/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-is-skydances-captain-americablack-panther-game-arriving-next">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> to look forward to. Developed by Skydance New Media and led by former Uncharted creative lead Amy Hennig, it stars Captain America and Black Panther Azzuri, the grandfather of T’Challa, alongside a soldier and a Wakandan spy, battling Hydra during World War II. That title was recently <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/13/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-to-early-2026-to-add-more-polish">delayed to 2026</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/676167/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-test-hands-on<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>I don’t want gaming to become another streaming subscription service that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23901586/streaming-service-prices-netflix-disney-hulu-peacock-max">keeps going up in price</a>. I don’t want to put even more power in Nvidia’s hands, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/672637/nvidia-rtx-5060-review-meddling-gamersnexus-wake-up-call">particularly not right now</a>.</p></div><p>But I can’t deny that the company’s $20-a-month* GeForce Now is a near-perfect fit for the Steam Deck. I’ve been covering cloud gaming for 15 years, and this is the very first time I’ve wanted to keep playing indefinitely.</p><div><div><p id="what-is-geforce-now"><h2><strong>What is GeForce Now?</strong></h2></p></div><p>For the uninitiated, Nvidia’s GeForce Now is a game streaming service that farms the graphical processing power out to the cloud. Instead of controlling a game running locally on your Steam Deck’s chip, you’re effectively remote-controlling an RTX 4080-powered* gaming rig in a server farm many miles away, which you sync with your existing Steam, Epic, Ubisoft, Xbox, and Battle.net accounts to access your games and savegames from the cloud.</p><p>*Nvidia’s GeForce Now also technically has a free tier, and a “Performance” tier, but I recommend you ignore both. For me, it was the difference between playing many games through a clean window or a dirty window, the difference between playing <em>Alan Wake II</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> with full ray tracing or none at all, the difference between comfortably stretching to 4K or not.</p></div><p>Handhelds have already become my favorite way to play games. The Steam Deck is comfortable and easy to pick up whenever and wherever the mood strikes. But neither my Deck nor my aging desktop PC have kept up with the latest titles. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> can look like a fuzzy mess on a Deck, and I’ve never seen <em>Alan Wake II</em>, <em>Portal RTX</em> and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> in all their ray-traced glory on my RTX 3060 Ti desktop.</p><p>But today, with Nvidia’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce-now%2Fdownload%2F" rel="sponsored">just-now-released GeForce Now app</a> for the Steam Deck, I can play every one of those titles at near-max settings, anywhere in my home, for hours and hours on a charge. And if I dock that Steam Deck to my 4K TV, it can output 4K60 HDR and/or ray-traced graphics that put <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">the PS5 Pro</a> to shame.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23561989/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-4080-price-reflex-hands-on-cloud-gaming">When we tested GeForce Now’s last big upgrade in 2023</a>, Tom and I agreed it wasn’t <em>quite</em> on par with playing on a native PC.</p></div><p>But on a Steam Deck, where I’m either playing on a low-res handheld screen or sitting across the room from a TV where I don’t notice so many imperfections, it can feel like the best of both worlds.</p><p>Here’s what <em>Expedition 33 </em>looks like running natively on my Steam Deck today, versus the Deck with GeForce Now:</p><p>The best part might be this: while handhelds like the Steam Deck barely get two hours of such a game at potato graphical settings, I could get 7 to 8 hours of GeForce Now. I saw the cloud gaming service consistently sip under 7 watts from my Steam Deck OLED’s 49.2 watt-hour battery, barely more than the system consumes at idle.</p><p>And the new native app makes it a cinch to set up, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147034/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-script-install">no more web browser-and-script workaround</a>: just hold down the power button and switch to desktop mode, download the app, run it, and scan QR codes with your phone to link your various accounts.</p><p>Oh, you’d best believe there are caveats. Giant gaping gotchas galore, which I’ll explain as we go. But after testing the service for nearly two weeks, I’m starting to believe in cloud gaming again.</p><p>Now, you might be wondering: how the heck am I playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/667900/doom-the-dark-ages-clair-obscur-expedition-33-parry-season">a game where timing is so critical</a> via remote control? Here’s the first big caveat: you need a low-latency internet connection, a good Wi-Fi router or wired ethernet, and you need to be within range of Nvidia’s servers for the magic to work. Download speed isn’t as key: 50Mbps should suffice for 4K, and you can get away with less.</p><p>But I’m armed with a AT&amp;T Fiber connection, and I live maybe 30 minutes away from Nvidia’s San Jose, California servers, which makes me a best-case scenario for this tech. Still, Nvidia has over 35 worldwide data centers now, including 14 distinct locations in the United States, and my colleagues with Xfinity and Spectrum cable internet in Portland and Brooklyn tell me <em>Expedition 33</em> played just as well for them.</p><p>“The latency was negligible to the point that I wasn’t missing parries,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner">Cameron Faulkner tells me</a>, saying he nailed the Sad Troubadour on the first try. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> and I found we needed to adjust our timing a bit, but I wound up playing roughly half the game over GeForce Now and almost never looked back.</p><p>Even with the best of connections, though, GeForce Now isn’t bulletproof. Once or twice a day, my seemingly stable gameplay session would at least briefly unravel into a choppy mess.</p><p>In single-player games like <em>Expedition 33</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> I could easily forgive a few minutes of trouble, but my colleagues <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio Di Benedetto</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/erick-gomez">Erick Gomez</a> saw it in otherwise stable twitch shooters where lag could be a bigger issue. “I saw a handful of lag spikes / hiccups that would definitely screw anybody over in a competitive shooter, but thankfully they weren’t at the worst times and they soon subsided,” Antonio tells me.</p><p>You also give up some of the Steam Deck’s portability. While you can plug and unplug the Steam Deck from a TV dock and seamlessly switch between big screen and small screen play, you can’t just put the Steam Deck to sleep without ending the session and losing unsaved progress. (Unlike, say, <a href="https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki-ng">Chiaki.</a>) And although the native GeForce Now app supports 4K60, a big leap up from 1440p, you may find yourself squinting at tiny text because it doesn’t scale the UI appropriately.</p><p>Speaking of portability, public Wi-Fi generally isn’t good enough for GeForce Now, and neither are most cellular connections — even with four bars of Verizon 5G UWB service and a wired USB tether to my phone, my stream quickly deteriorated into the jumble you see below. Only the very best cellular connection in my entire neighborhood, a spot right under a 5G tower where I can get 1,200Mbps down and 30 millisecond ping, felt playable to me.</p><p>You may have noticed an asterisk* or two earlier in this story, back when I said I was testing a $20-a-month service that gives you the power of a GeForce RTX 4080. That’s because Nvidia’s GeForce Now also technically has a free tier, and a “Performance” tier, and I highly recommend you ignore both of them, even just playing on a Steam Deck, because they’re dramatically subpar.</p><p>For me, it was the difference between playing <em>Expedition 33</em> through a clean window, or a dirty window. (Epic spec, native resolution, vs. Medium spec, 50 percent resolution with DLSS). It’s the difference between playing <em>Alan Wake II</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> on the Deck’s screen with full ray tracing, or none at all and some graphical compromises to boot. It’s the difference between comfortably stretching to 4K with some DLSS tricks, or not.</p><p>But the biggest caveat with GeForce Now may be outside the company’s control: you have to bring your own games, and yet you only can bring games where Nvidia has explicitly struck a distribution deal.</p><p>Nvidia has made progress: 165 of my 457 Steam games are now available to play, up from 85 two years ago. The company offers over 2,100 games in total across Epic, Battle.net, Ubisoft, Xbox, and GOG too. But Nvidia has no games from Sony, so I’m not playing <em>Helldivers 2</em>, no games from Rockstar, so I’m not playing <em>GTA V </em>or <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, and no <em>Elden Ring</em>, no <em>PUBG</em>, no <em>Schedule I</em> or <em>Football Manager</em> or <em>FIFA</em> or <em>NBA</em> or <em>The Sims.</em> We never quite know which games GeForce Now will get, or when, or if they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21168645/nvidia-geforce-now-2k-games-titles-bioshock-borderlands">might disappear</a>.</p><p>Cloud gaming has never felt like a better deal, now that the service has matured, now that handhelds can make such good use of it, and now that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/656783/gpu-prices-are-out-of-control-again">buying your own GPU is such a ridiculously expensive proposition</a>. Maybe I’ll defer my own next GPU upgrade in favor of a subscription.</p><p>But it’s not for everyone — you should definitely try a $8 GeForce Now Ultimate day pass first — and there’s still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547334/cloud-gaming-xbox-xcloud-microsoft-streaming-google-stadia-amazon">a lot of mental friction</a>. I’m not looking forward to the day that Nvidia <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24289443/nvidia-geforce-now-monthly-playtime-caps-performance-membership-1440p">alters the deal further</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’re doing everything we can to support them — including finding opportunities within EA, where we’ve had success helping people land in new roles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the news, EA staff and others who worked on the game took to social media to wave goodbye to Black Panther, and call on other companies to snap up developers affected by the studio closure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was a part of this incredible crew,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kortizart.bsky.social/post/3lqawcpmp222v" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said concept artist Karla Ortiz</a>. “We were working on such an amazing and stunning game.

What a sad day.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ortiz continued: "... every dev there wanted so badly to release the game. It was beautiful and such great care was given.” “We were so excited to show the world! It was truly special.” Then: “All I can say is that we had something phenomenal.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Senior Environment Architect II, Freddie Lee, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stringerseven.bsky.social/post/3lqbar2qlgk2m" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>: “Welp this happened today. It has to be said that during my short time there, I've had the honor and pleasure to work with people like Karla who's art inspired myself and the team, and also instilling confidence and growth into my professional artwork. This team was, and is GOAT.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: "took us by complete surprise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game designer Sophie Mallinson <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sophmallinson.bsky.social/post/3lqavusellk2g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>: “this is a ✧˖° dream team °˖✧ and you should snap up anyone who was working on this project. So sad that we might not ever get to see a black panther ARPG developed by the creators of the Nemesis System!!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ex-Respawn developer Rayme Vinson, now principal technical designer at Gravity Well, also touched on the game Black Panther might have been, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rayme.bsky.social/post/3lqavykwesk2d" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>: “When they shut down the Star Wars FPS, we got to see this game up close and talk to their dev team, because they could take on some of our folks. What they were building was ambitious and special and I was legitimately excited to play it someday, even if they'd only done 1/4 of what they planned.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patrick Wren, senior encounter design on Jedi Survivor at Respawn, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/witdarkstar.bsky.social/post/3lqaui6cjp22t" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simply said</a>: “Morale has been at an all-time low. I can say that much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These cuts come hot on the heels of multiple other rounds of layoffs and cancelations at EA over the last few years and especially in 2025. Just last month, EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn"><u>laid off roughly 300 individuals</u></a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-around-100-employees-impacted"><u>around 100 at Respawn, while canceling an in-development Titanfall game and another incubation project</u></a>. Earlier this year, EA restructured BioWare, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams"><u>moving some developers to other projects</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect"><u>laying off others</u></a>. In 2024, there was a massive restructuring at EA that resulted in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work"><u>670 workers</u></a> laid off company-wide, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-hit-by-layoffs-amid-eas-ongoing-reductions"><u>around two dozen workers at Respawn.</u></a> And in 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs"><u>50 jobs were cut at BioWare</u></a> and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-developer-codemasters-suffers-round-of-layoffs"><u>unknown number were cut at Codemasters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA is now focusing on a small handful of franchises: Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and Apex Legends. It insisted it will continue with its Iron Man game at Motive and the third Star Wars: Jedi game, as well as maintain its mobile business, while Bioware works on the next Mass Effect.

			<p>NVIDIA announced today that the GeForce NOW native Steam Deck application, previously announced at CES 2025, is now <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for download</a>.</p>
<p>It was already possible to run GeForce NOW on the Steam Deck via the built-in browser. However, that wasn't an optimal solution. Even the installation has been streamlined, as users can just download the app from the official website and follow the instructions to install it on their portable device. NVIDIA says that playing a game via its cloud gaming platform can consume up to 50% less battery life compared to running the same game natively on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>GeForce NOW on the Steam Deck supports streaming at up to 1440p 120 FPS when connected to a<br>
monitor or 4K 60 FPS when connected to a TV. NVIDIA will further improve the GeForce NOW<br>
streaming experience and is looking to add new features, including support for 90 FPS in a future update.</p>
<p>HDR10 is supported on GeForce NOW for premium members (those subscribed to the Ultimate or Performance tier). It works when using the Steam Deck in handheld mode (provided that you've got a <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-oled-announced-reservations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Deck OLED</a>, since the original model does not support HDR10) or when connected to a TV or monitor. Of course, if you're subscribed to those tiers, you'll also enjoy RTX features such as ray tracing/path tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4, and Reflex on supported games.</p>
<p>Speaking of games, today's GeForce NOW Thursday also reveals six new PC games to the ever-growing GeForce NOW library:</p>
<p>● Nice Day for Fishing (New release on Steam, May 29)<br>
● Cash Cleaner Simulator (Steam)<br>
● Tokyo Xtreme Racer (Steam)<br>
● The Last Spell (Steam)<br>
● Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon (Steam)<br>
● Torque Drift 2 (Epic Games Store)</p>

                <p>Doom: The Dark Ages launched earlier this month, and if you've already finished the Doom Slayer's prequel journey through Hell and a bizarre cosmic dimension, you don't have to stop ripping and/or tearing just yet. Bethesda and Kramer Guitars have partnered to create three guitars based on the game, and they're every bit as flashy and intense as the Slayer--but you'll have to be lucky to get one. </p><p>The three guitars, which appear to be functionally identical and sport different Doom-related visual designs, are classic Kramer, featuring a Floyd Rose bridge and a single humbucker. The brand was well known in the '80s for its shred-friendly axes, and the aesthetic certainly pairs well with a game as violent and over the top as Doom. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4503506-doom-kramer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503506" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4503506-doom-kramer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503506"></a><figcaption>Glowing eyes not included</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4503506-doom-kramer.jpg"></figure><p>"The unique designs were carefully applied with multiple layers of paint across several weeks, and each focus on one of the powerful weapons in your arsenal: the Atlan, Serrat the Dragon, and the Doom Slayer himself," reads the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/29/doom-kramer-guitars-giveaway/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official announcement</a>. They were created by illustrator Luke Preece, whose other work includes Gears of War: E-Day and art for bands like blink-182 and Metallica. </p><p>Now comes the bittersweet part: You can't buy these guitars. Instead, Xbox will be giving them away via its Instagram accounts, with residents from the US, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands eligible to win. Alongside the three guitars, you can win a copy of Doom: The Dark Ages, the game's collector's edition, or special-edition Xbox controllers. </p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages is a great addition to the legendary series, focusing on brutal counter-attacks and close-quarters chaos. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/" data-ref-id="1900-6418361">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>, Alessandro Barbosa called it "a finally tuned adventure that delivers the power fantasy of ripping and tearing through thousands of demons without losing an underlying complexity that makes each encounter engaging to blast through."

            <p>The Ukrainian government-run Center for Countering Disinformation have <a href="https://cpd.gov.ua/en/results/rf-en/how-russia-militarizes-youth-through-computer-games/%22%22">released a warning</a> about a new free-to-play shooter, Squad 22: ZOV, which they say is a blaring propaganda instrument for the Russian military that "mythologises" the country's invasion and bombardment of Ukraine since 2022. The accusation actually dates back to February this year, but it has resurfaced and picked up pace online now that Squad 22 is actually on sale via Steam. Valve have yet to comment. </p> <!--more-->
<p>Squad 22: ZOV certainly makes no secret of its affiliations. According to the Steam page, it's "designed with insights from Russian veterans and active soldiers" and "is officially recommended by the Russian Military for use as a basic infantry tactic manual for cadet and Yunarmy training" - Yunarmy being short for Russia's state-funded Young Army Cadets National Movement. </p>
<p>On the <a href="https://squad22.online/gameteam/">official website</a>, it's further described as being "developed with information support by The Main Military-Political Directorate of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation". Developers SPN Studio cite several military consultants, including a soldier who fought in the "SMO region" between 2014 and 2024 -  SMO being short for "Special Military Operation", the Putin regime's cute little safeword for their perverse and stupid invasion, which has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths on both sides.</p>
<p>The developers have responded to the accusations of being stooges for the Russian military on <a href="https://x.com/AlexanderT68010">Xitter</a>. They appear to be enjoying the adverse reaction, predictably describing it as "free marketing" and inviting people to "put our team on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrotvorets">Mirotvorets</a>", the online repository of "enemies of Ukraine" set up by Ukrainian politician Georgy Tuka back in 2014. They also post a fair bit in support of Russia's assault. Of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent declaration that Ukraine has no plans to capitulate to Russia, the developers comment snidely: "meaning, we will have a lot of content to make more missions in our game".</p>
<p>All of which makes me wonder what, exactly, Valve's policy is towards naked state-backed propaganda games on Steam, of which there are more than a few. According to the developer Twitter feed, Squad 22: ZOV <a href="https://x.com/AlexanderT68010/status/1922915188577030147">passed Steam moderation on 15th May</a>. For all the bragging about Russian heroism on social media, the game's creators strike a timid stance on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3573040/Squad_22_ZOV/">the Steam page</a>, promising only to "delve into the complexities of the 2014 and 2022-2024 events" and "gain insight into the perspectives of those who lived through these periods, understanding how these events shaped their lives and opinions". I wonder how much, if at all, they had to tweak that wording to satisfy Valve's moderators.</p>
<p>Valve don't explicitly prohibit state-sponsored propaganda on their <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/steamdirect/">Steamworks submission page</a>, though they do prohibit hate speech, "libelous or defamatory statements", "content that violates the laws of any jurisdiction in which it will be available", and "content that is patently offensive or intended to shock or disgust viewers". If they did ban games that explicitly advance the interests of national militaries, they presumably would have taken down the page for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/203290/Americas_Army_Proving_Grounds/">America's Army: Proving Grounds</a> - the official FPS of the US Army, live on Steam since 2015 - and possibly also Pandemic's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4520/Full_Spectrum_Warrior/">Full Spectrum Warrior</a>, a 2004 tactics game which describes the U.S. Army as "the most powerful ground force in the entire world" and began life as a military training aid.</p>
<p>I make those last comparisons not for the sake of some whatabouttery argument that every side is as bad as the other - amongst the hairs we might split, neither <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/full-spectrum-warrior">Full Spectrum Warrior</a> nor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/americas-army-proving-grounds">America's Army: Proving Grounds</a> is explicitly set in an on-going war, with the prospect of DLC obnoxiously riding on the delaying of a peace settlement - but simply as a reminder that connections between military organisations and the video games industry run deep. Squad 22: ZOV is a real piece of work, but it's far from an anomaly.</p>
<p>I've emailed Valve for comment and will update this piece as and when I receive one. In the meantime, perhaps you'd like to play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2362070/Hollow_Home/">the demo for Hollow Home</a>, a Ukrainian-made RPG about the occupation of Mariupol, or check out Frogwares' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sinking-city-remastered-gets-a-surprise-launch-with-a-50-discount-on-steam">recent remaster of The Sinking City</a>, or have a browse of <a href="https://indiecup.net/">the winning entries to last week's Indie Cup Ukraine competition</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/27/russian-army-backed-military-propaganda-game-squad-22-zov-listed-on-steam">Game Informer</a> for passing this on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-tactical-takedown-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> came out last week and, being a turn-based tactics game, <a href="https://aftermath.site/strategy-game-turn-based-tactics-movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I was both personally and professionally obligated</a> to try it out.</p><p>How does a series based on <em>TMNT</em>, which famously features loads of melee combat against hordes of shitty enemies, work in a tactics game, a genre usually known for cover, guns and careful planning? It embraces the chaos, asking you to take control of turn-based ninja turtles and spend a whole level running around slashing and smashing things.</p><p>To make things a little spicier than just an endless grind of close-quarters combat, <em>Tactical Takedown</em> has what I can best describe as a continually collapsing landscape, where sections of the map will disappear while others appear ahead of you. It's important to note that the game does this regardless of where you are; you don't trigger the collapse, it just happens to you in the middle of a fight, with the idea (I assume) being it continually ushers you through a level as though you were flying through a stage<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(arcade_game)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> from Konami's classic 1989 beat-em-up</a>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S0Ab1XckSRM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It makes the game breathless in its own turn-based way, as you can never just bunker down behind cover and get in a leisurely shootout. Since you're always taking damage (it's melee combat against a <em>lot </em>of bad guys, you can't avoid it) you have to always be moving to kill enemies and always be jumping to grab health items and always be thinking and always worrying about the impending collapse of the tiles you're currently standing on. I dig the idea! Any attempt to try something fresh with an established genre like this should be applauded, because as you might expect given how many turn-based games are called "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=xcom+like&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU1030AU1030&amp;oq=xcom+like&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIMCAEQIxgnGIAEGIoFMgwIAhAjGCcYgAQYigUyEwgDEC4YgwEYxwEYsQMY0QMYgAQyDQgEEAAYgwEYsQMYgAQyEwgFEC4YgwEYxwEYsQMY0QMYgAQyCggGEAAYsQMYgAQyDQgHEAAYgwEYsQMYgAQyEwgIEC4YgwEYxwEYsQMY0QMYgAQyCggJEAAYsQMYgATSAQgxMDgzajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XCOM-like</a>", innovation can sometimes be in short supply.</p><p>In this particular game's case, though...this is not what I play these kinds of games for. I am a languid gamer, an enjoyer of turn-based games for the serenity and contemplation they allow, and the amount of stuff <em>Tactical Takedown</em> was throwing in my face the entire time was just too much, too damn stressful. It often felt overwhelming in ways that I am actively trying to avoid with this genre, yet which in turn felt wasted on a game where everyone had to wait their turn instead of just <em>going at it</em>. </p><p>Not helping things are a lack of variety once the game's basics are laid out to you in the first couple of levels, and a few too many cut corners in terms of presentation. I'm not demanding AAA standards from my low-fi tactics games, but for something with a half-decent license, and which is drawing inspiration from one of the best-looking video games of the late 80s, the static visuals--the game looks more like a tabletop experience, with animation in short supply--were a little disappointing.</p><p>I get the design lure of bringing one game or genre's vibe into another--<a href="https://stonehandgames.com/the-great-air-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I've literally done this myself!</a>--and appreciate there may be many others who are far less precious about their genre expectations than I, but for me, here, the two just weren't a great fit, no mater how interesting the foundational idea might have been.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs"><h3>Another Day, Another Round Of Layoffs At EA</h3></a><p>Black Panther is canceled, and workers (once again) suffer the consequences</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-good"><h3>Parrying Is The Best Thing In Video Games</h3></a><p>Everybody’s gangsta until somebody parries your bullshit</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new game was released yesterday on Steam depicting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, claiming to be "officially recommended by the Russian Military".</p>
<p>The free-to-play Squad 22: ZOV is a tactical shooter from developer SPN Studio and publisher Zarobana Entertainment and is the only release from either company.</p>
<p>The game has been widely reported as Russian propaganda, raising questions on how it's been allowed on Valve's Steam platform.</p>
<p>According to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3573040/Squad_22_ZOV/">Steam description</a>, it allows players to experience the "complexities of the 2014 and 2022-2024 events through compelling campaigns". In 2014, President Putin signed the Crimea annexation, while 2022-2024 refers to the country's invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>While the game purports to be historically accurate through its basis on "people's experience and opinions during specific historical conflicts", it has also been "officially recommended by the Russian Military for use as a basic infantry tactic manual for cadet and Yunarmy training".</p>
<p>The modern Yunarmy, or the Young Army Cadets National Movement, was set up in 2015 by Putin to encourage young people to join the military. Now it appears officially recommending video games is part of this process. As shared on the game's website, Squad 22: ZOV was <a href="https://squad22.online/army2024/">exhibited at the Army 2024 event</a>.</p>
<p>The game's website also <a href="https://squad22.online/gameteam/">boasts special military consultants</a>, including "Hero of the Russian Federation" Vlad Golovin who commanded a platoon in the siege of Mariupol. This is included as a playable mission in the game, as well as the Russian Spring of 2014.</p>
<p>The ZOV in the title refers to the use of these letters on military equipment to show support for the invasion.</p>
<p>The game also allows players to "rescue hostages" and "capture prisoners", presumably from a Russian perspective, as well as "encounter and interact with civilians".</p>
<p>Incidentally, the developer has also admitted on the Steam page to using AI "as a base for work of our 2D artists and later drawn-over in order to make them genuine art".</p>
<p>Sources told Eurogamer the game presents players as Russian soldiers "liberating" real-life Ukrainian territories, adding the free-to-play game also includes paid content for specific campaigns. That means Valve is financially enabling a military-affiliated project, though it's unclear if the Russian Military is being indirectly funded through the developer's affiliation with the organisation.</p>
<p>The Steam page itself has become a hub for coordinated propaganda and hate speech. The game has a "mixed" reaction on the platform and recent reviews are predominantly negative, but older positive reviews include pro-Russian sentiment and disturbing comments.</p>
<p>A social media account linked on Steam to the game's developer includes a post suggesting Ukraine's refusal to surrender will provide "a lot of content to make more missions in our game" (thanks <a href="https://simulationdaily.com/news/steam-russian-military-propaganda-game/">Simulation Daily</a>).</p>
<p>Further, as spotted by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/27/russian-army-backed-military-propaganda-game-squad-22-zov-listed-on-steam">Game Informer</a>, the <a href="https://cpd.gov.ua/en/results/how-russia-militarizes-society-through-computer-games/">Ukrainian Centre for Countering Disinformation</a> has already had its eye on Squad 22: ZOV, describing it as "a key element in brainwashing the population, reflecting the Russian government's version of events regarding the invasion of Ukraine and glorifying military service".</p>
<p>Back in 2018, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1666776116200553082">Steam stated</a> its approach to content on its platform was "to allow everything onto the Steam Store, except for things that we decide are illegal, or straight up trolling". Instead, its focus is on giving users "control over what kinds of content they see".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Valve for details on what moderation checks were taken ahead of Squad 22: ZOV's release, and whether the game will remain on the platform.</p>
<p>Valve has recently removed some controversial games from its Steam platform, including a game which described itself as "address[ing] the Israel x Palestine conflict from a Palestinian perspective" that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-counter-terrorism-unit-demands-steam-withdraw-controversial-shooter-from-sale">removed from sale in the UK following demands by the UK's counter-terrorism unit</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk">No Mercy was removed following widespread criticism</a> of its content depicting explicit sexual violence.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>I love Idea Factory, but the long-running Japanese game developer has had far more misses than hits lately. While a couple truly incredible JRPGs make up part of their lengthy list of releases, a majority of their output consists of half-baked spinoffs and undercooked genre shifts that even the most diehard of fans have struggled to enjoy. Amongst all that, though, I’ve always been impressed by the newly blossoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/14/death-end-request-2-review/">Death end re;Quest&nbsp;series</a>. Two releases in, these grim, gruesome JRPGs come with a unique gameplay twist and a focus on layered world-building that always kept me intrigued. I was excited to see Death end re;Quest: Code Z continue that streak of success, but unfortunately the third time is not the charm.</p>
<p><iframe title="Death end re;Quest: Code Z - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1cvAuFb4Mds?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Instead of being a full-on sequel, Death end re;Quest: Code Z is a spinoff story laying down some potential groundwork for where a third full entry might go, but it expects you to be exhaustively familiar with the two prior games from the get-go. I can only barely remember the events of the last two games, leaving me with far more questions than I was comfortable with when hopping into this one.</p>


<p>In a way, the game is built to parallel that lack of knowledge – new protagoninst Sayaka is a blank slate in a strange alternate version of Earth that runs on binary code, the powers of mysterious entities known as Ludens, and the whims of a seemingly all-powerful cyber goddess named Iris. Unfortunately, instead of using our uninformed hero as a way to deliver helpful info to the player, characters hint at important things yet dodge Sayaka’s questions repeatedly. On top of that, the game incorporates a frequent fourth-wall break where the cast regularly acknowledges and talks to the player directly. It only serves to muddy the agency of Sayaka even more, and makes it clear that this game is more focused on delivering callbacks and easter eggs to well-informed fans than it is in crafting a cohesive story experience. It’s a huge departure from the approach to storytelling that the prior games had – two JRPGs that start out as standalone horror experiences before slowly unraveling into wild scifi narratives of AI-sentience and parallel worlds.</p>


<p>There isn’t just a major shift in the approach to storytelling, but in gameplay as well. Rather than the Hyperdimension Neptunia&nbsp;inspired turn-based combat of yore, this game plays out as a top-down grid-based dungeon crawler in the vein of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/05/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-rescue-team-dx-review/">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/23/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-review/">Shiren The Wanderer</a>.&nbsp;I was honestly so excited about this switch-up, as I’ve been itching for more mystery dungeon experiences after loving the latest Shiren The Wandered.</p>
<p>For the most part, the mystery dungeon gameplay in Death end re;Quest: Code Z is… fine. Your build options and item variety are pretty limited, but there’s still enough going on that makes running through dungeons pretty engaging. The default difficulty option strips away the item and money loss on death, which neuters the roguelike risk-reward that is kind of necessary in a game like this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, two specific gameplay mechanics bring the entire experience down from “just fine” to borderline unplayable. The first are Death Ends – these gruesome death scenes typically come with unique art CGs and visceral writing, but they are also your primary source of upgrade points in Death end re;Quest: Code Z.&nbsp;A pretty cool idea at first, but eventually you’ll be forced to grind out missing Death Ends by purposefully dying to fodder enemies or replaying dungeons far more times than I would have liked.</p>

<p>There’s also the Sanity meter – every action you take or damage you suffer lowers this meter, and at zero you can’t see anything and your character begins attacking themself. The only way to restore Sanity is through a healing item you have very rare and random odds of encountering. If you’re trying to die to a specific lower-level enemy for a Death End, you’ll almost constantly die from Sanity self-harm before the enemy can actually land the killing blow. It’s an absurd mix of clashing underbaked systems that soured the entire experience for me.</p>
<p>I’m so into the idea of a sci-fi horror mystery dungeon game, but Death end re;Quest: Code Z just isn’t it. Diehard fans will probably enjoy the focus on character interaction and deeper worldbuilding in this game, but the amount of frustrating gameplay hurdles you need to jump through to experience it all just doesn’t feel worthwhile. I would love to see this gameplay improved and expanded on for a sequel, but knowing Idea Factory’s track record, we likely never will.</p>

		Death end re;Quest: Code Z is a major fumble for what has so far been Idea Factory's most promising franchise yet. The idea of a sci-fi horror mystery dungeon adventure is right up my alley, but confusing writing and frustrating gameplay mechanics hold this one back and make it one of the most frustrating games I've played all year.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-no-dlc-plans/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Kojima Productions currently has no plans to release episodic DLC content for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, as Hideo Kojima thinks releasing this type of content is no longer a trend.</p>
<p>Speaking during the 19th episode of his KOJI10 radio show, as reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/naven0m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NV</a>, the legendary game designer discussed the possibility of the second entry in the series getting paid DLC expansions after launch, confirming that there are currently no plans for this sort of content, as he thinks it is no longer a trend to release this sort of content. Plans, however, may change in the future in this regard. For now, Kojima-san revealed that the studio plans to support the game after launch with bug fixes and improvements, possibly adding something that didn't exist in the first entry in the series.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of the KOJI10 radio show, Hideo Kojima also revealed that Death Stranding 2: On the Beach originally featured some sort of hair system. This system involved Sam cutting his hair and shaving his beard, which would both grow back as time passed. Players could trim the beard, dye the hair, and so on by standing in front of a dedicated mirror. The system, however, eventually ended up getting scrapped as Sam isn't just a customizable, player-created avatar.</p>
<p>During the radio show, Hideo Kojima also discussed the original concept of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which he confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-gaming-hardware-will-ultimately-vanish-death-stranding-2-was-rewritten-to-resonate-more-with-players/">a few years back</a> to have changed following the COVID pandemic in 2020. Initially, he planned on releasing a 1.5 expansion of the original that would be centered around exploring the other continents in a world where flight is impossible. As the idea of DLC became outdated, however, the plan was scrapped, and he began working on a full-fledged sequel that was also scrapped due to the pandemic, and the only thing that has been kept of the original concept is the opening, which was originally meant to be something like a post-credits scene for Death Stranding Director's Cut to bridge the gap between the first and the second entry in the series.</p>

Yuri Lowenthal, who played clumsy bicycle crasher Yosuke in the original 2008 game, expressed some revealing annoyance with developers Atlus in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r">a post</a> on social media that has since been deleted.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake," he said. "I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back."</p>
<p>That's not an undeniable signal fire proving the remake's existence, but it is some very billowy smoke. Lowenthal has appeared in the Persona series before, and he was the voice of Eiichiro in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, the recent remake of that entry. So he's close enough to the studio to maybe know a thing or two about what's going on. He's also voiced a certain neighbourhood webslinger in various Spider-Man games over the years, as well as Mylo from Arcane, and absolute sidequest liability <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Johnny_(Final_Fantasy_VII)">Johnny</a> in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a> remakes. </p>
<p>He's not the only one seemingly snubbed by Atlus. Erin Fitzgerald, the voice of Chie, has also complained of the developers' reluctance to have her return, as noticed by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/persona/former-persona-4-actors-seemingly-keep-revealing-a-new-jrpg-remake-from-atlus-by-confirming-they-wont-be-in-it-i-have-not-been-asked-to-reprise-my-role/">Gamesradar</a>. 

</p><p>"For those asking, I have not been asked to reprise my role as Chie Satonaka in the Persona 4 remake," she said in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erinfitzgerald.bsky.social/post/3lqbi6257w22d">her own post</a>. "I am blessed to have recorded as many Persona 4 games as I did playing her."</p>
<p>Hopes for a Persona 4 remake have persisted among fans, I'm told, since the third game got its makeover. Meanwhile, many folks are doubtless frothing at the mouth for a Persona 6 announcement, which has yet to materialise, with Atlus instead announcing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-persona-5-spinoff-is-launching-next-month-this-time-a-gacha-game-with-a-new-group-of-phantom-thieves">yet another Persona 5 spinoff</a> earlier this month. </p>
<p>Whether a remake is strictly necessary is another thing. A PC remaster of Persona 4 came out in 2020 in the form of Persona 4 Golden, which our Edwin called "a twisting tale of dreams gone rogue in a town sapped of purpose" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/persona-4-golden-review">his review</a>. If you want a second opinion, my cousin - who just phoned me to chat and who delayed this article from being written by at least one hour - instructed me to review all Persona games with the following single-sentence summary: "Too much text." And you know what? I might agree. 100 hours to complete a game? Please. I barely think I have 100 hours left to live.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, CD Projekt Red confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2-is-officially-the-2077-sequels-name-at-least-for-now/1100-6531871/" data-ref-id="1100-6531871">the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel is now in pre-production</a>. For the moment, the project is also being internally called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/">Cyberpunk 2</a>. However, the newfound foreword momentum doesn't mean that Cyberpunk 2 will be arriving anytime soon. CDPR co-CEO Michał Nowakowski has indicated that the sequel may be years away from release.</p><p>"Our journey from the pre-production to the final release date takes four to five years on average," Nowakowski said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-nOVGBRC3N0?si=MjhFgWy8svAGR2X4&amp;t=1268" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CD Projekt Red's investor presentation</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/cyberpunk/asked-about-cyberpunk-2-release-date-cdpr-boss-reiterates-our-journey-from-the-pre-production-to-the-final-release-takes-4-to-5-years-on-average-but-each-project-is-unique/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>). "Having said that, and keeping in mind that each project is unique and there are many variables that influence the final outcome, I will not lead you into specific years."</p><p>If that leads Cyberpunk 2 to a 2030 or 2031 release date, that means it would arrive a decade or longer after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/" data-ref-id="1900-6417622">Cyberpunk 2077</a> was released. It's also likely to fall in the next generation of consoles, presumably on PlayStation 6 and whatever comes after Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>The bulk of CDPR's resources currently appears to be focused on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, which only started pre-production late last year. CD Projekt Red North America is working on Cyberpunk 2, and a recent job posting for the game suggested that the developer wants the sequel to have "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-wants-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-to-have-most-realistic-crowds-ever/1100-6529613/" data-ref-id="1100-6529613">the most-realistic crowds ever</a>."</p><p>Mike Pondsmith--the creator of the Cyberpunk franchise--isn't directly working on Cyberpunk 2. But Pondsmith has disclosed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-a-second-city/1100-6531705/" data-ref-id="1100-6531705">there will be a second city featured in the sequel</a> beyond Night City, the setting of the first game.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-cd-projekt-acknowledges-development-challenges/1100-6531129/" data-ref-id="1100-6531129">Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition</a> will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">a launch title for Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

			<p>The rumored Persona 4 remake will likely feature an entirely new voice cast, as another actress won't be returning to voice one of the main characters.</p>
<p>Speaking on Bluesky, Erin Fitzgerald, who voiced Chie Satonaka in every Persona 4 game except the original PlayStation 2 release, confirmed they were not asked to reprise the role. With Yuri Lowenthal also <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-spider-man/">confirmed</a> not to play Yosuke in the remake, it's looking more and more like the remake will have a brand new voice cast, which wouldn't be surprising, considering the same happened in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona 3 Reload,</a> the remake of the third entry in the series developed by ATLUS released last year.</p>

<p>A Persona 4 remake has been rumored to be in the works for a while, but an official announcement has yet to be made. If the game is launching before Persona 6, however, it will likely be announced before long, possibly during any of the upcoming not-E3 summer showcases. These include the annual Summer Game Fest showcase on June 6th, of which the series' publisher SEGA is one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">partners</a>, and the Xbox Games Showcase on June 8th.</p>
<p>According to rumors, the Persona 4 remake isn't the only project that will bring back older entries of the series to modern gaming platforms. A remaster of Persona 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-persona-2-remaster-development/">reportedly</a> also in the works, and it will feature not only both entries in the series, Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment, but also a new translation. This remaster should be released on all current generation consoles, including the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Electronic Arts (EA) <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the closure of Cliffhanger Games, a Seattle-based studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-new-studio-led-by-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-veteran-kevin-stephens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> six years ago by Kevin Stephens, who previously worked as Vice President and Studio Head on Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Cliffhanger Games was working on an original Black Panther game.</p>
<p>Exactly a month ago, EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laid off</a> around 300–400 employees at Respawn Entertainment, too, and it may not be over yet. <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1927820651370271111?t=55cOa-shSeAFKbqb3REK9A&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the Spanish insider eXtas1s</a>, the publisher could be preparing to shut down Codemasters' central headquarters, removing another 400 developers or so.</p>
<p><em>I have learned that around 400 more layoffs are coming at EA, the total closure of Codemasters' headquarters, and that those developers will be integrated into EA Sports (F1) and a new Need For Speed that is already in development.</em></p>
<p>This would be another major blow to the games industry, which has suffered many closures and layoff rounds in the first half of 2025 after a couple of tough years.</p>
<p>EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-might-be-actually-acquired-by-ea-instead-of-take-two-according-to-a-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> Take-Two as the buyer of Codemasters on the finishing line. Take-Two had offered nearly a billion dollars, but Electronic Arts closed the deal at $1.2 billion. After the acquisition, Codemasters CEO Frank Sagnier <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-ceo-ea-is-like-our-cinderella-shoe-a-perfect-fit-they-listen-but-dont-force-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> Electronic Arts was a perfect fit.</p>
<p>However, Codemasters suffered major restructuring in the last four years at the hands of its new owner. Three years ago, the Cheshire-based team <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-cheshire-will-join-criterion-to-work-on-need-for-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was merged with Criterion</a> to work on Need for Speed. In late 2023, EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-interactive-suffers-embracers-restructuring-codemasters-also-hit-by-layoffs-at-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performed</a> a first round of layoffs at Codemasters. Just a few weeks, we also <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-shows-off-f1-25-gameplay-confirms-wrc-games-are-on-pause/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that the studio won't be making any more WRC games, as the license was reacquired by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nacon-is-once-again-publishing-wrc-games-new-wrc-series-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nacon</a>.</p>
<p>It appears that EA is positioning Codemasters to be solely focused on making new Formula 1 games. On that note, F1 25 was just released, and you can read Chris Wray's take on it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/f1-25-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>:</p>
<p><em>F1 25 is a good game, make no mistake about that. With a near-flawless presentation, improved my team mode, and additional features, there's a lot to do. There are a few pitfalls here and there, but nothing that takes away from what is another genuinely good release by Codemasters.</em></p>

            <p>Nintendo has updated its mobile app ahead of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s launch, including GameChat functionality and its improved screenshot upload feature.</p>
<p>Previously known as the Nintendo Switch Online mobile app, it's now named Nintendo Switch App in line with the change.</p>
<p>The Album feature is particularly welcome, as screenshots and videos taken on a Switch 2 console will be automatically uploaded to the app ready to be saved and shared.</p>

<p>Previously, players would need to scan a QR code on the console to link to their mobile device, which was a clunky process. Now it will work just like the PlayStation and Xbox equivalent apps.</p>
<p>GameChat notifications have also been added to the app. This is the new social feature on Switch 2 that allows players to voice or video chat with each other while playing.</p>
<p>Notifications for GameChat will now appear on the app, letting you know you've been invited to a call.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>Another inclusion on the app will be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/achievements-can-be-earned-in-switch-2-editions-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom">Zelda Notes feature</a>, used in both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. This will include achievements, a voice navigation guide, and all-new voice memories not in the original versions.</p>
<p>Though featured on the app, Zelda Notes will be added on Switch 2 release day - 5th June.</p>
<p>Last week, we reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-gamechat-feature-requires-a-mobile-phone-number">GameChat will require users to register a phone number</a> to use. The GameChat website states as an "additional security measure" text message verification "is required to set up GameChat".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-already-out-in-the-wild-but-needs-a-day-one-update-to-function">Some Switch 2 consoles are now out in the hands of the public</a> ahead of its release next week, with videos appearing online of the console being unboxed and its initial startup menus - though they're no longer available to view online. However, the console requires a day one update to function, meaning it's not yet playable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
