			<p>A new Star Wars Jedi Survivor patch is now live on PC, bringing some welcome performance and quality-of-life improvements</p>
<p>Patch 9 mainly focuses on performance and quality-of-life improvements, introducing framerate improvements for various hardware configurations and fixes for several sources of framerate hitching. The patch also optimizes ray tracing for CPU usage and should now scale better for high-end GPUs.</p>
<p>The new Star Wars Jedi Survivor patch also introduces some quality-of-life improvements, such as an improvement for the "Optimizing Game Files" screen and improvements for mouse and keyboard functionality. Lastly, the patch introduces some bug fixes and removes Denuvo DRM. The full patch notes can be found on the game's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-survivor/patch-notes?isLocalized=true">official website.</a></p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi Survivor is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. The game will launch on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One next week, on September 17th. Learn more about the second entry in the series by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor-cannot-change-the-past/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>While Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a surprise journey when it was first released, the time spent apart hasn’t made Cal Kestis’ adventures any less enjoyable. A similar framework in unfamiliar territories helps to establish Jedi: Survivor as a quality sequel to the original release. Jedi: Survivor still plays it safe in comparison to the prior game. It may be difficult to give Jedi: Survivor full marks for its individuality, but compared to the predecessor focused on Cal’s time as a Jedi Padawan, each title can stand up on its own merits, and Jedi: Survivor polishes up much of the experience as it propels the narrative ever forward on Cal Kestis’ journey to Tanalorr.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infamous-mobile-smash-hit-flappy-bird-returning-this-year.979080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/flappy-bird-returning-this-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>? It's back, in expanded form. The game so addictive it caused its creator to destroy it for fear of what he'd unleashed on the world is making a return, and it's hitting browsers this year, with a mobile version to follow in 2025.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://flappybird.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new official website</a> for the little yellow bird and its infuriating pipe-based gameplay,&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>will be available for iOS and Android, as well as browsers. Rather confusingly, the game's <a href="https://linktr.ee/flappy_bird" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linktree page</a> says it'll be playable "exclusively on Telegram".</p>
<p>A description on the site claims that&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>is "refreshed, reinvigorated, and ready to soar again", and that this will indeed be "the official&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>game", so this isn't one of those cheap imitators that sprang up in the wake of the original's disappearance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/flappy-bird-returns-gameplay.jpg?itok=miwzCPux 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/flappy-bird-returns-gameplay.jpg?itok=TrrVLO2z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>is back, with all the modern trappings you'd expect from a 2024 revival.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this being a 2024 revival of&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>, you can expect all the usual modern mobile game trappings. The relaunched version of the game will come complete with "new game modes, characters, progression, and massive multiplayer challenges", according to a press release.</p>
<p>Those modes include a basketball-based mode in which you guide the lil' bird through hoops, as well as an honest-to-goodness&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>battle royale (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/flappy-bird-battle-royale-is-thing-apparently">no, not that one</a>).</p>
<p>Said press release also confirms that the browser-based versions of&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>, which include a version for mobile web browsers, will launch this fall, and that the iOS and Android versions will follow next year.</p>
<p>It looks like original&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>creator&nbsp;Dong Nguyen won't be involved with this revival. Instead, the group spearheading the game's relaunch calls itself Flappy Bird Foundation, and the group says it will "revamp the game's ecosystem" while retaining the "familiarity of the game design" enjoyed around the world.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>was released in 2013, but its meteoric rise to fame came in 2014, at which point it gained millions of players and attained the number one spot in the iOS download charts.</p>
<p>However, just a couple of weeks after its sudden surge in popularity, creator Dong Nguyen <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/432227971173068800" rel="noopener" target="_blank">took the game down</a>, claiming he couldn't "take this anymore" (referring to the game's overexposure).</p>
<p>Whatever Nguyen may think of&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>, it seems Flappy Bird Foundation disagrees, and that's why you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>once again in your browser this year and on your phone next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>An upcoming "survival experience" from the makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">Eve Online</a> got its first trailer today, teasing spaceships against stellar backdrops. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-frontier">Eve Frontier</a> was previously known as Project Awakening and is set in a faraway sector of the Eve universe. The developer calls it "a sandbox which focuses on self-reliance, skill-based tactical gameplay and third-party development". Huh? Third party development? Oh, I see. It has a bunch of blockchain cryptocurrency horseshit attached to it. Great. </p>

<p>We've known the game was in development since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-onlines-developers-are-making-a-blockchain-game-in-the-eve-universe">its announcement last year</a>, and it saw a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-online-dev-ccps-blockchain-survival-experience-project-awakening-is-getting-a-closed-playtest-in-may">closed beta test</a> a few months ago. But this marks the moment it has been christened with a real name. "In creating EVE Frontier, we wanted to make a new type of survival game," say developers CCP in a press release, "testing not just the individual survival of players, but the survival of civilization itself within a sandbox simulation."</p>
<p>That sounds fine. I love to survive amid the hellish collapse of interstellar civilisation. What sounds less inviting is the horrendous soup of cryptochatter that follows. There is mention of "L2 Blockchain", "ERC-20 tokens", and a programmable in-game building mechanic called "Smart Assemblies" which seems to let players make little shops that sell in-game materials, presumably to fellow blockchumps for various crypto doubloons.</p>
<p>"Players will be able to turn their assets (ships, items, resources), their services (e.g. providing bodyguard services to a fellow player, maintaining third-party development environments), and their reputation (“as a renowned player, my members pay me to lead their clan”) into real-world value through the in-game economy and in-game currencies."</p>
<p>In other words, it's the grubby "play-to-earn" idea baked into the EVE universe. I'll pass, cheers.</p>

</figure>
<p>If the blockchain bullshittery is not featured in the trailer (or even mentioned in the video's description), it is likely because even those who indulge in unwise cryptocurrency speculation have to concede it is often interminably boring and invites immediate derision and skepticism from all quarters, save the cryptobro hardcore. Unlike vague images of spaceships flying coolly through space to warbling music, it does not make for exciting marketing material. Try to read this sentence, also included in the press release:</p>
<p>"Using Solidity, players can code functionality through smart contracts (on-chain code) and connect infrastructure to decentralized applications (DApps), programs through which you can modify how that infrastructure functions and behaves."</p>
<p>Is this a video game? <em>What is this?</em> Eve Online as an MMO can be a difficult game to approach as a new player, but at least it exists as an interesting landscape of cyber-skulduggery and a complex simulation of cutthroat economics. I have fond memories of rushing into battle as a dirt poor frontline fighter in a larger fleet, trying to orbit and electronically disable a much bigger, deadlier ship, like a buzzing fly trying to lasso an rhinoceros. I even have fond memories of manipulating the space stock markets with play money. </p>
<p>But that is the key thing: the ISK of Eve Online is play money that everyone agrees is play money. By contrast, Eve Frontier looks like an ill-fated attempt to pump $40 million dollars of real world money into a black hole. </p>
<p>But who knows. Maybe it will do better than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-ccp-havent-stopped-trying-to-make-an-eve-online-shooter-for-15-years">the first-person shooter they have made four times</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> has today received its ninth patch, which brings "substantial performance improvements" on PC and removes Denuvo DRM.</p>
<p>EA promises framerate improvements for various hardware configurations, fixes for specific framerate hitching elements for smoother gameplay, and optimised CPU usage for ray-tracing.</p>
<p>Importantly, Denuvo DRM has been removed, which is often criticised for hampering performance.</p>

<p>In addition, the patch brings other improvements like better mouse and keyboard control in menus, quality of life fixes, and bug fixes for crashes and collision issues. Read the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-survivor/patch-notes?isLocalized=true">full patch notes</a> for more information.</p>
<p>A further patch is set to arrive soon for the PlayStation 5 version of the game, which will allow for save file transfer with the forthcoming PS4 version - due on 17th September.</p>
<p>This ninth patch arrives 17 months after Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was first released in April 2023.</p>
<p>At the time, the PC version of the game was heavily criticised for its poor performance.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry described it as "the worst triple-A port" of 2023 and then, after seven patches, stated the "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-star-wars-jedi-survivor-on-pc-is-still-the-worst-triple-a-pc-port-of-2023">PC port is still not fit for purpose</a>".</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if this ninth patch will make the necessary changes to ensure the game is finally up to standard, but it's clear EA has been committed to improving its performance.</p>
<p>The game will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-survivor-gets-september-release-on-ps4-and-xbox-one">launch on PS4 and Xbox One</a> on 17th September, costing £44.99. Let's hope it runs well on the older consoles.</p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is the follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> and is a third-person action adventure with Soulslike elements. "Star Wars Jedi: Survivor's lovable unpretentiousness is what makes it such a blast - but a lack of true focus holds it back," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-hit-and-miss-action-with-the-warmest-of-hearts">our review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/king-of-meat-gamescom-2024-qa-it-is-an-obvious-good-fit-for-streaming-streamers-really-enjoyed-it/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Gamescom 2024, I got the chance to try <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-and-glowmade-reveal-king-of-meat-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">King of Meat</a>, the debut game of British indie studio Glowmade. The developer was founded a few years ago by former industry veterans who worked on high-profile games like Battlefield, Fable, and Horizon Zero Dawn, and they <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-glowmade-horizon-zero-dawn-fable-battlefield-vets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed</a> a publishing deal with Amazon Games three years ago.</p>
<p>King of Meat is a colorful cooperative action game styled after survival game shows. It is set in the world of Loregok, which seamlessly blends traditional fantasy elements like dragons, trolls, and skeletons with corporate commercialism. Contenders join the so-called Komstruct Koliseum in a risky bid for glory, gold, and fame.</p>
<p>During the game, you race through the dungeons, hacking and slashing against all sorts of monsters while at the same time trying to impress the bloodthirsty crowd with your combat skills. Indeed, every action, such as dealing a certain amount of damage or looting treasure, provides a certain amount of points that go into the tally.</p>
<p>As for the combat itself, it's pretty standard fare for an action title, with light and heavy attacks, dodging, and whatnot.&nbsp;There appears to be a strong focus on various types of environmental traps to avoid, including classics like lava-filled rooms, spinning blades, flaming balls of fire, rotating spikes, and more.</p>
<p>To be honest, I wasn't too impressed with what I played. At first glance, everything seemed to be a little too vanilla to stand out in today's increasingly crowded lineup of cooperative action titles, but King of Meat does have a feature that could make it much more attractive: user-generated content. It will come with a dungeon editor on all platforms, allowing the whole community to easily create levels and share them with the public. Needless to say, this feature could vastly expand the longevity.</p>
<p>After the brief hands-on, I had the opportunity to speak to Glowmade Studio Head and Co-Founder Jonny Hopper to discuss the studio's inspiration for King of Meat, its feature set, and the post-launch roadmap (in broad strokes). By the way, the game is currently in Pre-Alpha and there's no word on a release window. It will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and even Nintendo Switch, though. Glowmade is taking tester signups <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us/tester-sign-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>, in case you're interested.</p>

<p><strong>How long have you been working on King of Meat?</strong></p>
<p>About four years. We signed with Amazon at the end of 2020, although we had been working on it as a very small project for about a year before that.</p>
<p><strong>What was your inspiration for this rather peculiar setting?</strong></p>
<p>We were in the pub, and a few of us were sitting around just talking about the things that we love, the films and stuff that we really enjoyed. Adam, our art director, said he's a big fan of Labyrinth, the David Bowie film with Jim Henson. He loves that, and Mike and Jim were talking about WrestleMania and that kind of over-the-top, spectacular sort of stuff, and then we just felt like, well, what happens if we try and take those feelings and put them into a game?</p>
<p><strong>One of the main features is user-generated content (UGC). Will the ability to create dungeons be available on consoles, too?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. It's fully cross-play on all the platforms, so you can play the levels on any platform and create levels on any platform. The idea is that anything you make on any platform will work on any of them.</p>
<p><strong>Which engine are you using?</strong></p>
<p>It is our own technology. We built the whole engine ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>You said there will be your own levels and dungeons, and the community can create custom ones.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. We're sort of doing that already behind the scenes. The game itself, when it comes out, is going to have about a hundred levels that we made as part of the offering, and we've also got the community behind the scenes building levels for us already.</p>
<p>We've already got people kind of seeding those creations. The idea is that on launch, there's going to be a lot of content. Quite a lot of official Glowmade stuff, but also some community-made stuff ready to go on day one.</p>
<p><strong>Did the community already help you improve the level-making tools in King of Meat?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, they did. We got such great feedback from them. Also, we get surprised a lot, which is really, really cool because obviously we know exactly how everything works and how all the pieces work, but then somebody will make a level and you don't know how they've done the thing that they've done with the tools, and there's always really amazing moments when you go, how did he do that? There's one level which is a magic library, with all these books flying everywhere, and I know theoretically how it's done, but the complexity that the person pulled off is really amazing. Those are the things that really make us happy, actually.</p>
<p><strong>I guess it's a bit like LittleBigPlanet, where some people made astounding levels.</strong></p>
<p>I worked on the editor for that some 18 years ago, so yeah, they're very much alike. We want people to just actually feel good when they're making levels and feel proud of the things they've made.</p>
<p><strong>How will you feature creators in the game? Will players be able to rate the best levels?</strong></p>
<p>That's such a good question. There's quite a few ways to do this. When you make a level, one of the things you can do is you can use a preset, which consists of different objects and enemies and styles to make certain levels.</p>
<p>When you've published your level, it can then make its way into the sort of main league that the whole public can display as part of their game progress. Also, for every single player, we have this kind of tipping system. Every day as a player, you get like a hundred tips, and the only thing you can do with those tips is give them to creators to reward them. Using that makes you as a creator feel really good because you can see people enjoying what you made, but it also means we can do exactly as you said, feature the creator of the week with the most levels or the most tips. We can do those kind of cool leaderboards and tags and badges or something.</p>
<p>Also, when you were playing in the plaza, did you see the big banners? We can use those banners to be like, the creator of the week is Rebecca because she's got, you know, a 1000 tips or whatever. It lets us show off the people behind the creations and make them feel good and part of the game as well.</p>
<p><strong>With Amazon publishing, I bet it occurred to you that King of Meat could get big on Twitch.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that would be great. It is sort of an obvious good fit for streaming. We've also had a bunch of streamers and content creators play the game already, and they really enjoyed it. They were screaming and laughing and just having a good time. We're really hopeful that it can take off.</p>
<p><strong>In the past, a few games have implemented Twitch functionality that allowed spectators to interact with the game. Did you think about doing the same?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we've been thinking about that, but we're not going to want to talk about what that is at the moment.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'It is sort of an obvious good fit for streaming. We've also had a bunch of streamers and content creators play the game already, and they really enjoyed it. They were screaming and laughing and just having a good time. We're really hopeful that it can take off.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Fair enough. As far as what I played in the demo, King of Meat seemed to be a lot about avoiding environmental traps and fighting basic enemies, but will there be any boss encounters?</strong></p>
<p>A boss fight is kind of what you make it. What we've done is we've given the tools to the creators to build bosses. There's a really good example in as a level that you may or may not have played; I think it's called Bombs Galore, and it's got this really amazing boss fight that really feels like a climactic moment. But all we're doing is providing those pieces to let a level creator make that kind of thing in the way they want.</p>
<p><strong>What can you tell me about character progression?</strong></p>
<p>In the game, you have something called the road to stardom. You're ranking up through the levels, and as you rank up, you unlock new features, new moves, new weapons, and special moves, and then within that, you can rank up your weapon archetypes, and you unlock various different things there. The core game, even if you don't engage with the UGC side of it at all, making or playing, what we're delivering is a good 30 to 40 hours of campaign and progression.</p>
<p><strong>So there's also a campaign.</strong></p>
<p>There are some single-player campaign levels that you can play, and that's where we can do narrative development and story, as well as the League, which is your progress through growing fame.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned talents, right? Is there a player role system where you can be a support character, for example?</strong></p>
<p>That comes with your loadout. There are different weapons that are better or worse at different roles. You have a system called trinkets, which are like buffs for weapons, and you can also choose your kind of special move loadout as well. The idea here is that you can choose what you like, but then you start a level, and there's also like a little weapon locker, and it's like a vending machine; you can then go and change it once you're in the level if, as a team of four, you think you want to be more of a support type of character. So, it's not a character class thing. But it's more of an organic way to reconfigure your loadout.</p>
<p><strong>I know King of Meat is a co-op game, but what if one player could be the Dungeon Master? Did you think of that type of asymmetrical PvP experience?</strong></p>
<p>It's not the game we're launching with. I think there's loads of game modes and ideas that we plan to do post-release, and we'll talk about that more another time.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about the game's post-launch live service, what kind of additions can players anticipate?</strong></p>
<p>We've got a roadmap of one, two, and three years out where we've got a content plan for new weapon skins, weapon archetypes, more campaign levels, more example levels and cosmetics and so forth. We know what we want to do and how we want to do it, but we also want to listen to the community and see what they really want us to focus on.&nbsp;Do they want a new feature? Do they want a new creative mode? Are they really passionate about a particular skin or something that we can support?</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about whether these updates will be free or not?</strong></p>
<p>We are not going to delve too much in there at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Is there going to be an in-game store with microtransactions?</strong></p>
<p>It's only for the cosmetics. We've all been very clear that we're not doing a battle pass, and there is no pay to progress or pay to win.</p>
<p><strong>So you're not adopting a season system?</strong></p>
<p>Not in the battle pass way.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We've got an event system in the game where we could have a competition on making the best Halloween level, and then at the end of the competition, we feature those levels on a rotation and then you go into the Halloween event, and you can play all the best levels.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Will you release themed updates, like Halloween, for King of Meat?</strong></p>
<p>That's the plan. We've got an event system in the game where we could have a competition on making the best Halloween level, and then at the end of the competition, we feature those levels on a rotation and then you go into the Halloween event, and you can play all the best levels. We've got a lot of plans for that sort of seasonal content.</p>
<p><strong>With this event system, will you also add themed props, etc., for level creators?</strong></p>
<p>Exactly, that's perfect. Going back to the Halloween thing and maybe there's pumpkins and Jack-o'-lanterns and skeleton outfits.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kaiserpunk-delayed-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Overseer Games has announced a delay for&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>, its upcoming alternate-history grand strategy city-builder, and it's a fairly significant delay as well.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2012190/view/4595449146464414178" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>, which was originally intended to launch in the third quarter of this year, will now be arriving on February 27th, 2025 instead. Overseer says this decision came "after a lot of careful consideration and many days with our thinking caps on".</p>
<p>The studio says that it considered an Early Access release for&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>, but that "for a game like&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>, we believe it's crucial for players to experience the entire journey in the best possible light".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kaiserpunk-delayed-map.jpg?itok=p9e_sY0J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kaiserpunk-delayed-map.jpg?itok=7veau_He 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kaiserpunk&nbsp;</em>is going to take a little longer to cook.</figcaption></figure><p>Lead designer&nbsp;Danijel Mihokovic goes on to say that even if publishers "don't recognize the potential" of&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk&nbsp;</em>or are "too hesitant to try something genuinely new", he and his studio don't want to compromise their vision.</p>
<p>To that end, lots of new features have been added to&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>'s core design based on player feedback. These features include new biomes, a heritage system, and an "intricate trading system", as well as "significant optimization work".</p>
<p>If you're looking for more information about&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>, Overseer says it will release a series of dev diary-style feature articles that will explore various aspects of the game's mechanics, worldbuilding, and development process.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be an opportunity to playtest&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk&nbsp;</em>at some point in the near future, although Overseer doesn't disclose exactly when that will be. Watch this space.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kaiserpunk-delayed-city.jpg?itok=PyBFVdWu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kaiserpunk-delayed-city.jpg?itok=mtT7YJYr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll get plenty more info about&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk&nbsp;</em>between now and its release.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk&nbsp;</em>is, it's a grand strategy-infused city-builder that takes place in an alternate-history 20th-century setting.</p>
<p>Developer and publisher Overseer Games is promising the opportunity to build complex production and logistics chains that span "the length of the game", as well as 100 different resources to gather and transform into everything from zeppelins through to bombers.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of games like Paradox's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hearts-of-iron-iv"><em>Hearts of Iron</em></a>, then you'll likely find plenty to love here.&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2012190/Kaiserpunk/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on February 27th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/wild-bastards-review-roguelite-fps-blue-manchu-1851646637<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>iSometimes, when you want a food metaphor for a video game, you reach for a comparison to fine dining. Other times you might allude toward fast food. In this instance, my trite and overused analogy is a great big buffet offering of all your favorite foods, where you just grab handfuls of everything and stuff it in until you’re sick. That, in the best way possible, is <em>Wild Bastards</em>.<br></p><p>Ostensibly a follow-up to developer Blue Manchu’s 2019 game <em>Void Bastards</em>, but defiantly not a sequel, <em>Wild Bastards</em> is a large part old-school FPS action, with a hefty helping of <em>Slay The Spire</em>, and then embellished with tactical strategy. It mimics the behavior of a thousand rogue-lites, but certainly isn’t one, throwing you into super-difficult first-person action sequences that last only a minute or two each and encouraging you to carefully craft elaborate teams of specifically equipped characters, before undoing all your work between every chapter. And it all absolutely works.</p><figure id="" data-id="41b3fae117d5113fdc4d1b24ea1cbeba" data-recommend-id="image://41b3fae117d5113fdc4d1b24ea1cbeba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spider Rosa shoots at an enemy, causing a large spark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Spider Rosa shoots at an enemy, causing a large spark." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="41b3fae117d5113fdc4d1b24ea1cbeba" data-recommend-id="image://41b3fae117d5113fdc4d1b24ea1cbeba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spider Rosa shoots at an enemy, causing a large spark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s tempting to spend too long comparing <em>Wild Bastards</em> to its predecessor, putting ticks and crosses next to the aspects it shares and doesn’t, but I think this undermines both. And despite the visual similarity, and that both have a branching map of locations leading to FPS-based missions, they are starkly different. So let’s focus on what <em>Wild Bastards </em>is, rather than what it isn’t.</p><p>You begin the game with two characters, the four-armed, somewhat demonic Spider Rosa, and gambling robot Casino. The pair are attempting to escape the Chaste family of twisted evil cowboy types by fleeing through the galaxy in their spaceship. When beaming down to a (tutorial) planet where the two must make their way across a map to reach a spot that lets them beam back to their craft, one of the Chastes, McNeil, destroys the ship and attempts to capture them. At this point, a legendary ship called Drifter swoops in and rescues them, and forces them on a journey to recover the life forces of former colleagues killed by monstrous patriarch Jebediah Chaste. Which is to say, each chapter of the game is about reaching the end of a small, branching sector of space to collect the DNA of the fallen, then revive them and add them to your crew.</p><p>Each point on the sector map you opt to fly to has a planet you must beam down to, and each of these planets has its own map with branching, intersecting locations, points variously filled with pick-ups, stores, and most importantly, battles to win. Each of these battles is a mini-FPS location, where you take on collections of enemies with your crew. Except—and bear with me, there’s a <em>lot</em> of explaining to do here—your gang travels a planet in “bunches,” grouped in ones or twos, with no more than four selected for any drop. You can bunch them as you wish, but when you’re battling, only one is fighting at any time—however, you can switch between either in the group on the fly. You then need to make use of your ears (and the game’s visual representation of sound on the compass) to locate the enemies, who’ll hide but endlessly give themselves away by shouting insults or having conversations with each other…Oh god, this game is so much easier to play than to describe.</p><figure id="" data-id="0baa18fd7aaad7f7a86912331fb1c90e" data-recommend-id="image://0baa18fd7aaad7f7a86912331fb1c90e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1418" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Warping screen, showing your victories." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Warping screen, showing your victories." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0baa18fd7aaad7f7a86912331fb1c90e" data-recommend-id="image://0baa18fd7aaad7f7a86912331fb1c90e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1418" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Warping screen, showing your victories." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If a character dies in battle, they’re dead until you either get back on Drifter and revive them with a rare potion, or if you lose everyone and travel back to the beginning of the sector, or succeed without them and move on to the next sector, whereupon everyone is revived. Except, in both instances, you also lose all the many pieces of equipment you’ve won, bought or picked up, and previously assigned among your crew, along with any money, potions, bonus items, or…beans.</p><p>Except, or, or, except, but, or, except, and my goodness. I’ve not even gotten into the Ace cards you pick up that permanently improve a character, or the Juice you find in battles that allows each to perform their special ability, or how you want to make sure you pair up a long-range one-shot shooter like furious robot Judge with a more rapid-fire but less precise crewmember like mysterious alien Roswell, and if it’s a drop where only three can go, use Casino and his Juice ability to instantly kill the enemy he’s facing, or ghostly pastor Preach who wields the ludicrously ammo-heavy Sermon .58 and who has no shields but can use Juice to heal when she kills. Oh, but also, if your&nbsp;battle is going to be against a bunch of Critters rather than humanoids, you’d be crazy to use snake-like Hopalong and his laser lasso, but he’d be perfect if it’s just against a couple of heavy Ironclads.</p><figure id="" data-id="17c0c15960bf6b147e7e4d45ea28b869" data-recommend-id="image://17c0c15960bf6b147e7e4d45ea28b869" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1064" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A science-fictiony base, with smoke and guns and shooting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A science-fictiony base, with smoke and guns and shooting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17c0c15960bf6b147e7e4d45ea28b869" data-recommend-id="image://17c0c15960bf6b147e7e4d45ea28b869" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1064" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A science-fictiony base, with smoke and guns and shooting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I hope, if somewhat laboriously, I’ve made my point. <em>Wild Bastards</em> is extraordinarily involved, layers upon layers upon layers, with tactics to develop for all its elements. The range of characters is elaborate, eventually offering you 12 to pick from, and even <em>this</em> has added layers of complications, as the wonderfully written and voiced crew will have fallings-out with one another at unscripted points, meaning they’ll refuse to bunch with each other until they make up over…a plate of beans. Or they may bond during one of the squillions of conversations that can occur (I’ve never heard the same one twice), and work better together, supporting the other by dropping items into the arena.</p><p>I’ve also failed to celebrate the ever-larger menagerie of enemies to battle, an extraordinary 25 humanoids (Chasteners), 11 animals (Critters), and five types of automated security bots, each with unique behaviors, weapons, and defenses. Let alone that each Bastard on your crew moves subtly differently, some faster, some able to jump higher, one slithering rapidly on his belly. Like I say, this game has taken something from every section of the buffet, and somehow fit it all on one delicious plate.</p><figure id="" data-id="93dcbb5045fde5f6e0f7775b8c68824a" data-recommend-id="image://93dcbb5045fde5f6e0f7775b8c68824a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1418" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sector map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A sector map." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="93dcbb5045fde5f6e0f7775b8c68824a" data-recommend-id="image://93dcbb5045fde5f6e0f7775b8c68824a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1418" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sector map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are, of course, concerns. While the combat is a lot of fun, and even more so for the incredible variety on offer, I do think it lacks punchy impact on hitting enemies. It feels too often like they’re able to run through your fire unharmed, and there’s a lack of satisfying oof when you clip them. It makes things feel a little too ethereal.</p><p>Poison is ludicrously overpowered, and the levels with poison-spitting Rattlers can be miserable to get through until you’ve rescued some of the later crew members, the ongoing damage they deal being far too punishing. The other, rather more significant gripe, is that there’s a missing difficulty sweet spot between Normal and Easy. Normal can be a surprisingly tough choice, especially early on, as the game makes obsessed use of poison as you’re just getting going with two or three characters, and it can feel dispiriting. But Easy is genuinely easy, and lacks enough challenge. (Clearly there are those who’ll excel on Hard and Very Hard, and god bless them.) I wish that Normal were ever-so slightly less punishing at the beginning. I recommend switching back up to it when you’re just breezing through levels, however, because that’s to miss the point.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="26552c9ad5c3a2c16a037e63545c06dc" data-recommend-id="image://26552c9ad5c3a2c16a037e63545c06dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1426" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shooting at Critters at the general store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shooting at Critters at the general store." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="26552c9ad5c3a2c16a037e63545c06dc" data-recommend-id="image://26552c9ad5c3a2c16a037e63545c06dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1426" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shooting at Critters at the general store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The other odd decision is to force you to play through the tutorial every run. Even switched to “Off” in the menu, the opening level remains required, and it’s pretty tedious when you’re on your third or fourth run (something made far worse for me by my having hammered through the demo of this multiple times earlier this year).</p><p>Oh, but if you’re an impatient bugger like me, know that hitting Escape will skip you past the grindingly slow beam up and down sequences and post-battle reports. Just don’t ever use it on the conversations, because they’re all brilliant.</p><p>There, I barely compared it to the brilliant <em>Void Bastards</em> at all, although I urge you to play both. It’s tempting to call <em>Wild Bastards</em> an evolution, but that’s unfair to <em>Void</em>, which has its excellent crafting elements and the permadeath of characters (albeit with persistent progress). What’s crucially similar about both, beyond the excellent art and fantastic sense of humor, is that unlike so many roguelite games, they both <em>want you to win</em>. They’re about progressing forward, being able to reach an ending, and then starting all over to try it completely differently. It’s just that in <em>Wild Bastards</em>, there’s so much more that can be different each time.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Could the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series be making a comeback in some fashion? In a new episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIEpU0EF0XI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mythical Kitchen</a> released on Thursday, the legendary skateboarder was asked about the future of the Tony Hawk Pro Skater franchise as it celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. </p>



<p>Hawk said that there is definitely “something” planned to celebrate the anniversary. However, he wouldn’t say much more beyond that.</p>



<p>“I wish I could tell you more,” Hawk said. “But I can tell you that I’ve been talking to Activision again which is insanely exciting. We’re working on something.”</p>



<p>After a bit more back-and-forth on it, Hawk wrapped up with saying that he believes it’ll be something that “the fans will truly appreciate”.</p>



<p>Whether that is a brand new game entirely or the planned then canceled Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3/4 remake remains to be seen. Back in 2022, Hawk confirmed that the plan was to release another remake before developer Vicarious Visions was absorbed into Activision.</p>



<p>What do you think is next for the Pro Skater franchise? Let us know in the comments or join the discussion in our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>Flappy Bird, the infuriating mobile game, is set to make a return later this year.</p>
<p>The game grew to tremendous popularity with over 100 million people playing it, but in 2014 original developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flappy-bird-dev-is-removing-popular-app-for-some-reason">Dong Nguyen removed the game from sale</a> despite it generating a reported $50,000 a day in advertising revenue.</p>
<p>A decade later and Flappy Bird will return this autumn, followed by dedicated mobile apps coming to iOS and Android next year, as well as other platforms.</p>

<figcaption>Flappy Bird is back!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn6Yd-j8DeE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The game's return is thanks to the Flappy Bird Foundation, a team of fans "committed to sharing the game with the world". Together with affiliates, the team has acquired the official rights from Gametech Holdings as well as the rights to Piou Piou vs Cactus - a mobile game long credited as the inspiration behind Flappy Bird.</p>
<p>The new version will include new game modes, characters, and even multiplayer challenges.</p>
<p>"It's been a decade-long, convoluted journey to get here, but we're so excited to finally begin sharing Flappy Bird once again with the world," said a spokesperson for the Flappy Bird Foundation.</p>
<p>Michael Roberts, the chief creative behind Flappy Bird’s return, added: "We are beyond excited to be bringing back Flappy Bird and delivering a fresh experience that will keep players engaged for years to come. We have big plans for our little Bird!"</p>

<p>The developer of Piou Piou, Kek, added: "Today is a milestone not just in gaming but for me personally. It's so cool to see how influential Piou Piou has been for developers and hundreds of millions of gamers over the years. It's incredible to work alongside such a dedicated team of fans and creators who are truly passionate about changing the industry narrative and together bringing the original Flappy Bird back to life."</p>
<p>So <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-the-creator-of-flappy-bird-pulled-the-game-from-sale">why did Nguyen pull the game from sale</a>? "Flappy Bird was designed to play in a few minutes when you are relaxed," he said at the time. "But it happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it's best to take down Flappy Bird. It's gone forever."</p>
<p>Flappy Bird was a viral sensation on release, but its return is certainly a surprise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft will lay off about 650 people from its gaming division, largely in "corporate and support functions," according to an email from Xbox head Phil Spencer sent to staff today. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game File</a> reports that most of the cuts will impact people at Activision Blizzard.</p><p>Spencer called the cuts "part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business" according to his note, published by Game File and other outlets. That acquisition was also cited when Microsoft laid off <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-1900-people-at-activision-blizzard-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,900 gaming employees</a> back in January, which <em>also</em> <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largely affected Activision Blizzard</a>. Both these cuts come following Microsoft's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly $69 billion</a> purchase of Activision Blizzard in October, and as Activision Blizzard continues to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-and-diablo-boost-microsofts-gaming-revenues-but-xbox-sales-continue-to-fall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bolster</a> Microsoft's gaming revenue.</p><p>Spencer wrote that "No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today." This mention is apparently necessary given Microsoft's closure of <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four Bethesda studios back in May</a>. At that time, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/xbox-studio-closures-microsoft-plans-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a> reported that there would be more Xbox cuts to come.</p><p>"Throughout our team’s history, we have had great moments, and we have had challenging ones. Today is one of the challenging days," wrote Spencer, who is probably having a "challenging" day but is not losing his job, despite the fact that he's laid off <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2,550 people</a> since the acquisition. </p><p>Following this year's layoffs and closures, Microsoft has seen an increase in unionization, with workers at <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda Game Studios</a>, on <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Warcraft, </a></em><a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and in Blizzard QA</a><em><a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a></em>unionizing with the Communications Workers of America. While Microsoft signed a labor neutrality agreement with the CWA in 2022, workers at Raven Software <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/microsoft-and-activision-blizzard-accused-of-bad-faith-bargaining-by-raven-software-union-workers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board</a> last month, accusing the company of bad faith bargaining. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-chemical-agents-warbond<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Arrowhead have revealed a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond for next week, and if you've ever wished you could spray the Terminid hordes with lethal gas, then this one's for you.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond">Warbonds</a>, The Chemical Agents doesn't contain any new primary or secondary weapons. Rather, it offers two new Stratagems, one of which is a weapon, while the other is a new drone to help you clear out the hordes more effectively.</p>
<p>First up, the TX-41 Sterilizer is a new Stratagem weapon that you can use to spray your enemies with chemical gas. Drop this one if you think you're going to be facing off against innumerable swarms of bugs or bots.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-the-chemical-agents-warbond-tx-41-sterilizer.jpg?itok=_ovD5qKA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-the-chemical-agents-warbond-tx-41-sterilizer.jpg?itok=6jOtdltB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s The Chemical Agents Warbond does exactly what it says on the tin.</figcaption></figure><p>Your second new weapon of choice is the AX/TX-13 "Guard Dog" Dog Breath, a drone rover that uses a corrosive gas sprayer weapon to deal damage. Between that and the Sterilizer, you'll be unstoppable.</p>
<p>If, however, some of the Terminids should happen to break through your gaseous assault, you can use the new G-4 Gas Grenade to seal the deal. Why not go all gas, all the time with your next loadout?</p>
<p>Two new armor sets are also being released: the lightweight AF-50 Noxious Ranger and the medium AF-02 Haz-Master, both of which come with passives that help you resist the gas clouds you'll be spewing.</p>
<p>You'll also find new emotes, new patterns for your vehicles, and more in this Warbond, so get stuck in if you're thinking it's time for a change of strategy (or a change of aesthetic!).</p>

<p>News of the new Warbond arrives after&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>developer Arrowhead <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4339866697736692015" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pledged sweeping changes for the game</a> last month, including big balance changes, reworked primary weapons and combat, and improved performance, plus more.</p>
<p>Last week, the studio <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4613462911400573371" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed it was hard at work</a> on this initiative, further promising to rework Armor Penetration and Anti-Tank weaponry, as well as "more effective" Autocannons and Heavy Machine Guns.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see how these efforts pan out. For now, though,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and its new The Chemical Agents Warbond launches on September 19th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/transformers-one-review-prequel-optimus-prime-megatron-1851646612<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Maybe ten minutes into <em>Transformers One</em>, the computer-animated prequel to the entire existing saga of Hasbro’s robots in disguise, Scarlett Johansson’s focused mining manager Elita says to Chris Hemsworth’s idealistic worker Orion Pax, “You don’t have the touch <em>or </em>the power.” It’s a clunky, forced reference to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/A52--FKUQgU?si=tscQte1X15tCs0zJ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/A52--FKUQgU?si=tscQte1X15tCs0zJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a cheesy power ballad</a></span> from the original 1986 animated <em>Transformers </em>movie, and it seemed like a bad sign that <em>Transformers One </em>was going to be the kind of film more concerned with winking bits of fan service than with telling a compelling story of its own. Thankfully, however, while it’s ultimately uneven and lacking the inventiveness or visual splendor it would have needed to be truly great, <em>T1 </em>manages to have more smarts and depth than it first lets on. It could serve as a setup for better films to follow, now that all the “origin story” table setting is out of the way.<br></p><p>And make no mistake, this is an origin story top to bottom, and we know how it’s going to end even before it starts. Chris Hemsworth’s character may be called Orion Pax by everyone around him, but we know from the moment we first see him, already sporting that iconic blue and red, that he will be Optimus Prime before all is said and done. This is a movie that, you might say, exists in the context of all that came before it, so your own investment in <em>Transformers </em>will inevitably color your experience. For my part, I was already of moviegoing age when that 1986 cartoon hit theaters, and if <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/james-earl-jones-dies-dead-rip-darth-vader-93-lion-king-1851644027&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/james-earl-jones-dies-dead-rip-darth-vader-93-lion-king-1851644027">the late, great James Earl Jones’</a></span> incredible performance as Darth Vader defined malice and evil for me as a child, Peter Cullen’s work as Optimus Prime defined goodness and virtue just as much. In his acting, he conveyed so much: warmth, compassion, decency, thoughtfulness, a concern with the greater good, a reluctant willingness to sacrifice if that’s what was necessary to do what was right.</p><figure id="" data-id="e0772e03aa0b5a29f9773e7b9ce50c73" data-recommend-id="image://e0772e03aa0b5a29f9773e7b9ce50c73" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Orion Pax watches a holographic archive intently in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Orion Pax watches a holographic archive intently in a moment from Transformers One." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Hasbro</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0772e03aa0b5a29f9773e7b9ce50c73" data-recommend-id="image://e0772e03aa0b5a29f9773e7b9ce50c73" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Orion Pax watches a holographic archive intently in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When we first meet Orion Pax as he recklessly sneaks into a facility where classified archives are kept, in the hopes of learning something he can use to help end the shortage of precious energon plaguing the robots of Cybertron, it’s hard to imagine him growing into the measured, thoughtful leader we know him to be. He wants to make the world better, sure, but he’s also a bit of a goofball, a bit impulsive. To Hemsworth’s credit, however, he finds a path with his voice performance that reflects how the experiences Orion endures over the course of the film change him. And the screenplay smartly takes him through such galvanizing, radicalizing experiences that we believe he would be forever changed.<br></p><p>The origin story ultimately works because it all feels deeply personal for Orion, and it feels personal because of the relationship at its center. Orion’s best friend is his fellow mining bot D-16, voiced by Brian Tyree Henry, one of the most exciting actors working today. And as surely as we know that Orion will be Optimus before the credits roll, we know that D-16, at first his fast friend, will become his eternal nemesis, Megatron. Together, the two of them—along with Elita and Keegan-Michael Key’s B-127 (who someday will be Bumblebee but for now prefers to refer to himself as Badassatron)—go on a journey, discovering truths that will shake Cybertronian society to its core. It helps that some of those truths come from the wonderful voice of Laurence Fishburne, a welcome presence as a robot named Alpha Trion. In one moment, as he’s illuminating long-lost realities of Cybertron’s past, he suggests that the true meaning of “Transformer” may have less to do with being able to change one’s shape and more with being able to change the world. That’s a pretty cool idea.</p><figure id="" data-id="32d62f8747ee0d47fdbf78c7d5981c00" data-recommend-id="image://32d62f8747ee0d47fdbf78c7d5981c00" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Orion Pax offers D-16 a friendly fistbump in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Orion Pax offers D-16 a friendly fistbump in a moment from Transformers One." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Hasbro</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32d62f8747ee0d47fdbf78c7d5981c00" data-recommend-id="image://32d62f8747ee0d47fdbf78c7d5981c00" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Orion Pax offers D-16 a friendly fistbump in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But how do we go about trying to create that change? How do we react when we learn difficult truths, when we learn that the things we believed in were a lie? It’s natural, sometimes even good, to be angry. Anger can fuel us in our desire to fight for something better. But it can also consume us. The most fascinating thing about the plot of <em>Transformers One </em>isn’t the deep, dark secrets that Orion and his friends discover. It’s the way that Orion learns what kind of leader he wants to be by watching what D-16’s anger over those discoveries does to him, and deciding what kind of leader he <em>doesn’t </em>want to be.</p><p>It’s heartbreaking and a little horrifying seeing how D-16 is changed by the truths he learns and the injustices he discovers. He’s all the more compelling as a villain because we understand why he’s so outraged, and we feel the pain Orion feels in watching his friend lose his way. Near the end of the film, his simmering rage leads him to commit a shocking act of public brutality against another robot, and it’s tragic to see him become a demagogue who uses the rhetoric of dominance and violence to appeal to the basest impulses of those who end up following him–those who become the Decepticons. While Optimus becomes something like a labor organizer, using solidarity to encourage oppressed robots to toss off their chains and arguing that “freedom and autonomy are the rights of all sentient beings,” Steve Buscemi’s Starscream expresses the opposing ideology like this: “The idea of a unified Cybertron is a myth. The only thing that matters is the strength of one bot to dominate all.” It’s an idea that many find seductive at times, but it offers nothing but rot. (I feel like there’s something relevant in this kids’ cartoon to current events but I can’t quite put my finger on it.)</p><figure id="" data-id="28ed9597ce00afc3aa09e4c4b56d615a" data-recommend-id="image://28ed9597ce00afc3aa09e4c4b56d615a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Megatron threatens another robot with his massive arm cannon in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Megatron threatens another robot with his massive arm cannon in a moment from Transformers One." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Hasbro</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="28ed9597ce00afc3aa09e4c4b56d615a" data-recommend-id="image://28ed9597ce00afc3aa09e4c4b56d615a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Megatron threatens another robot with his massive arm cannon in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Anyway, the film’s climax is strong, a showdown which crystallizes the identities of these two friends-turned-adversaries and left me eager to see more of them, now that they are the Optimus Prime and Megatron we’ve known for so long. (It even, to my delight, nods to Optimus’ long history as a kind of Christ figure.) But that’s not quite enough to make <em>Transformers One </em>a great film in its own right. For most of its runtime it’s passably enjoyable, but sorely lacking the kind of ingenuity a film like this needs to establish itself as more than just another piece of corporate entertainment. There are no sequences here on par with the awe-inspiring action of the <em>Spider-Verse </em>films, for instance, nor any imagery as memorable as the unforgettable planet-sized robot Unicron from the 1986 <em>Transformers </em>movie.<br></p><p>I saw the film in 3D, which definitely enhances the film’s visuals, giving the central setting of Iacon City a wonderfully layered depth, but <em>Transformers One </em>never figures out how to make the most of its vistas in its action scenes, which often feel like arbitrary diversions from the story rather than involving sequences that contribute to the film or our understanding of the characters in a meaningful way. An early racing scene, for instance, just kind of happens, offering lots of sensory diversion with plenty of robots zooming really fast, but it’s hard to feel invested in it because it’s not shot in a particularly exciting way and Orion and D-16 just kind of fumble their way through it. It’s not until that final showdown, when the characters are each fighting desperately for what they believe in and the stakes feel truly high, that the action really starts to land. In this emotionally heightened context, a callback (or, I guess, call forward, since this is a prequel) to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRlZYeRKy08&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRlZYeRKy08" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a famous line from another <em>Transformers </em>movie</a></span> feels not like the clunky reference-dropping that <em>Transformers One </em>indulges in a bit too often, but like a real, defining moment in the relationship between these two, and man, it hurts.</p><figure id="" data-id="31683c65f39c5d15c4c62d41185be9c3" data-recommend-id="image://31683c65f39c5d15c4c62d41185be9c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Optimus Prime is seen with a glowing core in the center of his chest in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Optimus Prime is seen with a glowing core in the center of his chest in a moment from Transformers One." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Hasbro</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31683c65f39c5d15c4c62d41185be9c3" data-recommend-id="image://31683c65f39c5d15c4c62d41185be9c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Optimus Prime is seen with a glowing core in the center of his chest in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like a number of origin stories, <em>Transformers One </em>has the problem of ending right when it feels like things are really getting underway. Now that the dynamic is established and we understand that Optimus Prime and Megatron are two leaders with fundamentally different ideologies and approaches to the idea of making things better for those who’ve been wronged, I can see stronger films following in its wake, direct sequels that continue the story on Cybertron long before the robots make their way to Earth.
