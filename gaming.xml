But the team has gotten pretty good at detecting cheaters and banning their accounts. </p><p>One interesting stat that Chess.com’s Fair Play team shared in the blog post is that nearly 40 percent of closed accounts are less than two weeks old. This means the team’s methods of finding and punishing naughty players and bots are doing a solid job of catching cheaters early. But Chess.com thinks it can do an even better job at keeping cheaters out. </p><p>“One of the ways we’re tackling this phenomenon is by screening players more frequently early in their journey on the platform,” said Chess.com’s Fair Play team. “This means we’re generating reports for players that essentially serve as checkpoints as they play more games. It is entirely reasonable (and expected) that it may take time for someone to establish their rating, so these checkpoints go beyond games played and rating earned, but also include strength of play and over 100 other gameplay factors.”</p><p>The team also shared that it uses algorithms to look out for extraordinary examples of cheating or inhuman behavior. With only 30 people watching and 20 million games a day, it makes sense that the team would need extra help. All of this is in service of making sure most players who hop onto Chess.com have a good time.

        <p>"Corporate cowardice in action".</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Valve has introduced new - and worryingly vague - guidelines aimed at the adult-only game development community, forbidding content that may "violate the rules and standards" set by credit card companies, internet network providers, and more.
</p>
<p>
It's not precisely clear when Valve introduced this <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding">latest rule</a> stipulating what developers "shouldn't publish on Steam", but it appears to have been added sometime in the last couple of months. So what's now banned from the platform? According to Valve, "Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by [its] payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers."
</p>
<p>
There's some small nod toward additional clarity, but it's not much. Valve suggests developers should "in particular, [avoid publishing] certain kinds of adult only content", but provides no specifics beyond that. Banks have long been skittish about providing services to businesses where sex and adult entertainment may be a factor, but - as this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/16/sex-discrimination-why-banks-shun-workers-in-adult-entertainment">2021 article from The Guardian points out</a> - their inconsistency has proven a challenge for business owners. Which might be where Valve's own decision to err on the side of vagueness was born.
</p>
<p>
Valve, of course, has made headlines recently after a number of controversial sex games appeared on its store, so it's easy enough to imagine banks and similar financial services getting uncomfortable when a platform hits the news for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk">publishing content featuring extreme sexual violence</a>. And it seems Valve may have become skittish in return. As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lu32vdlsmg27">noted by SteamDB</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-introduces-new-rule-prohibiting-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-that-might-make-visa-or-mastercard-unhappy-financial-deplatforming-in-action/">PC Gamer</a>), it appears the company - which previously said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-backs-away-from-content-policing-says-it-will-allow-everything-on-steam">would "allow everything" on Steam</a> unless illegal or "straight up trolling" - has been frantically pulling incest-themed games from its store in recent times.
</p>
<p>
The vagueness of Valve's wording means confusion and concern among adult content developers is likely to intensify as they grapple with the reality that financial institutions may now be the ultimate arbiters of ever-changing acceptability on Steam. And some have expressed concern this new authority may start impacting the availability of LGBTQIA+ content as corporations buckle to appease the US government's continuing attack on queer rights.
</p>
<p>
"It's the quiet normalisation of financial censorship and it's going to hurt LGBTQ+ games and devs," YouTuber NoahFuel Gaming <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/noahfuelgaming.bsky.social/post/3lu2ngnm3hc26">wrote on social media</a>. "Banks like Visa and Mastercard are now backdoor moral authorities... They already pressured Patreon, OnlyFans, and others to remove NSFW content. Now Steam is next. And guess who they'll target first? Queer, transgressive, or "unusual" games... Queer content gets flagged as 'explicit' even when it's PG... If banks raise a fuss, they'll nuke anything that could be controversial. And they'll say, 'It's out of our hands.' Corporate cowardice in action."
</p>
<p>
Valve hasn't yet publicly addressed its new policy but we've reached out for more information.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo just announced the two leads of its live-action <em>Legend of Zelda</em> film, and unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690607/chris-pratt-mario-nintendo-illumination-animated-movie-december-2022-release-date-cast">celebrity-packed <em>Mario</em> movie cast</a>, <em>Zelda</em> will star <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/708143/nintendo-zelda-movie-casting-bo-bragason-benjamin-evan-ainsworth">two young, lesser-known actors</a>: Bo Bragason as Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. You may not have heard of them, but there’s a good chance they’re going to be a part of the franchise for a while.</p><p>Choosing stars who are in their teens (Ainsworth) and early 20s (Bragason) makes a lot of sense. In the games, even the “older” Links and Zeldas are still typically young adults, so Bragason and Ainsworth seem like they’ll fit the mold. (Yes, I know Link and Zelda are technically older than 100 in <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom,</em> but they look good for their age.) The choice of younger actors gives them both room to grow into the roles in any potential sequels — which, given Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671949/nintendo-switch-2-era-risks">growing ambitions beyond video games</a>, the company must already be starting to consider.</p><p>We can look at Nintendo’s recent expansion of Mario beyond games as an example of what might be in store for <em>Zelda</em>. <em>The Super Mario Bros. </em>movie, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review">surprisingly good</a>, quickly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">surpassed $1 billion at the box office</a>, and a sequel is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/10/24096213/super-mario-bros-movie-2-sequel-2026">set to debut in 2026</a>. A <em>Donkey Kong</em> spinoff <a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/706610/donkey-kong-movie-copyright-notice-nintendo-strategy">might also be in the works</a>. Both franchises are featured in Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan">theme</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293604/super-nintendo-world-theme-park-donkey-kong-country-osaka-date">parks</a>, too. It’s not hard to imagine Nintendo applying the same blueprint for the Zelda franchise.</p><p>The <em>Zelda</em> movie has the potential to be a similarly huge hit. The franchise is arguably as popular as it has ever been; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> was the fourth-best-selling game on the original Switch, after all, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> was an excellent followup. If this first <em>Zelda</em> film is even halfway decent, Bragason and Ainsworth might be representative of Zelda and Link for an entire generation of fans.</p><p>The two aren’t complete unknowns – Ainsworth voiced Pinocchio in Disney’s 2022 version of the film and played a major role in Netflix’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21508362/haunting-of-bly-manor-review-netflix"><em>The Haunting of Bly Manor</em></a> – but Nintendo is still taking a gamble by hinging a potentially risky adaptation on them. They’ll likely be in good hands with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23951339/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-live-action-nintendo">Wes Ball as director</a>, though, who is known for his work directing the <em>Maze Runner</em> trilogy and <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em>.</p><p>Nintendo is borrowing from a proven strategy here. Warner Bros. recently introduced its <em>second</em> trio of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/674752/hbo-harry-potter-cast-dominic-mclaughlin-arabella-stanton-alastair-stout">young leads for <em>Harry Potter</em></a>, and they’ll be the faces of a new decade-long series for HBO, much like Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint were before them for the <em>Harry Potter</em> films. Netflix has similarly stuck with the <em>Stranger Things</em> kids <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707540/stranger-things-5-teaser-trailer-netflix">all the way through the end</a>, even though the first season debuted nearly 10 years ago.</p><p><em>The Legend of Zelda</em> film could be Nintendo’s next breakout cultural moment when it debuts <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682751/legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie-date-delay">in May 2027</a>. If it is, we’ll probably be seeing a lot more adventures starring Zelda and Link.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/708494/nintendo-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-leads-stars-long-time]]></content:encoded>

It’s definitely worth checking out if you’re looking to save money on recent AAA games. You can get PS5 deals like Elden Ring Nightreign for $27.99 and Doom: The Dark Ages for $39.99. You’re not likely to find those kinds of discounts anywhere else for quite a while on new copies of those games, especially after Prime Day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The caveat is that all of the games are pre-played (more info on that below). You can shop the <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xJP1?object_uuid=848aaa0c-ba68-4e83-981e-ef794d5afd9c&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">whole sale here</a>, or read on for our picks.</p><p id="shop-the-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Shop the sale">Save Up to 50% Off Pre-Played Games at GameFly </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun twist on the From Software formula perfected in the original Elden Ring. It turns the game into a three-player co-op roguelite. It might not be for everyone (see our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review">review</a> for details), but $27.99 makes it much more palatable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom: The Dark Ages may be available for Xbox players on Game Pass, but that doesn’t apply to PS5 owners. So this is a great way to play through it at significantly less than the new game MSRP. Check out our 9/10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a> for more info on that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also on sale are Civ 7, Monster Hunter Wilds, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and many more. You can even save cash on Blu-rays like Mickey 17 and Mufasa: The Lion King. Lots of savings to go around.</p><p id="should-you-buy-from-gamefly"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Should you buy from GameFly?">Is GameFly a Good Place to Buy Used Games?</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything you buy from GameFly is “pre-played,” meaning it’s been sent out to GameFly customers. That said, everything GameFly sells in these sales is in good condition. It also comes with brand-new new cases and inserts where applicable. I’ve bought games in previous GameFly sales, and I never would’ve guessed they were used, aside from arriving without shrink wrap. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these games are also “100% guaranteed,” so if you have any problem with them, you can get a full refund. Buying pre-played games is a good way to pick up recent games at way cheaper than new pricing. And this sale knocks even more money off the pre-played discount, which is essentially stacking a deal on a deal. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

Switch 2 upgrades the now-classic hybrid console with a larger 7.9-inch HDR touchscreen, 4K dock output, and GameChat voice and video chat. If you've been holding out for the newest Switch, now is a good time to request an invite before stock dries up again.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also grab the Pokémon TCG Scarlet and Violet Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box for $88.95, which is slightly below market value. It includes nine booster packs, a full-art promo card featuring Team Rocket’s Wobbuffet, and plenty of extras like card sleeves, dice, and a collector’s box. I've got more deals comming your way too. Including the INIU 10,000mAh 45W Power Bank for $12, a 5-pack of six-foot USB-C charging cables for $6.99, the Superman 2025 Steelbook 4K Blu-ray, and TCL’s 55-inch QM6K Mini LED Smart TV for $449.99, $350 off its usual price.

This also mean said chase cards are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-cards-2025">worth significantly less</a>, but Japanese cards are far easier to get perfect grades in given they're always busting out of booster packs in perfect condition. Want a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Pokémon card collection</a> on a budget?

Whilst that unfortunately means it's still way above MSRP, some of these sets are at the best prices they've been in the last month.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">This Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet base set prices have been shifting noticeably ahead of the final sets Black Bolt and White Flare, with Psychic-type Illustration Rares like Ralts 211/198 and Kirlia 212/198 each climbing 28 percent this month while Gardevoir ex 245/198 now sits at $54.99 after a 25 percent jump. Miraidon ex and Koraidon ex are both trending upward as well, holding value around $23.99 each. At the same time several cards are sliding down as Fidough 213/198 dropped 15 percent, Armarouge 203/198 is down 11 percent, and Pachirisu 208/198 fell 19 percent. The steepest dips hit Dondozo 207/198 and Starly 221/198, now around $9.99 each after dropping 30 percent and 37 percent respectively, reflecting a market that is narrowing in on long-term playability and collector interest.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As newer Pokémon TCG sets grab the spotlight, Paradox Rift is seeing its high-rarity SIR ex cards drop in value while several Illustration Rares quietly climb due to shifting collector interest and low inventory. Cards like Altaria ex, Gholdengo ex, and Steelix have dropped between 16% and 25%, while Illustration Rares including Morpeko, Plusle, Minun, Groudon, and Iron Valiant ex are climbing fast, with Morpeko leading at a 43% increase. This mirrors earlier trends where less flashy cards gain traction as availability tightens.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Edge of Eternities Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering’s next set, Edge of Eternities, officially launches August 1 with preorders now live on Amazon for bundles including Play Booster Boxes, Commander Decks, and Collector Booster Boxes. Blending Magic’s iconic gameplay with science fantasy themes such as flying space whales and alien races, Edge of Eternities introduces four new mechanics: Void, Warp, Station, and Lander Tokens. Fan-favorite tribes like Eldrazi and Slivers return alongside reprints of coveted Shock Lands. Wizards of the Coast is gradually revealing more details, with a full card gallery arriving July 18 and prerelease events happening July 25 through 31, so now is the time to lock in your preorder if you want first access.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Pricing Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a bit of a mixed back for Magic: The Gathering prices this week, so it's always worth double checking eBay before TCG Player and Amazon for a last minute bargain. Also, whoever thinks a Theros Beyond Death booster is worth north of $700 needs to have a word with themselves.</p><p id="nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-worl"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart Worl">Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225375"><div id="225375" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Invites available now on Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still struggling to get your hands on Nintendo Switch 2?

I grew up playing these games, so jumping back in with the ability to duel online and unlock classic cards feels pretty great.

The standard Blu-ray is still available though if you’re just looking to watch the movie without the collectible packaging. James Gunn delivers a Superman story that feels fresh while staying true to the character. There’s a solid balance of action, humor, and heart, and it sets a strong tone for what’s next in the DCU. If you’re into superhero movies that keep things grounded while still feeling big and cinematic, this one’s worth picking up.</p></div><p id="split-fiction-ps5"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Split Fiction (PS5)">Split Fiction (PS5)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225246"><div id="225246" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Split Fiction (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed Split Fiction on PS5 recently and it’s been a great pick for co-op sessions. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">We gave it a 9 out of 10</a> and after playing it I can see why. It focuses on split-screen teamwork where you and a partner have to sync your actions to clear each challenge. I really like how each level introduces new mechanics and switches between sci-fi and fantasy settings so it never feels repetitive. Mio and Zoe’s story adds some extra depth too since they do not get along at first but that dynamic makes the whole adventure feel more personal as things ramp up.</p></div><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-earbuds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds">Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225247"><div id="225247" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I keep noticing for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features.

The active noise cancellation blocks out a lot of background noise while adaptive audio automatically adjusts based on your surroundings. You get four sizes of silicone tips for a customizable fit, and once those are set they stay comfortable even through longer listening sessions. The personalized spatial audio and hearing aid features add extra depth, giving them more flexibility than just a standard pair of wireless earbuds.</p></div><p id="dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switc">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225248"><div id="225248" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake</a> caught my attention for how it brings that classic RPG feel into a modern format. At $34.99, it’s a pretty big discount compared to the usual price, which makes it an easy pick if you’ve been waiting to try it. The HD-2D visuals really stand out with that mix of pixel art and depth that makes the world feel fresh but still familiar. Battles stick to the traditional turn-based system but with small updates like adjustable speed and auto-battle, so it doesn’t feel stuck in the past.

That's because Update 2.3 is on the way, arriving tomorrow, and features new quests, vehicles, Photo Mode additions, PC tech improvements, VRR on consoles, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Update 2.3 is the last big update, says CD Projekt Red (we believe them this time, considering Cyberpunk 2 has moved into pre-production as of May), and hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC tomorrow. Switch 2 players running through Night City via Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will have to wait for a "later date" to receive the Update 2.3 additions, however.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/McF9Ak1r7L8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/McF9Ak1r7L8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"This patch introduces 4 new vehicles, the AutoDrive feature, self-driving Delamain cabs, and more," the <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes">patch notes</a> read. "It also contains update for CrystalCoat and Photo Mode, as well as support for AMD FSR 3.1 Frame Generation, Intel XeSS 2.0, and HDR10+ gaming on PC, among others."</p><p>Update 2.3 also brings Cyberpunk 2077 to Mac computers running on Apple Silicon. You can purchase the game via the Mac App Store and the other usual PC storefronts.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-worry-about-me-being-a-nepo-baby-says-nepo-baby.1245501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year, Ubisoft <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a $1.25 billion bailout from Tencent</a>, resulting in the creation of a new subsidiary – partially owned by Tencent – that will take charge of Ubisoft’s three biggest series: <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. While details of how the operation will function remain sparse, we now know who’ll head it up: co-CEOs Christophe Derennes, former head of Ubisoft Montreal and managing director for North America who’s been with the company for over three decades, and Charlie Guillemot, whose main distinguishing feature is that he’s Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot’s son.&nbsp;</p><p>Is Guillemot the very definition of a nepo baby? I mean, yeah, sure, probably. Don’t worry about it, though!</p><p>"I’d like to address this question directly, if I may," Guillemot said in response to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a question from Variety about nepotism</a>. "I completely understand where it comes from, and I want to be clear about it. Yes, I’m Yves’ son. That’s not something I hide from. But my appointment isn’t only about family ties; it’s about what Ubisoft needs at this moment. ... What matters now isn’t my name, it’s the work ahead."</p><p>Guillemot also reassured Variety that he’s spent the past decade "building experience both inside and outside Ubisoft,” which is true. For example, he ran the Ubisoft studio behind <em>Tom Clancy’s Elite Squad</em>, which found itself in the crosshairs of controversy in 2020 after launching with an intro that was widely panned for <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-apologizes-for-tom-clancy-game-imagery-that-sug-1844892904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playing on right-wing conspiracies about Black Lives Matter</a>. He then struck out on his own to launch a Web3 studio called Unagi, which has predictably pivoted into AI but is also still clinging desperately to NFTs, before beaming back onto the Ubisoft fathership.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft has faced a great deal of criticism for its continued status as a pop ‘n’ pop (‘n’ pop ‘n’ pop) shop. The company was founded by five Guillemot brothers – Yves, Christian, Claude, Gérard, and Michel – in 1986, with four remaining in positions of power at the company to this day. However, recent times have not been kind to the Guillemot family’s reputation; allegations of widespread sexual abuse, harassment, and discrimination <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-and-insomniac-face-dozens-of-allegations-over-mistreatment-of-women" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit the company in 2020</a>, leading to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-france" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the conviction of three former Ubisoft executives</a> following a 2025 trial.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft’s business has also swirled a precarious drain in recent years, with sales of expected hits, like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, coming in “<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/star-wars-outlaws-coming-to-steam-in-november-sales-have-been-softer-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">softer than expected</a>” while longer-tail online games like <em>Skull And Bones</em> and <em>XDefiant</em> have floundered and failed. Despite this, the Guillemot family reportedly <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ubisoft-buyout-talks-are-reportedly-progressing-but-theres-one-small-hitch-the-guillemot-family-wants-to-stay-in-charge-but-tencent-isnt-so-sure-about-that/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fought to remain in charge</a> during pre-deal talks with Tencent, and now, here we are.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, best of luck to Charlie in his new role. After all, everyone deserves a little nepotism, as a treat.</p><p>“Ubisoft is at a pivotal moment,” he told Variety. “What’s expected of me is to help push the company forward by bringing energy, focus, and by relying on the incredible expertise that already exists across the teams. I see myself as someone here to contribute, support, and help create the right conditions are in place for everyone to do their best work.”</p><p>Sure! Cool!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-keep-it-in-the-family-with-their-new-subsidiary-for-core-games.1245483/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft have recently <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/">set up a new subsidiary</a> within their company which will focus on three&nbsp;core games, Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry.&nbsp; The set-up also involves $1.25 billion in investment from the French game publisher from Tencent.</p>
<p>Heading up this new take are two fresh-faced individuals ready to bring a new dynamic to Ubi.. oh wait. Scratch that, it’s being headed up by Christophe Derennes who launched the Montreal studio, and has been with the company 35 years, and Charlie <em>“Do you know who my Dad is”</em> Guillemot. Charlie is most famous for running Owlient, which made free to play game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howrse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howrse</a> in the late 2010s, and Unagi, which has made four web3 games that <a href="https://www.unagi.games/#token" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use NFTS</a>.&nbsp; Sounds just the chap to look after Rainbow Six, maybe they will add horseback combat with some gorgeous NFT horse armour.</p>


<p>We know that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/10/assassins-creed-codename-red-is-going-to-japan-codename-hexe-infinity-also-confirmed/">Assassin’s Creed: Codename Hexe</a> is on the way along with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/10/assassins-creed-codename-red-is-going-to-japan-codename-hexe-infinity-also-confirmed/">Animus hub</a> which will tie together all the games, but we’ve not heard anything about a new Rainbow Six or Far Cry.</p>
<p>“Today Ubisoft is opening a new chapter in its history,” Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot wrote for the announcement. “As we accelerate the company’s transformation, this is a foundational step in changing Ubisoft’s operating model that will enable us to be both agile and ambitious. We are focused on building strong game ecosystems designed to become evergreen, growing high-performing brands and creating new IPs powered by cutting-edge and emerging technologies.”</p>

<p>Rumours of a hostile takeover of Ubisoft appear quite regularly, but so far, the Guillemot family has remained in charge.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-release-date-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-claiming-fc-26-fixes-key-problems-players-have-with-the-series.1245477/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has announced that its annual football simulation game series, EA Sports FC, will return on September 26, 2025, with EA Sports FC 26. Alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the cover athlete for the Ultimate Edition of the game, Jude Bellingham and Jamal Musiala have been revealed as the main cover athletes. EA also showed players their first look at gameplay for this year's entry into the long-running series, with a trailer that claims EA Sports FC 26 includes fixes for several key issues players have with the games. </p>



<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-reveal-this-week-zlatan-cover-athlete/">EA announced that it would reveal EA Sports FC 26</a>, teasing the return of Ibrahimovic as one of the cover athletes. The process these games usually follow, is that the first trailer features very little, if any gameplay, and is instead a vehicle for introducing the tone of the year's entry, cover athletes, and the release date. We got all of that in today's trailer, and on top of it, we got a good look at some gameplay, and the improvements that EA is touting. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSi0iJYSQ24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Throughout the trailer, text bubbles appear posing as comments from players criticizing different elements of gameplay, such as the complaint that EA is too slow to show actual gameplay. EA attempts to change the narrative at the top of the trailer, switching from a cutscene to gameplay, and into a sequence where EA shows changes and fixes it has made in EA Sports FC 26 that solve the problems players have with the games.</p>



<p>The message of this year's entry is "<em>Innovation powered by you in every mode</em>," and that the overhauled gameplay experience has been built directly on player feedback. Whether that's actually how it'll feel when players get to test it for themselves remains to be seen.</p>



<p>"<em>FC 26 reflects our ongoing commitment to building this game with and for our community,</em>" said John Shepherd, vice president and general manager of EA Sports FC in a press release. "<em>We are players too, and that shared passion drives everything we do. This year brings an overhauled gameplay experience, new tournaments and live events in FUT, all-new archetype customization in clubs, and a career mode that comes alive through evolving challenges. We can't wait for players to feel the difference this September and help shape the future of FC</em>."</p>

At the center of the complaint are allegations that Krafton tried to sabotage the Early Access release for one of Steam’s most wishlisted games in order to avoid having to pay a $250 million bonus. “In the name of its bottom line, Krafton has thrown its promises out the window and ripped the game from the hands of both its creators and its community,” the lawsuit claims.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,196299,195922" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Those and other allegations are contained in a new 58-page lawsuit, a public version of which was filed in Delaware Chancery Court on July 16 on behalf of ousted Unknown Worlds cofounders Charles Cleveland, Adam “Max” McGuire, and Edward “Ted” Gill (the group’s legal team provided <em>Kotaku</em> with a copy). It details an alleged ramping-up of efforts by Krafton to delay<em> Subanutica 2</em>'s planned 2025 release in order to avoid triggering provisions from the October 2021 sale of the studio that would lead to a $250 million bonus payout if certain sales goals were met through early 2026. </p><p>According to the lawsuit, the terms of that agreement prohibited Krafton from firing any of the founders without cause or interfering in the studio’s business in any way that might impact that payout. Unknown Worlds would “maintain operational control of the Group companies in all material respects, including (for both existing and new products) product roadmap, launch, planning, partnering, budgeting and employee matters” as long as at least one of the cofounders remained employed there. </p><p>The founders claim the business relationship didn’t begin going south until earlier this year when projections for <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s sales were shared with Krafton management, one of which showed them hitting the targets required for the $250 million payout. “During the first week of April 2025, Unknown Worlds’ publishing colleagues in Krafton’s El Segundo, California office traveled to Korea to finalize the marketing and advertising strategy for <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s launch,” the lawsuit reads. “Upon their return, the El Segundo team—Krafton employees—reported to Gill that Krafton’s leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game.”</p><p> Things came to a head in a May 2025 milestone review, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101">portions of which leaked online last week</a></span>, in which Krafton argued the game needed more content and development time against the recommendation of the founders. From there, the founders alleged that Krafton began trying to sabotage the launch by locking down all publishing resources, failing to respond to emails with third-party partners, and claiming control over the final release date decision. </p><p>“One of Krafton’s El Segundo publishing employees reported to Gill that Krafton Headquarters told all Krafton teams to stop all creative tasks related to <em>Subnautica 2</em>,” the lawsuit reads. “The employee’s supervisor even demanded that he and his team cease communication with Unknown Worlds altogether.”</p><p>Then in June, according to the lawsuit, Krafton tried to get Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill to take a lower payout while also claiming that the founders were failing in their contractual obligations to the company. “On June 25, 2025, Krafton’s Head of Corporate Development told Gill that Krafton’s plan was to remove the Unknown Worlds board and fire the Founders,” the lawsuit reads.</p><p> “She warned Gill that ‘the lawyers are ready to go.’” They were fired roughly a week later, with termination letters from Striking Distance Studios CEO Steve Papoutsis, who has since taken over Unknown Worlds, blaming the founders’ “intention to proceed with a premature release of<em> Subnautica 2</em>.” According to the lawsuit, the firings were made “without cause,” and Krafton even went so far as to offer them their “post-termination payments and benefits” for being terminated “without cause.” </p><p>The lawsuit concludes:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>In short, Krafton flagrantly breached both the letter and the spirit of the promises at the very core of its agreement to purchase Unknown Worlds. It promised to leave creative and operational control in the hands of the Founders. Promise broken. It promised to consult with the Founders before taking any action that could harm the earnout. Promise broken. It promised not to take any action with the primary business purpose of frustrating the earnout. Promise broken. And it promised not to terminate the Founders without Cause. Promise broken.</p></blockquote><p>The founders’ side of the story comes after weeks of vague statements on Reddit and confusing press releases from Krafton, who has argued that the founders were fired for failing to get <em>Subnautica 2</em> ready for a successful Early Access release. In particular, the leaked milestone review points to concerns that a lack of biomes and story content would result in the game failing to meet player expectations for a sequel. It’s denied that the prospective payout, 10 percent of which was due to some of Unknown Worlds’ roughly 100 developers, had anything to do with the management shakeup. </p><p>Caught in the middle are those working on the game who still need to deliver it, one way or the other. With <em>Subnautica 2 </em>now coming out in 2026, Krafton has promised employees that it will extend the bonus payout window to make up for the delay as well as advance them money from next year’s profit-sharing pool, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjYwOTQyNSwiZXhwIjoxNzUzMjE0MjI1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWkdJMVNUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.eu_sHgKRf9uj-U3I1UDNgrJnNjE39Q3OcbLzDsn2xWY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjYwOTQyNSwiZXhwIjoxNzUzMjE0MjI1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWkdJMVNUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.eu_sHgKRf9uj-U3I1UDNgrJnNjE39Q3OcbLzDsn2xWY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>There are countless Android-powered gaming handhelds, but they go beyond the usual slate of Android games by offering console emulation support. The problem is the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/can-a-digital-lending-library-solve-classic-gamings-piracy-problem/">game ROMs</a> on these devices, which are not entirely legal. Italian YouTuber Once Were Nerd is learning how seriously some rightsholders are taking game piracy after agents from the country's Guardia di Finanza showed up to confiscate his consoles. He now says the investigation could lead to criminal charges and the end of his channel.</p>
<p>Once Were Nerd has produced YouTube content covering a plethora of gaming topics, including Android-based handheld game machines from the likes of Powkiddy and TrimUI. These devices usually run an older version of Android that has been heavily modified for gaming, featuring built-in emulation support for retro consoles like SNES, Nintendo 64, PlayStation Portable, GameCube, and more. They've become quite popular as the cost of mobile hardware has come down, making it possible to buy what is essentially an updated PSP or Game Boy Advance for $100 or less.</p>
<p>Recently, Once Were Nerd attracted the attention of Italy's Ministry of Economy and Finance, which is tasked with policing copyright in the country. In the video first spotted by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/once-were-nerd-youtuber-copyright-lawsuit-3577995/">Android Authority</a> (which has an AI-generated English language track), the YouTuber explains that Guardia di Finanza appeared at his door in April with a search warrant.</p>

      Once Were Nerd explains his legal woes.

<p>Agents accused the creator of promoting pirated copyrighted materials stemming from his coverage of Anbernic handheld game consoles. While emulation software is not illegal, a surprising number of these devices ship chock-full of pre-loaded ROMs—the channel showed multiple Sony and Nintendo games running on the device. Once Were Nerd is far from the only channel posting about these devices, though.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/umamusume-horse-expert-interview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/video-game-horse-expert-on-umamusume-%E2%80%98i-have-supremely-mixed-feelings%E2%80%99.1245456/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Once you get past <em>Umamusume</em>’s odd premise – and get so into it that you start <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/anime-horse-girls-are-causing-one-real-life-mare-dubbed-the-shining-star-of-losers-everywhere-to-receive-so-much-usd40-grass-she-broke-the-donation-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buying high-grade $40 grass</a> for a real horse – it’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hard not to love</a> the anime girl horse game that’s become a sensation on Twitch and Steam. But the video game industry’s premiere horse game consultant, Alice Ruppert, finds herself more bemused than amused.</p><p>Ruppert has spent years of her career trying to get gaming companies to take horses seriously and running <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mane Quest</a>, a site dedicated to video game horses. The fact is, many games mess up horses to an almost comedic degree – <a href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-horses-red-dead-redemption-2-horse-testicles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether we’re talking their legs or their testicles</a> – and the ones that focus on equine excursions first and foremost don’t tend to boast the biggest budgets or best development pedigrees. This typically relegates them to a niche. But now, finally, a horse game for the masses has appeared. <em>Umamusume </em>is already, per Ruppert’s own estimate, "by far the most well-known and well-reviewed game focused on equestrian sports.” Problem is, it’s only sort of a horse game.</p><p>"I have supremely mixed feelings,” Ruppert, who has said that <em>Umamusume</em>’s popularity relative to more traditional horse games is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/malicedafirenze.bsky.social/post/3ltjjxghwus2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going to turn her into The Joker</a>, told Aftermath. “It's not that I don't think this should exist, and I don't think it's bad that people are having fun with a silly sports game that features girls as horses. I do very much see the harmless fun in it. … [But] it's not about horses, which is usually what my criteria for something being a horse game is. But it is very much within that world of horse racing. It is very much inspired by real horse racing."&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I do very much see the harmless fun in it. … [But] it's not about horses, which is usually what my criteria for something being a horse game is.</p></blockquote></figure><p><em>Umamusume</em>’s determined not-quite-centaurs are all based on real racehorses, a genuinely interesting twist that’s resulted in fans forming parasocial relationships with the handful that are still alive, because nobody can just be normal about anything anymore. On that front, Ruppert appreciates the game’s attention to detail.</p><p>"Some of the characters have different colored shoes or socks depending on the leg marking of the horse she represents,” Ruppert said. “And many of them match the hair color to mane color and stuff like that. That's cute. That's attention to detail that I don't see in the horse games that I usually review."</p><p>But that gets to the heart of Ruppert’s conflicted feelings about <em>Umamusume</em>: “I am convinced that a good horse racing game about actual horses could do just as well if it was implemented just as well. I spent years trying to chase after what other horse games do wrong. What do so many of them do so bad? How do they harm their own reach and potential?”</p><p>Ruppert sees potential in a few horse games of today and tomorrow, but <em>Umamusume </em>is in a league of its own.</p><p>“We're seeing more things now where people actually try and take a chance on the horse game audience, with stuff like<em> Windstorm: Legend of Khiimori</em> or <em>Equinox: Homecoming</em>,” said Ruppert. “<em>Equinox: Homecoming</em> doesn't have comparable numbers [to <em>Umamusume</em>] on Steam. I'm not saying it necessarily should, but there's a difference in the amount of polish and reach that [<em>Umamusume</em>] came out with. I so badly wish there were actual horse games like that."</p><p>But of course, there’s an easy argument against Ruppert’s impassioned pleas: <em>Umamusume </em>is first and foremost an anime girl gacha game and, secondarily, a horse game. One of these things, you would think, is always going to grab more eyeballs than the other. Ruppert, however, disagrees.</p><p>"I've seen the argument of 'Yeah, of course this is bigger than any horse games; it has anime girls in it. It's the roster of conventionally attractive, nice, pretty ladies that you get,’” said Ruppert. “But that's missing big parts of the equation for me. On one hand, we simply don't know how many people would play a good horse game if it were made with comparable production value, because nobody's done it."</p><figure><blockquote><p>We simply don't know how many people would play a good horse game if it were made with comparable production value, because nobody's done it.</p></blockquote></figure><p>She even believes streamers might latch onto a well-made horse game in a similarly ironic way, if only because people have spent decades joking about <em>Barbie Horse Adventures</em> and games of the like.</p><p>“I've definitely seen some amount of similar reactions to games actually about horses, where people are like 'Let's try this for shits and giggles,' and then it ends up being actually fun,” she said. “That kind of explosion could technically happen to a horse game as well. I've heard enough people make jokes about horse games that lots of streamers would consider it super absurd. … It’s very hard to predict that, because you never know which trends will pick up steam, but I don’t consider it outside the realm of possibility.”</p><p>For now, though, Ruppert believes that most horse-focused games lack the necessary meat on their bones to gallop to the front of the pack. If nothing else, she says, they could stand to study <em>Umamusume</em>’s core gameplay loop – or assemble any sort of satisfying core loop at all. As with a great many things in this world, more money would go a long way toward solving the problem.</p><p>"Some of the games I review have budgets of $100,000-$200,000 [while] being multiplatform releases. That's nothing. That's no money at all,” she said. “It's not surprising that they don't have time for iterating, balancing, polishing, bug fixing, etc. My point is, these games could be more successful if publishers and investors would take a chance on them. But I also have to acknowledge that, currently, no investors and publishers are taking a chance on anything, so horse games aren't alone in this plight at the moment."</p><p>But thanks to <em>Umamusume</em>, interest in real horses – or at least, specific real horses – is on the rise. That, in Ruppert’s eyes, is something.</p><p>"People gain an interest in horse racing through <em>Umamusume </em>and then start looking into the topic in general, which is fun. Whatever exposes people to new interests and hobbies is fine. I would not dare to judge that," she said. “I do have a few people that joined my Discord this week like 'I checked out <em>Umamusume</em>, and that made me want to play actual horse games.

Mechanics related to training, competition, and care in between – that works,” she said. “People underestimate how many people want to play horse games because they think horse girls aren't gamers, and they think anybody who is interested in horses is at the barn and not at their PC – without accepting that people can actually be interested in multiple things, and that not everybody who wants to spend time with horses can afford to do so in real life.”</p><p>“I really believe that it would work with actual horses; it would target different people, but you could make a game like this with the actual animal,” she added. “And I feel like anyone who immediately goes 'Of course anime girls are more popular’ is underestimating the power of this audience of people who like horses and want to see them done well in games."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms"><h3>A Salute To The 13%</h3></a><p>Let them live a little</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/horror-anime-crunchyroll-netflix-hikaru-takopi"><h3>Your Guide To Feel-Bad-Anime Summer</h3></a><p>The Summer Hikaru Died and Takopi’s Original Sin are a throwback to the disturbing, horrifying anime of yesteryear</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/high-wheel-bike-race-frederick"><h3>The Penny Farthing Is Alive And Well In 2025</h3></a><p>The National Clustered Spires High Wheel Race takes place every summer in Frederick, Maryland</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/umamusume-horse-expert-interview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Whether you feel positively or negatively about the term, "friendslop" games have been more than a little common lately. First (arguably), you had <em>Phasmophobia</em>, the patient zero of friendslop, if you will. Next came a slew of other games that had similar vibes but which all provided their own twists.&nbsp;<em>Lethal Company</em> added creepypastas to the mix, and then games like <em>REPO </em>added an extra dose of chaos and insanity.</p>

<p>Now, the indie-gaming mavericks over at Strange Scaffold are bringing us <em>Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking</em>, a friendslop game about cooking meals for Kaiju. The developers invited us to a hands-off preview session to learn more, and it seems to be offering a way in for those who previously haven’t been able to enjoy these games with their friends.&nbsp;</p>


<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-man-holding-a-torch-from-a-first-person-perspective.jpg?itok=olvgI9f_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-man-holding-a-torch-from-a-first-person-perspective.jpg?itok=3mlxGrlw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Another year, another chance to go and stand on the chanting circle with your homies.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Other than being one of the most accurately descriptive titles I’ve ever seen, <em>Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking</em> is a first-person ‘friendslop’ game that sees you and several friends playing monks who descend into a dungeon to try and acquire the sort of food that will make a Kaiju creature happy enough to not attack your island monastery.</p>

<p>The focus is very much on finding the right combination of ingredients to please the monster, with each Kaiju preferring different flavors and ingredients. You and your friends descend into the dungeon, search rooms and fight creatures, and try to create the perfect meal, usually by running underneath different flavored geysers with whatever food you’ve managed to gather.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you’ve all acquired enough to please your hungry monster friend, you head back to the surface and launch it into their mouth with a catapult, or at least, with some sort of ancient military device (they were very specific about the historically accurate naming of said device). If you do well enough, the Kaiju leaves you alone for another in-game year, and you all head back to the monastery to rest.</p>

<p>With each in-game year, the story progresses, and ongoing generations of monks work together to maintain their home and deal with the ongoing losses as older monks die out, leaving the younger ones to fend for themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Unique Bucket of Friendslop</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-a-man-standing-in-front-of-some-bars-which-are-keeping-a-minotaur-away.jpg?itok=XqIHZRuk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-a-man-standing-in-front-of-some-bars-which-are-keeping-a-minotaur-away.jpg?itok=3bUZ3sxa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>All-in-all, Bob thought that the Cretian holiday was off to a bad start.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;While <em>Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking</em> is certainly a friendslop game--it even has a ‘chanting’ mechanic that you can almost guarantee is going to be in a lot of upcoming YouTube videos--it’s a friendslop game with a difference.</p>

<p>Firstly, it’s a lot more forgiving. When you die or get hurt, you can be revived by other players taking your heart back to the surface, and the tone is overall a little lighter than most other games in the genre. Sure, “horror” is in the title, but at the very least it seems unlikely that you’ll be running for the duvet playing this once.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As well as that, you’ve got the story elements that are being included. Normally, friendslop games will focus more on having background lore rather than a forward-facing narrative. This game opts for a more direct inclusion.</p>

<p>Between each round, you can elect to go around the monastery talking to the other monks who live there. If you do, and pay attention to the changes that happen to the locale each year, then you will get a proper narrative to follow, not just hints at the creepy stuff that has been going on behind the scenes. However, this story is completely optional. If you want, you can ignore all of the people in the settlement, upgrade your character, and then just head straight back into the main game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s a nice change to have something extra to come back for each game, and it might even give the game an edge over others in the same genre. If you’ve ever failed to get into it, this might be the game that makes it click for you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Worth Your Time?&nbsp;</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-man-stading-in-a-catapult-with-a-giant-monster-head-craning-over-him.jpg?itok=pDwRunZj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-man-stading-in-a-catapult-with-a-giant-monster-head-craning-over-him.jpg?itok=Yj1jX-O0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't think that Foozhochii is about to have the best day, but at least it's nice to know you can feed the monster your friends if you run out of options.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>It bears many marked similarities to other friendslop titles. At the end of the day, you’re collecting items with your friends, and you have proximity voice chat (albeit with a speaking tube that allows you to broadcast your voice to the entire map at once). It’s very possible to completely lose your one friend, only to discover he was eaten by something unknowable while no one was looking.</p>

<p>Realistically, it’s tough to say whether <em>Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking</em> will stand out from the crowd without getting a chance to go hands-on, but the inclusion of a narrative and a bit more accessibility for players who’ve struggled with similar games in the past might clinch it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that, you have to acknowledge that this is Strange Scaffold we’re talking about here. They have a history of producing games that all have at least one interesting thing about them, and it seems this game won’t be any different.</p>

<p>This is a friendslop game with biblical influence, and apparently one that wasn’t necessarily informed by trend-chasing, according to the devs themselves at least. The real test will be whether the game is enticing enough to attract both streamers and the players who are already deeply invested in other, similar games.</p>

<h2><em>Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-naked-man-standing-in-a-pile-of-blood-and-viscera.jpg?itok=xbgrzpOJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking-screenshot-showing-a-naked-man-standing-in-a-pile-of-blood-and-viscera.jpg?itok=08Tumnho 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just an average day on Monastery island.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Co-Op Kaiju Horror Cooking </em>launches&nbsp;July 29, but if you just can't wait that long, then you can sign up to playtest it on Steam right away. For the next two weeks, the game will be available for an open playtest, allowing gamers to try out the entire game as much as they want over the next fortnight, as well as giving us the opportunity to help and steer the direction of the game.</p>

<p>It's all part of the company's new policy of radical transparency. In fact, they also shared details of two other games that have been in development for a month or less. Both <em>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</em> and <em>Truck-Kun is Supporting Me From Another World</em> are in early stages of development, but Strange Scaffold wants their players to know about it, and be as involved as they can be. So head over to the company's Steam developer page to check out all of the latest info on all of these games, too.</p>

So that makes a “reveal” trailer kind of boring and unnecessary. This is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fifa-soccer-ea-games-sports-fc-franchise-pro-evolution-1848905860&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fifa-soccer-ea-games-sports-fc-franchise-pro-evolution-1848905860">the series that used to be called <em>FIFA</em></a></span><em> </em>and makes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/ea-sports-fc-electronic-arts-earnings-1235890705/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/ea-sports-fc-electronic-arts-earnings-1235890705/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA hundreds of millions of dollars every year</a></span>. Of course, we all knew there was going to be an <em>EA Sports FC 26. </em>The question then becomes: How do you get people to pay attention to your reveal trailer and hopefully win back fans who <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25">weren’t happy about last year’s entry</a></span>? The answer: Directly address their complaints in a fun way. </p><p>Here’s the trailer, which is filled with complaints about last year’s game being too slow, not reactive enough, or lacking other important features. And EA confidently offers a solution or improvement for each one. </p><p> “<em>FC 26</em> reflects our ongoing commitment to building this game with and for our community,” said EA Sports exec John Sheppard. “We are players too, and that shared passion drives everything we do. This year brings an overhauled gameplay experience, new Tournaments and Live Events in FUT, all-new Archetype customization in Clubs, and a Career Mode that comes alive through evolving Challenges. We can’t wait for players to feel the difference this September and help shape the future of <em>FC</em>.”</p><p>Now, while we hope the game turns out great, it remains possible that when players get their hands on <em>EA Sports FC 26</em> on September 26, they won’t be happy with what EA has done. But at the very least, I’ll give EA credit for poking fun at itself and offering up a trailer that is unique and memorable. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fc-26-fifa-trailer-reveal-complaints-soccer-ea-sports-1851786431]]></content:encoded>

The new Emerald Gamer pack is included at no extra cost with any level of PS Plus membership, and can be claimed in the PlayStation Store on PS4 and PS5, in the PS App, or <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1477-PPSA01922_00-PSCP300000000000" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on the web</a>. In order to unlock the skin in-game, you will need to actually load up Fortnite on a PlayStation device at least once after claiming it from the store.

The Emerald Gamer pack will remain in the PlayStation Store until September 23.</p><p>The Emerald Gamer pack is the 30th PlayStation Plus pack for Fortnite thus far, and none of the items included in any of the previous packs have ever been sold in the item shop, so these items are generally considered to be exclusive despite not explicitly being stated as such.</p><p>Sage is not the only "free" skin currently available in Fortnite.

            <p>
After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-23-update-is-being-revealed-this-week-and-its-probably-got-something-to-do-with-cars">series of vehicular teases earlier this week</a>, CD Projekt has finally unveiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s much-anticipated and mildly delayed 2.3 update, which - among other things - introduces self-driving (but sadly not flying) cars to Night City.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk's 2.3 update, developed in collaboration with Virtuous (presumably as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">most of CD Projekt is now busy on The Witcher 4</a>), is very much focused on traversal. It introduces four new vehicles - the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru, Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred", Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa, and Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila - plus several new Side Jobs to acquire them.
</p>
<p>
All these additions (and, indeed, any of your other vehicles), now support a new "autonomous driving feature" CD Projekt is calling AutoDrive. It'll ferry you to your chosen destination without needing to do any of that messy moving-your-hands business, or you can just sit back and enjoy a leisurely cruise around Night City to nowhere in particular if you prefer. And to really make the most of the ensuing sights, there's a cinematic camera for AutoDrive too.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, as of 2.3, Night City residents can - after completing the Don't Lose Your Mind job - summon the services of a self-driving Delamain Cab from the vehicle menu.
</p>
<p>
Also new is the Rayfield's CrystalCoat (and a cracked variant for lower-end vehicles), which you can capture on camera using some of the improvements to Photo Mode. There are 27 new spawnable NPCs, for instance, and outfits for everyone - including V - can be swapped while still in Photo Mode. Then there are new Look-At Camera options, depth of field improvements, new time, weather, and colour balance tabs, plus new stickers, frames, quotes, and overlays.
</p>
<p>
All this - which you can get a taste of in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFLKoZaHak8">today's 2.3 livestream</a> - arrives alongside a heap of fixes and enhancements, as detailed in <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes">CD Projekt's extensive patch notes</a>. But expect the likes of Variable Refresh Rate support for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, plus support for AMD FSR 3.1 Frame Generation, Intel XeSS 2.0, and HDR10+ Gaming on PC.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077's 2.3 update launches for most platforms (including Mac) tomorrow, 17th July. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> owners will need to wait bit, however, as it's hitting the platform "at a later date".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/60h1Sq3PKN8WlNdlic2KLN/ubisoft-announces-christophe-derennes-and-charlie-guillemot-as-coceos-of-new-subsidiary">announced</a> that Charlie Guillemot, son of Ubisoft co-founder and chief executive officer, Yves Guillemot, will be a co-chief executive officer alongside Christophe Derennes of Ubisoft's newly formed subsidiary with Tencent. </p>



<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/">March</a>, Ubisoft announced that it was forming a new subsidiary that would be partially owned by Tencent, within which Ubisoft would house its biggest IPs and franchises: Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. Since then, despite some <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">leaked information</a> and an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">official statement</a> regarding where the subsidiary would be in the hierarchy of Ubisoft's global team and how it would function, we've not had a lot of insight into this new subsidiary. </p>



<p>Now, at least, we have our latest bit of new information, with the subsidiaries' leaders having been named. Christophe Derennes comes to the role after most recently being the head of Ubisoft's North American studios, a role he stepped into in 2023. Before that, he had been the general manager of Ubisoft Montreal since 2020, one of Ubisoft's more famous branches, and one that Derennes co-founded in 1997, where he served the bulk of his time as an executive vice president of production. </p>



<p>Overall, he's been with Ubisoft for 35 years, and says that his focus in this new role is "<em>to finalize the foundations of this new entity, clarifying team responsibilities while ensuring current projects and roadmaps stay on course</em>."</p>



<p>Charlie Guillemot, in a way, has been with Ubisoft his whole life, growing up with it as the family business his dad and uncles had started. He properly joined the company right out of college, and after graduating with a master's degree in computer science, in 2014, he was named the studio head of Owlient. The studio had been acquired by Ubisoft and was set to make mobile games, including Tom Clancy's Elite Squad, which launched in 2020 and was immediately met with controversy at launch due to its intro video including imagery that suggested the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-apologizes-for-tom-clancy-game-imagery-that-sug-1844892904">Black Lives Matter movement was part of a terrorist plot</a>.</p>



<p>Ubisoft apologized, changed the video, and in 2021, <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-guillemot-son-of-ubisoft-s-ceo-is-leaving-the-1846986415">Charlie Guillemot left the company</a>. He faced criticism from employees who saw his appointment to Owlient studio head as nepotism, especially considering that he got the job just out of school. In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/">Variety</a> that went live alongside the announcement of Charlie Guillemot and Christophe Derennes as new co-CEOs, Charlie Guillemot addressed the nepotism factor, claiming, "<em>What matters now isn't my name, it's the work ahead</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Yes, I'm Yves' son,</em>" he began, "<em>That's not something I hide from. But my appointment isn't only about family ties; it's about what Ubisoft needs at this moment</em>.<em> I've spent the last decade building experience both inside and outside Ubisoft, leading teams, managing brands, and navigating change in a fast-moving industry. I also made the conscious choice to step away when it made sense, to learn and grow elsewhere.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>What matters now isn't my name, it's the work ahead. Ubisoft is at a pivotal moment. What's expected of me is to help push the company forward by bringing energy, focus, and by relying on the incredible expertise that already exists across the teams. I see myself as someone here to contribute, support, and help create the right conditions are in palce for everyone to do their best work. And beyond that, this industry is where I want to be. There's nowhere quite like it, where creativity, talent, and technology intersect in such dynamic ways, and where you constantly have to adapt to new platforms, new ideas, new expectations from players. That's what draws me in.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>I'm fully committed to doing everything I can to make this work. Ubisoft matters to me as a company, as a team, and as a place known for taking risks. I know trust is earned, not given. That's exactly how I approach this role</em>."</p>



<p>This is now officially Charlie Guillemot's third role within Ubisoft, since he jumped from Owlient studio head to the lead of Ubisoft's transformation committee, a role he was appointed to<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/charlie-guillemot-returns-to-ubisoft/"> earlier this year</a>. In between 2021 and 2025, he co-founded a Web3 and AI-focused studio, Unagi, which he's still the chief executive officer of, according to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-guillemot-18609a37/?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2F&amp;originalSubdomain=fr">LinkedIn page</a>.</p>



<p>As to why Charlie and Christophe were chosen for the co-CEO roles, father to Charlie and boss to Christophe, Yves Guillemot, said, "<em>Christophe brings a deep production expertise and decades of hands-on production leadership in Canada on the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. Charlie brings an entrepreneurial perspective, a sharp understanding of evolving industry dynamics and players' expectations, shaped by his experience in game development. He has a strong product mindset, a deep understanding of tech, and a passion for games.</em>" </p>



<p>He also added that they bring "<em>distinct complimentary strengths that will be instrumental in making this new step in the history of Ubisoft a success</em>."</p>

<h2>PC-like power, console-like benefits</h2>
<p><em>Cyberpunk</em> is a big get for the Mac’s gaming team, as it's an enduringly popular open-world game with a distinctive look, but it’s also of a piece with all of the AAA gaming launches the Mac has seen in the last couple of years. It’s a popular and graphically impressive game from a major studio, but it’s also coming to the Mac years after it initially arrived on PCs and consoles.</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk</em>’s graphics settings show where the Mac could have advantages as a gaming platform, though. Like PCs, Apple Silicon Macs are available at all kinds of price and performance levels, from the low-end fanless MacBook Air to the top-tier M3 Ultra Mac Studio. But unlike PCs, where developers can’t account for all of the possible CPU, GPU, motherboard, storage, and RAM configurations, Windows versions, and graphics driver updates, the Mac comes in a more finite number of configurations with more tightly controlled software. This makes it easier for developers to target and tune for specific hardware.</p>
<p>Case in point,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>’s “<a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/mac/sp-technical/issue/2894/for-this-mac-preset">For this Mac</a>” preset. Unlike the PC game’s Steam Deck preset, this isn’t a fixed collection of specific settings made with one particular hardware configuration in mind. Rather, it’s a dynamic preset that chooses different settings based on which specific Mac hardware you’re running the game on. An M1 Mac using this preset would get different settings than an M4 Max Mac using the same preset, and players can choose it knowing that they ought to get reasonably smooth and consistent performance with the best settings that their individual Mac can reasonably handle. (The one setting “For this Mac” doesn’t touch is ray-tracing, which can be manually enabled on M3- and M4-series Macs with the GPU hardware to support it but which won’t be turned on automatically.)</p>

                <p>Since its foundation nearly 40 years ago, Ubisoft has been a family company, with the Guillemot brothers steering the French gaming giant. That tradition is continuing with the new spun-off subsidiary of the company funded in part by Tencent, with Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's own son, Charlie Guillemot, being named as the co-CEO along with Ubisoft Montreal veteran Christophe Derennes.</p><p>The two men will lead the new subsidiary that aims to "accelerate the growth" of Ubisoft's main franchises: Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry.</p><p>Charlie Guillemot got his start in gaming at Owlient in 2014, and Ubisoft later acquired the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/our-brands/howrse" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horse simulation game developer</a>. He left Ubisoft in 2021 before rejoining the company earlier this year leading up to his promotion to co-CEO. As for Derennes, he was a co-founder of Ubisoft Montreal in 1997 and was most recently the managing director for Ubisoft's North American operations.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asked by Variety</a> about concerns over nepotism, Charlie Guillemot said he "completely" understands why some would take issue with his promotion. "Yes, I'm Yves' son. That's not something I hide from. But my appointment isn't only about family ties; it's about what Ubisoft needs at this moment," he said.</p><p>Charlie will be in charge of things like the "vision, direction, content development, and marketing" of Ubisoft's main franchises going forward, while Derennes will oversee production, co-development, and technology.</p><p>Looking ahead, Charlie <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/60h1Sq3PKN8WlNdlic2KLN/ubisoft-announces-christophe-derennes-and-charlie-guillemot-as-coceos-of-new-subsidiary" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> he expects generative AI and cloud technologies to "revolutionize" game development and player experiences. "Sometimes that means shorter content, speaking to new generations that consume content in a different way. I'm convinced the industry will face new tech disruptions we can't fully predict yet. And Ubisoft intends to play an active role in shaping that future."</p><p>His comment about generative AI is likely to cause a stir given ongoing serious concerns expressed by developers about the role of generative AI in game development and potential job losses. A report from earlier this year said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">the majority of game developers worldwide use AI</a>, despite concerns from workers.

<p>That's right, no Game-Key Card!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Sega has just earned itself a big win by confirming that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> on the Switch 2 will <em>not</em> be a Game-Key Card when it launches physically in <strong>early 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>In a press release, the company confirmed that Crossworlds will launch digitally on Switch 2 in Holiday 2025 and physically in Early 2026, with two versions available for digital purchases. The standard is priced at <strong>£64.99</strong> and the Digital Deluxe is priced at <strong>£74.99</strong>. It's not known at this time how much the physical version will cost.</p>
<p>Crucially, Sega states that the physical release "will feature the full base game on the cartridge". So no Game-Key Card! Rejoice! We've reached out to Sega to triple check, but the wording seems pretty clear to us.</p>
<p>Sega has also reiterated that those who purchase the game on Switch 1 will be eligible for a paid upgrade to the Switch 2 version. Again, pricing has not been confirmed for this at the time of writing, but we'd probably expect it to be around £10 or so. We'll see.</p>
<p>Finally, a new trailer looking at customisation in the game has been released. It's looking pretty awesome so far, and we can't wait to take the game for a spin properly when it launches.</p>
<p>If you're not bothered about waiting for the Switch 2 version, Crossworlds will launch elsewhere, including Switch 1, on <strong>25th September 2025</strong>.</p>
