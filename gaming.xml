<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> brings back the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-system-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traditional Call of Duty Prestige system</a>, which sees players progress through the ranks without a seasonal level restriction, unlocking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/">new weapons</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Equipment</a> as they edge towards rank 55. You no longer have to wait around before progressing your level, and entering Prestige has some pretty awesome bonuses on top of resetting your rank so you can do it all again. </p>



<p>Treyarch have implemented some cosmetic rewards alongside the Permanent Unlock token and new Icon you’ll receive as you make your way to Prestige Master. So, here’s every reward you’ll earn as you grind through all 10 Prestiges in Black Ops 6.</p>

            <p>Two N64  games have now been added to the Mature app of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok-2-seeds-of-evil">Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</a> and Shadow Man are both available right now for subscribers with the Expansion Pack.</p>
<p>Both games were known for their blood and gore - unusual on Nintendo's system - hence their inclusion in the Mature app, alongside shooters Perfect Dark and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok-dinosaur-hunter">Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</a>.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the Mature app is a separate download away from the main N64 app.</p>
<p>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil was, of course, the follow-up to the first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok">Turok</a> game, in which players shoot dinosaurs with a variety of outlandishly gruesome weapons.</p>
<p>Shadow Man, meanwhile, was based on the comic book series of the same name, following a voodoo warrior with the ability to visit the land of the dead.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-will-have-a-spider-free-mode-for-those-with-arachnophobia.1021752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-will-have-a-spider-free-mode-for-those-with-arachnophobia<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Spider dislikers, your concerns have been noted. At least by Capcom, anyway. The developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> are including an option in the upcoming beast-skinning action RPG that will turn all arachnid style monsters into something much less creepy and/or crawly. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The spider-free option was spotted by players of the PlayStation Plus beta test (as noticed <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/monster-hunter-wilds-features-an-accessibility-mode-for-players-who-fear-spiders-and-insects/">by Automaton</a>). It's called "Arachnophobia assistance" in the accessibility options, and reads: "Adjusts the appearance of multi-legged creatures such as arachnids, insect-like small monsters, and endemic life." The description also notes that it won't alter the difficulty or "creature movements". </p>
<p>So how does it deal with eight-legged monsters? They <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029-39053-001.jpg">become slimes</a>, of course. As Automaton note, so far only small monsters appear to be accounted for. It's not clear how larger monsters with spider-like legs will be altered, if at all. What even counts as "spider-like" anyway? When your game is full of hybrid creatures that take inspiration from all sorts of wildlife, that line where a phobia kicks in may be hard to define. </p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is not the first game to do this sort of thing. Even this week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> came out with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-arachnophobia-mode-is-arguably-more-terrifying-than-actual-giant-spiders">an arachnophobia mode in its zombies campaign</a>. Meanwhile, shrunken survival game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a> has an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-groundeds-arachnophobia-mode-turns-creepy-spiders-into-cute-blobs">extensive arachnophobia mode</a> that lets you disable or enable every individual element of what makes a spider scary. You can get rid of the legs but keep the fangs, for example. Or just turn it into a harmless pair of spheres. </p><p>The PC beta for Monster Hunter Wilds <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-beta-launches-this-month-with-a-character-editor-and-co-op-multiplayer">isn't arriving on Steam until October 31st</a>, so we won't be able to investigate the monstrous wilderness ourselves just yet. But if you do play, you'll be able to import your character when the full game releases on February 28th next year (actual progression through the game's opening chapter will not be saved though, say Capcom).  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> has had its early access release date pushed back until December.</p>
<p>Grinding Gear Games' take on Diablo was expected to release this November. However, due to some "server-side infrastructure work" that still needs sorting out, Path of Exile 2 will now be released in December.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry about this one. People plan time off and things like that around our launches, but we just have to do it," Path of Exile 2 game director Jonathan Rogers said in a video announcing the delay.</p>

<p>Path of Exile 2 itself is in good shape, the director stated, though to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mercenary-class-unveiled-for-path-of-exile-2-and-it-plays-like-shooter">microtransactions work seamlessly across both Path of Exile and the sequel</a>, a little more time is needed.</p>
<p>"We have to integrate the account systems for not only <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile">Path of Exile</a> 1 and 2, but also for the console realms as well," Rogers explained. "This meant changing a lot of things. Not only do we have to create a bunch of new systems, we have to make sure that all the old data is backwards compatible with them as well."</p><p>The Path of Exile 2 team wants to ensure everything is "perfect" on the game's early access launch, Rogers continued, so "nobody loses anything they paid for and nobody has their account broken". This means "a lot of load testing to make sure the whole thing doesn't fall over" on Path of Exile 2's debut, he added, as Grinding Gear is expecting a "huge number" of players.</p>
<p>Rogers admitted things had been left too late to get everything up to snuff for Path of Exile 2's November release date. "I'm really sorry," he apologised again, "this one really hurts".</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 will now be released in early access on 6th December. Ahead of this, the developer plans to host a live stream in roughly four weeks time, with an exact date still to be confirmed. Rogers promised the team will share more on what kind of content players can expect on Path of Exile 2's launch during this stream.</p>
<p>"Until then, thank you very much for your support," Rogers concluded.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> has announced changes to its big new Gigantamax battles feature, in response to this weekend's initial launch.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-launches-gigantamax-raids-to-mixed-response-as-developer-bans-countless-players-by-accident">Fan feedback to Gigantamax has been decidedly mixed</a>, as Eurogamer reported yesterday, with concerns over the difficulty level of being able to beat the skyscraper-high monsters, and the ease of then actually catching one afterwards.
</p>
<p>
Niantic has responded swiftly, and in a statement to Eurogamer last night a company spokesperson detailed a number of changes for the game's next set of Gigantamax raids this weekend, against Gigantamax Gengar. 
</p>
<p>
Most notably, the difficulty of Gigantamax Gengar will be lowered "slightly", to make the battle easier when compared to other Gigantamax battles. 
</p>
<p>
"While we want Gigantamax to be the new high bar for a meaningful challenge in Pokémon Go, we want to make sure that players have a reasonable chance to defeat Gengar," a Niantic spokesperson told Eurogamer. "You'll still need to strategise and coordinate with your group and go in powered up to a degree, but we think this tuning will make things slightly easier to help a range of Trainers jump into Gigantamax."
</p><p>
Here, Niantic seems to agree with a common complaint I heard this past weekend - that the feature could have benefited from giving players more of a leg-up to get started. Once you have your first Gigantamax Pokémon (and after a battle or two to learn the ropes), the whole thing becomes easier. 
</p>
<p>
Other changes to Gigantamax Gengar include a bonus 25k Stardust reward for beating the boss, and an improved capture rate for snagging it afterwards.
</p>
<p>
"We want players to feel rewarded for accomplishing such a huge feat, and right now the catch rate didn't match the experience we wanted," a Niantic spokesperson said. "We'll be increasing this for Gengar and will continue to monitor other Gigantamax encounters."
</p>
<p>
There's no changes to the game's Max Particle limit, which effectively caps the amount of Gigantamax raids you can complete at two without purchasing more of the currency from Pokémon Go's shop. And there's certainly no suggestion you will be able to complete Gigantamax Gengar battles without still forming a large group of players.
</p><p>
Also, it's worth highlighting that these changes are specifically for Gigantamax Gengar this weekend, in a manner that suggests Niantic realises it needs to throw the game's community something of a bone to encourage participation in the feature once again. 
</p>
<p>
Could these changes stick? "Other Gmax encounters are unaffected for now," a Niantic spokesperson said, "but we MAY make changes to them in the future."

			<p>It’s time to pop on your Phrygian caps and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GYtgFdXCGE">blue yourself</a> for a new Smurfs adventure. The Smurfs – Dreams takes the top-down 3D platformer and runs with it in ways that show that Ocellus Studio (previously responsible for the excellent Marsupilami tie-in game) have totally understood the assignment. Dreams is not quite at the level of the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a> or Nintendo’s best, but it is a great alternative if you’ve played those already.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Smurfs – Dreams – Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Dtl9DiYc4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You play as a generic Smurf, though in contrast to my youth, you do get to choose between a boy and a girl character. Compared to when there was only ever Smurfette to represent an entire gender, it seems there are more female Smurfs nowadays and you do get to rescue a fairly equal number of each throughout your somnolent adventure. There are a number of costumes available to lock with some exclusively present as DLC for the diehard Smurf fans. Many of these surprisingly give you the chance to change the iconic blue skin to other shades, which just feels wrong to me.</p>


<p>As you begin the game the sneaky Gargamel has found a way to poison the Smurfs’ favourite berries with a sleeping potion, leaving the entire village helpless against him. What follows is a race against time as you must venture into their dreams and awaken them before Gargamel finds the hidden village and captures everybody. This mechanic enables a range of different platforming environments and mechanics to roughly match the character of each sleeping Smurf.</p>


<p>Most of your time in Dreams will be spent jumping and collecting items whilst avoiding or defeating enemies. The perspective and platforming approaches are very reminiscent of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/10/super-mario-3d-world-switch-review-bowsers-fury/">Super Mario 3D World</a> and some levels do reach for the heights of that game. As a whole, however, Smurfs Dreams lacks the variety and magic spark of Mario’s adventure, though it does have some tricks of its own. Across your playtime you’ll be tasked with using hammers, magical lanterns and a strange gunge firing gun to successfully rescue your pals.</p>
<p>Early levels here are pretty simple affairs and you’d be forgiven for thinking that you were playing a very easy kid’s game. Don’t be lulled into this sense of security, though, as The Smurfs – Dreams does throw a lot of strong design decisions and even some surprisingly challenging platforming sections towards the end. The highlight here is a level <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/12/the-smurfs-dreams-preview-the-3d-platformer-to-drive-away-your-blues/">featured in the demo</a> which makes innovative use of mirrors to confuse and disorientate you and offers some genuinely original and innovative moments. Equally, trying to locate all of the collectables will offer up a decent challenge, albeit not on the scale of something like Astro Bot.</p>

<p>Every main level is separated into individual chapters, a welcome move when it comes to replaying parts to track down missing collectables. There are yarn bobbins unlocked by finding cunningly camouflaged Smurfs, blue mushrooms that are generally in obscure or hidden areas, and lots of berries used to unlock costumes. You’ll find enough of the latter so that you won’t ever need to grind, even if you make your way through finding most rarer collectables. The game as a whole does respect your time and doesn’t overstay its welcome.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Smurfs – Dreams is a welcome throwback to classic 3D platformers and makes for a good snackable game if you’ve already played the likes of Astro Bot or the Mario games (or don’t have the relevant consoles for them). It’ll keep you well entertained for the 7 or 8 hours it lasts and there are plenty of hidden secret collectables to hunt out. Whether you have any nostalgia for the Smurfs or are new to them you could do a lot worse than to have a snooze with the blues.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-will-keep-a-stable-frame-rate-at-all-times-promises-developer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We're now less than a month away from the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-long-awaited-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER 2</a>, which in itself seems impossible to process. The game has had so many delays (some forced on the developers by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, for example) that even the most attached fans were skeptical at some point.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 is almost here, though. GSC Game World recently hosted a final press event in Prague where they shared a few extra details about their game. In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1msvzkT1d8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> by Radio Times Gaming, for example, Technical Producer Yevhenii Kulyk talked about optimization after the interviewer mentioned the many recent Unreal Engine games suffering from stuttering issues on PC.</p>
<p><em>To meet our expectations for optimization on Xbox and PCs, we made a lot of changes to render threads, some CPU optimizations, and a lot of RAM optimizations. Now we are pretty much close to finishing the whole polishing process. Our aim is to provide a game that is running constantly in stable FPS and with stable performance all the time.</em></p>
<p>When asked about the Unreal Engine 5 version they've been using, Kulyk said:</p>
<p><em>Our engine is based on Unreal Engine 5.1, but we internally call it 5.1.GSC because to make a world this big, we had to adopt and, let's say, maybe rewrite and upgrade some tools that were provided by the basic Unreal Engine to fit our needs to create the world of STALKER 2.</em></p>
<p>Over a year ago, GSC Game World <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-dev-says-ue5s-nanite-and-lumen-were-the-right-bricks-to-properly-finish-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the news of upgrading from UE4 to UE5, stating that Lumen and Nanite were the 'right bricks' to finish the game. However, Epic introduced several performance and quality improvements to both technologies in the more recent UE5 versions; let's hope staying on an older, albeit custom, build won't jeopardize the performance. After all, the team seems confident in their promise of a smooth frame rate.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Kulyk reiterated what we already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> in our exclusive Gamescom interview: mods are coming, to both PC and consoles.</p>
<p><em>We are aware that our player base, especially the old fans, is waiting for our game to support mods. We will bring in the mods to consoles, so they will be available on the Xbox as well as the PC We are preparing a very big toolkit that will provide the mod makers with all the necessary tools to create mods, from the smallest one to big total conversions.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is out on November 20 on PC and Xbox Series S|X, available from day one on Game Pass. A PlayStation 5 release hasn't been publicly talked about yet, but we know from a previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-a-3-month-console-exclusive-microsoft-will-increase-revenue-share-for-xbox-games-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> that there is a three-month exclusivity window in place, so the game could launch on Sony's console in early 2025.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path Of Exile 2</a>'s early access release has been shoved back three weeks from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/path-of-exile-2-will-release-in-early-access-november-15th">15th November</a> to 6th December 2024, game director Jonathan Rogers has announced in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2zus8ux73s">a brief Youtube video</a>. The action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> itself will seemingly be ready in time for the original launch date, but there's a load of "server-side infrastructure work" that needs doing.</p> <!--more-->
<p>"One of the key promises we made is that all your microtransactions will work across both Path of Exile 1 and 2," Rogers said in the video, as passed on by charming RPS doppelganger <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/this-really-hurts-path-of-exile-2-early-access-has-been-delayed-by-three-weeks/">PCGamer</a>. "In order to do that, we have to integrate the account systems for not only Path of Exile 1 and 2, but also for the console realms as well.</p>
<p>"This meant changing a lot of things: not only do we have to create a bunch of new systems, we have to make sure that all the old data is backwards compatible with them as well. And when you start migrating databases that are this old and with this much data, you find all sorts of strange demons."</p>
<p>Old certainly means <em>old</em>, when it comes to Path Of Exile. The original game launched in 2013.</p>
<p>Rogers detailed a few of the aforesaid "strange demons" - accounts sharing the same email address and steam IDs, and accounts that consist of "random gibberish". Purging them will go hand in hand with additional load-testing to ensure the backend code changes don't screw the game up at launch.</p><p>"I actually believe that we possibly could have made the original launch date, but I'm no longer confident that we could do it without making mistakes, and these are the kind of games we just can't let happen," Rogers continued. "So with that in mind, we've decided to delay. Now this one's totally on me. I just didn't leave enough time to make sure we could get it done."</p>
<p>This is as fine a time as any to say that I played a bit of Path Of Exile 2 at Summer Games Fest and - speaking as an extremely greenhorn POE player, so green that I still giggle like a schoolboy when people call it "peeowee" - found it to be quite fun. I was some kind of necromancer, I think. I basically spent my 30 minutes resurrecting enemy corpses while backpedalling furiously. There's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-to-expect-from-the-path-of-exile-2-beta-and-how-grinding-gears-are-breaking-their-own-rules">a crossbow-wielding class in POE2</a> which looks like it'll be catnip for the twin-stick shmuppers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Grinding Gear Games has announced a slight delay to the early access date of Path of Exile 2. The sequel to the highly popular free-to-play hack 'n' slash action RPG will now debut on December 6 instead of November 15 as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-on-november-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> at Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p>Game Director Jonathan Rogers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2zus8ux73s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the news in a brief video message and explained that it was caused by server-side shortcomings:</p>
<p><em>I'm really sorry about this one. People plan time off around our launches, but we just have to do it. So what happened? Well, it turns out it isn't really the game itself that we're behind on. It's a bunch of server side infrastructure work that has taken us a lot longer than we expected.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the key promises we made is that all your microtransactions will work across both Path of Exile 1 and 2. In order to do that, we have to integrate the account systems for not only Path of Exile 1 and 2 but also for the console realms as well. This meant changing a lot of things. Not only do we have to create a bunch of new systems, we have to make sure that only old data is backwards compatible with them as well.</em></p>
<p><em>When you start migrating databases that are this old and with this much data, you find all sorts of strange demons in there. How do multiple accounts get the same name? How do multiple accounts get the same email address? How do multiple accounts have the same steam IDs? Why is this person’s account name just random gibberish that doesn't even decode? We have to get everything perfect so that nobody loses anything they paid for and nobody has their account broken.</em></p>
<p><em>At the same time, because we're changing all this back-end code, we have to do a lot of load testing to make sure the whole thing doesn’t fall over when they could get the huge number of players that we're expecting at the Path of Exile 2 early access launch. I actually believe that we could possibly have made the original date, but I'm no longer confident we could do it without making mistakes, and these are the kind of mistakes we just can't let happen. With that in mind, we've decided to delay.</em></p>
<p>Rogers ended the message with news of an upcoming live stream that will delve deeply into everything that's going to be in the early access launch. The Game Director said it's going to be like the biggest League announcement they have ever done, and he added he's looking forward to sharing information on the endgame content players will find in Path of Exile 2.</p>

<p>One PlayStation player has spent $2000 on 24 years of PS Plus to avoid future price hikes.</p>



<p>Reddit user /u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1gbag2i/lads_i_did_it_subscribed_to_ps_plus_until_2048/?embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgamerant.com%2Fplaystation-plus-user-subscription-24-years-2048%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On_Reddit_In_Class</a>&nbsp;took to the website to say they they made the plunge to avoid “the absurd price increases the past few years,” which promoted the user to buy PS Plus until 2048. </p>



<p>Users reacted with mixed emotions in the Reddit thread, with some calling it a genius move, but only if the services last for that amount of time. Others morbidly said that it’s only good if he “last that long.” </p>



<p>Sony last raised its prices for PS Plus in September 2023 from $59.99 to $79.99, so who knows how much the service could be in the next two decades. The past two decades has seen the industry change various times, too, but whatever the case may be, it’ll probably work out at being good value for money. After all, if the service is cancelled, he’s almost certainly going to get some kind of refund… Right?</p>



<p>What do you think about buying 24 years worth of PS Plus? Do you think it’s a wise investment or a stupid move? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon.1133/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/blade-and-sorcery-nomad-full-release-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Blade &amp; Sorcery: Nomad never felt as fleshed out or high-tier as the PCVR version of the game, but yesterday, that changed. The developer, WarpFrog, has pushed out ‘The End Update’, the full release of Nomad that brings it up to spec and makes it feel like an entirely new game.</p>



<p>It’s not without issues, but this change boosts the game’s graphics, frame rate, performance, and sound effects. It also adds the core progression mode, which gives you something to aim for when you play.</p>



<p>It’s like Cyberpunk 2077’s ‘2.0’ update. It has made Nomad feel like an entirely new game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-overhauled">Overhauled</h2>



<p>Let’s get the downsides out of the way before we talk about Blade &amp; Sorcery: Nomad’s full release.</p>



<p>When you install The End Update, you’ll lose all your mods as they’ll be incompatible. It’s advised that you hit ‘Uninstall All’ on your mod list before you proceed, as even having them installed could cause issues with your update. That’s a massive hit for anyone like me who previously had dozens of mods installed.</p>



<p>Another issue I have is with the combat – decapitation seems to be bizarrely easy, and simply tapping an enemy with a sword results in their head popping off. I’m not sure why, but it’s irritating.</p>



<p>That’s about it when it comes to issues.</p>



<p>The biggest talking point about The End Update is the addition of Crystal Hunt, which is Blade &amp; Sorcery’s core progression mode. With this mode, you’ll get to pick a path and follow it with a new character, exploring an all-new world, never-before-seen (for Nomad) races and factions, and a gameplay loop that gives the game more of a <strong>point</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s what WarpFrog had to say about the introduction of Crystal Hunt:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The addition of Crystal Hunt was sheer madness for us because it was like dropping a new game on top of the established Blade &amp; Sorcery game that you already know. Then trying to make that work for the standalone headset… it was insanity fuel. However, here we are.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s a skill tree to work through, a trading system, immense new enemies, and a stack of lore and puzzles to unfold and uncover. The graphical improvements are nothing short of stunning, and as someone who poured hours upon hours into Blade &amp; Sorcery: Nomad before the update, the changes are <strong>night and day</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Everything from the ambient sounds to the effects of spells, and from the detail on weapons to the way enemies behave mid-fight has been changed for the better. </p>



<p>It took me a good few minutes to get to grips with the changes, including the new inventory menu and journal system, but it was worth sticking to it. I cannot stress how impressive The End Update is. Let’s rattle through some more bonuses:</p>



<ul>
<li>There’s a new stash system and the ‘home’ is persistent when it comes to adding and moving things around</li>



<li>Modders can now take full control of the SDK</li>



<li>Enemy mages are now wild and have immense powers</li>



<li>Enemy AI is much more realistic, particularly in combat</li>



<li>The existing Arena maps have been overhauled</li>



<li>The new armour sets and weapons feel and look superb</li>



<li>For the first time, there’s a voiced and animated NPC shopkeeper</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, this monumental change has brought about a sharp price increase. Before, Blade &amp; Sorcery: Nomad would have run you up a bill of just $19.99, but that has been increased to $29.99 to account for the overhaul update.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<p>The End Update makes one of the best games on VR even better. I didn’t know it was coming, so it was a <strong>very </strong>welcome surprise, but if you’ve been holding out waiting for the full release of Blade and Sorcery: Nomad, you won’t be disappointed. This feels like WarpFrog has given us an entirely new game, and it’s worth every second you spend exploring it.</p>

Since Spider-Man is a very popular Halloween costume, we suppose it fits the theme--and both games are nearly 50% off, so they are awesome deals regardless.

The remake features radically improved gameplay and modernized graphics with support for advanced tech like ray tracing, so it's a great match for high-end gaming rigs. It also benefits from a new over-the-shoulder perspective. This deal disappears after Halloween, however, so you don’t have much time left to cash in on the offer.

We have to delay early access for three weeks. The new date is the December 6. I’m really sorry about this one. People plan time off and things like that around our launches, but we just have to do it.</p><p>So what happened? Well, it turns out it isn’t really the game itself that we’re behind on. It’s a bunch of server side infrastructure work that has taken us a lot longer than we expected.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Now, one of the key promises we made is that all your microtransactions will work across both <em>Path of Exile I</em> and <em>II</em>. In order to do that, we have to integrate the account systems for not only <em>Path of Exile I</em> and <em>II</em>, but also for the console realms as well. This meant changing a lot of things. Not only do we have to create a bunch of new systems, we have to make sure that only old data is backwards compatible with them as well.</p><p>And when you start migrating databases that are this old and with this much data, you find all sorts of strange demons in there. How do multiple accounts get the same name? How do multiple accounts get the same email address? How do multiple accounts have the same steam IDs? Why is this person’s account name just random gibberish that doesn’t even decode?</p><p>We have to get everything perfect so that nobody loses anything they paid for, and nobody has their account broken. At the same time, because we’re changing all this back-end code, we have to do a lot of load testing to make sure the whole thing doesn’t fall over when they could get the huge number of players that we’re expecting at launch.</p><p>I actually believe that we could possibly have made the original launch date, but I’m no longer confident we could do it without making mistakes. And these are the kind of mistakes we just can’t let happen. So with that in mind, we’ve decided to delay.</p><p>Now this one’s totally on me. I just didn’t leave enough time to make sure we could get it done. And I’m really sorry. This one really hurts.</p><p>Now we’re going to be having a livestream talking about all the content you can expect in <em>Path of Exile II</em>‘s early access in about four weeks. You can think of it like the biggest league announcement we’ve ever done. I’m really looking forward to telling you guys about the endgame content that the team have been working hard on.</p><p>Until then, thank you very much for your support.</p></blockquote><p>Listen to the message in video form below.</p><h2><span>Three-Week Delay Announcement</span></h2><p><iframe title="Path of Exile 2 Delayed Three Weeks" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2zus8ux73s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is finally here, and lots of people are liking it. And one person liking it very publicly is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian's outspoken director of publishing, Michael Douse - who's been praising BioWare's new RPG, calling it, among other things, "the first Dragon Age game that truly knows what it wants to be."
</p>
<p>
Douse isn't one to shy away from sharing his opinions on social media, of course, having recently fired shots at Ubisoft following <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>'s underperformance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-director-of-publishing-calls-out-baldurs-gate-3-ce-scalpers-for-making-people-sad">called out scalpers</a> for "making [people] sad", and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-boss-blasts-publisher-greed-behind-layoffs">spoken candidly</a> about the games industry's current layoff culture, noting, "None of these companies are at risk of going bankrupt... they're just at risk of pissing off the shareholders." But following the launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Douse is singing a rather more positive tune.
</p>
<p>
"I've been playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard in complete secrecy (behind my backpack at the office in front of a giant window, in the kitchen)," he <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1850949592667590700">wrote on X</a>. "From me, you may be wondering, 'Is this a game compatible with my experience during BG3' so I'll tackle it from that perspective. The answer is yes. It is to a heavy, nine-season-long show what a well-made, character driven, binge-worthy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> series is. It has a good sense of propulsion and forward momentum. The combat system is honestly brilliant (to me, a mix of Xenoblade and Hogwarts which is giga-brain genius). It knows when it needs a tentpole narrative moment, and it knows when to let you toy around with your class and exploit some of its stronger elements."

<p>
"More important," Douse added, "to me, it feels like the first Dragon Age game that truly knows what it wants to be... If you want some character-driven romping with a strong combat system in a universe you know, love, or have heard of, it is much better than the average action game, and much less heavy than the gargantuan RPGs that may intimidate at times. In a word, it's fun!"
</p><p>
"I'll always be a [<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>] guy," Douse continued in a <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1850951012053295168">follow-up post</a>, "and this is not that. But at least it's something it wants to be, and not a mishmash of everything. I respect that. I like action games, like RPGs, I like it when they collide. I like shooting baddies with mage magic. Your mileage may vary!"
</p>
<p>
It's a positive outlook on The Veilguard shared by Eurogamer's Robert Purchese, who slapped Dragon Age's latest outing with five shiny gold stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">his enthusisatic review</a>. "What BioWare has managed to accomplish here," he wrote, "in the face of all the pressure it's faced since Dragon Age: Inquisition came out 10 years ago, is extraordinary. From head to toe, wing to wing, The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling. It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general. This is among the very best of them."
</p>
<p>
But back to Douse for one last observation: "I'm extremely happy BioWare gets to stick around - presumably - in these uncertain (because of moronic corporate greed) times," he concluded. "[The Veilguard is] an existential game, and a fun one at that."

          <p>Apple will adapt the classic educational game <em>The Oregon Trail</em> into a big-budget movie, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/oregon-trail-movie-apple-1236045454/">according to The Hollywood Reporter</a> (THR).</p>
<p>The film is in early development, having just been pitched to Apple and approved. Will Speck and Josh Gordon (<em>Blades of Glory</em>,&nbsp;<em>Office Christmas Party</em>) will direct and produce. Given that pedigree (zany comedies), it's clear this film won't be a serious historical drama about the struggles of those who traveled the American West.</p>
<p>In fact, the report not only notes that it will be a comedy—it says it will be a musical, too. "The movie will feature a couple of original musical numbers in the vein of <em>Barbie</em>," according to THR's sources. EGOT winners Benj Pasek and Justin Paul will be responsible for the original music in the film.</p>
<p>Of course, with a comedy, the writers are at least as important as the director. The film will be written by Kenneth and Keith Lucas—but they're most recently best known for the 2021 drama <em>Judas and the Black Messiah</em>, for which they received an Oscar nomination.</p>
<p>That's all we know about the film so far. As for the game, well, it needs no introduction—especially for folks who were of the appropriate age to play it at school or at home on personal computers from the 1970s through the 1990s.</p>
<p>The game is a major cultural touchstone for a certain generation—to the point that "The Oregon Trail Generation" has been used as a label for many of the people born in the early 1980s. It's long been a thing to joke about the game's morbid content, like the infamous phrase: "You have died of dysentery."</p>
<p>Since the film was greenlit by Apple, it's likely to debut on the Apple TV+ streaming service, but we don't yet know when it will arrive or who will star in it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-svd-loadout-in-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Currently trying to use the SVD in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, but not sure what loadout to use? While it is true that the gun is among the weaker snipers in the game, it still can be quite useful with the right loadout.</p>



<p>Here is our take on the best SVD loadout in Black Ops 6.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-best-svd-loadout-in-black-ops-6">The Best SVD Loadout in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Sniping in Call of Duty has always been incredibly popular. However, sniping without modifying a weapon is a fool’s game. The SVD can easily become one of the better snipers with the proper loadout.</p>



<h4 id="h-best-svd-loadout">Best SVD Loadout:</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Quickdraw Riser</strong> (Comb)</li>



<li><strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong> (Barrel)</li>



<li><strong>Heavy Stock</strong> (Stock)</li>



<li><strong>7.62x54mmR FMJ</strong> (Fire Mods)</li>



<li><strong>Ported Compensator</strong> (Muzzle)</li>
</ul>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-quickdraw-riser">Quickdraw Riser</h3>



<p>Quickdraw Risers are essential for pretty much all snipers. This attachment allows players to ADS faster than normal, allowing for players to quick-scope and more. Make sure to equip one to your SVD.</p>



<h3 id="h-reinforced-barrel">Reinforced Barrel</h3>



<p>The Reinforced Barrel helps with damage range for the SVP while also increasing the bullet velocity. It is a great attachment for long-range weapons. However, it does decrease movement speed while aiming, but having the Quickdraw Riser also equipped should help with that issue.</p>



<h3 id="h-heavy-stock">Heavy Stock</h3>



<p>Especially for snipers, the Heavy Stock is essential. This attachment helps improve aim, making the weapon more stable and accurate. Be sure to equip one to your SVP in Black Ops 6.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-62x54mmr-fmj">7.62x54mmR FMJ</h3>



<p>The 7.62x54mmR FMJ is easily the best fire mod for the SVP, as it helps make the weapons shot much more powerful. </p>



<h3 id="h-ported-compensator">Ported Compensator</h3>



<p>The Ported Compensator improves the recoil of the SVP. This helps immensely with the weapon’s accuracy, allowing for first-shot kills to happen much more often when using the SVP in Black Ops 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-rocket-league-ranks/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Rocket League has become an incredibly popular esport over the years, with the game first releasing back in 2015. Since then, various massive Rocket League tournaments have emerged, including RLCS, Collegiate leagues and more. However, Rocket League also has its own competitive mode. Here are all the Rocket League ranks.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rocket-league-ranks">Rocket League Ranks</h2>



<p>Like many other games, Rocket League also has a ranked system that players can play, moving up in levels. Like many other games, Rocket League follows the traditional ranking system, starting with Bronze and moving up the list. </p>



<h4 id="h-all-rocket-league-ranks-in-order-from-worst-to-best">All Rocket League Ranks in Order from Worst to Best:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Unranked</li>



<li>Bronze</li>



<li>Bronze II</li>



<li>Bronze III</li>



<li>Silver</li>



<li>Silver II</li>



<li>Silver III</li>



<li>Gold </li>



<li>Gold II</li>



<li>Gold III</li>



<li>Platinum</li>



<li>Platinum II</li>



<li>Platinum III</li>



<li>Diamond </li>



<li>Diamond II</li>



<li>Diamond III</li>



<li>Champion </li>



<li>Champion II</li>



<li>Champion III</li>



<li>Grand Champion </li>



<li>Grand Champion II</li>



<li>Grand Champion III</li>



<li>Supersonic Legend</li>
</ul>



<p>Moving up in ranks in Rocket League can be quite difficult, and claiming the title of Supersonic Legend is definitely a massive accomplishment. In fact, the game used to end at Grand Champion, but after Epic Games bought the title, Supersonic Legend was added to the ranks.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up">How to Rank Up</h2>



<p>Trying to rank up in the game? Well, luckily, the process is simple: Play ranked matches and win. If you constantly lose when playing ranked matches you will not see yourself move up.</p>



<p>Rocket League’s ranked system also has a decent anti-smurfing system, which works to stop high-ranking players from creating new accounts just to play at lower ranks. </p>



<p>The game also has a new system that evaluates one’s rank early on and moves them up higher in level when officially ranking them. Not everyone will start from Bronze.</p>



<p>What is your rank?</p>

			<p>Today, Bungie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a small video developer update for their <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming extraction shooter</a> based on the sci-fi Marathon IP. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Game Director</a> Joe Ziegler (who previously worked on The Saboteur at Pandemic and Valorant at Riot) talked a bit about how the game is going to work:</p>
<p><em>We give you a lot of different tools to do a lot of different things inside the game. There is a ton of loot that you can find: weapons, equipment that you can equip that changes your stats or tweaks some of the things that you can do inside the game. There are utility consumables akin to mines or grenades, and there are even consumables to heal yourself and give you utility in that way.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond that, there is also another layer: Runners. They are the template by which you equip all that stuff to. Each Runner has a small subset of abilities and on top of that, you get to customize however you want, thinking about what you want to accomplish. You might equip different types of gear to your Runner and then go on those runs with that gear in mind.</em></p>
<p><em>There's a lot of different ways a Marathon session can unfold with all those different pieces. There are also many objectives and things like that that exist inside the game. But of course, every single one comes with its own risk. And the risk is always present that if you don't get out alive, you will lose the things that you have on you.</em></p>
<p>In the latter half of the video, Ziegler said that Bungie has collaborated with some players and creators to iterate on the game over the past two years. Next year, fans can expect to learn a lot more about the game toward the middle of the year, likely during the regular May PlayStation Showcase. In 2025, Marathon will also greatly expand its player testing with each new milestone.</p>
