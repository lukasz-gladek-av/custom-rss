<p>We've been talking about 8BitDo a fair bit recently, as the Chinese peripheral maker has just made its large catalogue of controllers backwards compatible with Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-8bitdo-controllers-require-a-firmware-update-to-work-on-switch-2">via a firmware update</a>, and they've also got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/fight-fans-rejoice-8bitdo-is-launching-a-new-arcade-controller-for-the-switch">snazzy arcade controller</a> for Switch, too.</p>
<p>This review, though, I'm taking a look at the brand new 8BitDo Pro 3 Controller which is a very, very nice-looking piece of kit. Especially if you get the Gamecube-styled purple one. I got a grey one, which I'm not cross at anyone about. It's all good.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xyqskm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Controllers, it feels to me at least, have become even more of a hot topic than usual these days, and a lot of this interest is to do with the leaps and/or bounds being made in joystick and trigger technology. Issues like <em>*whisper it*</em> stick drift and unresponsive or janky triggers are being dealt with by utilising technology like Hall Effect or the newer TMR variety of magnetic wizardry to solve age-old problems.</p>
<p>8BitDo's Pro 3 Controller is compatible with Switch 1 and 2 (as well as PC, Apple, Steam, and Android devices), packs TMR joysticks, which are apparently even more sensitive than Hall Effect. Everyone wants TMR — that's 'Tunnelling Magnetoresistance' — sticks this year, where last year it was Hall Effect or die, it seemed. Anyway, TMR they are and they feel brilliant.</p>
<p>There's a high-quality feel to this controller all around, in fact, that I'm gonna say sits just fractionally below <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Nintendo's Pro Controller 2</a>. Now, considering that the Pro 2 may well be the most premium-feeling controller I've held (and I own some nice ones), this is a great turnout for a third-party product, and even with swappable magnetic buttons — sometimes these things just make the overall product feel jankier — it all comes off as properly expensive and nice to hold. It's weighty, the rumble feels great, and those joysticks...this magnetic magic, or voodoo, or whatever it is the stick boffins are putting in here, it is damn smooth and responsive.</p>

<p>In terms of the triggers, they can be switched between two modes, giving you Hall Effect and micro-switch options. What does this mean? Well, it means you've got a little switch beside your triggers on both sides to move between the regular Hall Effect trigger action (that's just normal trigger movement to you and me, mate), and a micro-switch mode that means the triggers don't move, they just click when you push them. Simples!</p>
<p>They feel fantastic, and I love the extra length they've been given, as it adds a little more to the grip and makes differentiating between the two sets of shoulder buttons easy-peasy. Oh, and speaking of grip, the entire back of this controller is a slightly darker shade of grey, indicating a nice gripped surface that keeps the thing in your hand, even when you're getting sweaty on the last few moments of a round of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> - the game I've used mostly to test this one out.</p>
<p>Right beside the bumper buttons along the top of the Pro 3, you've also got two smaller 'L4' and 'R4' programmable buttons, too, and these combine with the 'PR' and 'PL' paddles on the back to give you lots of options on programming in-game button placements.</p>
<p>In terms of the D-pad, it's a retro-feeling, bulky sort of number which is raised up quite nicely, so it's one of the better ones I've used recently in the patented D-pad test I've devised (sticking on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ultra_street_fighter_ii_the_final_challengers">Street Fighter 2</a> to see how many hadouken fails I get. Yes, that's right, I'm a scientist now).</p>
<p>The ol' D-pad, of course, is a very personal taste, mileage-varying sort of thing, but for my fighting game needs, this is doing the business. Oh, and it's nice and clicky through all its points, which I love. If you hate weak, mushy-feeling D-pads, this one is the opposite. It stands out from the face of the controller and feels properly solid.</p>
<p>To connect the Pro 3 to your Switch or Switch 2, you've got a couple of options, with a USB-C dongle for the 2.4ghz connection, alongside Bluetooth and good old wired mode. Everything here was easy to set up and get running, and I've had no issues in using the controller using any of these connection methods. Now, though, is a reasonable time to point out one of only two real complaints I have with the 8BitDo Pro 3; it can't wake the Switch 2 up from sleeping. Oh dear.</p>
<p>This <em>is</em> an issue with third-party stuff for Switch 2 at the moment (although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/gulikit-elves-2-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-wake-up-support-cant-make-up-for-the-downgrades">some manufacturers seem to be getting around the issue now</a>), and it's just a bit of a shame we don't have that luxury here. If this thing could wake the Switch 2 up, as it can do the Switch — which is even more annoying — then I would be struggling to find fault, really, but for now it is an issue that irritates me, and I hope they update the controller so it can wake both consoles.</p>

<p>On to the changeable magnetic face-buttons now (the fun stuff), and I have to say I always shy away from controllers with parts that come off and on, as they sometimes feel a bit naff as a result. However, this is a nice, straightforward magnetic swap-over that takes less than a minute, and the SNES-styled coloured buttons look cracking.</p>
<p>The controller comes with a very nice charging stand that has a discreet light bar running along the bottom, so it looks cool in a dark room. On the bottom of the stand you'll find a little compartment; in here you've got space to store your buttons, and it's here you'll find the magnetic button tool for swapping them out. This is also where you'll find your USB-C dongle, so don't panic — like somebody I know did — if you can't see it when you open the box. I've got the coloured buttons on my Pro 3 at the moment, and I doubt I'll take them off.</p>
<p>Now, besides the magnetic button fun, you also get two lovely ball-top joystick caps, so you can go full retro arcade mode. Big red shiny balls are always an unexpected delight, they feel good on your thumbs, and they look ridiculous. What more could you ask for?</p>
<p>Some gamers don't like the layout of this particular style of controller with both sticks down on a level at the bottom, but I've always been a fan, so this aspect doesn't bother me, but it's worth noting. As too are all the other bells and whistles you get here, such as six-point motion control, a turbo function, and that charging dock, which, again, feels proper premium in its materials and robustness.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of battery life, I've played from a full charge on this controller for absolutely ages, and it seems 8BitDo's claims of 20 hours of battery life are on the money. This positive, however, shall now transform into my second issue with the Pro 3. Well, it's not me, actually, it's 8BitDo; they've gone and made it so you can't take the battery out. It's welded in there.</p>

<p>This is a shame, obviously, as if the battery dies, well, it's wired-only time, and for some it'll just be a total dealbreaker. I'm of the opinion that, whilst not ideal, I'm willing to take the trade-off for a longer-lasting battery, and it definitely adds to how solid and nice the controller feels overall, having it so permanently put together. However, I get the annoyance.</p>
<p>Overall, then, the 8BitDo controller is a bit of a belter. It can't wake up the console, and you can't remove the battery. Those are my only issues, and they're big ones, no doubt. But I'm happy enough with the style and vibe of this controller, the finish and feel — especially given we get TMR and Hall Effect and all the things that push some controllers up into crazy price ranges — for $69.99/£59.99. It may not be bargain basement territory, but the tech here is stuff I have paid way more for quite recently on PC.</p>
<p>It's also tech that works and is worth shouting about. TMR sticks are super smooth and responsive, the triggers feel bloody great, and it gives your Switch 2 games a real boost if you're making the jump from Joy-Con. I will also say that while I prefer the overall feel of Nintendo's Pro Controller 2 in my hands, 8BitDo's offering here wins with regards to its sticks, triggers, D-pad <em>and</em> selection of programmable buttons.</p>

<p>So, whilst Nintendo's premium offering can wake the console, for me it's being beaten when you're actually in-game. Not a bad showing then, and as someone who owns a fair few 8BitDo controllers, such as the lovely <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/hardware_8bitdo_sn30_proplus_review_-_the_best_third-party_switch_controller_just_got_better">SN30 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/hardware_review_8bitdo_m30_-_the_best_retro_controller_on_switch">M30</a> varieties for Switch, this is my favourite so far from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Now, I'm gonna get my big red thumbsticks on here and go play something really sad. For that sweet juxtaposition.</p>

<figure><a title="Metroid NES box" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/94916cc00d993/metroid-nes-box.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a>'s <a href="https://youtu.be/gFUGG6SFiQQ?si=TLUr5Q5RkF2kVSL_">ending theme</a> is one of the most iconic pieces of video game music from the NES era. The shift from serious and determined to celebratory is masterful for the area; of course, what else would you expect from Hirokazu Tanaka?</p>
<p>Well, the legendary composer — also known as 'Hip' or 'Chip' Tanaka — has shared his motivation for composing that track on <a href="https://x.com/tanac2e/status/1953024137364160999">social media</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-composer-reveals-metroids-ending-theme-was-made-to-impress-one-debugger-on-the-team-i-composed-the-theme-specifically-for-him/">Automaton Media</a>). And it was all to impress one debugger on the Famicom and NES game.</p>
<p>This debugger was playing through the game during the final stages of the debugging process, and many other employees at Nintendo had gathered to cheer him on. Tanaka, however, went one step further and composed the ending theme <em>specifically</em> for this moment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The final debugging stage of Metroid’s development was quite memorable for me. We had one staff member that was older than us, and wasn’t an active member of the production team.... I composed the ending theme specifically because I wanted him to feel deeply moved after completing the game.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a touching little reason to make a song, particularly for someone who was less familiar with the game and was there simply to catch bugs and issues.</p>
<p>And Tanaka sets the scene perfectly, describing the events of the endgame: "I think people who have played the game understand, but even if you manage to rush through defeating Mother Brain, the escape sequence is surprisingly tough, lol" he continues, echoing a sentiment I think we all understood as first-time Metroid players.</p>

<p>But it went beyond just composing the song for the moment, it was all about the entire atmosphere: "For the sake of one debugger, we kept switching to a bigger monitor and making the sounds louder and louder, creating such an amazing atmosphere. All of the staff was having so much fun debugging." And it sounds like it!</p>
<p>The original Metroid released on the Famicom Disk System on 6th August 1986, making the game 39-years-old — how on <em>earth</em> are we about to celebrate Metroid's 40th anniversary next year? Renowned for its tight controls and immersive map, and celebrated as one of the earliest examples of having a female protagonist, it kickstarted one of Nintendo's most-beloved franchises.</p>
<p>'Hip' Tanaka was recently at BitSummit 2025 in Japan and, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/tetris-and-metroid-composer-hip-tanaka-is-getting-back-into-video-game-music">when speaking to outlet VGC, mentioned that he wants to compose a video game soundtrack again</a>. We'd welcome it.</p>

			<p>The first Batman: Arkham Knight HD texture pack is now available for download, ten years after the game's debut on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>The new texture pack, which has been created by GPUnity in collaboration with other developers such as Neato, Mr. Binks, and Ranger, enhances multiple low-resolution textures with a mix of upscaling and manual work, and the end results go a long way in improving the game's visuals at high resolutions. You can download the texture pack from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/batmanarkhamknight/mods/2671">Nexus Mods</a>, and check out how the new textures improve the game's visuals in the video below.</p>

<p>Batman: Arkham Knight is the last entry in the series developed by Rocksteady. Released back in 2015 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, the game is remembered for having been released in a terrible state on PC, requiring <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-knight-gets-new-pc-patch-to-improve-vram-management-november-dlc/">multiple patches</a> to fix. The third and final main entry in the series was ported to Nintendo Switch in late 2023, becoming likewise infamous for being one of the worst third-party ports released on the system, running at a whopping<a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-knight-embarassing-switch-0-fps/"> 0 FPS</a> in some scenarios. The Nintendo Switch 2 excellent backward compatibility feature, however, allows the game to take advantage of the system's specs to <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-knight-fixed-nintendo-switch-2/">brute force better performance.</a></p>



<p>After releasing Batman: Arkham Knight, Rocksteady released Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, a live service game that not only failed to deliver an engaging experience but also looked <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-dated-batman-arkham/">considerably worse</a> than the third entry in the studio's iconic series. You can learn more about the failed live service game by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avalanche-studios-contraband-reportedly-canceled-by-xbox.1265676/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox Game Studios has reportedly canceled&nbsp;<em>Contraband</em>, the next game from <i>Just Cause&nbsp;</i>developer Avalanche Studios, following four years of silence from both studios regarding the game.</p>

<p>That's according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who reported the cancellation on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lvt7g4p7fs2k" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>. Given that we haven't heard anything about&nbsp;<em>Contraband&nbsp;</em>for four years, its cancellation is perhaps unsurprising, but it's a shame nonetheless.</p>

<p>Of course, we didn't know that much about&nbsp;<em>Contraband&nbsp;</em>to begin with. When it was <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/06/13/announcing-contraband/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced in 2021</a>, Avalanche said the game, which was to be a "co-op smuggler's paradise", would be the studio's "most ambitious and spectacular game to date", but beyond that, not much was revealed about the project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/contraband-xbox-canceled-just-cause-4.jpg?itok=KIba7MRl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/contraband-xbox-canceled-just-cause-4.jpg?itok=rgVBzlhN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>developer Avalanche Studios' game&nbsp;<em>Contraband&nbsp;</em>has reportedly been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>Avalanche did say that the game would utilize&nbsp;<em>Just Cause</em>'s Apex Engine, and as far as we knew, the game would be an Xbox Series X|S exclusive, although given Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">recent moves</a> towards <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">platform agnosticism</a>, that may not have been the case for long.</p>

<p><em>Contraband</em>'s cancellation comes after a massive wave of Microsoft layoffs that saw around 9,000 company employees lose their jobs, as well as high-profile game and studio shutdowns under the Xbox brand.</p>

<p>These included the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">cancellation of Rare's&nbsp;<em>Everwild</em></a>, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">shuttering</a> of The Initiative's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/report-indicates-perfect-dark-studio-initiative-hemorrhaging-staff" rel="nofollow">reportedly troubled</a>&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot, along with the closure of that studio. As far as we know, Rare remains operational, although it doesn't have any active projects that have been announced publicly.</p>

<p>According to what a Microsoft spokesperson told Schreier, despite these high-profile shutdowns, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">Hideo Kojima's&nbsp;<em>OD</em></a>, which will serve as a collaboration with Xbox Game Studios, is still in development (for the time being, at least).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As far as I’m concerned, 8BitDo’s Pro 3 is the ultimate controller. You may already know that it makes a model literally called the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/678772/8bitdo-controller-gaming-favorites">Ultimate controller</a>, but it plays second fiddle to the new Pro 3 in some key ways. It’s highly customizable, allowing you to change the face buttons, joystick caps, and more.</p><p>Let me explain: like most other 8BitDo controllers, it’s made to work on multiple platforms, but the Pro 3’s swappable ABXY face buttons allow it to actually transform as needed, say, if you’re going from Switch to PC, or vice versa. You can just pull off the buttons, which all but requires the included magnetic suction tool. It can’t easily be done by hand, a perk for someone like me who has a baby at home. I feel comfortable knowing that they won’t just pop off when my kid smacks it around.</p><p>Another fun addition is that you can swap the standard joystick caps in favor of bright, shiny arcade stick-like nubs. That’s the first thing that I did after unboxing the controller. How essential they are to your moment-to-moment gaming will come down to taste and the types of games you want to play. Playing <em>Soulcalibur II</em> via the Switch Online GameCube library felt better (or at least more fun) than with other controllers. The arcade stick caps are best for games that require quick flicks. They’re too slippery for games that require you to hold the sticks in a direction for a long time. I felt the need to swap them out for Switch 2 games like <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> and <em>Mario Kart World.</em></p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>The button faces don’t come off easily without the included magnetized suction tool.</figcaption> <cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364301/8bitdo-pro-2-controller-review-switch-back-buttons">2021’s Pro 2</a> before it, the Pro 3 feels great in my medium-sized hands. It’s a safe pick for those who want a reliable D-pad that’s easy to reach, and who prefer the symmetrical PlayStation-style joystick layout. While I’ve grown accustomed to the $84.99 Switch 2 Pro since getting the new console, there’s something about the Pro 3’s design that fits like a glove for me, even though it has been a long time since I last grabbed a DualShock.</p><p>The Pro 3 costs $69.99, a $20 price increase over the previous generation. However, its added features easily warrant the higher cost, unless you’re a discerning Switch 2 player who’s looking for a 1:1 matching of features with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">Switch 2 Pro</a>. I’ll get into where it misses the mark below, but the Pro 3 has better trigger and stick technology. The highlights include the shift to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR joysticks</a>, which are improved over the already-great Hall effect sticks and are more power efficient. It also includes more accurate Hall effect triggers instead of the linear ones in its predecessor. These specs should ensure a longer lifespan than controllers that fall short by comparison.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Includes charging dock and 2.4GHz dongle</li><li>Highly customizable</li><li>Particularly comfortable for small-handed gamers</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Next-level bad rumble</li><li>Can’t wake Switch 2</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The Pro 2 was among the initial wave of acclaimed third-party controllers to adopt customizable back paddles, and the Pro 3 builds on that with new L4 and R4 macro buttons between the triggers and its USB-C charging port, just like on the 8BitDo Ultimate 2. I like having more buttons, and these are unobtrusive in case you’re the type who expects to never touch them.</p><p>Nearly everything on the gamepad can be customized in 8BitDo’s Ultimate V2 PC app. You can make up to three profiles, each with its own button assignments, joystick sensitivity, and more, and swap between them with a dedicated button located between the joysticks. Alternatively, if you just want to quickly assign a one-off command or combo to one of its extra inputs, just hold the desired button you wish to assign to, then simultaneously press the original one(s) you’re copying and press the star button. It sounds complicated, but it gets easier with practice.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>The Pro 3 features new L4 and R4 buttons, just like the Ultimate 2.</figcaption> <cite>Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>In addition to the two sets of customizable buttons and magnetically-attached face buttons, this new model also features adjustable trigger distances via two switches. Toggling the switch shortens the distance you have to push to actuate it. This feature is also available in the 8BitDo Ultimate 2.</p><p>8BitDo’s latest controller is compatible with a ton of devices via Bluetooth, including the Steam Deck, Windows PC, Mac OS, Android, Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro, and other products. You can toggle between three modes as needed with a switch on its back: D input (DirectInput), X input, and S input (Switch). Both the Switch and PC also support a 2.4GHz mode, enabled by a dongle integrated into the sleek charging dock that comes with purchase. Being able to situate the charging dock wherever I liked ensured that I was able to get better wireless range than I typically get with a DualSense connected over Bluetooth to my PC.</p><p>I’ve mainly used the Pro 3 with my Switch 2. The built-in motion controls work great, but there are a couple of things holding it back from being my primary controller. Namely, its rumble effects feel imprecise and hyperactive. I really enjoy rumble, particularly in first-party Nintendo Switch games, so I was disappointed that turning it off was the only way I could enjoy playing Switch games with the Pro 3. It also can’t wake the Switch 2 from standby mode, which seems like an oversight since some of 8BitDo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716763/gulikit-elves-2-controller-wake-switch-2">competitors claim to have figured it out</a>. However, it can wake the original Switch from standby mode, as well as the Steam Deck OLED (but not the LCD model).</p><p>The Pro 3 isn’t worth upgrading to if you have one of 8BitDo’s recent controllers. But if you’ve been waiting to replace your Pro 2, this new model is suitably packed with enough features to warrant the higher cost. Even for those who haven’t tried this line before, this is a highly customizable gamepad that’s great for multiple platforms, especially since its face buttons can be switched around. I think it’s a fantastic PC controller. But if you plan to use it mainly on Switch 2, like me, its perks and cheaper price aren’t appealing enough to sway me from the more feature-complete Switch 2 Pro controller.</p><p><em>Photography by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/reviews/755307/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-review-pc-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-soundtrack-netflix-animated-stream-1851785935"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> is </span><a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/top-10-reports/can-kpop-demon-hunters-topple-red-notice-plus-debuts-of-leanne-and-my-oxford-year-netflix-top-10-report/"><span>projected to possibly become Netflix’s most-streamed movie ever</span></a><span> in the coming weeks, and for good reason. The animated action musical is a visual feast that’s already made its way to </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular"><span>the #4 spot on Netflix’s all-time list</span></a><span>, buoyed by an incredible KPop soundtrack by fictional groups Huntr/x and Saja Boys that is topping the charts in the music world. That collection of original songs has been one of the major draws for the film, but how do those songs compare to one another? Some songs are elevated (or, in other cases, hindered) by their placement in the movie, but in a musical, no song is ever </span><i><span>just</span></i><span> a song. It’s a moment in a story crystallized and encapsulated in its most uninhibited form. So even if a song doesn’t quite hit the same way others do, that very feeling of something being off or the characters not quite giving it their all is very likely a storytelling tool in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>. We’re going to examine each of these numbers within that context and rank all seven of its original songs.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>“Takedown”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Huntrix - Takedown (Lyrics) KPop Demon Hunters" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7P-ODFkHd5Y?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Hey, hey, hey. We just started. Put the tomatoes away until the end, please. “Takedown” is a fan favorite (let’s be honest, most of the songs are fan favorites because they’re all bangers), but when the song’s entire narrative meaning in the film is that the girls are decidedly unenthusiastic about the diss track, it’s not too surprising that it’s one of Huntr/x’s weaker works. It oozes attitude and grit, but even when it comes to those vibes, the song is pretty markedly outclassed by another song that blew the roof off at the beginning of the movie. Even when I was rewatching the film and hearing the girls brainstorm its lyrics without any of the backing music, I just didn’t feel that the group’s heart was in it like it is in all the other numbers. It’s an effective storytelling tool, but it doesn’t translate to one of </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ better</span> <span>songs.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>“Soda Pop”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="&quot;Soda Pop&quot; Official Lyric Video | KPop Demon Hunters | Sony Animation" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/983bBbJx0Mk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Saja Boys’ debut single is, as Mira says while the demon boy band is performing it for the first time, “infectious.” It’s the most straightforward bubblegum pop song in the movie, and the group’s flirtatious sex appeal cranks its cutesy wordplay up to something that would have all the girls and gays losing their goddamn minds in an arena show. The Saja Boys mostly end up being extensions of Jinu’s plans throughout the movie, but “Soda Pop” is the one time it feels like all five members really get to express their individual personalities, from Baby Saja getting to rap to Romance having a…well, romantic, lilting singing tone that gets put on display in the pre-chorus. The whole thing is, on its face, the kind of chart-topping hit that brings a new boy band outfit into the spotlight, but it all hides an insidious undertone, as it talks about the audience as something to be consumed. That’s foreshadowing, baby.</span></p>

 <h2><b>“Golden”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="“Golden” Official Lyric Video | KPop Demon Hunters | Sony Animation" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yebNIHKAC4A?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Ah, I see the tomatoes are out once again. Look, all these songs are great. “Golden,” easily the breakout song for </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>based on chart and streaming numbers, is a gorgeous vocal showcase for lead singer Rumi, who absolutely soars as she sings of self-acceptance and her and her girls overcoming adversity to be their truest selves…only to take on a much more introspective, reserved tone in the bridge. As she privately whispers to herself about her own demonic patterns that she’s hidden from her friends and the world, “Golden” becomes a surprisingly subversive anthem that sets the tone for the entire film. It’s great! But it had some tough competition in this ranking.</span></p> <p><b>“Your Idol”</b></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="&quot;Your Idol&quot; | Official Song Clip | KPop Demon Hunters | Sony Animation" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWppAbqm9I8?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>The Saja Boys’ second song, “Your Idol,” is a masterful mask-off moment. The demonic group has shed their boy-band disguise and is presenting to an audience of brainwashed fans as their true, hellish selves. Gone are the neon color palettes of the Saja Boys’ original costumes; they’re now dressed in traditional Korean garb with their demonic patterns exposed for all the world to see. If that weren’t enough of an indicator that everything has gone awry, the song’s haunting Latin chant in the opening portends a world completely overtaken by the demon king and his musical lackeys. Even as the song shifts into an absolutely filthy industrial pop beat, the choir still chants underneath the Saja Boys’ singing as they beckon the helpless crowd into the mouth of the demon king. Jinu and his demon crew still put on a seductive show, but their violent intention is no longer masked behind boyish good looks. It’s a harrowing song that’s also an absolute banger.</span></p> <h2><b>“How It’s Done”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="&quot;How It's Done&quot; Official Lyric Video | KPop Demon Hunters | Sony Animation" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QGsevnbItdU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>“Takedown” is billed as </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ diss track, but “How It’s Done,” the opening number that introduces Huntr/x’s demon-hunting musical talents, is so superior as a showcase of the girls’ attitude, lyricism, and their status as pro-level haters, that it takes the wind out of the other song’s sails. “How It’s Done” and the opening sequence set to it make for such an incredible tone-setter for the whole film that it’s a feat in and of itself that the movie manages to live up to it across the rest of its runtime. It’s a barrage of nasty reads, fierce wordplay, and infectious swagger set to incredible demon-slaying choreography. Every beat, bar, and change in flow has a corresponding strike, stab, or bludgeon as the girls rock a bunch of demons’ shit while rapping and singing about how these foes are just cannon fodder, roaches to be crushed under their heels while they get ready to perform for thousands of adoring fans. Then these absolute queens </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>dive onto the stage while skysurfing on their enemies’ ragdolling bodies and making sure their makeup and hair are just right. If you came into </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>even vaguely unconvinced it would have the sauce, Huntr/x silences any doubts with “How It’s Done.” God, that shit rules.</span></p>

 <h2><b>“Free”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="&quot;Free&quot; | Official Lyric Video | Sony Animation" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fjOeJssZX_Q?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>I think “Free” is the best animated musical love song since “A Whole New World” from </span><i><span>Aladdin</span></i><span>. I know that’s a bold statement, but Rumi and Jinu’s lone duet in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is such a lovely vocal showcase for both singers, and by god, I feel my soul lift from my body every time the chorus hits. “Free” is </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>at its most restrained, and even then, it is head and shoulders above the best most movie musicals have to offer as a vocal showcase for its leads. The ballad is a beautiful admission from two warring parties that they can dream of a life beyond the ones they’ve been told they have to have, and maybe, if they can find a way, they can reach that life together. Rumi’s singing is as gorgeous as ever, but one of the most surprising aspects is Jinu’s rap-like verse that manages to fit surprisingly well into a song that, up until that point, had been a pretty straightforward ballad. The song builds so well, utilizing both singers’ strengths in a way that makes it feel like the two are crafting it together, making space for one another’s talents as well as all their faults. Goddamn, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>knows how to tell a story in songwriting just as well as it does in lyricism.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>“What It Sounds Like”</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="“What It Sounds Like” Song Clip | KPop Demon Hunters | Netflix Family" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ug_pv5-r1js?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>A good musical can live or die by its closing number. By the time </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span> reaches “What It Sounds Like,” it’s already had six good to incredible songs, and it somehow has to leave on a note that wraps up its story, sums up everything its characters have learned, and is also an incredible group performance that manages to be at least on par with everything it’s already done. “What It Sounds Like” does all of that so effortlessly that I’m still kind of in awe of it. You know what I do when I’m not listening to “What It Sounds Like”? I’m watching people react to it and making sure I’m not the only person who cries his eyes out as Huntr/x, having been torn apart and nearly lost to demonic influence, sing their apologies to one another as they fight their way through an army of demon spawn. The audience watches on, singing with them, and empowering the group to keep fighting, and eventually, they win the day.</span></p> <p><span>Much of Rumi’s inner struggle in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>is in the self-imposed restraints she’s put on herself after being told for her whole life that she was a mistake to be corrected. It’s why her heart isn’t in the anti-demon sentiment of “Takedown.” It’s why “Golden” has to have an aside in which she gets to talk about what she’s actually feeling before she goes back out on stage to sing about the joys of being herself. “What It Sounds Like” is an anthemic summation of everything she and the rest of Huntr/x should have been doing this entire time. Rather than hiding everything from each other and the public and pretending to be perfect to write a song they couldn’t believe in, they’re putting it all on the line for one final, world-saving song that reflects who they truly are, rather than who they’ve been told they should be.</span></p> <p><span>“The song we couldn’t write, this is what it sounds like.”</span></p>

<p>PlayStation has announced what games were the most downloaded across its platforms for July 2025. The company revealed the most downloaded titles on PlayStation 5 (PS5), PlayStation 4 (PS4), PlayStation VR 2 (PS VR 2), and free-to-play.</p>



<p>The data separates the United States (US) and European Union (EU) downloads.</p>



<p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/08/playstation-store-july-2025s-top-downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Leading the way</a> on PS5 in the US should be no surprise as College Football 26 led the way after its July 7 launch. In the EU, the top spot on PS5 was held by Ready or Not, which came in 2nd in the US. In what could be viewed as a surprise to some, Sloclap’s recent soccer title Rematch was the third-most downloaded game in the EU and 12th most in the US on PS5.</p>



<p>Moving to PS4, Read Dead Redemption 2 took the top spot in both regions while Fortnite was the number one for the free-to-play games.</p>



<p>You can check out the full list of most-downloaded PlayStation games for yourself below, and let us know which games you picked up in the comments. </p>

<p>According to the former president of Blizzard Entertainment, Call of Duty is going to receive a ‘boot stomp’ from Battlefield 6, which could be a good thing for the FPS genre.</p>



<p>The hype surrounding Battlefield 6 is unreal, with thousands of players flocking to the game’s beta. Before the beta even launched, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-game-servers-full-players-queue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 200,000 players</a> were waiting in line to play the game. Moreover, BF6 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beaten-almost-every-cod-game-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed</a> almost every Call of Duty game on Twitch. But, is it enough to beat Call of Duty: Black Ops 7? </p>



<h2 id="h-former-blizzard-president-thinks-battlefield-6-will-force-call-of-duty-to-change">Former Blizzard President Thinks Battlefield 6 Will Force Call of Duty to Change</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-will-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-former-blizzard-boss-says-but-the-real-win-here-is-cod-wont-be-lazy-anymore-and-well-all-get-better-fps-games-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, the former president of Blizzard Entertainment, Mike Ybarra, posted about Battlefield 6 and Call of Duty on his <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1953621587993014620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). Ybarra’s post states, “Battlefield will boot stomp” Call of Duty in 2025. He adds that the “real win” here would be that this competition will stop Call of Duty from being “lazy” and “better FPS” games can come from it. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year. But the real win here is CoD won’t be lazy anymore, and we’ll all get better FPS games for it.</p>— Mike Ybarra 🎮 (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1953621587993014620?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Ybarra added in a follow-up tweet that Call of Duty has been going “downhill” for years. The game’s a mess, the former president adds, with issues such as “cheating, heavy UI/install, rainbow colors” and more present. Ybarra hopes that Battlefield 6 could be the game that changes things for Call of Duty. </p>



<p>A recent Insider Gaming exclusive report reveals that Activision is closely monitoring Battlefield 6. Still, leadership is not worried about the upcoming title as they feel Call of Duty is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-vs-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too big to fail</a>“. </p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 beta has already been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beta-hit-by-cheaters-clips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit by cheaters</a>, according to the recent clips surfacing online. Additionally, Call of Duty is relying on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-rely-on-17-year-old-reznov-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 17-year-old character</a> to drive pre-orders for Black Ops 7.

			<p>You’ve dusted off dinosaurs, you’ve dived into the Two Point sea, you’ve even visited the netherworld and scoured the far reaches of the known universe. Now your helicopter begins to gather dust, and your Experts are stuck in an endless pattern of restoring the same exhibits, over and over again. But just when you think you’ve found all there is to discover, a brand-new adventure falls into your lap with the Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds DLC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds | OUT NOW!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GRgEvhYj1L0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fantasy Finds, unlocks a Lord of the Rings styled fantasy expedition map, called Scorched Earth, for you to explore. This location is packed with fun Points of Interest (POI’s), including various fantasy realms to travel through. The map isn’t accompanied with a themed museum, like the other Two Point Museum expedition maps do, which is a little disappointing, but does come with an entertainingly silly storyline and enjoyable, yet challenging, objectives to play through.</p>


<p>And a bonus expedition map means bonus exhibits to discover. You won’t be disappointed by the finds on offer as they all come with quirky fantasy qualities – complete with Two Point’s trademark wit and wackiness – and intriguing magical properties. Some exhibits can be worn by your staff to give them a level-up and others can be combined to unlock different features. I particularly enjoy the winged boots magical gear that send the wearer careening off through the museum waving their arms uncontrollably. Or the enchanted find that turns your guests into chickens. Just keep an eye on your expedition rewards – I found at least one of the same exhibit at two different POI’s (one at a much higher price point!).</p>


<p>This Two Point Museum DLC brings new features across the board. Yes, there are the normal unlockables that you’d get with different themes – new decorative items, gift shop gear and floor/wall panels – but Fantasy Finds doesn’t stop there. You’ll be treated to all sorts of additional add-ons like fortune-teller admission booths, tavern-like café furniture, three fresh guest types and themed receptionist announcements (which, let’s face it, is everyone’s favourite bit!).</p>
<p>Plus, Fantasy Finds comes with the latest Expert type, broken down into four subclasses: wizard, bard, rogue and barbarian. This is a brilliantly smart addition to the game, because each subclass of fantasy Expert has their own individual traits in the form strength, dexterity, intelligence and luck stats. Each subclass specialises in one of these four stats, but you can also upgrade and change these numbers if you need to. There’s a huge advantage to this because some POI’s can only be unlocked when a certain subclass reaches a high scale of speciality. In addition, particular POI events can be added or removed from your expedition if your combination of Experts bypasses a particular stat quantity. This is such a clever way of levelling up staff beyond the regular museum training regime and opens up loads of enticing possibilities for you to explore during your gameplay.</p>

<p>The only thing missing from Fantasy Finds is a themed museum. This seems a bit of an oversight as a fantasy museum would have been an entertaining accompaniment. This becomes a little frustrating if, like me, you’ve maxed out all of the other locations to the extent that they’ve started to become a bit laggy. The options then, are to start a new game – and start from curator class zero – have a play in sandbox or add your DLC loot to the recent free add-on museum, Pointy Mountains.</p>
<p>A word to the wise, if you do decide to use your DLC content in Pointy Mountains, your fantasy guest types won’t be able to visit your museum until you’ve achieved two stars. A few of the Scorched Earth POI’s can only be unlocked with buzz from these guests, so you’ll experience a short delay in being able to send expeditions to these areas.</p>

<p>But for me, reaching two stars in Pointy Mountains was a minor inconvenience if it meant I could start a museum from scratch while keeping my curator class, where I could explore all of the exciting features, quirky additions and clever add-ons that this DLC has to offer.</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo My Mario" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c715b5b2a21b9/nintendo-my-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Of the big three platform holders, Nintendo is the 'family-friendly' one. <em>Did you know that?</em></p>
<p>Of course you did - you're an intelligent human being. And over the course of the Switch generation, with all the company's eggs now in a single console basket, Nintendo has diversified its business, leaning into non-gaming areas and getting its IP under the noses of a broader audience with mobile apps, movies, theme parks, stores, and all that game. This has been a stated goal for many years, and the monster success of <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> worked as planned, funnelling interest back to its gaming hardware and software, resulting in revenue bumps across the board.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xyqskm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>However, despite its colourful character roster appealing to kids across the age spectrum, the hand-eye coordination needed to operate a 'proper' video game is beyond the abilities of Nintendo's youngest fans. Until we evolve as a species, that's unlikely to change, so it's that demographic — the one-, two-, three-year-olds — that Nintendo is aiming at with this suite of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">'My Mario' products</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> app, which is coming to Switch as well as smart devices, looks to be a simple touchscreen toy where you can interact with Mario by bopping him on the nose, tweaking his moustache, and generally poking and prodding at the poor plumber like many of us did on the start screen of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Mario 64</a> back in 1996. It's extremely simple stuff on the face of it, but it's designed to surprise, delight, and snare 'em young with that patented Nintendo charm.</p>
<p>Then there's the wood block set - or set<strong>s</strong>, rather. This is baby toy 101, giving the smallest kids the chance to play around with Nintendo characters without jabbing themselves in the eye with the pointy limb of an amiibo or gnawing on and potentially swallowing a Master Sword.</p>
<p>Looking at the high-res PR pics of these blocks, they appear to have the quality you'd expect from Nintendo. The paint and glaze over the blocks let the woodgrain show through, and they would look right at home next to any number of artisanal wooden block sets on the shelves at your local free-range toddler toy boutique - with prices to match.</p>

<p>Of course, there's the basic three-piece set offering Mario, a Question Block, and a Super Mushroom - that'll only set you back 2,980 yen (around $20 / £15). The characters are also amiibo, remember, so I can see this appealing to people who don't even have kids as a cute little display set.</p>
<p>The full 30-piece set, though — which also includes Luigi, Peach, and Yoshi, plus a wider selection of other items and blocks in a nice little case — comes in at a whopping 19,980 yen (around $135 / <em>£</em>100). There's no word yet on the RRP Nintendo will set for these when they come to the West at a later date, but I can hear the <em>"135 bucks for a bunch of wood?!?!"</em> comments already.</p>
<p>As somebody who has spent more time and money in ludicrously expensive boutique kids' toy shops than he'd like over the past few years, I can confirm that 100 quid for a bunch of glossy wooden blocks <em>isn't</em> unheard of. The NFC tag in the amiibo characters adds negligible production cost in itself, but given the need to embed them in the character blocks and the quality of the paint job and materials...yes, unfortunately, I don't see them coming in much cheaper when they arrive on our shores, either.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo My Mario" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1031157f3afb4/nintendo-my-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, my own kids are a year or two past the point where these would appeal — we're in the steering-assisted-Mario-Kart, giggling-and-shouting-"Ooh, ba-nana!" phase right now — but newer Nintendo (grand)parents may find these irresistible. You know, for the kids. And I feel sorry for amiibo fiends who simply have to have every last one. <em>*glances furtively at the Billy bookcase*</em></p>
<p>Ahem. Then there's the Mario book, with pop-out bits and pieces. Yes, seeing all the promo images of smiling parents indoctrinating their defenceless youngsters into the cult of Nintendo gives off disquieting vibes, even for the biggest Nintendo fans. The Pokémon Company has certainly gone further in this direction, with kawaii plushies and products more specifically designed for the youngest of people, but Nintendo's never <em>quite</em> gone here before, never quite stepped into the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse like this, with <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/my-mario/movie/index.html">a stop-motion animated short series</a> and little romper suits and rattles aimed at tiny humans whose facility with a Joy-Con amounts to chewing on it. The Rosalina &amp; Luma Observatory Cot Mobile can't be far off.</p>
<p>Again, everything presented looks like a quality product, and it makes you wonder why it's taken Nintendo so long to go full Disney like this, targeting the audience fresh from the womb in a way that not even self-driving, self-steering, auto-item-deploying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> can manage. For the past decade or more, the Play-It-Loud generation has been phasing into parenthood, so I guess you can chalk this up to Nintendo's slow-and-steady approach. But, slow starters as they are, they're ready now - and they've got their marketing lasers trained on your toddlers.</p>
<p>And your wallets. But there's nothing new about that.</p>

              <p>Did Tencent just stealthily try to walk itself back from the brink after getting sued by Sony for trying to rush a <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969">brazen ripoff of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a> to market? Will the PlayStation 6 be Sony’s least important console yet? And do we finally have our first real clue as to when <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> will come out? Welcome to the latest Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of news, trailers, and other fascinating curios, like how the proprietor of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW-BU6keEUw">Mom’s Spaghetti</a> is totally chill with being known as “<a href="https://twitter.com/Shadyind/status/1953257598129717757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1953257598129717757%7Ctwgr%5E7f954647bca4ad74de71348ad09444d1288fa6ec%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwatch-eminem-react-to-being-called-that-guy-from-fortnite%2F1100-6533781%2F">The guy from <em>Fortnite</em></a>.”</p> <h2>Tencent tries to pretend the <em>Light of Motiram</em> never happened</h2> <p>The Chinese conglomerate was recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-clone-knock-off-light-1851787163">sued by Sony,</a> who alleged that Tencent kept trying to license <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> for a survival crafting game and, when Sony kept saying no, turned around and made it anyway. A week later, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/after-sony-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-dev-store-page/"><em>The Game Post</em> noticed</a> that developer Polaris Quest has quietly been changing out the worst offending images, language, and key art from the game’s Steam page.&nbsp;References to “colossal machines” and “Mechanimals” were stripped from the description and the screenshots and art now focus on generic scenes instead of <em>Light of Motiram</em>‘s Temu version of Aloy. Now that Sony has called Tencent’s bluff, it’ll probably continue to strip out the most egregious <em>Horizon</em> copycat elements from the game. We’ll see if that’s enough to get the PS5 maker to settle.</p> <h2>Sony is moving away from a “hardware centric business model” ahead of the PS6</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sony Senior Vice President Sadahiko Hayakawa says they are gradually shifting their gaming business from a hardware centric business model to a community and engagement based platform business model <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlayStation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PlayStation</a></p> <p>“In the gaming business, we are moving away from a hardware centric… <a href="https://t.co/8xnKyihMHE">pic.twitter.com/8xnKyihMHE</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1953483758667170146?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The console war is grinding to an end. With <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> on PlayStation and<em> Helldivers 2</em> coming to Xbox, the old rivalries are slowly, if not completely, fading into the background. “In the gaming business, we are moving away from a hardware centric business model more to a platform business that expands the community and increases engagement,” senior Sony VP Sadahiko Hayakawa said this week. While in line with the company’s previous comments about focusing more on total players and engagement time over unit sales, the remark still raised eyebrows as the PS5 continues to dominate. Former chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment of America Shawn Layden responded with a GIF of <em>God of War</em>‘s Kratos <a href="https://x.com/ShawnLayden/status/1953706271594397696">putting his head in his hands</a>.</p>

 <h2>The Xbox Rog Ally release date may have just leaked</h2> <p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">Dealabs poster billbil-kun</a>, the new PC gaming handhelds aiming to deliver Xbox-like console experiences will come out in Europe on October 16. Neither the date nor the price of the upcoming hardware has been officially revealed yet, though billbil-kun previously claimed it would cost €599 for the Xbox Ally and €899 for the more powerful Xbox Ally X in Europe. We’ll have to wait and see how those prices translate to the U.S. amid Trump’s current tariff war.</p> <h2>A very convincing theory for<em> Silksong</em>‘s possible release date</h2> <p>Xbox fans will remember that Microsoft used <em>Silksong</em> to hype the Xbox Rog Ally reveal back during its Xbox summer showcase. The most wishlisted game on Steam would be “available at launch and in Game Pass when Ally releases later this year,” Xbox president Sarah Bond said at the time. Based on this, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/we-might-actually-have-a-tenuous-silksong-release-date-absolutely-nobody-on-my-team-believes-me-and-i-think-i-can-hear-hornet-in-my-walls/"><em>PC Gamer</em>‘s Harvey Randall</a> speculates that, if the October 16 leak is accurate, that could also be <em>Silksong</em>‘s launch date. That day is also a Thursday, which is when most new Switch 1 and Switch 2 games come out. Hmmm. Or maybe Bond simply meant that <em>Silksong</em> would already be out by the time the Xbox ROG Ally arrives, which, if that’s the case, is even better!</p> <h2><em>Ashes of the Singularity 2</em> is happening</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ashes of the Singularity II  |  Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SV3k4yxWKS0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The real-time strategy game known for its massive armies will return with a sequel nearly a decade later, this time with a human faction. There’s no release date yet and my current PC will just barely be able to run it but as a huge fan of<em> Total Annihilation</em>, one of the series’ influences, I can’t wait.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite is set to add pet-like cosmetic "Companions" to its battle royale, a series of fresh leaks suggest. Initial designs include a range of dogs, as well as a turtle on a skateboard. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Datamined images sourced from yesterday's new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> season update show what looks to be a golden retriever, a pair of pugs, a robot dog based on the game's iconic Cuddle Team Leader, and the aforementioned skateboard-wielding aquatic reptile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite fans have been aware of plans by developer Epic Games to release pet-like Companions for some time, based on bits of evidence dug up and posted online from past datamines. But today is our first glimpse at the Companions themselves, from what look to be user interface icons for them. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If Fortnite having pets sounds familiar, well, that's because the game <em>technically </em>has them already. During the early years of Fortnite battle royale, at least, the game offered "Pets" — animated animals — that you wore as a "backbling", or essentially like a rucksack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Around a dozen or so of these Pets were released, usually within battle passes, with later designs becoming slightly more elaborate (a floating mind-controlling alien named Choppy is a personal fave, alongside a licensed Baby Yoda). But more recent years have seen Pets left by the wayside, despite fan calls for their return. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Fortnite Leaks 🕜 (@FortniteFNLK) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteFNLK/status/1953578096960938007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Epic Games is believed to be working on Companions as a far more evolved version of Pets, with the creatures able to scamper around in-game near your player character. Fans expect that these creatures will be visible to you and your squad of allies, though perhaps not to enemy players — so there's no blowing up of your new turtle buddy to be had.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Epic Games is yet to acknowledge Companions as being in development, and it's still unclear if they will arrive this season. Whenever they do launch, however, Companions will be the first new cosmetic type introduced to Fortnite since November 2024, when the game introduced Kicks, better known as shoes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday's big Fortnite update saw the game launch a new alien bug-infested season for its main battle royale portion, while Fortnite OG shifted into the beloved season where Kevin the Cube first appeared. Although, as we previously reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/something-is-wrong-fortnite-is-doing-something-strange-but-brilliant-with-its-og-mode-which-is-now-no-longer-just-a-carbon-copy-of-the-original">strange things are going on in Fortnite OG</a> — where the timeline appears to be occuring slightly differently this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>Earlier this summer, a battle between gaming giants began when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/" data-ref-id="1100-6533493">Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent</a>, alleging that the latter's upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencents-new-game-bears-a-shocking-resemblance-to-horizon-zero-dawn/1100-6528178/" data-ref-id="1100-6528178">Light of Motiram</a>, is infringing on Sony's Horizon franchise. Now, Tencent appears to have revamped its presentation of Light of Motiram and downplayed its similarities to Sony's game.</p><p>Tencent has changed several elements on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Light of Motiram's Steam page</a> (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/after-sony-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-dev-store-page/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>), including a new description for the game that drops all references to the mechanimals creatures in the story, which looked and sounded a lot like the ones from Horizon. The new description doesn't have many specific details at all, and instead tells players, "Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land."</p><p>The screenshots for Light of Motiram have also been swapped out on Steam and replaced with new pics that still retain some common elements with Horizon. But the screenshots that had a color palette and backgrounds similar to Horizon have been removed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4546448-lightofmotiram.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4546448" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4546448-lightofmotiram.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4546448"></a><figcaption>Archery is still a big part of Light of Motiram.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4546448-lightofmotiram.jpg"></figure><p>As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-pitched-sony-on-a-horizon-game-set-in-asia/1100-6533509/" data-ref-id="1100-6533509">detailed in Sony's lawsuit</a>, Tencent pitched a Horizon spin-off that would have featured the game's heroine, Aloy, traveling to Asia and encountering new mechanimals inspired by Eastern mythology as well as a brand-new cast of characters. Sony rejected the pitch and alleges that Tencent and developer Polaris Quest went ahead with the game regardless of the company's wishes.</p><p>Light of Motiram's Steam page gives the game a Q4 2027 release window. However, if Sony's lawsuit is successful, the game's release may be in question.</p>

                <p>The fantasy shooters Heretic and Hexen have been remastered and re-released for modern platforms, allowing longtime fans and new players to experience these cult classics all over again. Originally developed by Raven Software and released in 1994 and 1995, the games stood out for combining fast-paced first-person shooter gameplay with dark-fantasy settings and RPG mechanics--a big departure from the sci-fi and military themes popular at the time.</p><p>The remastered collection, Heretic + Hexen, is now available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. This definitive edition includes new features such as two brand-new episodes, support for community-made mods, and both local and online multiplayer. Players can team up in co-op or compete in deathmatch modes, with up to 16 players supported in online play and split-screen options on all platforms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnzow2f3Rt4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jnzow2f3Rt4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Heretic featured a long protagonist--the elven warrior Corvus--Hexen introduced a class-based system, giving players a choice between three characters: the strong and fast Fighter (Baratus), the spell-casting but fragile Mage (Daedolon), and the balanced Cleric (Parias). Each has unique weapons, abilities, and ways to use items, adding some level of replayability and variety of gameplay style. This feature, along with the game's fantasy setting, helped set Hexen apart in the early days of first-person shooters.</p><p>One of the biggest improvements is full cross-platform multiplayer, allowing players across different systems to join games quickly using a room code. The remaster also includes access to the Raven Vault, a collection of behind-the-scenes materials from the original development. For music fans, there's the option to switch between the original MIDI and FM Synth soundtracks or enjoy a modern remix by composer Andrew Hulshult.</p><p>If you already own the original versions of Heretic or Hexen, you'll be able to access and download them on the same platform. Players who already own the original versions of Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, and Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel receive a free upgrade to Heretic + Hexen in their respective game library on the same platforms.</p><p>Steam and GOG versions include these originals as launch options or downloads. The remaster only requires a Bethesda account to access online multiplayer and browse or upload mods, depending on your platform.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have released a brand new car database for <i>Gran Turismo 7</i>, which contains information on the 500-plus vehicles currently available to drive in the racing sim.</p>

<p>The database, which you can access <a href="https://www.gran-turismo.com/gb/gt7/carlist" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, contains 539 cars for you to peruse, and it looks like new ones will be added when the game gets further updates as well.</p>

<p>A number of different organization methods are available for the new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>car list; you can view cars sorted by manufacturer, by the country or region from which they originate, and even by individual specs like drivetrain, power, and weight.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-car-database-racing.jpg?itok=j6ehMQIA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-car-database-racing.jpg?itok=lmSY8HL1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't know what this car is, but I bet the new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>database does.</figcaption></figure><p>Clicking on each car will give you a detailed breakdown of that car's specs, including stats like its displacement, max power (I got it from a hairdryer), and max torque, among other things.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to see a gallery of images of the car from different angles, so this new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>car database really is a gearhead's dream. If you've ever wanted to just chill out and read info about cars, this is the place to do it.</p>

<p>You can view the car list either as a series of images of each car or as a more prosaic text list, so if you're just looking for cars of a particular weight class or max BHP value, then you can simply switch to the text view and find what you're looking for.</p>

<p>Released in 2022,&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates since launching, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-161" rel="nofollow">latest of which</a> gives you the chance to drive an incredibly rare car (in the game, of course, not in real life, as fun as that would be).</p>

              <p>Late on August 7, <em>GTA</em> publisher Take Two put out its quarterly earnings report, accompanied by a shareholder Q&amp;A and interviews with CEO Strauss Zelnick appearing on various outlets. Obviously, the big question everyone had is: How much are you going to charge for <em>GTA 6</em>? Zelnick chose to deliver some extra-special corporate gloop instead of actually answering.</p> <p>Rumors have been flying back and forth over the price of next year’s&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em>, with a recent round of “industry analyst” nonsense <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/analyst-says-i-expect-a-usd100-price-point-for-gta-6-estimates-rockstars-development-cost-is-over-usd1-5-billion-and-predicts-it-will-earn-usd10-billion-lifetime-and-another-usd500-million-annually-from-gta-online/">declaring that the game will cost $100</a>. However, while something around $70 to $80 seems far more likely, Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick avoided giving a price when speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/take-two-gta-6-pricing-debate-june-earnings-1236481561/"><em>Variety</em></a>.</p> <p>Game prices are in something of a hinterland, with many publishers wanting to follow Nintendo’s lead up to a standard price of $80 but seemingly being afraid to push the button. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292">Microsoft recently backtracked on the plan</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-price-70-80-ea-preorder-black-ops-7-1851787292">EA has made clear it intends to stick with $70 for the foreseeable future</a>, and perhaps most relevantly here, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-tag-70-drama-pitchford-80-real-fan-1851784583">Take Two recently said&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em> would be $70</a>, after <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-games-1851781445">Randy Pitchford made a twerp of himself on the subject</a>. Many, however, are predicting that if any game could push prices up, it’s&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>.</p>

 <p>In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-the-firms-most-robust-release-schedule-and-preparation-for-gta-6s-launch">an interview with&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em></a>, Zelnick put modesty aside and said of <em>GTA 6</em>, “I do think it’s fair to say that this is perhaps the most highly anticipated property pre-release in the history of entertainment.” Given this confidence, you might think the CEO would be willing to just state the intended price for the game. However, when&nbsp;<em>Variety&nbsp;</em>spoke to him, he instead prevaricated.</p> <p>“Our goal is always to deliver more value than we charge,” Zelnick told the outlet, which are words that <em>look</em> like they should mean something. He continued, “so we’ve had variable pricing at the company forever.” Mentioning special editions and so on, the response finished, “I think, probably more than most, we’re highly focused on making sure that the experience is great, not just because the game itself is great, but also because consumers have paid a fair price for it.” Yes, but how much will it cost?</p> <p>Zelnick was equally bemusing about <em>Borderlands 4</em> during August 8’s earnings call, responding to a shareholder question about why <em>that</em> game will be $70, “We believe that any consumer experience is the intersection of the thing itself and what you paid for the thing. So our goal is to vastly exceed expectations. We want to put out the best entertainment on Earth.” Yes, but why is it $70?</p>

 <p>When 2020 prices were stepping up from $60 to $70 as a console standard, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-interactive-next-gen-software-price-increases-reflect-the-quality-of-the-experience">Zelnick wasn’t nearly so shy</a> about justifying the increased costs. “We think with the value we offer consumers…and the kind of experience you can really only have on these next-generation consoles, that the price is justified,” the CEO told <em>GI.biz</em> at the time. “But it’s easy to say that when you’re delivering extraordinary quality, and that’s what our company prides itself on doing.”</p> <p>So, we still have no idea what Take Two will be charging for May 26’s&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>. Presumably there’s a desire to hold off and see which way the wind blows over the next nine months. Given Nintendo is sticking to its guns at $80 for&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, but then confusing everything by charging $70 for&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, there’s no clear indication yet. Certainly Microsoft and Sony appear to be sticking to $70 for the upcoming holiday season, but it seems entirely possible that $80 will creep in during 2026.</p> <p>And yes, sure, Take Two&nbsp;<em>could</em> charge $100 for&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>, but it’d be a bad move that would do reputational damage to both the publisher and the game. Presumably there will be a “premium” version priced at around $100, and possibly another at $130 or more, but it seems vanishingly unlikely the vanilla game will cost more than eighty bucks.</p>

<p>Sales of the Grand Theft Auto franchise have been revealed, and the series is nearing 455 million units sold. </p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto is one of the most popular gaming franchises in history, having released several iconic titles, including GTA San Andreas, GTA Vice City, and GTA 5, among others. GTA 5 is one of the longest-running games available today, spanning three generations of consoles and accounting for nearly half of the franchise’s sales. </p>



<h2 id="h-gta-series-has-sold-close-to-half-a-billion-units">GTA Series Has Sold Close to Half a Billion Units</h2>



<p>The new sales details for the GTA series were announced during Take-Two’s latest <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4caa8ce3-9cd2-45d5-b267-593e2391801f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a> (via <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/465433/gta-series-approaches-455m-rdr-series-tops-104m-borderlands-series-tops-94m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGChartz</a>). One of the slides reveals that the Grand Theft Auto franchise has sold “nearly 455 million units”, out of which GTA 5 has sold 215 million units. GTA 5 has also reached $1 billion in retail sales faster than any entertainment release in history and has been the “best-selling title of the past 10 years in the U.S., based on both unit and dollar sales.”</p>



<p>Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption series has also surpassed 104 million units in sales, with RDR2 accounting for over 77 million of those units. The NBA 2K franchise has sold over 162 million units, the Borderlands series has sold over 94 million units, and Sid Meier’s Civilisation has sold over 77 million units. </p>



<p>In other news, Take-Two CEO has dodged a question on whether GTA 6 will be priced at $80, stating that the upcoming title will have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fair-price-80-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a ‘fair price’</a>. Additionally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lazlow-doubt-gta-6-longest-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">longest-serving actor</a> in GTA doubts he will be included in GTA 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Publisher Kalypso Media announced Disciples: Domination, a new installment in the dark fantasy turn based strategy RPG franchise. This is the direct sequel to 2021's Disciples: Liberation (currently 65% off on Steam), though the developer has changed. Whereas Liberation was made by Canadian developer Frima Studio, Domination is being developed by French developer Artefacts Studio.</p>



<p>The narrative of Disciples: Domination begins fifteen years after the ending of Liberation, when Avyanna freed Nevendaar from the gods' tyrannical grip. Players will step on Queen Avyanna’s throne and attempt to hold together a crumbling kingdom.</p>



<p>The fire of doubt burns within the Queen, sparked by the weight of the Yllian throne and stoked by dreams of becoming the monsters she once defied and destroyed. Paralyzed by fear and haunted by her own power, her rule begins to crumble, with allies disappearing and abandoning her just as an unknown force spreads strife and madness throughout her realm.</p>



<p>Players' choices will shape the future, whether for salvation or ruin. As they chase the truths behind the ceaseless conflicts, dark magic, and conspiracies infecting the empire, they must also face betrayal, strife, and shadowy schemes. </p>



<p>Over the course of Disciples: Domination, they'll get to choose their companions. They can be consulted for guidance on the many choices that will shape the faction's reputation and impact how others react to Avyanna's rule. In combat, players will lead their army in tactical, grid-based battles with faster pacing, dynamic events, and richer interaction. New skills, faction abilities, and unit synergies deepen the strategic options available, along with the unique system of strengths and weaknesses.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sega Sales and Profit Fall Due to "Weaker" Back Catalog]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-financials-q1-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-sales-and-profit-fall-due-to-weaker-back-catalog.1265550/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has released its financial summary for the first quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and things aren't looking too good for the&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>studio, although the outlook for the rest of the year is a little rosier.</p>

<p>As revealed in Sega's latest financial <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20250808_q1_presentation_e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a>, sales and income for the company's core gaming segment have fallen when compared to the same period last year. Sega puts this down to "repeat sales", i.e. sales of games from its back catalog, performing "weaker compared to expectations".</p>

<p>Indeed, across the board, Sega's sales are down by around 23%, with income also falling significantly. Despite this, Sega says its first quarter "exceeded expectation", with the company's pachislot and pachinko machine segment getting "off to a good start" this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sega-financials-q1-2025-raidou-remastered.jpg?itok=y_Rk1x5n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sega-financials-q1-2025-raidou-remastered.jpg?itok=_fKB5D03 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sega's first-quarter releases haven't made up for a shortfall in back catalog sales.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Sega, its releases for this quarter, which include titles like June's&nbsp;<em>Raidou Remastered</em>&nbsp;and a remaster of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine</em>, performed "as expected", as did the company's existing free-to-play offerings.</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, a free-to-play game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-release-date-leaked" rel="nofollow">released in the West</a>&nbsp;in June, has gotten off to a steady start, according to Sega. Unfortunately, these games weren't enough to make up for a shortfall in back catalog sales for Sega.</p>

<p>The company's forecast for the rest of the year is looking a little more optimistic, however. Sega reckons it'll do better this year than last when it comes to sales, driven largely by the release of new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>titles later in 2025.</p>

<p>Indeed, Sega's first quarter may have been a little more lucrative had the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled" rel="nofollow">not canceled&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled" rel="nofollow">Football Manager 25</a>&nbsp;</em>in order to focus on its successor earlier this year, but from a quality perspective, that was likely the right decision to take.</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt mode has been given a Fall 2025 release window, indicating it won’t be available at launch. </p>



<p>The remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 is all set to release on August 28, 2025, bringing players back to their beloved stealth action title. The title will feature the same story and world, with brand new visuals and audio, improving on the core experience of the original. The title was also going to receive a brand new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-reveals-fox-hunt-multiplayer-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer game mode</a> called Fox Hunt, but it seems that will be available post-launch.</p>







<p>Konami has posted a new update on its <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/foxhunt/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, which provides a release window for Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt mode. The post only states ‘Fall 2025’ without giving an exact release date. As the MGS 3 Remake is set to release at the end of this month, it seems players will have to do without the Fox Hunt multiplayer mode for some time. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt mode is a hide-and-seek-based online experience. Here, players will utilise elements unique to Metal Gear, including camouflage and survival. The game mode features sneaking gameplay elements iconic to the Metal Gear series, and the new visual enhancements help make the experience that much more immersive. </p>



<p>Worry not, as the other two game modes of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be available at launch. PlayStation and Steam players will receive ‘Snake vs Monkey’, where you have to round up all the escaped apes as Snake. Xbox Series X/S will receive ‘Snake vs Bomberman’, where you have to blast these bombermen across different stages. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Forza Motorsport Video Review In Progress</p>
      </div>
<p>The studio says that it has <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-motorsport-update-21-featured-tours" rel="nofollow ">several events planned for Forza Motorsport</a> throughout August and September, starting with the return of Track Toys Tour as a permanent feature in the game. At the start of each month, an additional Tour will be added to the game until all of these have returned.</p><p>Layoffs at Turn 10 come at a time when the Forza franchise is experiencing positive growth on PS5. Since Microsoft shifted to a multiplatform strategy for its first-party games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-biggest-game-of-2025-is-a-former-xbox-exclusive-analyst-says/1100-6533368/">Forza Horizon 5 and several other former Xbox exclusives</a> have been some of the best-selling games on PS5. Forza Motorsport hasn't been ported to the console yet, but it could only be a matter of time until it does, given the success of other Xbox games on the Sony platform.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Microsoft reported a net revenue of $70.1 billion (up 13%) and a net profit of $25.8 billion (up 18%) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast">for its latest quarter</a>, and a few months later, statements issued by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/">Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-tries-to-defend-shutdown-of-award-winning-hi-fi-rush-studio/1100-6523342/">Xbox president Sarah Bond</a> about the staff cuts weren't well-received. </p>
