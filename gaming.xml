The 2D “Metroidbrainia” was first revealed back in 2024 and it continues to look very neat. You have to uncover secrets and manage the clock to liberate yourself from a glitched time loop. It’s the next game from the creators of the beautiful puzzle adventure <em>The Wild at Heart </em>and it looks like it could be something special. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>
Keepsake Games' Jump Ship is a co-op FPS where up to four players attempt to jump across the universe by selecting from a variety of hand-crafted missions. As the action plays out, they can seamlessly transition from operating their ship to on-foot planetary exploration, even space walks if need be. There's also talk of scavenging to make upgrades and repairs, as well as random elements to keep things fresh. Jump Ship comes to early access this summer.

<p>
Echo Weaver, from Moonlight Kids, is a "time loop metroidBRAINia where time is [the] best resource and secrets are [the] only upgrades." It sees players navigating the remnants of a ruined society - a task made more challenging by the fact they're stuck in a glitching time loop. To escape, they'll need to rely on the energy of the loop itself, using it to complete various actions, including healing, trading, and more. It also proudly proclaims, "No upgrades, no unlocks, just secrets... you can already do everything, you just don't know how yet." Echo Weaver doesn't have a release date, but it's coming to Xbox and PC with a day one release on Game Pass.

<p>
Fans of rogue-lite dungeon-crawling and shop management can witness their loves smash together again later this year when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> 2: The Endless Vault launches for  PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass. Fundamentally, developer Digital Sun/s sequel promises more of the same but it does have a few new tricks, including a new setting a leap from charming pixel out to striking 3D.

<h3>Blue Prince</h3>

<p>
There's a lot of buzz already for developer Dogubomb's "atmospheric architectural adventure" Blue Prince, a fascinating-looking puzzler set in an ever-changing house. The ultimate goal is to find the elusive Room 46 by unravelling the secrets on the 9x5 grid of rooms that makes up the house, but players can only venture so many steps before it reconfigures itself again. It looks absolutely marvellous and it now has a release date, coming to Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on 10th April.

<p>
If, like me, you've been itching to get back into an orange camper van ever since your family's beloved Volkswagen dramatically caught fire in the middle of the road back in the 90s, developer Square Glade Games' Outbound should be pure bliss. It's a game of open-world wilderness roving and survival, where you'll need to grow your own crops, harness natural resources for energy, customise your vehicle, and build a comically impractical house on your roof. Sadly, it's now out until next out until next year, but I'm ready.

<p>
This latest from Far: Lone Sails developer Okomotive, Herdlings is a " stirring and beautiful journey into the mountains... and beyond" that sees players shepherding (or herding, I guess)mysterious creatures across a strikingly picturesque landscape of sweeping mountains, fog-shrouded forests, and more. You'll need to hone your skills to overcome challenges, threads, and a smattering of light puzzles, and you'll probably need a few tissues given it's promising an "emotional, wordless tale of trust, survival, and companionship during a great crossing through a fallen world". Herdling it out this summer on PC and consoles.

<p>
Wax Heads, from developer Patattie Games, continues to look like a treat. It's a "cosy-punk" narrative game about running a struggling record store, where players are charged with satisfying eccentric customers by rooting out the perfect musical purchase. It's got puzzles, arcade cabinets, stickers, and "punchy, humorous" dialogue - and it's coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC in "summer" next year.

<p>
The Lonesome Guild is a single-player action RPG "full of heart, battles, and bonds that change everything" from developer Tiny Bull Studios and publisher Don't Nod that follow protagonist Ghost (a ghost) and their ragtag team of friends as they try to save the world. It promises puzzles, intense battles, and a world full of mystery and treasure that players an explore by seamlessly switching between party members - with new side quests and abilities unlocking as bonds are strengthened among the team. It's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC this autumn.

<p>
Pretty much everything you need to know about Buckshot Roulette is right there in the title. Developer Mike Klubnika's grimly comedic twist on Russian Roulette - the twist being it involves a shotgun - promises bargaining, begging, betrayal, and the change to walk away rich as each 15-minute mach plays out. It was a bit of a viral sensation when it launches in 2023, and it's coming to Xbox and Game Pass "soon".

Suda51 and Swery's 2.5D slasher parody Hotel Barcelona didn't quite make its originally planned 2024 release date, but today's ID@Xbox showing indicates its still on track to release this year. Its weird, wild premise sees novice federal marshal protagonist Justine - who just happens to have an insane serial killer named Dr. Carnival living inside of her - breaking up a serial killer shindig in the titular Pittsburgh hotel by rampaging across seven levels, each inspired by a different horror movie, to kill its boss. And she's got a bit of help, in the form of herself - with previous attempts fighting alongside her as ghosts.

Developer LocalThunk's poker-inspired roguelite Balatro ha been a smashing success since its launch last year. But if you haven't yet played it, you've <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-balatro-has-shadow-dropped-on-game-pass">now the option to do so via Game Pass</a>.

The last band management game I can remember playing was Rockstar Ate My Hamster, and that came out over 35 years ago. Yet Rockbeasts from developer Lichthund somehow reminded me of that games anarchic spirit, even if you're playing grumpy grungy animals instead of parodies of real-life musos. "Lead a band of misfits on a roller-coaster ride to stardom in the age of MTV, rock anthems, and bad haircuts," explains its official blurb, before dropping the bombshell it also stars Iggy Pop. Rockbeasts, officially a "story-driven, role-playing management game" is coming to Steam and consoles later this year.

Ratatan, if you're unfamiliar, is the spiritual successor to Sony Japan Studio's beloved PlayStation Portable rhythm adventure Patapon. It managed to smash its crowdfunding goal within an hour of launch back in 2023 and development's been quietly ticking along since then. Helmed by Patapon creator Hiroyuki Kotani with original Patapon musician Kemmei Adach also onboard, it promises a roguelike blend of rhythm and side-scroller action in which players build an army of 100 Cobun to take on foes. Ratatan was originally targeting an Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC release this April, but its latest gameplay trailer - shared during ID@Xbox - is only saying "2025".

When last we heard from developer Witch Beam, it was gracing us with Unpacking - a lovely little thing that would go on to be crowned Eurogamer's game of 2021. Four years later and it's poised to release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tempopo">Tempopo</a>, a vibrant musical puzzler set across a world of floating islands. Each island is a puzzle and finding the solution will allow protagonist Hana to reclaim a lost musical bloom and replant it in her garden. Finding the solution, however, involves using Hana's conducting skills to guide the titular Tempopo onward, encouraging them to smash, block, lift, and push their way to victory.
It's coming to PC, consoles, and Game Pass on 17h April.

<p>
Tiny Monks Tales' Woodo is absolutely adorable, and I'm already sold on that fact alone. But more specifically, it's a "cosy 3D puzzle matching game" in which players work through a series of diorama charting a new episode in the life of Foxy and Ben the frog. Each new stage brings a new selection of items - lovely, chunky wood-carved things - and players have to figure out where they belong, dropping them into a scene with a satisfying plop. There's no release date for Woodo yet, but it's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation, and PC.

<p>
In Denkiworks' Tanuki: Pon's Summer, the Tanuki Festival is just a month away. Unfortunately, the shrine is also in need of repair - and so enter's Pon, a well meaning Tanuki who gets himself a part-time job delivering packages, all in the name of raising some coin. There's a colourful cast of characters to befriend, a whole bunch of side activities and sports to pursue - from baseball and sushi making to enthusiastic drumming - and best of all, you get a BMX you'll be using to hurtle around the game's four towns, inspired by Kyoto, Aomori, Sapporo, and Beppu. It's a delightful looking thing and it's out on PC, Switch, Xbox, and Game Pass later this year.

<p>
Descenders Next, an extreme-sports-focused sort-of-sequel to developer RageSquid's acclaimed downhill biking hit Descenders, has a release date and will be coming to Xbox, PC, and Game Pass on 9th April. It's an intriguing one too, ditching the exhilarating mountain biking of its predecessor in favour of basically as many extreme sports as possible. That's obviously a pretty ambitious goal, so Descenders Next is starting smaller and focusing on boarding sports - the snow kind and otherwise - across "multiple huge biomes". It's got extensive customisation, a Monstercat soundtrack, and support for up to 12 players.

After getting its neon on in 2023's Tron: Idenity, Bithell Games is back with more future action in Tron: Catlayt. It's an "all-new story-driven, isometric action adventure game" in which players ride Light Cycles and engage in Identity Disc combat as they traverse the crumbling Arq Grid. There's talk of "intriguing stories within a budding revolution", as well as secret areas as shortcuts - all of which players will be able to experience when Tron: Catalyst comes to  PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on 17th June.

<p>
After a bit of a delay nudged Spiritfarer studio Thunder Lotus's 33 Immortals into this year, it's finally almost upon us. It's an intriguing thing too, serving up a striking action roguelike in which players, in the role of damned souls, role of damned souls, must co-operative to defeat hordes of monsters and massive bosses in order to rebel against God's final judgment and fight for their eternal lives. There's a twist, however; as its name implies, it's a chaotic quest designed for 33 players. And if that appeals, it'll 33 Immortals is launching into PC and Xbox Series X/S early access on 18th March.

And finally, a bit of a treat for twinky puppet fans. Lies of P: Overture, the eagerly awaited expansion for 2023's well-received Souls-like just got a striking new story trailer. Overture, a "dramatic prequel" to the base game, transports players to the city of Krat to witness its final days before the Puppet Frenzy massacre. They'll meet a legendary Stalker and journey through Krat together, uncovering untold stories and hidden secrets. And probably a bunch of extremely tough battles too. There's no release day for Lies of P: Overture yet, but it's certainly, but hopefully it's moody new trailer will tide you over.

  <div>
      <div><p>A new <em>Catan</em> Kickstarter campaign has gone live. Fanroll LLC's new <em>Catan Masterpiece</em> campaign isn't for a revised board game edition but for a series of artisanal, bespoke game components in the vein of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-3d-expansion-and-dawn-of-humankind-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Catan 3D</em></a>. The campaign was fully funded in an hour.</p>

<h2>The Catan Masterpiece Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the Kickstarter page, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ultimatecatan/catan-masterpiece-series/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Catan Masterpiece</em></a> campaign started as a premium dice set. This escalated to the studio wanting to reimagine every element of the beloved board game. Those reimagined elements include game pieces made of wood, metal, resin, and cut gemstones.</p>

There are even three sets of player pieces: Metal Classic, Plastic Civilizations, and Metal Civilizations.</p>

<p>The CATAN Masterpiece Series is a tribute to the game that has brought joy and camaraderie to so many. It's a celebration of the countless memories made around the table, the friendships forged through friendly competition, and the sheer excitement of watching your settlements and cities come to life.</p>

After a messy run with Zack Snyder, the new plan was to reboot the DC film franchise, connect the shows and movies to it, and give creators more freedom to make varied projects in different genres. And the two said that the goal is to create a universe that feels interconnected, but with films that still feel separate and standalone. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dc-movies-tv-shows-updates-superman-batman-1236145240/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dc-movies-tv-shows-updates-superman-batman-1236145240/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As covered by <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span><em>,</em> who attended the recent DC Studios press event, Gunn doesn’t want people to feel like they need to do homework and watch a bunch of past content before they see the next big DC show or film. </p><p> “We remain steadfast that each of these projects work as a standalone project,” said Gunn. “So you can see <em>Superman</em>, you can watch <em>Lanterns</em>, without having to see both of them. Although if you can, there will be special things in there for people who have seen both.” </p><p> And this is all part of a larger six-year plan, which the duo confirmed will culminate in an <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>-like crossover movie. Neither exec had any more details to share about this big movie, which is not likely to hit theaters until 2030, but Gunn has experience producing these kinds of superhero event films, having served as an executive producer on Marvel and Disney’s <em>Endgame </em>in 2019. </p><p>To reach the point where such a project is viable in the new DC universe, Gunn and Safran laid out a plan that calls for a lot of content. According to the DC Studio bosses, the company will produce two-live action movies, two live-action shows, and two animated shows every year, some of which will be created exclusively for WB Discovery’s Max. </p><p>It’s an ambitious plan and I worry that it might be too much, too fast, but Gunn and Safran are committed to making sure every movie has a solid script before production begins. Likewise, they admitted they are flexible and will change the plan as needed. </p><p>For example, in 2023, they had no intentions of making a movie about Batman villain Clayface. But then Mike Flanagan, the filmmaker behind works such as <em>Doctor Sleep </em>and <em>Midnight Mass</em>, pitched them one and wrote a script they both loved and it got greenlit. Of course, I’ve not seen <em>Clayface</em>, but it at least sounds like Gunn isn’t too worried about changing plans or fiddling with canon if it means getting a cool movie. That might be the key to defeating superhero fatigue and competing with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-best-worst-movie-avengers-1851765913&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-best-worst-movie-avengers-1851765913">Marvel’s massive MCU</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the nearly 23 years since its release, Neverwinter Nights has remained popular with players who have supported the title with fan-made mods. Now, there's a new expansion for Neverwinter Nights called Doom of Icewind Dale, and it's officially authorized by Wizards of the Coast.</p><p>Doom of Icewind Dale was developed by Luke Scull, a game developer who got his start as a modder for Neverwinter Nights before joining Ossian Studios and working on the official expansion for Neverwinter Nights 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/neverwinter-nights-2-mysteries-of-westgate-review/1900-6209264/" data-ref-id="1900-6209264">Mysteries of Westgate</a>.

From there, players have to reclaim their identity, figure out why they were abducted, and "uncover a sinister plot to unleash a rage-filled godling upon the North."</p><p>The base game is required to play the expansion, but Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition is currently on sale on Fanatical.

It has approximately 10-15 hours of gameplay that lets players explore some of the 10 towns of Icewind Dale, as well as other locations including Icewind Pass, the Dwarven Valley, and the Reghed Glacier. It also includes new monsters and original music created for the expansion.</p><p>Like several of D&amp;D's adaptations, Neverwinter Nights and Doom of Icewind Dale are set in The Forgotten Realms. That setting is also going to be used in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-developing-a-live-action-dungeons-dragons-series-set-in-the-forgotten-realms-report/1100-6529513/" data-ref-id="1100-6529513">the Dungeons &amp; Dragons live-action series</a> that is currently in development.</p><p><em>GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t release until March 20, but that hasn’t stopped some players from getting their hands on a copy of the game. Ubisoft knows about the situation and has, in turn, released a statement to players about Assassin’s Creed Shadows getting out to the public early and the leaks that have followed.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1894135156312617339/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledges that players have</a> “accessed Assassin’s Creed Shadows ahead of its official release”. Ubisoft says that players, if they see the gameplay, should know that there is still some work being done to prepare for the day one experience.</p>



<p>“The development team is still working on patches to prepare the experience for launch and any footage shared online does not represent the final quality of the game,” Ubisoft said.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-dauntless-being-shutdown-by-phoenix-labs-in-may">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dauntless-being-shutdown-by-phoenix-labs-in-may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dauntless Being Shutdown By Phoenix Labs In May</a></h6>



<p>The studio also called the leaks “unfortunate” and “can diminish the excitement for players”. To that point, they suggest those with the game avoid publishing anything to avoid spoiling it for those who are waiting until the game launches.</p>



<p>“We kindly ask you not to spoil the experience for others,” they said. “Thank you to our community for already taking steps to protect everyone from spoilers.</p>



<p>“Stay in the shadows, avoid the spoilers, and keep an eye on our channel for more official surprises in the coming weeks!”</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on March 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game’s launch comes after multiple delays from its original fall 2024 release.</p>

			<p>It's been <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/new-dc-games-netherrealm-rocksteady-batman-arkham-injustice-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed that DC Studios</a> is in talks with Rocksteady and NetherRealm for any upcoming DC video games. This was mentioned during a visit that brought the press out for a studio update on their upcoming films, shows, and games. Typically, games aren't included in these sorts of meetings, but after James Gunn was announced as co-head of DC Studios, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-boss-reveals-plans-to-expand-arkham-universe-beyond-suicide-squad/">announced a plan</a> to include games in an interconnected DC universe.</p>
<p>During this meeting, James Gunn confirmed that the heads of DC Studios have been meeting with WB Games Division Head JB Perrette, where they then meet with members of NetherRealm and Rocksteady.</p>
<p>"We work incredibly closely with JB Perrette who runs that division," said Safran. "it's really the first time its ever been this way at Warner Bros. James and I sit with the guys that run the studios under JB whether it's NetherRealm or Rocksteady. We sit with them and we talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in."</p>
<p>Gunn says that there are designs for the projects "in their very earliest stages," when he then goes on to talk about what the story could be for the character or the game's overall theme. However, when asked about when people will begin to see hints of video games coming in the DCU, James Gunn said that it will be a "couple years" from now.</p>
<p>There's also been no hints as to what kind of games will be in development. It's well-known and well-documented as to what fans would like. Fans have been waiting for Injustice 3 for nearly a decade. However, fans instead received Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. These are two games that did not perform well at all, with the support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League ending last month.</p>
<p>As a result of this, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">Warner Bros. Games CEO left</a> the company thanks to the major failure of the Suicide Squad game and MultiVersus. It's always been known that Marvel is more popular than DC in nearly every avenue, but especially when it comes to DC games. They are known for being hit or miss. However, with new Batman games reportedly in development, there is hope that these games will be as successful as the other Batman games that were released.</p>
<p>What DC games would you want to see from NetherRealm and Rocksteady? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

Three years later, the game has been brought over the finish line by the rest of the team at Indonesian studio Pikselnesia, with a result that feels unavoidably prescient. Though <em>Afterlove EP </em>isn’t without its flaws, its meditation on the mundane ways grief distorts us, and the unglamorous journey of finding our way back to the light, offers an understated catharsis.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Afterlove EP </em>follows Rama, an indie band frontman who loses a part of himself when his partner Cinta unexpectedly passes away. He spends a year in self-inflicted isolation, and by the time he’s ready to crawl out of his apartment and try to be a person again, he’s surprised to see how much of the world has moved on without him. Or, at least, tried to. His bandmates have felt trapped in his indecision, so they’ve been looking for lifeboats off a sinking ship with new projects and career paths. Rama expected everything to be where he left it a year ago. <em>Afterlove EP </em>spends much of its time underlining that while grief deserves sympathy, it doesn’t become a free pass to treat people however you want.</p><p>Grief requires some grace. No one handles the loss of a loved one “perfectly,” and a story that criticizes someone going through that pain can be a tough sell, and easy to fuck up if its characters come off as irredeemable or its approach feels insensitive. <em>Afterlove EP </em>starts out with Rama hearing the disembodied voice of Cinta encouraging him to get back out there and perform again, but as the game goes on, it becomes clear it’s less an echo of a lost loved one and more a manifestation of Rama’s inner monologue. Cinta is defensive and accusatory, and puts Rama’s feelings above everyone else’s. As I lived out Rama’s life, I gradually became frustrated when Cinta would weigh in. This wasn’t the compassionate person her grieving friends described, it was someone who almost always defaulted to Rama’s point of view, siding with him even when his friends had grievances that were more than reasonable.</p><figure id="" data-id="865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-recommend-id="image://865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Adit says &quot;I mean, you're rally pissing me off, Rama.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Adit says &quot;I mean, you're rally pissing me off, Rama.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pikselnesia / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-recommend-id="image://865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Adit says &quot;I mean, you're rally pissing me off, Rama.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If that disconnect between player and protagonist sounds frustrating, it is, but it makes Rama’s growth and the story’s pay-off so much sweeter. Rama starts off sympathetic. He’s grieving the loss of someone who was clearly close to him, but the longer I played <em>Afterlove EP</em>, the more it became clear he was myopically obsessed with his own pain and ignoring how others were affected by his absence. The identification I felt with him gradually gave way to alienation as I stood by and watched his relationships unravel, like I was a friend powerless to stop someone I care about from falling further down into despair. <em>Afterlove EP </em>gave me plenty of opportunities to argue with my friends who felt abandoned by me, but for most of the game, I couldn’t find dialogue options that resembled an apology for my absence, my belligerent musician’s ego, or the selfish way I talked about my grief as if it was more important than anyone else’s. I spent hours of <em>Afterlove EP </em>watching people who cared about each other nearly lose one another because Rama couldn’t see past his own pain. Every time I met up with bandmates trying to pick up where things left off, it felt like the ties between them were one wrong word away from snapping as he insisted on his own vision of the music and the band’s future, and was indifferent to his friends’ pain after they lost a friend, too. Rama can be a frustrating character to pilot in a dialogue-based game, and Cinta’s inability to challenge him made me skeptical of her from the beginning, but <em>Afterlove EP</em>’s commitment to its damaged hero and his dysfunctional friend group is a crucial piece of the story it’s telling.</p><p>There’s a fine line between a sympathetic protagonist and a selfish one, and <em>Afterlove EP</em> balances on it so well that by the time I was hours into Rama’s story—watching him be so fixated on his own shit that he was hurting those closest to him—I only felt sorry for him. He couldn’t see the forest for the trees, even in the face of so many possibilities for forming new connections and repairing old ones.</p><figure id="" data-id="b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-recommend-id="image://b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria listen to music." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rama and Satria listen to music." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pikselnesia / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-recommend-id="image://b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria listen to music." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Afterlove EP </em>plays like a <em>Persona </em>game in which you manage relationships and work each day, deciding whether to spend your limited time seeing friends, busking for money, going to therapy to unpack all the discord within your social circles, or possibly building a relationship with a new suitor. I spent most days hanging out with Satria, a record store shopkeeper who knew exactly how to push Rama’s buttons. He’s part of a queer community that plays music in the local park. Rama hasn’t explored this side of himself, and that kind of self-discovery isn’t made easier by having the disembodied voice of your ex talking to you while you try to form new connections. However, <em>Afterlove EP </em>doesn’t reach for the low-hanging fruit I expected it to when it comes to Rama finding new love. Given Cinta’s hold on him, I feared that Rama moving on to a new partner might see the game create a toxic love triangle in his mind, but instead, things play out quite differently. It was a welcome change after Rama’s mourning had gotten in the way of him moving forward for most of the game. Grief is the foundation <em>Afterlove EP </em>is built on, but its waxings on the topic aren’t the only thing it has to say.</p><p>The thread connecting all these relationships is the indie rock music Rama plays. When you’re not chatting with friends and potential lovers, <em>Afterlove EP </em>is a rhythm game with some really catchy tracks that capture the spirit and gusto of young performers who want a life for themselves outside of the bars and kitchens they work at now. Even if I can’t understand the Indonesian lyrics, I feel the pain and yearning in Rama’s voice and the heavy riffs underneath.</p><figure id="" data-id="f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-recommend-id="image://f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria perform in front of a crowd." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rama and Satria perform in front of a crowd." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pikselnesia / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-recommend-id="image://f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria perform in front of a crowd." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That being said, <em>Afterlove EP</em>’s rhythm game segments are exceptionally hard to read. Each note you play runs down a sheet music-like track, prompting you to press one of the four directional buttons when it reaches the center of the screen. The way it’s presented can be disorienting and frustrating—its use of directional inputs comes with a muscle memory expectation that some of the movement you’re seeing should correlate to which button you’re pressing. Instead, I tripped up a fair bit as notes came from the right side of the screen but required me to press up or down. Rhythm games, like playing a real instrument, are meant to be instinctual. You train yourself on something long enough and it becomes muscle memory embedded in your fingertips. <em>Afterlove EP</em>’s UI design is minimalistic, and doesn’t communicate its mechanics well, so it never quite reaches that level of intuitive rhythm you need to get lost in the music.</p><p>Like Rama’s music, <em>Afterlove EP </em>balances the thorny and heartwarming parts of love and loss. Given what the Pikselnesia team went through to make it happen, it’s not surprising that it understands all the ugly and beautiful parts of losing someone you care about. A lot of <em>Afterlove EP </em>guides you by the hand through the mundane parts of becoming a person again. When you lose parts of yourself, finding something new, good, and healthy to fill that void isn’t always glamorous or fun. It can be awkward and uncomfortable, and require talking to people who see through your bullshit and call you out on it when you can’t see past it yourself. <em>Afterlove EP </em>is sympathetic to the fact that none of us handle grief in a way that is easy to swallow for everyone around us, but its best moments come when it’s willing to slap you across the face and tell you to do better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Phoenix Labs is officially shutting down its free-to-play action RPG Dauntless this spring. In a post on Steam and social media, the studio kept the announcement pretty short and sweet.</p>



<p>“Dauntless is shutting down on May 29, 2025,” the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/331370/view/503943474819631342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement reads</a>. “Dauntless will receive no additional content or updates. The game will no longer be available to play on May 29, 2025.”</p>



<p>They closed the social media post, specifically, saying, “Thanks to all for being a part of the Dauntless journey.”</p>



<p>Dauntless’ shutdown comes nearly six years after it first launched in September 2019 for PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. The game had since been released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. </p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-microsoft-ceo-says-company-will-train-new-ai-on-a-catalog-of-games">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-ceo-says-company-will-train-new-ai-on-a-catalog-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft CEO Says Company Will Train New AI On A “Catalog Of Games”</a></h6>



<p>The movealso comes during a tumultuous time for Phoenix Labs as a studio. </p>



<p>In January, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phoenix-labs-layoffs-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming learned</a> that roughly 50 people were let go at the company. There was a belief among those let go at the time that Phoenix Labs as a whole was set to be closed. </p>



<p>As of writing, parent company Forte has yet to make an announcement on the status of the studio. Insider Gaming has reached out, however, to attempt to get clarity on the situation.</p>



<p>At its peak, Phoenix Labs said that Dauntless had seen over 6 million players.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fellowship | Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Just like in WoW's Mythic+ system, players will have a limited amount of time to slay a dungeon's bosses as well as clear out a certain percentage of enemies. Higher difficulty dungeons will have additional modifiers, but will reward better loot upon a successful run, thus enabling players to push even higher difficulty dungeons in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who has run a WoW dungeon in the last decade will feel right at home. However, what's impressive about Fellowship is how it's taken WoW's Mythic+ system but distilled it down to its core, without 20 years of outdated UI elements, need for player-made add-ons to play optimally, or lengthy grinding to level-up new characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Its interface is clean and customizable and enemy attacks are easy to read and react to. Many of the add-ons players need to download in WoW in order to play well, like a threat meter, a way to track party interrupts, or a detailed dungeon map so players can plan effective routes, are baked into Fellowship by default. That makes it far easier for players who may have always been interested in playing WoW's dungeon-heavy endgame, but found the entire thing too confusing and unapproachable, to jump in and understand what's happening at a glance.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether there is a huge audience for a standalone MMO endgame experience minus the whole MMO part is still an open question, but Fellowship looks like it has a lot of the essential pieces in place. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fellowship's open Steam Next Fest playtest</a> will run from February 24 through March 3, with six different heroes for players to choose from. It does not currently have a release date.

Good question, because as cute and wonderful as this trailer and its song might be, I wasn’t sure what the game actually was. Its really confusing that at the end there is a note mentioning that this new game isn’t actually <em>about </em>food or cooking despite the giraffe’s catchy song. </p><p>According to Annapurna Interactive, <em>To a T</em> is being developed by <em>Katamari Damacy </em>creator  Keita Takahashi and is described as a “colorful” “narrative adventure” game. Here’s the official description: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>To a T </em>is a charming, colorful adventure game about a teen navigating life in a small town with their cute dog companion. While their body is stuck in a T-pose, they do their best to make the most of it. </p></blockquote><p>I’m down to play this.

But I can do just that in <em>Lushfoil Photography Sim</em>, which is planned to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on April 15. </p><p>And if you want to watch the whole showcase, which featured a new trailer for <em>Wanderstop </em>and news of a PS5 port of<em> Sayonara Wild Hearts</em>, you can watch the entire event below.

<p>The CEO of esports tournament organizer PGL says there have been “concerted efforts from multiple parties to stop” running CS2 events. The most recent PGL event at Cluj-Napoca sold out tickets, despite many teams backing out of the tournament at the last minute.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pgl-ceo-says-anyone-trying-to-monopolize-cs2-will-simply-fail">PGL CEO Says Anyone Trying to Monopolize CS2 “Will Simply Fail”</h2>



<p>Following the conclusive grand finals of PGL Cluj-Napoca, where MOUZ defeated Falcons 3-1, PGL CEO Silviu Stroie <a href="https://x.com/ssilviu/status/1893928028591251706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to X </a>(formerly known as Twitter) to celebrate. While celebrating the event, Stroie also spoke against the alleged efforts to thwart PGL, and called out those looking to monopolize the CS2 tournament circuit.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is Cluj Napoca, this is Romania!!! We finally decided to run an event with audience in our home country and we were all blown away! By far one of our best events ever. We will continue to run CS2 events despite concerted efforts from multiple parties to stop us. Counter-Strike is a global phenomenon and any single company that will try to monopolize it will simply fail. Our next arena event is in May in Astana, where we expect another sold out arena full of [Counter-Strike] fans.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But who are the parties trying to stop PGL? Stroie’s comment about monopolization suggest he’s referring to the larger competing organizers in ESL and BLAST. Prior to 2025, ESL and BLAST’s primary Counter-Strike leagues featured partnered organizations, which incentivized those teams to prioritize those events over any other ones, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">save for Majors</a>. Not only did those teams prioritize ESL and BLAST events, put the partner programs restricted the number of non-partnered teams that could qualify for those events.</p>



<p>These programs were effectively dashed by Valve changes made in 2023 that went into effect at the start of 2025. These changes banned partnership programs between team and organizer, forced all events to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-vrs-in-cs2-valve-regional-standings-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use Valve rankings</a> or open qualifiers for qualification, and forced organizers to make compensation public. In an attempt to get teams to re-prioritize their events, both ESL and BLAST have publicized new revenue share models. According to HLTV’s Milan “Striker” Švejda, the lack of revenue share <a href="https://www.dust2.us/news/57777/striker-reveals-why-several-teams-skipped-pgl-cluj-napoca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">directly led</a> to some of the top teams choosing to skip PGL Cluj-Napoca.</p>



<p>While PGL has not pursued a revenue share model, their Cluj-Napoca event drew praise for its format. Namely, fans were overall pleased to see a meaningful 3rd place match adopted, upping the stakes with an improved result in the Valve rankings and a big prize pool bump.</p>

			<p>It's been announced by publisher Devolver Digital and developer Croteam that the "<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-talos-principle-reawakened-is-an-unreal-engine-5-remaster-plus-due-early-next-year/">radically overhauled reawakening</a>" of The Talos Principle will be released on April 10, with its new title being The Talos Principle: Reawakened. This release will see the puzzle game launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam. For those who are on PC, a demo is now available to play as part of Steam Next Fest.</p>
<p>Additionally, to celebrate the official launch date, a release date trailer has been released, showing off some of the puzzle editors and the new environments available in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Talos Principle: Reawakened - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SyMjhahRJhE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you've played this game before and plan on picking up the remastered version, it will still have the same story that you loved, but now it will look better than ever, as it was rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5. As a result, the Simulation world you explore is now more detailed than ever, introducing enhanced textures, lighting, and environmental design to upgrade the experience of the original Talos Principle experience.</p>
<p>Alongside the game, you'll also get to experience the acclaimed expansion, Road to Gehenna, where you'll get the opportunity to play through the new chapter, In the Beginning. This is a brand-new addition that dives into the beginning of the Simulation, where new layers are added to the complex story of The Talos Principle.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy the head-scratching puzzles that are featured in The Talos Principle, there will be a brand new Puzzle Editor, which allows creative minds to create new puzzles for players to take on, as well as new worlds to explore.</p>
<p>If you're unsure whether this game is for you and you're on PC, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2806640/The_Talos_Principle_Reawakened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is a demo</a> for The Talos Principle: Reawakened currently available on Steam. This demo will give you access to a medieval environment where there are plenty of puzzles and challenges to undertake. The puzzles available in the demo have been cherry-picked to showcase some of the key mechanics that are utilized in the game. This includes laser connectors, pressure plates, and force-field jammers.</p>
<p>Along with this, you will be given the opportunity to try out the fully-featured Puzzle Editor, where you can build your own worlds and create your own challenges for other players to take on, giving control back to the dedicated modding community.</p>
<p>The Talos Principle: Reawakened will fully launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam on April 10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/acquire-60th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">1964 was a busy year. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, The Beatles made their way to New York City, and the Olympics were held in Tokyo. But for our purposes, it also marked the wide release of the board game Acquire. Now, more than 60 years and multiple editions later, Renegade Games has the reins on this historic hotel-building powerhouse, releasing both a premium 60th Anniversary Edition in 2024 and its retail counterpart in 2023. While these new versions may have a fresh coat of paint, they still maintain the same wonderful gameplay that has kept it around for six decades and landed it on our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">best classic board games</a>.</p><div id="215711" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="578d7190-f9d3-4f11-9bcb-7e0a0d6f6c4e"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Acquire 60th Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><div catalogid="578d7190-f9d3-4f11-9bcb-7e0a0d6f6c4e" id="159919"><div id="159919" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Acquire</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Acquire plays with two to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-6-player-board-games">six players</a>, where everyone lays tiles, establishes hotel chains, and purchases shares of stock – all with the hopes of getting big returns on their investments. While the theme may not sound the most enthralling compared to other games on your local game store’s shelves, there’s a reason Acquire has been around for more than 60 years. It’s easy to teach and has a deceptive amount of strategy involved – so much so that it was even featured at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4rdQlj9BVA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>World Series of Board Gaming</u></a> tournament last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On your turn, players will pull a tile – each with a grid coordinate printed on it – and place it on the board in its corresponding spot. When a tile is placed and creates a minimum of two adjacently connected ones, a hotel is formed, and its founder gets a share of its stock. The larger a hotel chain grows, the more expensive each share of stock becomes, but also, the greater the payout when that hotel gets acquired and absorbed into a bigger hotel. So, buying low and selling high is the name of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These latest versions from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/renegade">Renegade Games</a> offer a new variant rule known as Tycoon Mode, which makes it easier for players who aren’t in the lead to stage a comeback. In the traditional Classic Mode, only the first- and second-place owners of a hotel chain – the two who own the most stock – get the payout when it’s acquired. Tycoon Mode expands this benefit to the third player as well. While I prefer the classic option, I appreciate this variant’s inclusion to help ease new players into the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unique to the 60th Anniversary Edition are a set of special power cards that tweak the gameplay further. These cards provide powerful bonuses, such as playing four tiles at once or buying three stocks for free. While these cards dramatically change the game, I found them to be too powerful and game-altering for my tastes. After a single playthrough with them, I haven’t gone back and have no real desire to. However, like Tycoon Mode, they are optional, so they're worth trying out to see if they suit your style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding the differences between the main retail release and the 60th Anniversary Edition, the $50 price difference comes with enough tweaks and adjustments to make the premium edition worth considering. Gameplay and core components (tiles, board, and cards) remain the same – with the exception of the power cards – so the main differences lie in the components.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three main upgrades in the premium version that make the investment worthwhile: a drawstring bag for tile selection, a removable insert for organizing share cards and hotel miniatures, and replacing paper money with sturdy poker chips.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the surface, these may not seem like major upgrades – or worth the additional cost – but the improved organizer and drawstring bag significantly enhance the experience. Storing and blindly grabbing tiles from a bag eliminates the need to manually flip over tiles during setup, making the game flow much smoother. If you opt for the base edition, I highly recommend finding a bag to use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another helpful addition exclusive to the Anniversary Edition is the redesigned plastic organizer, which stores share cards in their own separate container with a plastic lid. This allows the cards, which are held upright in grooves alongside their corresponding hotel miniatures, to be placed more conveniently. In contrast, the base edition’s organizer is the size of the entire game box, which, while functional, takes up more table space. Most players would likely prefer having the cards placed separately on the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last exclusive upgrade is purely cosmetic: replacing paper money with poker chips. Personally, I detest paper money in board games and believe it should have stayed in the 1960s. A significant portion of the Anniversary Edition’s increased price comes from this component upgrade, but what an upgrade it is. The chips have a nice weight to them, are neatly stored in their own container, and help keep the game organized. Plus, they’re simply more satisfying to handle than flimsy paper bills – there’s just something about that clinky sound.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Acquire: 60th Anniversary Edition (MSRP $99.99)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zj4Xqe?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D7MSX6PR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3ReLK?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Atomic Empire</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXYp4?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Standard Edition (MSRP $49.99)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/7XxGD?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKO4n8?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Atomic Empire</a> | <a href="https://zdcs.link/znXYgx?object_uuid=dc6ebc17-4e83-48b4-ad84-26212523dd94&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Walmart</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">See More Strategy Board Games:</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Feb 24, 2025 7:25 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Acquire is one of those games I can always fall back on for game nights, knowing it will be a great time. We even have it on our list of the best classic board games. The Renegade releases were my first foray into the game, but it quickly became apparent why it has endured for so long. It’s easy to learn, quick to set up (especially with the Anniversary Edition), and offers a low barrier to entry while maintaining a high skill ceiling. This is especially true thanks to the new Tycoon Mode and power cards, which make it more accessible for younger and newer players.
Whether you get the base version or the more expensive Anniversary Edition, Acquire is an easy recommendation for any board game collection.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/jump-ship-preview-its-sea-of-thieves-meets-left-4-dead-and-its-even-more-polished-and-fun-than-last-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It was almost exactly one year ago that I walked into a meeting during the Game Developer’s Conference and first got introduced to Jump Ship, a four-player sci-fi PvE shooter that blends mechanics from Sea of Thieves, Left 4 Dead, and FTL into something I thought was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jump-ship-plays-like-a-mix-of-sea-of-thieves-left-4-dead-and-ftl">extremely special</a>. I recently had a chance to play the latest build with a few of the developers, and let’s just say that if any indie game can break out big in what’s already an absolutely stacked year of releases, I’d bet my money on Jump Ship. As it heads towards an Early Access launch this Summer, it’s more polished and more fun than ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you aren’t familiar with Jump Ship already, it’s a non-grindy space romp for up to four players — and I specifically didn’t say multiplayer because the team at Keepsake Games told me they’re responding to feedback and building on what they hope will be a clever way for solo players to enjoy Jump Ship. In short, if you want to treat it like a single-player game, there will be narratively constructed AI assistants to help you man the ship. You get a taste of this in the Prologue, which serves as one part tutorial — introducing you to gameplay mechanics like shooting, flying in your space suit, manning and piloting the ship, and ship combat — and one part lore-builder. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Jump Ship - Closed Beta Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Jump Ship now has a much-appreciated story behind its core PvE gameplay. A malicious virus has infected machines throughout the galaxy, and it’s up to you and your fellow Atirans to get to the root of it at the heart of the galaxy and stop it. You’ll run through procedurally generated chains of missions in each sector in order to get there. Some take 10 minutes, others might take an hour. You’ll know roughly what to expect going in, as each one of your branching choices on the Jump Map is color-coded to let you know how much danger you’re voluntarily wading into. But of course, the greater the danger, the greater the reward… </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Jump Ship now has a much-appreciated story behind its core PvE gameplay.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aiding you is a non-infected AI you discover in the Prologue called Iris, who acts as something of a narrator on your missions. It’s a welcome bit of structure around the solid foundation of gameplay Jump Ship brings to the table. As is the Hangar, which is the sort-of base of operations from which you can cash in your in-game currency to buy and customize your outfits, look at the greater Galaxy Map, and even engage in a bit of soccer in your downtime. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But back to that core four-player gameplay. Boy oh boy is it fun! As you embark on your mission, things naturally won’t always go according to plan. Your ship will get attacked en route to your destination, requiring one of you to pilot the ship and fire the meager pilot’s chair weapons, while another sits down at the ship’s proper weapon station to wield the 360-degree-pivoting cannon at any annoying targets. Meanwhile, the other two of you might be mag-booted to the ship’s hull outside, taking shots at passing ships. That is, until an enemy vessel damages your ship, requiring one or more of you to run inside, grab a fire extinguisher, crawl into a vent, and put out the flames. After all, you’ve gotta keep that pineapple pizza-maker in full working order!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you do get where you’re going, all four of you disembark and make your way on foot inside the structure that houses the loot you’re after. These evil, infected robots will keep coming and they won’t play nice, so teamwork is essential at each step of the mission. Your grappling hook helps zip you around areas both on the ground and in outer space much quicker, and once you’ve got the big loot, one of you has got to get it back aboard the ship while the others protect your defenseless, arms-full self.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Both my demo last year and my latest one just the other day were short. On the one hand, it proves that Jump Ship is a blast in short bursts, and thus you don’t have to quit your job in order to keep up with it. On the other hand, though, I haven’t seen enough of the larger mission structure and the procedurally generated variety to know if it will deliver on its endlessly replayable promise. But everything I’ve seen so far absolutely screams potential hit. Jump Ship has all the right ingredients to become something special, and I can’t wait to play a lot more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <title><![CDATA[Mecha Break: The Final Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/mecha-break-the-final-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mecha-break-the-final-preview.1117689/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mecha-break-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The upcoming free-to-play online shooter Mecha Break really does well to evoke the exciting, breakneck sense of action from classic Japanese anime like Gundam Wing or Macross Plus. Focusing on the dizzying combat and thrills of piloting giant robots tearing through environments and enemy steel, it so far looks to deliver on its potential of over-the-top mechs duking it out in stylish fashion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of the open beta, I got to dive into several hours of a near-final build of Mecha Break, seeing its opening storyline set on a post-cataclysmic Earth and a suite of multiplayer skirmishes that range from familiar match types to a surprisingly ambitious take on a squad-based Mecha extraction shooter on a large-scale map. So far, Mecha Break offers an impressive suite of mechs and modes for its upcoming debut.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mecha BREAK Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in a far future where an ecological disaster has torn Earth apart, you play as a pilot in an organization known as S.H.A.D.O.W., which fights rival mech pilots and works to stop the spread of a crystalline virus that infects both organic life and even mechs. By engaging in strike missions and amassing more resources to upgrade and unlock new mecha, you can help the war effort and improve humanity's chances of survival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For anyone who's watched any mecha action series or tried their hand at building Gunpla over the last 30 years, Mecha Break's influences are obvious – and the lead developer was clear about what type of game he wanted. During our chat at the preview session, Kris Kwok, CEO of Amazing Seasun Games and executive producer of Mecha Break, stated that the team aimed to capture the experience of watching a classic mecha anime with giant robots weaving through missile fire and landing a slick finishing shot.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've had a wonderful childhood experience watching a TV station in Hong Kong, which introduced me to Japanese anime. My favorites were Gundam and Macross, and they are my biggest influences on Mecha Break," said the CEO of Amazing Seasun Games. "I've always wanted to make a multiplayer game like this, and I drew upon a lot of military tactics to offer different types of experiences for players – you have strikers with light or heavy armor, and you have a sniper role, or mechs that fly and move swiftly through the environment. Our core design philosophy was to have a roster of mechs that all capture the experience of piloting giant machines of war, regardless of your role in a match."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The opening missions are the most story-driven moments of Mecha Break, but considering there are no present plans for a dedicated campaign, it was a little disappointing to see it's not much of a focus. However, the existing plot did well in framing the multiplayer engagements, and you'll even be able to have your custom pilot explore the massive hangar to talk with other characters and observe your mechs. The heart of the gameplay is the multiplayer engagements, and as seen in last year's beta, Mecha Break features the traditional 6v6 multiplayer match types such as territory control, guiding payloads, and a twist on capture the flag, which involves delivering fuel to a rocket ship while avoiding enemy fire.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what elevates these engagements is the awesome suite of mechs that lean into the hero-style archetypes. Aquila is the long-range heavy sniper that can hover in mid-air to time a shot, Falcon is the agile, flight-focused mech that can rain down missiles, and Tricera is the heavily armored mech that can tear through enemies with its twin Gatling guns. I was impressed by how well-designed and visually striking each mech was, and I had some fun decking out the robots with custom decals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mecha Break is gorgeous to see in action, and I was very pleasantly surprised with the current state of its level of craft and polish. Since last year's beta, the developers have taken in feedback to fine-tune the player interface and balance between mechanisms. Considering how fast and exciting the matches can get, seeing how well-layered they are is impressive. It's also a multiplayer game that's not focused on racking up kills, but on helping the team achieve objectives and offering support. Still, I definitely had my moments where I became an absolute menace in the air as Falcon, only for the team's sniper to adapt to my tricks and pick me off from afar.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The pacing of Mecha Break is incredibly fast, and yet I sometimes found myself forgetting about capturing objectives because I was so swept up in the action and the dizzying pace. In some cases, I spent so much time focusing on enemy movements and attacks that I missed clear opportunities to help the team's larger goals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One mode that was more recently added is Mashmak, which is Mecha Break's take on an extraction shooter. In this large-scale mode with several other players, a squad of 3 will hot drop onto a random spot on the map and take out AI mechs and elite foes to collect forces, all the while facing off against other players and even the environment as tornadoes and deadly swells rip through the environment. By upgrading your mech with mods and other gear – such as a glider that I missed out on using – your team will have been able to boost up and eventually provide you coordinate and pick your battles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an impressive concept for sure, and I appreciate just how expansive the mode is – especially when piloting mechs – but given that it's a much slower-paced mode, it felt at times felt like the matches took a little while to properly get going, even with the AI mechs to battle. I also felt generally underpowered when facing some battalions of enemies, which prompted my team to move on to other places to avoid wasting time. Still, I see the potential of this mode, and storms in game really do well shake up the match and instill some tension.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It took some time for the developers to properly get Mashmak into shape, but they stated they found a nice balance for the experience by offering variety.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It took some trial and error to get this right, as we were never happy with how it initially turned out – our first prototype was not that positive," Kwok recalled. "So we had to rework everything, and sometime later we had a better version of it, but it still was not there. So after iterations, we finally brought Mashmak together and it was very important to offer variety within these matches. The auxiliary weapon systems you can collect, the [hazardous weather] storms, and the boss enemies you can find really do add a lot to these matches, especially on a large map to explore with a team."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Mecha Break's fast action and stellar selection of mechs present a fun and thrilling package for its online multiplayer. As a live service game, it'll definitely offer a lot of options right out of the gate, but I do have some lingering worries about how the in-game store will be set up, which is a normal worry to have these days. Mecha Break's combat and style is in great shape, and it'll certainly make for a solid option for fans looking to get their next mecha action game fix.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
