            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/617587/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-xbox-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In my first few hours with <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, I fought against a gigantic spider in waters that were as red as blood and dodged the onslaught of a twisting dragon amid a desert storm, complete with powerful strikes of lightning terrorizing the ground around me. I went up against sandworms and giant apes and a poisonous bug that could inflate itself while causing a cascade of explosions in the ground below. Each battle felt monumental — and the scale only increased the more I played.</p><p>This focus on spectacle is what sets <em>Wilds</em> apart. The game is the follow-up to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/25/16931366/monster-hunter-world-review-ps4-xbox-one-release-date"><em>Monster Hunter World</em></a>, which shook up the series with a larger, more open world and catapulted it from Japanese phenomenon to global blockbuster. <em>World</em> went on to become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682599/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-preview-kaname-fujioka-interview-e3-2019">Capcom’s bestselling game ever</a>, no small feat for the company behind <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Street Fighter</em>. Instead of changing things up once again, <em>Wilds</em> ups the ante and makes its monster battles feel bigger than ever.</p><p>The <em>MonHun </em>games are all built around a specific gameplay cycle. You prepare for a hunt by getting your gear in order, you head out and study your target, and then you spend a long time slowly whittling down the health of a giant monster before killing it. Once it’s dead, you carve some pieces off the creature and head back home to forge new armor with it and start the cycle all over again, only more powerful this time. Also, you have a giant talking cat that serves as your assistant.</p><p><em>Wilds</em> follows this same structure but moves it to a new, mostly uninhabited locale known as the Forbidden Lands. There’s a story about helping a young boy whose village was decimated and following a particularly dangerous creature known as The White Wraith. Mostly, though, the story is just an excuse to take on increasingly challenging hunts across this surprisingly diverse landscape.</p><p>There are a few new details to <em>Wilds</em>. A targeting system lets you really focus on a particular part of a monster’s body in battle, so you can open up a wound and hack away at it to cause lots of damage. You can also store a second weapon type on your mount, opening more options in combat, since weapons greatly determine your playstyle. And of course, there are new monsters and items and locations. You start out in a barren desert, but the Forbidden Lands eventually opens up to include locales like a lush jungle teeming with wildlife and a volcanic oil field that looks ripped out of a postapocalyptic future.</p><p>What’s really different this time around, though, is how massive and cinematic the battles feel. You’ve always fought against giant beasts in <em>MonHun</em> — that’s kind of the whole point — but here, more care has been put toward the backdrop. The action set pieces are ripped right out of a blockbuster movie, and they all have their own feel. That could mean the almost horror-like sensation of that spider swiping at you while your vision is filled with red or facing off against a beast during a dramatic downpour with the wind creating huge waves crashing down all around you. These moments can be terrifying, thrilling, or exciting — and often all three at the same time.</p><p>In a lot of ways, <em>Wilds</em> represents the <em>MonHun</em> team slowly perfecting its more modern formula. It in no way represents a dramatic change, which means it can still be a little rigid in places, particularly when it comes to futzing with menus to use all of the various items at your disposal. More than once, I accidentally whipped out my portable barbecue in the middle of a tense conflict because I hit the wrong button. But for the most part, this is the most accessible <em>MonHun</em> to date, and one that builds on the open-world foundation laid down by <em>World</em>, including more seamless transitions between areas that makes it feel like one big, cohesive place.</p><p>Even in its first real competition with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23599391/wild-hearts-review-ps5-xbox-pc">2023’s <em>Wild Hearts</em></a>, which infused monster hunting with <em>Fortnite</em>-like building, <em>Wilds</em> shows that there’s still nothing quite like the thrill of a hunt in <em>MonHun</em>. They can be exhausting and challenging and, at times, frustrating; my thumb remains sore from all of the rolling and dodging I’ve done over the past week. But it’s also immensely satisfying to actually pull off taking down one of its massive beasts, a combined sense of relief and joy that few other experiences can replicate. <em>Wilds</em> doesn’t change any of that — it makes it feel even bigger.</p><p><sub>Monster Hunter Wilds <em>launches February 28th on PC, PS5, and Xbox.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I have upsetting news. Some months back, I had electrical work done on my office to install ceiling lights. In trying to figure out a problem with the grounding of an outlet, we reset some breakers around the house to diagnose the issue. In doing so, my tiny Costco hot tub was turned off. It does not have a fancy app to tell me it turned off, and so, instead, it just slowly got colder and colder, until the heating pump broke, and simply beeped instead of working. It is now a brick of ice on my patio, waiting for the spring to unthaw it, so I can throw it out.

To a T focuses on a teenager named Teen, who is stuck in a T-Pose and their dog needs to assist them with everyday activities such as getting dressed and washing their face.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7PWNpBDPjI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L7PWNpBDPjI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The AbleGamers organization is collaborating with Takahashi and his studio, uvula, as To a T is an allegory about being disabled. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23777644/to-a-t-keita-takahashi-uvula-annapurna-interactive" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AbleGamers provided feedback</a> on the game's design as the studio was seeking input on sensitivity and accessibility.</p><p>Described as a narrative adventure game, To a T follows Teen as they discover some sort of mysterious ability due to their T-pose posture and must uncover its origins while exploring the town and going to school.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/monster-hunter-wilds-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Cloaked in high-level parts carved from many, many fallen creatures, there’s a point in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, as in all Monster Hunter games, where you start to feel sorry for the monsters. Your character and skills have evolved to such a point that you can wade through the less powerful amongst them in moments and, as they flail before you, parts pinging off them like sparks from a fire, you wonder whether it’s you that’s the bad guy. Then, you’ll do it again. And again. And again.</p>
<p>This is the unalterable loop of Monster Hunter. You hunt monsters. You kill or capture those monsters. You use their bones, webbing and tails to make yourself fancy new gear with better statistics, and then off you trot to murder another victim.&nbsp;Monster Hunter Wilds is the current culmination of years of perfecting that loop.</p>

<p>Where early games were obtuse, with control schemes that felt like playing an Ocarina and gameplay mechanics that had players crying into their strategy guides, the series has come on leaps and bounds in recent years, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-world-iceborne">Monster Hunter World</a> the game that truly brought it to the masses with a much smoother, more accessible experience. Wilds is fundamentally a direct continuation of that game, though at least one or two of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise’s</a> best tricks have also made it along for the ride.</p>
<p>The storytelling is one of those key improvements. Monster Hunter stories have either centred on enemy creatures entering the wrong habitat, spreading a disease, or a combination of the two. Wilds tells a similar tale, but the way it is told is easily best directed in the series’ canon.</p>

<p>Your created hunter is fully voiced, lending an immediacy to every cutscene, while the cast here – also fully voiced, with an excellent dub in both Japanese and English – are endearing and memorable. The only misstep has been to grant your feline Palico companion full voice acting, when they’ve always made cat sounds in the past. Thankfully you can revert to the original cat sounds in the menu, because their voice is amongst the most annoying things to ever happen to Monster Hunter.</p>
<p>The story is kicked off by the discovery of a young boy named Nata on the edge of the Forbidden Lands. This region is thought to be uninhabited, but you soon discover that’s not remotely true, instead finding a region stuffed with new creatures and a series of villages and new tribes.</p>

<p>A key change to the environments is that the majority of these areas are connected. It’s one whole open-ish world, though the corridors or tunnels that you’re funnelled through between each biome are clearly hiding some loading, with a bit of judder while it all tries to catch up. Either way, you can run through a series of distinct locales, hunting your way through them without pause.</p>
<p>You don’t even need to return to your base between each quest. You can run up to any monster you encounter in the open world, whack it a few times with your sword, and the game will automatically set you off on a full quest, with the resulting rewards and framing to match. I’ve hared after five monsters in a row, all without having to return home, and it’s an absolute blast, making everything flow so much better than it did previously.</p>
<p>Helpfully, there’s a new mount to get you through these immense landscapes. Replacing Rise’s canine Palamute, the Seikret is a feathered friend that you can ride on, and they’re incredibly handy, able to automatically take you to your destination, whether that’s the monster you’re hunting or a shopping list of ingredients you need for crafting. Some might decry that there’s now much less in the way of actual ‘hunting’, but when those old days could be 30 minutes of hide and seek with a giant ape before even swinging a sword, I know which one I prefer.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds plays host to the most memorable cast of monsters the series has ever seen, initially giving more focus to its new members, before ushering in a batch of the most recognisable faces. More time is given to the Arkveld – Monster Hunter Wilds’ signature monster – than they would have been in World or Rise, and when it’s a wicked combination of a Viking helmet, chains and a dragon, that’s the correct decision.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are various stars, from Lala Barina, an arachnid-like with a giant scarlet flower instead of an abdomen that flutters paralysing spores around the arena, through to Nu Udra, an octopod that lives in the Oilwell Basin, sliding through the oily landscape while setting itself on fire.</p>
<p>Witnessing one of its multiple-limbed fireball-chucking attacks would be one of the highlights of the game, if you weren’t running for your life while it happened. It gives you a wholly new set of problems that are distinct and different from the winged dragon, great apes or oversized iguana archetypes that remain the series’ staple, and it’s refreshing in all the right ways.</p>

<p>There is a lingering question about how quickly you can put these incredible creatures down, though. Difficulty creep is a real thing, and it can be harder to quantify when I have twenty years of Great Sword experience already, but this is undoubtedly the easiest it’s felt. Monster Hunter World was capable of knocking some sense into you, especially by the first time you face Nergigante, and Rise’s mix of tower defense and hunting proved tricky to master at first too. Monster Hunter Wild’s has been a hell of a good time, but it’s rarely pushed me to the limit when playing solo.</p>
<p>There’s the sense that Wilds is, as with the last two games, an opening salvo, a tasty bit of hunting that’s been designed to get you into the flow of things, sampling all the new delights, while a main course waits in the wings. Some of that will come as free updates with new monsters special events and crossovers – the Monster Hunter team are one of the best in the industry at this – but you can bet that there will be an Iceborne or Sunbreak style expansion in around 18 months to give us the full vision for this generation and add Master Rank gear on top.</p>
<p>That won’t mean much to newcomers,&nbsp;but returning players will know that this isn’t the finished article, despite being a wholly complete game. That hard-won armour and weaponry will be made a mockery of the moment that the expansion arrives. This fact has never felt as immediate to me as it does here, but I don’t want to wish the next year and a half away. There’s still a huge amount to enjoy.</p>

<p>Once you’ve rolled the first set of credits, and then completed the actual story some thirty hours later, you can settle into the rhythm of hunting, collecting and crafting. You’ll find tracks or monster parts while exploring, which give you access to special investigations and hunts, and they’re much more controlled than the insane number of quests you’d find in World.</p>
<p>Besides that, it’s all about the fashion and function. Your endgame drive is to collect every single piece of armour – which can immediately be used as cosmetic layered armour – as well as every single weapon, and to then min-max your build to your heart’s content.</p>
<p>It’s a timesink that Monster Hunter aficionados will know well, and it’s no less enticing here, particularly when the overall visuals and armour designs are an exquisite new high-point for the franchise. There’s also Artian weapon crafting to dabble in, collecting special rewards from certain hunts that you can combine to create specific weapon types, with a spectacular set of stats. An Artian blade was my endgame weapon, and so far it’s proving hard to put down.</p>
<p>Focus Attacks are a powerful new addition to the formula, and help to add even more weight to the already hefty strikes the game is known for, but Monster Hunter Wilds biggest change to combat has been the ability to take two weapons into the field with you, stowing an extra one away on your Seikret to give you options in the field.&nbsp;I played through much of the game with a Great Sword and a Bow, giving me the perfect mix of close combat and ranged offence. It helped to force me out of my comfort zone, changed the way I play the game, and slowed my progress down in the process – perhaps the lower difficulty was a deliberate choice to get people experimenting with different weapons?</p>
<p>It certainly helps that Monster Hunter Wilds’ bow feels unbelievably good to use, mixing up powerful dodging, different arrow types, and the ability to drop a hail of arrows on any monster’s head before following it up with explosive homing attacks. They’ve already tweaked this following the beta as people again felt that it was too easy, and there’s every chance that the team will go in and make further changes following the game’s initial release. It’s going to be very interesting to see how that pans out. </p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is at its best when played with others. The difficulty scales up alongside this, and each monster’s elongated health keeps them in the fight far longer than when playing solo. There’s also crossplay here so you can hook up with players on any other platform, either sharing a lobby or using the new Link Party. This ties you together, no matter what platform you’re on, bringing you across automatically when one of you starts a quest. It’s a slight faff to set up, but once you’re connected with friends it works incredibly well, and has to be one of the greatest additions to the game’s underpinning tech.</p>
<p>Across the board there are further changes, both big and small. Amongst the group of players we’ve had for review, the one that has caused the most controversy is the changes to eating a meal. You used to have to dine before every quest, but now, since you’re out in the field, you can just whip out your BBQ spit, and make a host of hearty meals whenever you want, even in the middle of a fight.</p>

<p>It breaks the fiction of it, not least because you shouldn’t be able to do it when involved in combat, and sitting down to a meal with your friends in a lobby used to be a highlight. Whether that was due to the glorious cutscenes – there’s still some good munching action here at least – or Rise’s saccharine Bunny Dango song, it’s hard to say, but I’d like to see the option to sit down for food return.</p>
<p>This is getting into the weeds, though. After twenty years of monster hunting, it’s hard not to pick at the small things and miss the greater whole. Monster Hunter Wilds is absolutely a remarkable entry in the franchise, and one which furthers the lore and refines the action a few increments further. Is it the best one yet? Yes, it is, but greed and expectation will keep me waiting for the second wave, the Master Rank it will bring with it, and the ‘complete’ experience of this hunting generation.</p>

			<p>Despite running since 2004, it took the Monster Hunter series multiple installments to reach the level of popularity it enjoys today, and that's largely due to the much-improved accessibility. Much like the first entries in FromSoftware's Souls series, the early Monster Hunter games had some obscure mechanics that weren't properly explained in-game and required some experimentation to properly grasp. Since 2018's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/">Monster Hunter World</a>, however, making the series more accessible has become one of the main focuses, an effort that has paid off immensely, as working on making the franchise more accessible to newcomers also addressed some of the series' archaisms and brought massive gameplay improvements, such as the introduction of seamless maps whose different zones aren't separated by loading screen, streamlined hunting preparation and more.</p>
<p>Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, which features a very straightforward approach to the series' gameplay experience that puts the action at the forefront, fans of the Monster Hunter World approach have been eagerly anticipating the proper evolution of its gameplay formula, which has finally come with Monster Hunter Wilds, the most accessible entry in the series to date. The increased accessibility, however, takes nothing away from the complexity of the series' formula. On the contrary, it offers Hunters more ways to enjoy the latest evolution of the series' gameplay, which takes full advantage of some open-world mechanics to deliver an amazing experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250214200804_1-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Like Monster Hunter World, Monster Hunter Wilds features a story campaign with actual cutscenes that develop the new area of the series' expensive world, the Forbidden Lands, and several central characters, such as the young boy called Nata, who was found years before the beginning of the game near the border of the uncharted region which the Guild believed to be uninhabited. After hearing from the boy how his village was attacked by a mysterious monster known as the White Wraith, the Guild organizes an expedition into the uncharted region to investigate this mysterious monster and rescue Nata's people, known as the Keepers. Being part of the expedition's Avis unit, the player will get to experience firsthand this uncharted region and its every-changing environments, learn how its inhabitants have learned how to coexist with some fearsome monsters, and eventually come face to face with the White Wraith itself, the game's flagship monster Arkveld.</p>
<p>Right from the start of the campaign, it's clear how the development team wanted to give Monster Hunter Wilds a marked cinematic feel and better involve the player with the story. For the first time ever, the Hunter is fully voiced and interacts with other characters in cutscenes and dialogue sequences, greatly enhancing immersion. While the story takes a while to get going, once things got going, I found the campaign surprisingly interesting, thanks not only to the Hunter now feeling an integral part of the story but also to some pretty impressive, action-packed cutscenes that pump the player up properly before the intense fights against some of the game's strongest monsters. As such, the 18 or so hours that separated me from when the proper Monster Hunter experience begins with High Rank went by smoothly, almost leaving me hungering for a little more.</p>
<p>The more involving campaign isn't the only one of Monster Hunter Wilds that suggests how the game aims to be more welcoming to newcomers. Besides not being particularly challenging for the most part, the campaign feels effectively like an introduction to the series' main mechanics and the new ones introduced in the game, as things like crafting, cooking, Charms, Decorations, and melding are introduced gradually to allow new hunters to come to grips with them. Monster design, in combination with the generally low level of the campaign's Low Rank hunts, also suggests how the experience was created to get as many new players as possible to experience at least the main story. Reading monsters' attacks and learning their patterns is rather easy compared to the past, and the high efficacy of the vast majority of the 14 weapon types makes it so that it is possible to have fun straight away, even before the Hunter is lured into the addictive gameplay loop of the series which effectively begins in High Rank.</p>
<p>In terms of improving the Monster Hunter's formula accessibility, the introduction of a mechanic like Focus Mode is as unsurprising as it gets. This new gameplay mechanic allows the Hunter to properly aim the attacks of any weapon, giving them more control over their techniques and making some weapons easier and way more fun to use, such as the Great Sword, as Focus Mode allows the Hunter to properly aim all charged slashes, including the powerful but very slow True Charged Slash. The&nbsp; Wounds mechanics is yet another mechanic that has been clearly introduced to make the hunting experience a little less obscure, but it also improves the experience for more seasoned Hunters, as it is used to highlight the damage on monsters' parts, directing players to continue attacking those parts to break them and possibly collect rare parts that can be used to craft better weapons and gear.</p>
<p>Focus Strikes, special attacks available only in Focus Mode for all weapons that allow Hunters to immediately destroy a wounded monster part, have also been seamlessly integrated into the game plan of each weapon type, making them even more fun to use. For the Long Sword, for example, destroying a monster part with a Focus Strike increases Spirit level by one, a mechanic that can be used to unleash multiple Level 3 Spirit Helmbreakers in quick succession; for the Great Sword, it is possible to go straight into a True Charged Slash after unleashing a successful Focus Strike. And if a novice Hunter still needs time to understand these mechanics, it is possible to summon support AI-controlled Hunters when real players may not be available that can take the heat off them and give them more breathing room to understand the intricacies of the combat experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250211174013_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the mechanics may be a little difficult to grasp for newcomers, Monster Hunter Wilds does a decent job explaining them with many tutorials as it eases players into its aforementioned gameplay loop, which, on the surface, hasn't changed a whole lot. Like the rest of the series, Monster Hunter Wilds approaches action gameplay in a very peculiar way, doing away with useless mob fights, pitting the player against massive beasts with unique attack patterns and behaviors that require proper preparation and good knowledge of the mechanics and of the monster itself to win. After a monster has been defeated, it is possible to carve its remains to obtain items that can be used to craft better weapons and gear. Both weapons and armor pieces come with a variety of skills that improve the Hunter's performance and are best suited for certain weapon types or playstyles. With these improved tools, it becomes possible to hunt even more powerful monsters, get new items, craft better gear to perfect builds and take on even more powerful monsters. This gameplay loop is as addictive as ever and won't fail to lure in those who like a certain type of action RPG where gameplay and build crafting are always at the forefront.</p>
<p>First impressions, however, can be deceiving. While it is entirely feasible to play Monster Hunter Wilds like previous entries in the series (essentially using the various Base Camps that have replaced villages and towns and Gathering Hubs that are unlocked on all maps during the campaign to prepare for hunts before accepting quests from the Quest Handler Alma as it has always been done in the series), the new entry in the series really wants players to always be out on the maps hunting monsters, returning to Base Camp only to access specific features. Like in past entries in the series, it is possible to unlock additional camps on maps, only this time, you will get access to the vast majority of the Base Camps' features. Cooking, for example, can be done anywhere on the map by using the Portable BBQ Grill, while Alma will follow the Hunter at all times, allowing players to accept quests on the fly.</p>
<p>And if you are into a more organic way of playing the game without wasting time going from one menu to another, you can simply start field surveys right from the map, mount on your Seikret, a giant bird that can be used not only to traverse maps quickly and effectively but that also gives access to a couple unique attacks, and let it take you to your target monsters. And if you're looking to gather items as well, you can use your Slinger to pick up items or interact with Endemic Life, all without getting off the Seikret. As Monster Hunter Wilds turns each of its maps into actual living ecosystems, it is possible, for example, to hunt all monsters on a map and wait for others to appear, which doesn't take a lot of time to happen, although one will have to look out for weather condition changes that have a noticeable impact on all maps. All of this has been clearly designed to further streamline the experience without taking away its complexity, and the fact that taking advantage of these mechanics is essentially optional is a great way to implement them. If one were to play Monster Hunter Wilds in the old way, there's no penalty for it whatsoever.</p>
<p>Much of the popularity of the Monster Hunter series comes not only from monster design but also the very diverse weapon line-up, and in these regards, Monster Hunter Wilds delivers without question. All of the new monsters debuting in the game have clearly been created to ease new players into the experience, but not all of them are complete pushovers, as some of the late-game new monsters sport complex movesets and plenty of variables to make them unpredictable without getting into "randomly throwing out an attack" territory, such as the flagship monster Arkveld and a few others. In addition to these sorts of basic variables, the vast majority of monsters react to the changing weather conditions of the environment, potentially making them even more powerful depending on the situation. As highlighted by those revealed before launch, all of the monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds are also quite diverse, and their unique features are sure to make some of them staples for the series going forward.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250214200212_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As both new and returning monsters get new tools to force Hunters on their carts, so do the Hunters themselves. Focus Mode is only one of the new additions to the combat, as weapons that can guard, like the Great Sword, Sword and Shield, and Charge Blade, can initiate Power Clashes by guarding at the very last second before a monster attack connects. By winning these Clashes, it is possible to topple monsters and create a window of opportunity to deal massive damage and destroy wounds with ease. Offset attacks are also another big addition to the combat system, as certain techniques can interrupt a monster's attack, and open them up for a powerful follow-up attack while negating all damage.</p>
<p>The introduction of these two techniques is as huge as the introduction of Focus Mode, as it gives players new tools to play more reactively and make combat way more fluid. For example, both Power Clashes and Offset attacks are massive game changers for the Great Sword, as they turn the weapon into the proper tank that it was always kind of meant to be, finally sunsetting the old hit-and-run playstyle which is still somewhat viable, especially considering the buff to the charged slashes other than the True Charged Slash, which was slightly nerfed, but it's most definitely not as fun as Perfect Guarding monster's attacks and retaliate quickly as they recover, or meeting a deadly technique with a perfectly timed Offset Rising Slash.</p>
<p>Besides introducing the new universal mechanics above, Monster Hunter Wilds also makes some big changes for every weapon type beyond those seen in the open beta tests held before launch. Going over all of the changes would take a long time, but speaking about the weapons I am most familiar with - Long Sword, Great Sword, and Insect Glaive - I have found the changes to make the weapons even more enjoyable to use. For the Long Sword, for example, unlocking new techniques while Spirit Gauge is red adds a whole new dimension to the weapon, giving the Hunter some good reasons to hold onto the powerful Spirit Helmbreaker until the very last second; for the Insect Glaive, being able to get Extracts by using regular attacks in Focus Mode is a massive change that makes the weapon way less stiff than before, although the introduction of charged attacks and a few other changes may force the player to use a claw grip for any controller without back buttons or paddles, which can be uncomfortable. Over the closed beta, the Insect Glaive also got back its aerial capabilities, making it even more varied but also slightly more complex, though not by much if you have used the weapon in Monster Hunter World or Rise and constantly took the fight to the sky.</p>
<p>While Monster Hunter Wilds doesn't add any new weapon type, it still does, in a certain way: the environment. Besides featuring some natural traps that can be activated by interacting with them or using the Slinger from afar, it is possible to use monster's tendencies against them to make them, for example, crash against rock formations or walls, position them right under some hanging elements like boulders that can be brought down as needed and so on. I expect proper environment usage will be a big part of the best future speedruns, as the open beta tests already highlighted.&nbsp; The environment now playing a big part in combat has also elevated map design to new heights, as the maps are no longer just a fancy background for hunts but an integral part of the entire experience that can be used to make hunts easier. Following in the footsteps of World and, in some ways, Rise, the maps feature complex layouts and a prominent verticality that makes them believable as locations in an unexplored, and mostly untamed, land.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250211193454_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Being the next main chapter of the series, Monster Hunter Wilds attempts and succeeds at upgrading pretty much every one of the franchise's core features, and, as such, even the multiplayer features got a massive glow-up with the introduction of lobbies with visible players. While the limited online population in the early access period didn't allow me to properly test out how this changes interactions with other Hunters, the little I was able to experience made me feel like the series has moved one step closer to an MMO-like experience, doing away with the aforementioned Gathering Hub and introducing online lobbies that make it easier than ever to team up with other Hunters and complete quests together. For mostly solo players like myself, it is also possible to play the game in single-player lobbies but still enjoy some of the multiplayer features, which include joining Squads, asking for help with SOS Flares, and responding to help calls via the Quests menu.</p>
<p>All of the features outlined above shine even more in Monster Hunter Wilds endgame content, where the hunter can experience an even more intense experience on all the maps, which feel more alive than ever with unpredictable environmental changes, which also include the frequent appearance of monsters, of both the regular and the stronger Tempered variant. By taking down these monsters during the High Rank postgame, hunters can also get a variety of additional rewards that are randomly determined, including Decorations sporting two different skills and special parts that can be used to craft Artian Weapons. These weapons are rather peculiar compared to regular weapons, as the player can determine their properties depending on the parts that are used during crafting, and they usually come with three Decoration slots at the cost of innate skills. And, if you are lucky enough to get a monster that comes with some high rarity bonus rewards, you can save this hunt as an Investigation at the cost of a few points and replay it multiple times as if it were a regular quest to farm these rewards. Considering how Monster Hunter Rise essentially did not have much postgame content before the release of the Sunbreak expansion, the engaging postgame of Monster Hunter Wilds is a major step forward that has a lot to offer for those who want to push their builds to the current possible limit.</p>

<p>If there's an area where Monster Hunter Wilds disappoints slightly, it's visuals and performance. While the RE Engine handles the changing weather conditions extremely well from a visual standpoint, delivering these changes in a very believable way, the visuals sometimes lack the vibrancy of past entries in the series, feeling a little too drab even in the Springlike season of Plenty. That is not to say that the game looks bad, however, as some environments look stunning under the right conditions, and character and monster models look great, with amazing detail and animations, so it's mostly a matter of getting used to different aesthetic choices from the past. What most players are never going to get used to is performance, at least on PC. Just as the system requirements and the benchmark tool suggested, performance is really all over the place, reaching an acceptable level of smoothness only with Frame Generation.</p>
<p>In an early game Ajarakan hunt set in the Oilwell Basin map, with a lot of fancy fire effects going off, at 4K resolution with DLSS Quality and Frame Generation, and a mix of high and ultra graphics settings, the game ran at an average of 86 FPS, 45 FPS 1% Low on a system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) that runs the vast majority of recent games well. In the heat of the hunt, I did not notice the frame rate drops too often, but watching the recording, in reality, it was very choppy instead. So, if you don't have a top-of-the-line machine, you may have to drop most settings and resolution to hit 60 FPS, which is the bare minimum for a game like this. Following the game and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, it's quite clear how the RE Engine may not have all it takes to handle open-world experiences properly.</p>

<p>Despite a generally low challenge level and performance issues on PC, Monster Hunter Wilds is undoubtedly a new peak for the series. The increased accessibility, which is sure to expand the series' reach beyond its current fanbase, didn't water down what makes Monster Hunter the unique series it is, while the open-world mechanics have been seamlessly integrated with the classic formula to provide new and better ways to enjoy these hunts solo or with others while further streamlining the experience.</p>

It refines the foundation the series has been built on for decades: fight monsters, make gear from monster parts, rinse, repeat. It also tries to bring in new players with some creative swings. This is admirable since the series is notoriously impenetrable to those not already onboard, even with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-world-review-hunt-worth-going-on" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monster Hunter World</em></a> finding mainstream success.</p>

<p>While some of these decisions are hit and miss, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> still provides that exciting dopamine rush when tearing through a dragon with some friends.</p>

Here's hoping a predator doesn't show up.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> Review – By Order of the Guild</h2>

<p>For the longest time, every <em>Monster Hunter</em> story was told in brief, impersonal text on a quest select menu. If you were lucky, there were worldbuilding details peppered in the environment or in supplemental material. That story usually amounted to, “Some monsters are attacking some people, go stop them,” or “Some monsters are acting odd, go deal with it.” Serious storytelling was never this franchise's strong suit; the narrative has always been a vehicle for the next hunt.</p>

<p>I bring this up because <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> manages to bring a conventional cinematic narrative into this franchise. The Hunter's Guild has sent your character to investigate the Forbidden Lands. What was believed to be an untamed frontier of monsters is home to a secret tribe of people with ties to the land's ancient roots.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-lala-barina-hunt.jpg?itok=YXqJDRjU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-lala-barina-hunt.jpg?itok=A51AYZoE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>That's it, breaking out the flaming sword for this thing!</figcaption></figure><p>But something has gone wrong in the Forbidden Lands. Monster outbreaks are threatening the populace and the environment is suffering for it. This means your job is to gather research data, hunt what is in your way, and figure out the cause of these monster attacks.</p>

<p>It's a familiar set-up, but the difference with <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is the presentation. Every story mission in this game has extensive cutscenes leading up to the hunt. These cutscenes involve multiple recurring characters, all with unique voices and personalities. In a franchise first, the player character and their palico companion talk. They're characterized as broadly taciturn, but it's something.</p>

<p>This guided narrative approach extends to the game's opening hours. Whenever you start in a new area, you get a guided tour. Rising and falling water levels in a forest. Mysterious ruins that act as lightning rods in the middle of the desert. Caverns with sludgy deposits of flammable oil. The list goes on.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-village-meal.jpg?itok=6gYowTtz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-village-meal.jpg?itok=WmmLz9-X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The meal was good. The buffs were better.</figcaption></figure><p>I am of two minds about this new approach. It is a concerted effort by Capcom to bring the worldbuilding of <em>Monster Hunter</em> from the margins into the spotlight. In addition, it puts one of the franchise's greatest strengths center stage: making every monster feel like one part of a living ecosystem.</p>

<p>If you have never played a <em>Monster Hunter</em> game before, <em>Wilds</em> does a great job bringing you in with this cinematic presentation.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are a longtime fan like me, this approach has reined the series' sillier side. The tone is less playful and certain parts of the game lack the series' campier elements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A good example is cooking a meal. Instead of meals being prepared by a goofy band of palicos at a canteen, complete with the kind of showmanship you'd see at a Benihana, you just cook your meals yourself over a small grill. The presentation of the food still makes your mouth water, but how it is delivered to your table is more forgettable.</p>

See what happens.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> Review – Sharpening Old Blades</h2>

<p>In the gameplay department <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is a refinement across the board. The 14 different weapon types are still here and play exactly as you expect but with some notable quality-of-life improvements. Certain weapons that require charging like the Switch Axe or Charge Blade, will automatically do so the first time you try to use a relevant ability. No more impotently hitting a dragon's flank here.</p>

<p>In addition, the Long Sword and Dual Blades have gotten faster and more acrobatic. Attack animations are packed with fluid spins and twirls, giving you more control over your positioning during a battle. As for Hunting Horn mains, the old support buff system from <em>Monster Hunter World</em> has returned.</p>

<p>A new wrinkle to these monster hunts is the introduction of wounds. If you hit a certain body part enough times, that monster will gain a wound. These are represented as red glowing spots on the monster. Hit this area with a focused attack and you'll deal a bunch of damage, stagger the monster, and get a monster part for your trouble. It is a fantastic addition to the hunt gameplay since it allows you to strategically stagger your target, giving you more control over the battlefield.</p>

<p>Complimenting this are new creative ways the environment is affected as you hunt. Fighting a monster in the desert can lead to sinkholes forming. Vines of jungle trees can be struck down for improvised net traps. Some of these elements were in place in <em>Monster Hunter World</em>, but they feel more fleshed out in <em>Wilds</em>, leading to some stellar setpieces.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-uth-duna-mount.jpg?itok=C22nI_i9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-uth-duna-mount.jpg?itok=bqCTMcyZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to break this thing's face open.</figcaption></figure><p>These are welcome additions that bring more tactility to the <em>Monster Hunter</em> experience. But the trade-off is a lack of hunt variety. There are no alternate hunt challenges like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-rise-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monster Hunter Rise's</em></a> Rampage hunts or any unique weapon stances or abilities to figure out. There is meaty endgame material here as well as some arena hunts, but they are few and far between.</p>

<p>As for the new player experience,<em> Monster Hunter Wilds</em> does its best not to overwhelm. From the start, the game gradually introduces mechanics and systems. It slowly rolls out tutorials for whatever weapon you are using, how to sharpen your weapons, certain item crafting recipes, the importance of honey, etc. The game even has friendly NPC hunters you can call in for help, and their AI behavior is rock solid.</p>

<p>These are welcome concessions, but Capcom's answer to teaching new players still amounts to some text boxes. If you're starting out you will need to intuit some things. Things veteran players take for granted like focusing more on consistent combos than giant kill-shots, navigating the map, using the environment to your advantage, or applying poison or paralysis status effects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-rey-dau-hunt.jpg?itok=LFUPwhbO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-rey-dau-hunt.jpg?itok=F6o1dWFZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wearing metal armor to fight this thing in the middle of a lightning storm. Not one of my best moments.</figcaption></figure><p>This is not a failing on Capcom's part. <em>Monster Hunter</em> as a whole is a very hands-on experience. You are expected to get your hands dirty, get smacked around, and even fail at your first handful of hunts. In addition, the cadence of the combat is heavier than other action RPGs out there. While this makes the core gameplay experience unique, it is something you click with or not.</p>

<p>As always, the real stars of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> are the monsters. The Forbidden Lands does feature some returning beasts like the Nerscylla and the iconic Rathalos, but the new creatures also make a good impression. Highlights include the Nu Udra, a giant octopus monster covered in flaming oil, and the Rey Dau, the result of someone combining a dragon with a railgun.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is the first entry in the series to introduce cross-platform play. And on paper, a lot of the endgame content highly encourages you to play with friends.&nbsp; You will need a crew to get the most bang for your buck.</p>

<p>On the technical side, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds'</em> multiplayer works. When I finally got a group together, it gave me flashbacks to playing <em>Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate</em> on my 3DS back in the day. Didn't matter if we were on PC or console, everything worked. Connections were smooth, shenanigans with bombs happened, and good times were had. On a less formal note, getting random help from sending up an SOS Flare never gets old.</p>

<p>What sours the experience a bit is how finding groups or matchmaking is handled. You can't just search for players on your Friends List or jump into a hunt in progress. Instead, there is a cumbersome code system alongside the same confusingly laid-out lobby used in past entries. It isn't as bad as Nintendo's Friend Code system, but it gave me flashbacks.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is a great entry in a beloved series. If you're a longtime fan, the gameplay improvements and new monsters are more than enough to pick this up. Alternatively, if you haven't touched the series before and are willing to get through a steep learning curve, the cinematic narrative presentation and imaginative monster designs will welcome you with open teeth and claws.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/why-there-should-never-be-bloodborne-remake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just before February's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-recap-february-2025" rel="nofollow">State of Play presentation</a> aired, rumors began to swirl that a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake, or at the very least a remaster, could be imminent.</p>

<p>Those rumors were aided by Sony's move to DMCA two major&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>fan projects, namely a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca" rel="nofollow">60fps patch</a> created by modder Lance McDonald and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-psx-demake-dmca-sony" rel="nofollow">PlayStation-style demake</a> made with love by the very talented Lilith Walther.</p>

<p>Of course, the State of Play came and went, yielding nothing in the way of PS4 revivals barring the frankly bizarre&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/days-gone" rel="nofollow">Days Gone</a> </em>remaster. Most other&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>fans breathed a sigh of frustration, but mine was one of relief.</p>

<p>Let me lay my cards on the table.&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>is probably my favorite game of all time. I've got its platinum trophy, and I've spent close to 200 hours in Yharnam, breathing in its eerie atmosphere and battling its deranged, skeletal beasts. I know that doesn't sound like a lot, but trust me, it is for me.</p>

<p>Here's the thing. There should never, ever be a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake. I'm not even convinced there should be a remaster, although that's an argument I'd be far more ready to come around on. Here's why a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake or sequel is a terrible idea and why Sony should never do it.</p>

<h2>The&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>Conundrum</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-demons-souls.jpg?itok=UGjTxGi2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-demons-souls.jpg?itok=0qajyxqX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bluepoint's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>remake serves as an excellent cautionary tale.</figcaption></figure><p>In 2020, when Sony released the PlayStation 5, one of the console's launch titles was a remake of the 2010 action RPG (for there were no "Soulslikes" back then)&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>.</p>

<p>Developed by Bluepoint, the remake garnered critical acclaim, with many praising its faithfulness to the original. This is a take that has always baffled me. Bluepoint's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bluepoints-remake-of-demons-souls-coming-to-ps5" rel="nofollow"><em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>remake</a> is certainly shinier and more "presentable" than the original, but it has none of the trademark strangeness and atmosphere of FromSoftware's effort.</p>

<p>Much of that is down to creative choices that I'm sure were made in order to sell the power of the PS5. The land of Boletaria is now one of much higher detail, much shinier surfaces, and much slicker animations, but it has completely lost the creeping, misty dread of the 2010 original.</p>

<p>The music choices, too, are irritatingly tone-deaf. Listen to Flamelurker's boss theme. Composer Shunsuke Kida wrote a theme that sounded like a long-forgotten demon "lurking" in the darkest recesses of the world. Bluepoint's remake, by contrast, drowns the boss in the kind of bombastic orchestral arrangement that Hollywood would kill for.</p>

<p>Like many other gaming companies, Sony's attitude towards game preservation is occasionally commendable but usually selective. While the company has made an effort to add many PlayStation classics to its modern store, there are also a lot of games - many of which are exclusives - that remain unavailable.</p>

<p>A lot of the games featured as little collectible robots in Sony's celebratory platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right" rel="nofollow"><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>(which is great, by the way)</a>, including major titles like&nbsp;<em>Ico</em>,&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Killzone</em>, and even the first few&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>games, are unplayable on modern hardware despite being hugely celebrated and beloved landmarks in the medium of gaming's history.</p>

<p>Sure,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Colossus&nbsp;</em>has its Bluepoint remake, but here, we run into the same issue as&nbsp;the studio's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>work. What if I don't like the Bluepoint version? What if I want to play the original? Well, it's tough luck for me in that regard, I suppose.</p>

<p>In short, I don't think Bluepoint's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>remake gets close to the original for atmosphere and feel, but more to the point, Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/sony-playstation-3-psp-vita-store" rel="nofollow">slipshod approach</a> to game preservation means that for many - myself included - it is now impossible to legally source the original without resorting to the second-hand market.</p>

<h2>The&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>Remake Game Preservation Problem</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-doors.jpg?itok=MHjUIds1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-doors.jpg?itok=CF1VOclL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony's attitude towards game preservation has me worried about a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony has seemingly decided that nobody would ever want to play the original&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>, and that the only legitimate version is the remake. This is a terrible attitude to take; even if you prefer the shinier, more "AAA-feeling"&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>, this attitude leaves no room for those like me who prefer the 2010 version.</p>

<p>Should Sony ever make the decision to remake&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, there's every chance that just like the 2020&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>, original director Hidetaka Miyazaki, as well as many of the other creative personnel who originally worked on the game, wouldn't be asked to return.</p>

<p>In the worst-case scenario, this would result in a remake that utterly butchers FromSoftware's original vision for&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, ruining the game's subtle, creeping journey from beast-strewn, blood-soaked horror to something altogether darker and more eldritch.</p>

<p>Now, I know what you're thinking. There's no guarantee Sony would ruin a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake. Maybe it would be better! Perhaps that's true, but&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>is a work of art born (no pun intended) of its particular time and circumstances. Any remake produced by Sony would inevitably be a different product, because of course it would.</p>

<p>Remaking&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>would be an act of monumental arrogance on several levels, and one that would only be slightly lessened by ensuring that the original remains available to play in perpetuity. Given Sony's previously demonstrated selective approach to game preservation, I don't have confidence this will happen.</p>

<p>In fairness to Sony, one of the reasons the original&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>may not have been preserved has to do with the PS3's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps3-emulation-playstation-plus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notoriously difficult hardware</a>. Other games, like Konami's&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4&nbsp;</em>and Sucker Punch's&nbsp;<em>inFamous</em>, also remain unplayable on modern systems (although I note the latter doesn't seem to have been considered for a remaster).</p>

<p>The point, though, is that the ball, as with many other companies, is very much in Sony's court here. It's not so much that Sony definitely will decide to replace&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>with a remake (although I think I've demonstrated prior for that), but that it could, and if it does, the artistry of the original, like&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>, could be lost forever.</p>

<h2><em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>Isn't Perfect, but It's Perfect to Me</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-cleric-beast.jpg?itok=XCMY3LNM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-cleric-beast.jpg?itok=9szq5DO1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I think&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>does everything it set out to do artistically.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there's also the artistic argument for why&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>shouldn't be remade.</p>

<p>Let's go back to&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>for a moment. It's not just a product, a piece of entertainment to be consumed and thrown away. It's a work of art. To remake it largely without the involvement of the original creative team and then proudly stamp the original name on the remake with no embellishments seems to me to be a little insulting.</p>

<p>By doing so, Sony is essentially saying "this is our new definitive version of&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls.</em>" I don't think Sony has, or should have, the artistic authority to do so. I'm fully aware it has the corporate authority, but I don't find arguing for or against remakes from a corporate perspective particularly interesting or illuminating.</p>

<p>For reasons we've already been over, a&nbsp;remake would probably be given to people who may well be huge fans of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, but who didn't make it, and whoever would end up making the&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remake, they probably wouldn't have been heavily involved in the creation of the original.</p>

<p>Miyazaki <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring" rel="nofollow">has moved on</a>. Sony's Japan Studio, which helped out with the development of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-japan-studio-reportedly-shutting-down-this-year" rel="nofollow">has been closed down</a>. The team that came together to create the singular vision of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>no longer exists in its original form.</p>

<p>If you love&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>like I do, and I really, really love&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, then you should rage against the concept of a remake for this reason.</p>

<p>To me,&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>is a beautiful, precarious marriage of everything I want from both an action game and a horror game. I'm aware of how precious I sound here, but if just one element was pushed out of alignment, the whole house of cards could come crashing down.</p>

<p>I can't imagine a realistic scenario in which&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>is remade and some beautiful, wonderful element of the original experience isn't carelessly tossed aside for some redundant quality-of-life improvement or gameplay tweak because someone didn't realize how important it was to the full picture.</p>

<p>Perhaps that's a failure of my imagination, but I'll offer you this guarantee (which is audacious, I know). If&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>is ever remade, it will not live up to the remake you're currently imagining in your head. Not even close. Better to close that book and wait, likely in vain, for the remaster that barely does anything besides touch up the game's minor technical problems.</p>

<h2>Okay, So Why Not Remaster&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-alfred.jpg?itok=CBQpQ25q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodborne-remake-article-alfred.jpg?itok=DPr2RgmS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Beast hunting is a sacred practice, and so is leaving&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>alone.</figcaption></figure><p>This is a thornier question, and it's one I grapple with from time to time. When I revisited&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>for this article, I found myself occasionally wishing it ran a little more smoothly or that its resolution was just a touch sharper.</p>

<p>A remaster could, in theory, fix these problems, but remasters aren't exactly perfect solutions either, at least not all the time. Let us remember the tragic, terrible story of Rockstar's&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>remasters and how they <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rockstar-games-apologizes-for-gta-trilogy-launch" rel="nofollow">desecrated the classic originals</a>.</p>

<p>Ah, but it wasn't just technical glitches that marred those particular remasters, was it? Fans also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/remaster-fatigue-ballad-of-gta-definitive-edition-failures" rel="nofollow">complained</a> about odd-looking character models and newly introduced migraine-inducing rain effects. Proof, if proof were needed, that remasters also have the potential to ruin a game's artistic vision, even if they seem initially innocuous.</p>

<p>What about&nbsp;<em>Sonic Colors: Ultimate</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-colors-ultimate-shadow-dropped-today-on-pc-via-steam" rel="nofollow">remaster that dropped back in 2021</a>? At launch, it ran horribly, leading to widespread criticism from players. Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Warcraft 3: Reforged&nbsp;</em>led to the company dropping support for the original RTS, but it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-3-reforged-developer-update-does-little-to-satisfy-irate-fans" rel="nofollow">hated by fans</a>. No matter, though; to the best of my knowledge, you still can't easily play the originals.</p>

<p>Again, in fairness to Sony, its own remasters and ports are generally well-received (with some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spider-man-2-pc-port-bad-reviews" rel="nofollow">notable exceptions</a>). All it would take, though, is one careless screw-up like the ones outlined above, and a game I consider to be one of the greatest of all time suffers as the result.</p>

<p>Of course, there are always updates and patches to fix issues, but, well... why not just play the original&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, which doesn't need any of those things to play well?</p>

<p>This may be a heretical statement, but I also think&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>still runs just fine. Sure, it's not 60fps, but guess what? Your eyes will adjust. Mine did after just a few minutes, and if you allow yourself to be immersed in&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>'s peerless atmosphere and excellent storytelling, yours will too. I can almost guarantee it.</p>

<p>No, I think I've found my perfect solution. Let's just leave&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>alone. No remakes, no remasters, and for the Moon Presence's sake, absolutely no sequels.&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>came, kicked all kinds of ass, did what it came to do, and left. Why, in our era of constant unnecessary corporate franchise revivals, can that not be enough?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-players-want-to-filter-out-games-that-use-generative-ai/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The debate around the use of generative AI in video games is one of the more hotly debated topics of the last handful of years. While some find the value in what it could mean to the development timeline of larger games, others are worried that it will lead to lower-quality games being released and talent artists and developers losing their jobs. It appears that Steam users are concerned about generative AI in their games as well, and they want to be about to know which games are using the technology.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/10/595140105668154379/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam forum’s suggestions</a> thread, a suggestion to allow players to filter out games made with generative AI has picked up steam—no pun intended—since it was posted earlier this month. </p>



<p>Said original poster AyeforScotland, “I don’t have any interest in playing demos from games that use Generative AI in their development. It would be good if an option was added to filter these games in the same way players can already filter Adult/NSFW content.”</p>



<p>In 27 pages of replies, as of publishing, it appears to be a feature that everyone is in agreement with wanting. And the reasons, while similar, have some specific variance.</p>



<p>“I don’t want to play a game nobody wanted to make,” one user responded. “I want to play things people made, who love what they’ve created.”</p>



<p>Said another: “All the AIs out there are trained on stolen labour. I’d rather not financially support anyone who’s happy to use them to produce games, and every demo download translates into financial support via Steam’s own algorithms.”</p>



<p>What do you think about being able to filter games based on whether generative AI was used or not? Let us know down below, and join the discussion further in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1691/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disney-lorcana-archazia%E2%80%99s-island-%E2%80%93-first-impressions-of-the-new-tcg-expansion.1117131/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-first-impressions-of-the-new-tcg-expansion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Disney Lorcana set, Archazia’s Island, is just around the corner with the early release on March 7 at local game stores, followed by the wide release on March 21. With this seventh set, the trading card game introduces dual color cards for the very first time. Two new starter decks also accompany the new booster expansion: a Ruby/Sapphire deck featuring characters from Beauty and the Beast, and an Amethyst/Steel deck featuring characters from Aladdin. Disney Lorcana starter decks have been a good way to tease what the new meta could be with its new mechanics, but one of these new decks seems stronger right out of the box than its counterpart. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starter decks are, of course, not optimized for super competitive games, but they’ll get you part of the way. So generally, playing starter decks out of the box may feel slow. With that said, there are synergies with certain cards if you can find them in time. The Ruby/Sapphire deck, for instance, relies on the use of items whether they are on the field or not. The new dual-color Belle can be cheaper to play based on how many item cards are in your discard. When she quests, she also allows the player to put three items from the discard back into the deck. Outside of getting rid of your items normally, you also have characters like dual-color Beast, who banishes two items to deal damage to an opposing character. Then there’s Cogsworth, who becomes stronger if there’s just one item in the discard. So now you have this engine where you’re using your items as normal, benefitting from them in the discard, and putting them back into the deck to do it all over again. With so much opportunity for interactions, a player has to be careful about the order of their plays. For example, you don’t want to put back items into the deck if a character benefits from them being in there in the first place. Outside of that, the usual Ruby and Sapphire tendencies are there in the deck, like building up your inkwell or dealing damage and rushing down characters.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana: Archazia’s Island Starter Decks</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Amethyst/Steel deck, this gets the most interesting mechanic from this set with the Vanish keyword. A character that has Vanish is immediately banished if it is targeted by an action, which are like single-use spells. For example, the action card Double Trouble deals 1 damage each to up to two characters. If your opponent has two cards with Vanish on the field, this action card will make both of those powerful characters go away for cheap – and they don't even need to damage them to do so. This keyword is seen on characters that are Illusions, which is also a new attribute to Lorcana. So like Illusions, they disappear as soon as they are waved away. This sounds pretty bad, of course, but the Illusion characters themselves are quite strong considering the cost for them. In this deck, for example, we have a 4/4 Mufasa that costs four ink to play. The Illusion Iago is 4/6 with evasive and also costs four ink to play. Generally, these Illusion cards can wreak some havoc as long as the opponent doesn’t have the necessary cards to get rid of them easily. The main beneficiary of these Illusion cards is the dual-color Jafar, who can return any Illusion cards that are banished on the opponent’s turn. Considering the value and threat these Illusion cards pose, Jafar is crucial to making this deck perform. Otherwise, playing an Illusion to only get banished immediately feels pretty bad. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/049-dlcs7-rcmx-iago-giantspectralparrot-en-150-1740005973182.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, the introduction of dual-color cards seems to be an obvious addition to a deck if you are playing the right colors with the right playstyle. As expected, they’re strong with new cards and a whole expansion, but they are locked with the deck color of choice, unlike Star Wars Unlimited, where you can splash other colors in the deck but incur an extra cost. In regards to deck brewing, it doesn’t leave too much room for creativity. For instance, if you run Illusions, you kind of have to have a card like dual color Jafar to give you the extra value with the negative kickback of Vanish. On the other hand, Illusions can be cheap throwaways to banish any opposing characters before they quickly disappear. Out of the box, though, Illusions are very susceptible to actions, and with one Jafar, those characters are not lasting too long in any game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both Archazia’s Island starter decks showcase the new mechanics of the upcoming set well, but the Ruby/Sapphire deck just has a more consistent engine than what the Amethyst/Steel can pull off. Unfortunately, the featured characters are ones we’ve seen already in the game, but that does allow for some room to mess around with the older Belle or Jafar cards in this upcoming meta. With that said, these starter decks are always a good chance to see what the game has to offer so far.

            <p>
Microsoft boss Satya Nadella has said the company plans to train its new gaming AI on a "catalogue of games" soon, so it can then "start playing them".
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/satya-nadella">Dwarkesh Patel podcast</a>, Nadella described seeing Microsoft's gaming AI Muse generate gameplay videos that reflected a user's input as a "massive, massive moment of 'wow'".
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-generative-ai-model-muse-isnt-creating-games-and-its-certainly-not-going-to-solve-game-preservation-expert-says">Microsoft lifted the lid on Muse last week, and described the technology as something that would help game ideation and preservation - though not everyone was convinced</a>.

<p>
In short, Muse has so far been trained based on years of gameplay footage from Ninja Theory's arena shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bleeding-edge">Bleeding Edge</a>. After ingesting this gameplay archive, Muse can then generate new gameplay footage and estimate how it might change based on a specific prompt suggested by the user. For example, Muse could generate gameplay footage with an additional jump pad in the level, if commanded to do so.
</p>
<p>
As yet, this is not an AI able to start coding its own games, or dreaming up its own concepts. Rather, it's a tool that could eventually become a shortcut for providing generated gameplay footage to speed up the process of development. 
</p>
<p>
"Can you actually generate games that are both consistent and then have the ability to generate the diversity of what that game represents, and then are persistent to user mods?" Nadella said. "That's what this is.
</p>
<p>
"What I'm excited about is bringing - we're going to have a catalogue of games soon that we will start using these models, or we're going to train these models to generate, and then start playing them."
</p>
<p>
Nadella did not elaborate on how users would be able to play the generated footage Muse provides.
</p>
<p>
"When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> first showed it to me, he had an Xbox controller and this model basically took the input and generated the output based on the input. And it was consistent with the game," Nadella continued.
</p>
<p>
"That to me is a massive, massive moment of 'wow'. It's kind of like the first time we saw ChatGPT complete sentences, or Dall-E draw, or Sora. This is one such moment."
</p>
<p>
Writing in response to Microsoft's announcement of Muse last week, <a href="https://www.possibilityspace.org/blog-before-you-post/index.html">gaming AI expert Michael Cook described the advancement as "impressive" but "not a practical process"</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It's impressive that it can do this using visual information because things like lighting, camera angles, user interface and so on are a lot for an AI model to handle. But ultimately, even with all of this data, all the time spent annotating datasets, and so on, it was still only just about able to generate footage predicting player behaviour.
</p>
<p>
"The research team behind this probably believe it will get more efficient over time, which might make it more affordable or tractable for small developers," Cook continued. "However, it still raises the question of how we get video footage of people playing our game in the first place."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/artificial-intelligence-is-an-oxymoron-theres-no-such-thing-says-take-two-boss">Strauss Zelnick weighed in with his opinion of AI</a>, saying that "artificial intelligence is an oxymoron, there's no such thing".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/is-the-gothic-1-remake-a-gothic-revival-or-a-gothic-ruin/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The original Gothic games played an important role in the history of PC RPGs. Pioneering the RPG subgenre affectionately nicknamed ‘Eurojank’, their immersive worlds and open-ended style attracted a legion of passionate fans. While the third game in the series saw a change of emphasis, titles such as Risen and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/12/21/elex-review/">Elex</a> continued the legacy. It was therefore a huge disappointment when longtime developers Piranha Bytes closed down in 2024, just one of a number of victims of the Embracer Group’s irresponsible purchasing spree.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the legacy of Piranha Bytes games can still be seen in the indie scene and particularly through the long-awaited release of a full Gothic 1 Remake by Alkimia Interactive. Having now been hands-on with the first playable demo – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1297900/Gothic_1_Remake/">available today via Steam Next Fest</a> – I can spill the beans on how it holds up to the original, both in terms of nostalgia and more recent memories of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gothic 1 Remake | Nyras Prologue Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_3VLY-B-LTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The original Gothic saw you follow the journey of the iconic Nameless Hero as he was thrown into the magical prison known as The Colony, in which prisoners are forced to mine for precious ore to supply the Kingdom of Myrtana with weaponry to fight off the invading hordes of orcs. This is such a classic fantasy story that still has resonance some 24 years later, but the real draw of the game was the freedom it allowed you in your adventure.</p>
<p>Gothic holds a special place in my own memories, but having replayed it in part recently it is clear where the ‘jank’ part of the subgenre came from. Gothic’s controls were an acquired taste at best and the ease with which you can venture off the path and meet instant death is a far cry from the handholding approach of more modern titles. My main hopes for the Remake were for it to improve the former, but still maintain the challenge of the latter and the demo goes some way to demonstrating that this has been achieved.</p>

<p>Rather than offering the start of the game itself, the demo takes the form of a prologue with a separate character in the spotlight – Nyras (who plays a small role in the original game; a nice nod to longtime fans). The demo is very aware that this could be seen as a big change from the original and most of the loading screen tips serve as confirmation that the Nameless Hero will be the protagonist in the full release. This defensiveness feels a little overdone, but it’s understandable. Nyras also finds himself thrown into The Colony, but the world is deliberately much more closed off in this demo.</p>

<p>Graphically, this remake is obviously a million miles ahead of the original. While not at the very cutting edge of modern graphics, it is far more detailed and benefits from beautiful lighting and design. Animation is much smoother and a vast number of extra animations are included allowing for quality of life improvements such as being able to pick things up without having to sheathe your weapon. There is still a sense of stiffness in the movement though and I hope that this is being refined before the full release.</p>
<p>You can talk to other returning characters, such as Diego, and these show a high level of detail and good voice acting. Background dialogue is suitably earthy and it feels like a land occupied by suspicious criminals. There isn’t a great deal of content here (in many ways it’s a proof of concept and the main game has developed a long way on a separate path since this build) but you get to follow a couple of questlines and carry out some exploration.</p>

<p>Your first challenge is to find a weapon and there are an encouraging number of ways to achieve this. You can either dive into the large pool at the start of the map, explore the caves, or find a sword near the first quest NPC. A weapon is essential, though, as even the most minor of enemies can kill you in seconds. This danger is particularly apparent if you rush headlong into combat with multiple enemies so it’s clear that the feel of the original has been maintained.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the changes aren’t restricted to the graphical details. A far more modern inventory system has been added which feels much more user friendly than the original – though it’s not really utilised in this demo. You can loot a vast number of items still, although there wasn’t a sign of the risk and reward stealing mechanic that is so important to the original. Controls feel much more in keeping with modern games but, as mentioned above, the animations leave it feeling a little stiffer than the original, especially in combat.</p>
<p>All in all, the Gothic 1 Remake holds a lot of promise, looking set to retain the feel and challenge of the original whilst updating the interface and graphics to appeal to modern gamers. It remains a crying shame that Piranha Bytes are no more, but Alkimia seem to be honouring their legacy in all the right ways.</p>
<p>Now to replay the original on Switch before the Remake is released. Weirdly it’s the version that works best for modern controls…</p>

			<p>Bossa Games, previously known as Bossa Studios, has made the unfortunate decision to lay off more staff, with the previous round of redundancies happening at the end of 2023, leaving 40 employees behind to work on its upcoming project, Lost Skies. At the moment, it's uncertain how many staff have been impacted by this latest round of layoffs. The news broke when a statement was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on LinkedIn</a> from Co-Founded and Co-CEO Henrique Olifiers. The full statement reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>The past couple of years have brought a significant amount of disruption to the games industry at large, with treasured studios, teams and games being shut down or significantly scaled back. We've all read the news, suffered through the changes ourselves or seen it through the eyes of peers and colleagues affected.</em></p>
<p><em>In our view, this is not a phase, it's a fundamental transformation of the games industry, a reshape of how games are made and by what kinds of teams. The industry of two years in the future will not look like the industry of two years ago.</em></p>
<p><em>We've had to make the painful decision to scale back, focusing on the late-stage production of Lost Skies and its upcoming launch, ensuring the game is successfully released and evolved for its players for the foreseeable future. Once Lost Skies is established and enjoying live operations, we'll reshape into small teams working independently on novel game ideas brought to the players as early as possible.</em></p>
<p><em>This means saying very difficult goodbyes to extremely talented and treasured colleagues, truly some of the best people in the games industry, who have been part of our journey for a long time. We wish we had found a way of navigating this turmoil without resorting to the decision of scaling back our teams, but unfortunately we've failed in this endeavour.</em></p>
<p><em>To our industry peers, who undoubtedly are also fighting their own difficult battles, we wish you all the luck and resilience - and if you are in the enviable position to hire someone, we can't recommend anyone better than a former Bossian.</em></p>
<p>A <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-gameplay-trailer-drops-for-lost-skies-showcasing-floating-islands-more/">new gameplay trailer</a> for Lost Skies was released just two weeks ago, showcasing the floating islands and the traversal system that players will get to experiment with in the upcoming title. At the moment, Lost Skies still doesn't have a release date, so it's uncertain as to how long those excited for the game will have to wait for its release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-april<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced that it will hold a&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>15th anniversary livestream in April, and that the stream will feature appearances from key franchise figures.</p>

<p>Per the description for the stream on YouTube (for which we're using machine translation), the presentation will last for around two and a half hours, and will feature "the latest information on events and merchandise" commemorating the franchise's 15th anniversary.</p>

<p>Additionally, developers will hold "talks", and a "mini live performance" will be featured as well, with pianist Shotaro Seo and guitarist Takanori Goto seemingly set to perform, although we don't know what they'll be performing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-replicant.jpg?itok=suwFcq76 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-replicant.jpg?itok=EKYTcq45 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>franchise will be celebrated in the upcoming 15th anniversary livestream.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, the question on every&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>fan's lips is whether or not a new game will be announced during the stream. Square Enix hasn't given any indication that this is the case, but the franchise's 15th anniversary seems to me to be the ideal time to reveal a new game, assuming such a thing is in the works.</p>

<p>We're also nearing (or perhaps that should be&nbsp;<em>Nier</em>ing) the eighth anniversary of Square Enix and PlatinumGames'&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata</em>, which remains the last major tentpole franchise release, discounting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-replicant-release-date-and-editions-announced" rel="nofollow">2021's&nbsp;<em>Nier Replicant</em>&nbsp;remaster</a>.</p>

<p><em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>has proven to be a solid little seller for Square Enix; the game has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">racked up over nine million sales</a> since launching back in 2017, although whether that's enough to match Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">notoriously high targets</a> is anyone's guess.</p>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Automata&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Replicant</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>franchise also got itself a mobile action RPG in the form of&nbsp;<em>Nier Reincarnation</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-has-opened-pre-registrations-for-ios-and-android" rel="nofollow">launched in 2021</a>&nbsp;and ran for a few years before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">shutting down in April last year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-engels.jpg?itok=YOq7M7oz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-engels.jpg?itok=-b5d2mGB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hopefully,&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>won't be the last major&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>Two and a half hours is a mighty long time, but it's entirely possible Square Enix intends to use that time simply having&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>personnel reminisce about the franchise, which still wouldn't be a bad way to spend the stream.</p>

<p>In any case, the&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>15th anniversary livestream is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3FQD3gUBShw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">set to air on April 19th</a> at 6pm Japanese time, which works out at around 5am Eastern or 2am Pacific. Looks like you're going to have to wake up early for this one.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Sawyer has mentioned such a project. He said last September that <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/a-pillars-of-eternity-tactics-game-has-been-pitched-by-a-number-of-obsidian-devs-because-fans-will-play-a-lot-of-them-even-if-theyre-not-that-good/">a few developers at Obsidian</a> have "floated" the idea. According to Sawyer, the audience "is not huge, typically, but very passionate. People that are into [strategy] RPGs, tactical RPGs, they'll play a lot of them, even if they're not that good. It's a hard one to make a case for," but "every once in a while we bring it up and go 'oh, we could maybe…"</p>
<p>The Pentiment dev returned to these sentiments in the recent livestream. "Tactics games have a very enthusiastic fanbase, but the fanbase is not humungous," he said. "It's sort of like that floor is high - like, if you make a decent tactics game, those people are gonna buy it. But if all of them buy it, that's still not that many people."</p>
<p>Obsidian Chief Egg Overseer Feargus Urquhart recently revealed in <a href="https://youtu.be/FB9qwiskL18">an Ian Games interview</a> that the studio was still fairly modestly sized for the big budget RPG space, with nearly 300 employees compared to, for example, CD Projekt Red's 615 or Larian's 470 (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-ceo-reveals-its-just-half-the-size-of-many-triple-a-studios-even-as-it-prepares-to-launch-its-4th-game-in-5-years/">thanks PC Gamer</a>). That's not gigantic for a studio that has another RPG project, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">Outer Worlds 2</a>, following Avowed later this year, so it's not surprising they'd want to be careful with how they allocate resources. Their approach to financials is refreshing too, saying in a recent DICE talk that they go into each project assuming "mild success" rather than gangbusters.</p>
<p>I'm extrapolating a bit here, but it sounds to me like (at the studio level at least) they're a team that want to make money so they can make more games rather than the depressingly common inverse. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">Whatever I thought of Avowed</a>, that feels like something to celebrate.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With <em>Captain America: Brave New World </em>and <em>Thunderbolts* </em>wrapping up Phase Five in the ongoing superhero saga before <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps </em>arrives this summer to kick off Phase Six, we thought we’d take a look back at all the ups and downs in the Marvel machine’s cinematic output. Let’s see which movies still stand out after nearly two decades of the MCU, and which are better off forgotten.</p></div><div><p>The second <em>Thor </em>flick has widely become the default selection for worst Marvel movie in series rankings. The first two <em>Thor</em> movies are sauceless but the pieces are there for something great, as <em>Thor: Ragnarok </em>would prove six years after the original. <em>The Dark World</em>, however,<em> </em>utterly lacks the personality and zest that future installments would find. Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth have great chemistry as Loki and Thor and sell some of the film’s heavier subject matter, but they can only carry it so far when it’s weighed down by some of the least interesting lore in the series and a villain I couldn’t identify in a line-up. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>2021’s <em>Eternals </em>boasted a star-studded cast and an interesting premise following immortal superpowered aliens, but neither could elevate what was ultimately a wooden film that failed to adequately utilize its talent. Additionally, almost everything that happens in this movie has been rendered meaningless by subsequent plot developments, so all that’s left is the interpersonal drama of an ensemble cast that Marvel was quick to cast aside when the audience didn’t latch on. It’s a shame that Marvel had more incredible acting talent on screen than in any film since <em>Endgame</em>, and they just squandered it with a lifeless script. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>The original <em>Thor </em>is better than <em>The Dark World</em>, generating some intrigue as it gradually reveals Marvel’s spin on Norse mythology, but that’s about it. Hiddleston is, once again, the standout in a cast that could have thrived with a better script, but <em>Thor </em>is mostly a dry fantasy film masquerading as a superhero romp. It’s got soap opera dramatics that make the most of <em>some </em>of its actors’ talents, but without the wit and humor of later films, it’s just a forgettable hero’s journey. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>How do you mess up a movie with Paul Rudd, Jonathan Majors, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Corey Stoll? By employing the blandest CGI imaginable, which makes Stoll’s M.O.D.O.K. look like a poorly resized .jpeg with arms, and by giving us a Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) who is too easily defeated given his multiversal powers. When the most exciting part of the movie is the post-credits scene with hundreds of Kang variants yelling in a colosseum, you know it’s a failure. In its favor, the meticulous and heartfelt unraveling of Kang’s villainous nature through exceptional dialogue between him and Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) was some of the most emotionally grounded work in the entire series. Overall, though, the MCU would’ve been better without this rushed movie. — Keith Nelson Jr</p></div><div><p>The second movie in the MCU is often forgotten despite being a mostly serviceable origin story for the big green guy. <em>The Incredible Hulk </em>stars Edward Norton, who would be replaced as Bruce Banner by Mark Ruffalo in future appearances, and as such, a lot of people who come in late to the Marvel universe tend to skip it. You’re not missing much if you already know the Hulk’s whole deal, though some references to its characters in <em>Captain America: Brave New World </em>might go over your head. But this was before the MCU became the juggernaut it did, and it’s mostly a bog-standard superhero origin story that Marvel wouldn’t revisit for 17 years. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>While <em>Thor: Ragnarok </em>would perfectly adapt Marvel’s take on Norse gods into a whipsmart, slapstick action comedy, 2022’s <em>Love and Thunder </em>is the result of too much of a good thing. <em>Ragnarok </em>director Taika Waititi also brings his signature brand of rapid-fire joke delivery to this follow-up, but it’s devoid of most of the thematic richness that made its predecessor both sugary sweet and filling. <em>Love and Thunder</em> cranks the jokes up to 11 and makes Thor such a goofball that some of the more emotional beats are hard to take seriously. The movie has easily Natalie Portman’s best performance as Jane Foster and Christian Bale makes the most of his appearance as Gorr the God Butcher, but beyond that, the movie is empty calories. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier </em>wasn’t my favorite MCU show, but at least it was willing to reckon with what it meant for a Black man to wield the Captain America shield and represent a country that has done nothing but bring Black people down. <em>Captain America: Brave New World </em>finally gives Sam Wilson the suit, but it’s so preoccupied with maintaining the status quo that it doesn’t so much as touch anything controversial. Rather than advocate for people suffering under a broken system, it fence-sits and suggests we just need to see the good in people. The people who are wielding their power to strangle the life out of the marginalized? No thanks. A more radical version of this story, or even one that was consistent with the one <em>The Falcon and Winter Soldier </em>started, would burn it all down. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>The second <em>Iron Man </em>is easily the least memorable entry in the Robert Downey Jr. trilogy. Sure, it introduces Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and brings in Don Cheadle to take on the role of War Machine, but in the grand scheme of the MCU it’s not all that impactful. Downey remains captivating as tortured genius Tony Stark, though. The MCU was still finding its footing as an interconnected web of heroes and villains in this era, and it would reach greater heights with Stark in the future. But this sequel is mostly just a serviceable follow-up to the film that started the whole thing. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Florence Pugh carries <em>Black Widow</em>, one of the most confounding MCU movies to come out this side of <em>Endgame</em>. It’s a prequel that would have felt more appropriate in the first phase of films but mostly exists to give Scarlett Johansson flowers after she’d played a supporting role in everybody else’s movies. She deserved it, at least. Natasha was dragged into every female archetype Marvel could conceive of as she played second fiddle to a bunch of men and then died in <em>Endgame</em>. By the time <em>Black Widow </em>came out in 2021, going back to finally fill out the backstory of one of the MCU’s oldest mainstays felt odd, but the end result is still a pretty fun spy film that introduces a new dysfunctional family to the Marvel mix. Again, Pugh’s performance as Natasha’s sister Yelena is worth the price of admission. Otherwise? It’s fine. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Robert Downey Jr. is the person who unlocks your inner badass, Tom Holland is the person who reminds you of the innocence of youth, and Chris Hemsworth is the person who reminds you that you’ll never look as good as him. Unquestionably, Paul Rudd as Scott Lang is the most relatable, average MCU superhero, and <em>Ant-Man</em> is the movie that makes that abundantly clear. The climactic duel between Ant-Man and Yellowjacket on a toy train set—a scenario that’s destructive on a microscopic level and yet completely harmless on a normal scale—encompasses the movie’s penchant for artfully balancing high-stakes drama with genuine comedic relief. Plus, this is the movie that introduces the MCU to the Quantum Realm, a crucial yet sorely underused pocket of the MCU that was the key reason Thanos’s <em>Infinity War</em> snap could be reversed in <em>Endgame</em>. In many ways, <em>Ant-Man</em> is one of the most important films in the MCU canon, and is definitely one of its most fun viewing experiences. — Keith Nelson Jr</p></div><div><p>The middle entry in the MCU’s <em>Spider-Man</em> (as of now)<em> </em>trilogy isn’t a bad or boring movie. Instead, it’s just mostly forgettable. A big part of the problem is that it is so intertwined with the MCU, and especially with <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, which hit theaters just 13 weeks earlier, that it almost feels like an <em>Avengers </em>epilogue more than a proper standalone Spidey movie. And sure, Jake Gyllenhaal is great as Mysterio, but anybody even slightly familiar with Spider-Man knew he was a baddie the whole time. Making matters worse, revealing that his villainous origin is directly connected to the original<em> Iron Man </em>movie just makes this oddball European side quest feel even less like a proper <em>Spider-Man </em>sequel. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>The second <em>Avengers </em>film is full of fun moments held together by gum and string. We’re past the catty banter of the first movie and the Avengers are mostly friends now. The bit in which heroes take turns trying to lift Thor’s hammer is a classic MCU scene that riffs on the group’s dynamic without devolving into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/ust2i3/how_do_i_identify_whedonisms_in_my_writing_and/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/ust2i3/how_do_i_identify_whedonisms_in_my_writing_and/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whedonisms</a></span>, and James Spader’s monologues as killer AI Ultron are spine-chilling. <em>Age of Ultron</em>’s greatest asset, however, is the introduction of would-be staples like Vision and Scarlet Witch. Unfortunately, it falls apart in its attempts to tie everything that’s happening into a neat bow to later be unwrapped in <em>Infinity War</em>, struggling to balance its ties to the extended universe with being a coherent standalone film. But hey, at least we got the cool moment of Vision picking up Thor’s hammer without breaking a sweat. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>Ms. Marvel</em> was, I think, Disney+’s most successful TV series set in the MCU. Obviously <em>WandaVision</em> was stunning, but the lower stakes, smaller scale nature of <em>Ms. Marvel</em> belied a show that had enormous, intricate depth. Its coming-of-age focus, echoing the best of <em>Spider-Man</em>, combined with its portrayal of a loving, complicated, and ebullient Muslim-American family, made it feel so warm. And on top of this, it was an astonishing history lesson about the horrors of the 1947 partition of India. You should watch it. Also, you should watch it as a primer for <em>The Marvels</em>, in which we see the union of Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, and Monica Rambeau, in conflict with the Kree.</p><p><em>The Marvels</em> may not have the greatest narrative in the MCU, but it’s bursting with happiness, and that’s something we should grab with both arms. It’s just lovely! It’s lovely people being lovely in difficult circumstances, and it offers the most wonderful opportunity for Kamala Khan’s family to shine once more. I love that this movie exists. —John Walker </p></div><div><p>Bringing Benedict Cumberbatch’s Stephen Strange into the MCU gave Marvel an easy magical out it’s overrelied on in situations that followed, but on its own, <em>Doctor Strange </em>is one of the strongest origin stories in the series. Cumberbatch, coming off of his stint as Sherlock Holmes, can sell the insufferable genius humbled by those wiser than he, and watching him go from a selfish bastard to a selfless one is satisfying. This was also the first time the MCU had really delved into the sorcery side of the comics, which leads to some of the most compelling special effects and setpieces the series had up to that point. Doctor Strange may have become a party trick the MCU would whip out in future installments, but his first movie was a breath of fresh air that opened the universe to new possibilities. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>I challenge you to find five cooler villains in all of MCU history than Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), a victim of a quantum accident who can phase in and out of reality while donning a cool grey and silver suit that looks better than Moon Knight’s. Most of the fun of any <em>Ant-Man</em> movie is in how the size-manipulating Pym technology is used in visually captivating and absurdly funny ways, and the sight of a Hello Kitty PEZ dispenser getting enlarged to deadly proportions during a thrilling car chase could get a rise out of a corpse. Add in stellar acting turns from Walton Goggins and Laurence Fishburne, and it’s safe to say <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em> is the best <em>Ant-Man</em> movie ever. — Keith Nelson Jr</p></div><div><p>The third <em>Iron Man </em>movie came after the first <em>Avengers</em>, which means it’s the only movie with the name of Tony Stark’s superhero alter ego in the title that gets to really reckon with the bigger picture. By this point, Tony has seen some shit, fought aliens, and met Norse gods. He’s come a long way since his days as a mere billionaire genius playboy philanthropist. <em>Iron Man 3 </em>paves the way for the sacrifices Tony will have to make in <em>Infinity War </em>and <em>Endgame</em>, exposing the broken core underneath the metal suit exterior. On the other hand, its mishandling of villain the Mandarin is one of the MCU’s most notable misfires, though at least <em>Shang-Chi </em>managed to iron out some of those kinks eight years later. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>The first <em>Captain America </em>movie is still one of the most interesting takes on an origin story in the MCU. It starts as a period piece in the 1940s showing Steve Rogers becoming a symbol of the wartime American ideal, fighting Nazis and wielding his iconic shield. (Sadly, as the MCU has become more of a fence-sitting corporate product that’s seemingly scared of alienating anyone, the series has gotten less willing to sit with what it means to be a representative of that ideal, as exemplified by <em>Brave New World</em>.) <em>The First Avenger </em>is an idealistic movie led by Chris Evans at his most golden retriever, and it feels strangely classic Hollywood in a way Marvel hasn’t felt in a while. The funny thing about looking at old MCU movies is that you realize just how much of the identity of individual heroes has been lost as the franchise has been put on the assembly line. <em>The First Avenger </em>may not have been a spectacular film but it at least had a voice and perspective, unlike the several dozen other movies in the series that could have been made by anyone. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Don’t let internet trolls rewrite history—<em>Captain Marvel</em> kicks a lot of MCU movies’ asses. Brie Larson has the perfect blend of snarky defiance with a smile and duty-bound stoicism needed to play someone like Carol Danvers, a cosmic-powered demigod brainwashed by an alien species to be a sleeper cell on a universal level. The origin story is surprisingly fleshed out for the MCU, which usually opts for the “show and not tell” (more like “blow up and then sorta tell”) approach. Also, her snapping the inhibitor chip out of her head to unlock her full powers (powers that almost had Thanos shitting Infinity Stones in <em>Endgame</em>) is one of the best awakening moments in MCU history. Sure, some of the dialogue tries to force Danvers’ wit a bit too hard. Still, <em>Captain Marvel</em> is essential viewing for any and all MCU fans. —Keith Nelson Jr </p></div><div><p>If it were up to me, as it should be, this would be the number one film. Yeah, yeah, it has an almost incoherent plot, and <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em> does multiverse cameos vastly better, and it forgets that character development is even a thing…Yeah, I know. But now, imagine if your favorite film growing up was <em>Evil Dead 2</em>. See? Whole different framework.</p><p><em>Multiverse of Madness</em> is, I contend, <em>Evil Dead 4</em>. Everything is there! Obviously, it’s directed by Sam Raimi, the mastermind behind the original <em>Evil Dead </em>trilogy, and of course <em>Drag Me to Hell</em>, <em>A Simple Plan</em> and 2002’s <em>Spider-Man</em>—that’s a great start. Then of course it features all of Raimi’s signatures, from the appearance of his Oldsmobile Delta 88 (the original car from the <em>Evil Dead </em>movies) to a cameo by Bruce Campbell (the star of all three <em>Evil Dead</em> movies), and indeed the camera rushing forward to suggest impending danger (the core camera move in the <em>Evil Dead</em> movies). But more than that—and there are people who pooh-pooh this because they’re wrong—it’s a horror movie!</p><p>Sam Raimi somehow snuck a horror movie into the MCU. I know I’m right, because when showing my 10-year-old all the MCU movies, this is the only one he asked to stop watching because it was scaring him too much. So, fact. It’s made like a horror movie, it’s framed like a horror movie, it’s directed like a horror movie. It’s actually a bit scary in places!</p><p>But perhaps more importantly than anything else, there’s the scene in which Bruce Campbell plays Pizza Poppa. After insisting that America Chavez pay for her pizza roll, Strange casts a spell on him that causes him to squirt mustard in his own face, then beat himself up with his own hands. Which, as you will know, is a callback to <em>Evil Dead 2</em>’s greatest scene, when Ash’s hand becomes possessed. And that makes this <em>Evil Dead 4</em>, and I don’t care that you think the film shat on Wanda, because none of that matters. Thank you. —John Walker </p></div><div><p>Nothing against Jamie Lee Curtis and her hot dog fingers in <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em>, but Angela Bassett should’ve won that Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her powerful portrayal of Queen Ramonda in <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em>. The <em>Black Panther</em> sequel shined under the immense shadow of Chadwick Boseman’s death by shifting the entire landscape of Wakanda with an epic flood, dividing the hero duties amongst Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong’o, and Danai Gurira, and honoring both Boseman and T’Challa’s deaths. The movie’s greatest achievement, other than being the rare post-<em>Endgame</em> MCU success story, is establishing the <em>Black Panther</em> franchise as an irreplaceable aspect of the MCU because the world of Wakanda is ripe with some of the coolest characters. — Keith Nelson Jr</p></div><div><p>Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman came barreling into the MCU right through the fourth wall in 2024, and the meta-action comedy that emerged as a result has some standout moments. <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>serves as a sort of eulogy for all the old Marvel movies that existed outside the “official” canon of the MCU, and the resulting cameos are pretty great. But the best part of the movie is its two leads, who finally get a redemptive team-up after the crime against comics that was <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em>. If you can’t stand Reynolds’ brand of rapid-fire raunchy one-liners, even when it’s balanced by Jackman’s brooding angst, the third <em>Deadpool </em>probably won’t do it for you. But if you can, you should; rather than just wiping the slate clean, Marvel took an opportunity to merge its disparate universes together and ran with it, and the results are as unexpectedly poignant as they are hilarious. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Rewatching 2008’s<em> Iron Man</em>, the movie that kicked off the entire MCU, is wild. After nearly 20 years of movies, TV shows, and spin-offs, the first <em>Iron Man</em> feels so small and contained, with only a few tiny nods to the greater Marvel universe. And then it ends with a post-credits scene setting up <em>The Avengers</em> and the next 20 years of MCU movies, even if we didn’t realize it at the time.</p><p>As a result, <em>Iron Man</em> is a very important piece of the MCU, but it’s a solid sci-fi action flick, too. <em>Iron Man </em>also<em> </em>feels very much of its era, terrified to reveal that it’s a comic book superhero movie at a time before such movies had completely taken over the multiplex. That doesn’t matter because of Robert Downey Jr. and his incredible performance as Tony Stark aka Iron Man. The dude nailed it so hard that every version of Iron Man since has copied him. Meanwhile, Stark has gone on to become—for better or for worse—the most popular character from the MCU. - ZZ </p></div><div><p>Bringing Spider-Man into the MCU after two earlier franchises still fresh in moviegoers’ memories was also going to be tricky. Thankfully, Marvel realized that the key to making Spider-Man work in the MCU was to focus on what made him so different from the other heroes. The MCU is filled with a lot of folks who don’t have secret identities or even traditional powers. It’s a lot of gods, aliens, robots, mercenaries, and enhanced people. But for Spider-Man, Marvel producers kept the character a teen trying to balance crimefighting with high school while living in NYC. It’s a winning formula that is helped out a ton by the fact that <em>Homecoming </em>skips the origin story that everyone knows already. Add in one of the best villains in the entire MCU and arguably one of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/QtfwHjpaUkQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/QtfwHjpaUkQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most tense scenes ever included in a comic book movie</a></span> and you’ve got yourself a damn fine Spidey flick. — ZZ</p></div><div><p><em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings </em>might be one of the most criminally underrated movies in the MCU’s catalog. Its sequel has been mired in development hell and swallowed up by Marvel’s shifting priorities, but the studio’s take on a superpowered martial arts film is still quietly one of the studio’s most impressive outings. <em>Shang-Chi </em>starts with mostly practical, well-choreographed action set pieces, all framed in a dramatic family soap opera that maintains its grounded humanity even as the otherworldly elements ramp up in the second half. By the time it turned into Marvel CG sludge, I was already too invested to be annoyed at the film’s distinct voice falling victim to the same nonsense plenty of other Marvel movies do. And can we also talk about that soundtrack? I know <em>Black Panther </em>gets a lot of love for its Kendrick Lamar-curated music, but <em>Shang-Chi</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPwelOkz5qo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPwelOkz5qo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is also full of bangers</a></span>. Good film. Gimme a sequel, Marvel. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>I may be an outlier in thinking the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>movies only got better as they went, but I’d argue that the first is the least of the three. Star-Lord and friends’ intergalactic adventures benefit from having one director in James Gunn across all three films, the same cast whose chemistry only grew stronger with each installment, and a clear arc for its heroes that didn’t have to bend to the whims of the MCU’s overarching storyline. The first movie effectively brings five heroes together who should have wanted nothing to do with one another and makes you believe they could become more tight-knit than any other team in Marvel’s catalog. That being said, its villain is forgettable and I don’t think the movie is as funny as it thinks it is. But hey, it led to the other two films which are some of the best in the MCU. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Looking back on <em>The Winter Soldier </em>after having just seen <em>Brave New World </em>only makes this earlier entry look even stronger. Whereas the latest <em>Captain America </em>loves to sit on the fence and say we should find the good in America, <em>The Winter Soldier </em>is all about how deep the rot goes. The espionage thriller explores parts of Steve Rogers’ buried past and how the same monsters he fought in the 1940s have persisted decades later. It was bold of Marvel to completely upend the foundations it had built and force Captain America to make hard choices. What a shame that, when a Captain America who stands against corruption would really hit, Marvel’s put the gloves on and given us a version of the character who doesn’t live up to that part of the legacy.— Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 </em>is about as close as the MCU has come to doing a one-shot comic storyline. It’s mostly disconnected from the rest of the films but uses all that freedom to really dive into its heroes’ deepest traumas, and its best moments come when people are just talking to one another. Mantis touches Drax and feels his grief with her empath abilities, Rocket and Yondu get into a shouting match because they’re two bullheaded men who can’t see past their own noses, and Gamora and Nebula stop trying to kill each other and hash out decades of unresolved sisterly trauma. Then there are the moments that are expressed without words at all, like Star-Lord opening fire on his own father after he nonchalantly confesses to killing his mother. <em>Vol. 2 </em>is not a subtle film. It bluntly has every character look into the camera and tell you how they’re feeling, essentially making it a vibrant two-hour therapy session for them to talk about the things they were afraid to in the first movie. Yeah, they’d still have some raw wounds to poke at in future movies, but the Guardians of the Galaxy are truly united after <em>Vol. 2</em>, rather than a bunch of weirdos drawn together by circumstance. And come on, you can’t tell me you weren’t hyped when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce2a0wWtnJA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce2a0wWtnJA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The Chain” dropped in the final fight</a></span>. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>I never ever thought this movie would happen. Sure, now it seems like nothing. Marvel characters (and, separately, DC characters) pop up together in films all the time. But in 2012 the MCU wasn’t even five years old and the idea of a shared universe of comic movies was still new; for years before, superhero movies had never crossed over as all the rights were kept separate between different studios.</p><p>And then, Marvel pulled it off. Hot damn, <em>Avengers </em>is fun. It’s not the best MCU movie and the pacing is a bit odd in the middle, but whatever, Marvel did the big comic book team-up movie and it rocked. The action is exciting, each character is given plenty of screen time, and we finally get to see these heroes interact and it’s just the best. Thor fighting Iron Man! Cool shit! I remember seeing this movie twice in theaters because I couldn’t believe it was real. And while the success of <em>The Avengers </em>and the greater MCU contributed to Hollywood becoming a superhero- and IP-obsessed slop machine, it doesn’t change that the MCU’s first big crossover movie was a blast. - ZZ </p></div><div><p>Yeah, <em>No Way Home </em>is basically 90 percent fan service. I mean, there was no way a Spider-Man movie that brings together the last three actors to play Peter Parker alongside villains from past movies in one big Doctor Strange-filled multiverse adventure was ever going to be anything but a massive fan service extravaganza. But that doesn’t diminish the fact that, in the midst of all that fan service, there’s a really good superhero movie with big stakes and some punishing losses. Watching the three Spider-Men (Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland) together on screen is enjoyable, and not just because they are spitting out references. Instead, we get new insights into these characters and what they’ve been doing since their last film. In one scene Garfield’s Parker is even able to get some much-needed closure<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/FFjFIXVI2xs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/FFjFIXVI2xs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> in an emotional moment that I still tear up watching</a></span>. And by the end, Marvel resets Peter’s life in a way that could lead to some really interesting new Spider-Man movies. -ZZ</p></div><div><p>Ideally, <em>Infinity War </em>and <em>Endgame </em>would be judged as a single work, considering this film was very clearly written as a Part 1 to <em>Endgame</em>’s Part 2. But Marvel released them as separate films, so we will address them as such. <em>Infinity War </em>is the culmination of everything the MCU had been building to at this point, but as its own movie, it’s mostly a bleak setup for a payoff that wouldn’t come for a full year. It is two-and-a-half hours of watching heroes that fans had been following for a decade face their greatest defeat at the hands of Thanos. Portrayed by the charismatic Josh Brolin, Thanos believes so wholeheartedly in the wisdom of his delusional plan to wipe out half the universe that some of the dumbest motherfuckers you’ve ever seen on YouTube are making videos about how he was right, actually. <em>Infinity War </em>feels like half of a film, but it doesn’t feel half-baked. It manages to bring disparate sides of the universe together in a way that is satisfying dramatically and comedically, and that paves the way for some of the most entertaining action scenes in the franchise. It was a huge pop culture moment to see the Avengers, the Guardians, and so many others come together to face a threat unlike any they’d ever faced. Even the most jaded filmgoer had to have felt something being in a theater with people who had watched every movie up to this point applauding as Evans showed up as a vigilante Captain America, or hearing the dead silence as, one by one, heroes were lost to Thanos’ snap. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>While <em>Infinity War </em>was a major crossover event, <em>Endgame </em>mostly goes back to basics, putting the spotlight on the original Avengers as they try to fix the world Thanos broke. Because we always knew that the first film’s ending was a cliffhanger and that much of what transpired was likely to be undone, <em>Endgame </em>is the movie with the higher stakes and the more dramatic goodbyes. It starts out with the MCU putting on its best Oscar-bait face as everyone collectively grieves the events of <em>Infinity War</em>. Yeah, some of it is laughably hokey, like putting one of the Russo brothers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PjuixX7d5k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PjuixX7d5k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in front of a camera to be the series’ first gay character</a></span>, but when it’s sitting with the core cast of Avengers, it’s genuinely affecting. From the nostalgic time-traveling tour of the past decade to the climactic final battle, <em>Endgame </em>feels like a goodbye, one meticulously led to and earned over a decade of great films and mystifying stumbles. It’s a shame that the MCU hasn’t been able to capture that magic since. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>The stars aligned for this one. We know that now, after the dull thud of <em>Thor: Love And Thunder</em>. That or the writing team of Craig Kyle and Christopher L. Yost was utterly vital to <em>Ragnarok</em>’s incredible success—neither returned for the Taika Waititi-penned follow-up, although he directed both movies. Where <em>Love And Thunder</em> was a misfiring joke machine, putting plot behind a desire to just endlessly show off, <em>Ragnarok</em> was a dense, engrossing tale that couldn’t help but leak squillions of top-quality gags.</p><p>The stakes are incredibly high in a film that sees the loss of an entire homeworld, all while juggling the myriad of arcs from within the MCU in a way that somehow made sense. The extremes were a joy to be flung between, from an Earthly, dying Odin and the imminent release of Hela, to the camp pantomime lunacy of Thor and Hulk battling on the garbage planet Sakaar for the entertainment of Jeff Goldblum’s adorably awful Grandmaster.</p><p>This is also the movie that best handles the flip-flopping love/hate relationship between Thor and Loki, in which the inevitability of Loki’s betrayals is not something for the audience to sigh at as they see them coming but rather is integral to the plot.</p><p>Perhaps more than anything else, <em>Ragnarok</em> is a collection of wonderful performances. Hemsworth finds the perfect pitch for Thor’s vanity and heroism, Hiddleston is gleeful as Loki, Goldblum is the most gloriously Goldblum he’s ever been, and Cate Blanchett is just fucking incredible as the villainous Hela, the scene-chewingly wicked Disney witch Angelina Jolie wishes she could be. It’s a movie that, despite being a cog in the infinite MCU machine, works brilliantly as a standalone action comedy in its own right. —John Walker </p></div><div><p>The third <em>Guardians </em>movie is an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-rocket-raccoon-animal-vio-1850408326&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-rocket-raccoon-animal-vio-1850408326">animal lover’s worst nightmare</a></span> and also a beautiful culmination of the spacefaring scoundrels’ adventures. Like its predecessor, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 </em>has the advantage of being mostly separated from the dumpster fire that is post-<em>Endgame</em> MCU, and just has to focus on wrapping up the titular group’s decade-long arcs. Thank god Marvel wised up and re-hired James Gunn to wrap up the trilogy because I can’t imagine anyone else sending off the original Guardians with this much love and understanding. The crew’s journey to save Rocket Raccoon from the demons of his past is heartfelt and raw, incredibly funny, and most importantly, earned. Working together helped each of the Guardians become the best versions of themselves, and after one final mission to save one of their own, the group decides that if they’re to keep growing, they have to forge their own paths. It’s sad to see the band break up, but at least they do so having learned so much about themselves and each other. <em>Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 </em>is perhaps the most appropriate finale the MCU has yet created, and that’s including <em>Infinity War </em>and <em>Endgame</em>. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Nearly every <em>Avengers </em>movie has the members of its organization arguing about some shit. It was about time that all that tension came to blows as the core of a full film. <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> adapts one of the most iconic comic book stories into something that should not have worked within the MCU’s smaller scale, but manages to make the most of its smaller roster. Though Cap’s name is in the title, <em>Civil War </em>is effectively an <em>Avengers </em>movie that introduces some of the most important characters to the MCU and sees them stand tall alongside heroes we’d been following for a decade. Black Panther and Spider-Man’s intros are some of the most effective in the series, adding compelling dramatic wrinkles to an already complex conflict between Captain America and Iron Man. The end result is some of the most gripping interpersonal drama in the MCU, punctuated by memorable action sequences that make the most of each of the heroes. It also leaves the Avengers in shambles when their greatest threat is still looming in the distance. As a setup for <em>Infinity War</em>, it’s excellent. As a character study of Captain America and the lengths Captain America he’ll go to in order to do what he believes is right, it’s unmatched. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Getting Marvel fans to agree on anything is like trying to keep the Sacred Timeline in order with a safety pin. Yet when <em>Black Panther</em> roared into the MCU, it earned near-universal acclaim, a supremely rare feat for a superhero film. In his masterful performance as T’Challa, Chadwick Boseman balanced the ferocity of a warrior with the compassion of a king, creating a hero both formidable and relatable. And unlike many MCU entries, <em>Black Panther</em> is deeply rooted in a rich cultural tapestry, eschewing reliance on supernatural gimmicks to craft a compelling narrative. The film’s iconic challenge—”Is this your king?!”—has become the stuff of movie legend, and its fully realized vision of Wakanda and the people who live there resonated so profoundly that audiences worldwide donned African attire to screenings, making <em>Black Panther</em> a significant cultural touchstone as well as a box office hit.</p><p>It’s no exaggeration to say that <em>Black Panther </em> redefined the superhero genre by infusing it with profound cultural significance. Director Ryan Coogler’s vision brought Wakanda to life, offering a glimpse into an Afrofuturistic society that captivated audiences and critics alike. The ensemble cast, featuring standout performances from Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong’o, and Danai Gurira, added depth and dimension to the story, making it a multifaceted cinematic experience. <em>Black Panther</em> transcended traditional superhero tropes, delivering a narrative rich in themes of identity, heritage, and responsibility. Its legacy endures, not just as a box office triumph, but as a grand cinematic achievement that continues to influence and inspire. —Keith Nelson Jr</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Keita Takahashi, the creator of games like&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wattam</em>, has revealed the release date for his latest game&nbsp;<em>To a T</em>. It's scheduled to hit Xbox and PC later this year.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>To a T&nbsp;</em>will launch across Xbox Series X|S and PC on May 28th. It sounds as though the Xbox One version, which was apparently revealed back when the game was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/06/annapurna-interactive-uvula-and-keita-takahashi-announce-to-a-t-for-xbox-series-xbox-one-and-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled in 2023</a>, is no longer happening.</p>

<p>Takahashi and his team describe&nbsp;<em>To a T&nbsp;</em>as "a narrative adventure game...with a strong focus on character, interaction, story, and exploration". You will play the role of Teen, a teenager permanently stuck in a T-pose trying to live a normal life. Hey, at least nobody will challenge Teen's dominance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator-teen.jpg?itok=X6bxnQjO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator-teen.jpg?itok=Us_jC-kL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>To a T&nbsp;</em>turns T-posing into a plot element.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll have to help Teen try and live as best they can, controlling them in "a variety of different scenarios" like moving their arm to eat, petting their dog, and more.</p>

<p>As well as helping Teen with their everyday life, you'll also be able to explore the town in which they live, meeting its inhabitants and collecting coins scattered around the streets. <em>To a T</em> will offer a "free mode" that will allow you to explore at your leisure.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you'll also be able to customize Teen in whatever style you like, purchasing clothing from stores you'll find around town. Don't worry, though; I'm pretty sure you won't need to buy those clothes with real currency.</p>

<p>You can check out the (frankly adorable) release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>To a T&nbsp;</em>right here. It features an original song, "Giraffe Song", sung by none other than&nbsp;<em>Steven Universe</em>'s Rebecca Sugar, as well as exactly the kind of visual style you'd expect from the creator of&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wattam" rel="nofollow"><em>Wattam</em></a>.</p>




<p><em>To a T&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875320/to_a_T/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/to-a-t/9NM6NMBJ7ZK4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on May 28th. It'll also be available as part of Xbox Game Pass on day one, although you'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">need to be subscribed</a> to either PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate to play it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 1 T-1000 DLC Release Date Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date-revealed.1117041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros and NetherRealm Studios have revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s upcoming T-1000 DLC, and it won't be long before you get to slice your opponents apart as Robert Patrick's intimidating automaton.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer showing off the T-1000's moves, the character, who is the latest crossover fighter to appear as part of the game's&nbsp;<em>Khaos Reigns&nbsp;</em>expansion, will be released for owners of that expansion on March 18th and for everyone else on March 25th.</p>

<p>The T-1000 wears his (its?) iconic police officer uniform from&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em>, and since the newer model is a shapeshifter, it can be seen transforming its arms into weapons like blades and Kabal-esque hookswords.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/t-1000-johnny-cage-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=JBwFNUZO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/t-1000-johnny-cage-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=1Xpp0kqp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The T-1000 will fit into&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s violent world perfectly.</figcaption></figure><p>During the closing moments of the DLC fighter's teaser trailer, after he's beaten Johnny Cage to a pulp, we see him using his Fatality, in which he uses&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2</em>'s infamous truck to pulverize his opponent before hopping out of the driver's seat and finishing the job with a submachine gun.</p>

<p>It's not just the T-1000, either. The trailer also teases a little of new Kameo fighter Madam Bo, who appears in&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s main story mode as the owner of the Fengjian Teahouse and a friend to Raiden and Kung Lao.</p>

<p>In the trailer, she can be seen leapfrogging over the T-1000 to deliver some pretty impressive martial arts moves of her own, so it looks like she'll be a formidable ally.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date trailer for the T-1000 right here, with&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>head honcho Ed Boon <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1893814056609263619" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">promising</a> that a longer trailer will be on the way "soon".</p>




<p>The T-1000 is just the latest crossover fighter to appear in&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>. He's preceded by the likes of&nbsp;<em>The Boys</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-first-look" rel="nofollow">Homelander</a>, DC antihero&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-peacemaker-gameplay" rel="nofollow">Peacemaker</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Invincible</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-omni-man-gets-gameplay-reveal-november-release-window" rel="nofollow">Omni-Man</a> (are you sensing a pattern emerging here?).</p>

<p>The game's roster has also been expanded with fighters from previous&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>games, including telekinetic ninja <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-ermac-release-date" rel="nofollow">Ermac</a> and Netherrealm sorcerer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-cena-will-voice-peacemaker-in-mortal-kombat-1-while-quan-chi-gets-release-date" rel="nofollow">Quan Chi</a>.</p>

<p>Patrick's single-minded automaton, as well as the upcoming Conan the Barbarian DLC, won't be the only crossover in&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>'s future, either; Lin Kuei ninja Sub-Zero recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-lawless-update-chapter-6-season-2" rel="nofollow">found his way into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em></a>, and it's been rumored that his rival Scorpion will be appearing later in the game's newest season as well.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mortal-kombat-1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mortal-kombat-1/9N7271QN4SGB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mortal-kombat-1-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. The game's T-1000 DLC launches on March 25th for general players and March 18th for&nbsp;<em>Khaos Reigns&nbsp;</em>owners.</p>

If you plan to go all-in this playstyle, you may want to bring a wand with you too. These have a high attack speed and can build Stun damage on your foes very quickly. Most importantly, of course, is that it rounds out your Wizard vibes.</p><p>Though you can certainly get through the game mixing and matching spells, picking a single element to focus on with a single grimoire can make you ultra-powerful. If you want to go for high damage over time, I recommend choosing fire, because it absolutely slaps in this game.</p><h2 id="h7963"><a id=""></a><strong>Sword and Grimoire</strong></h2><p>Grimoires also pair exceedingly well with a good one-handed weapon like a sword. This allows you to cast spells and beat the hell out of enemies with rapid swings all at once. This Battlemage build can be one of the most rewarding in the game once you learn how to weave all of your attacks together.</p><p>If you decide to go for a fire-focused build, <strong>pick up the quest Dawntreader in Paradis</strong> during the early part of the game. This quest leads you to arguably the best weapon in <em>Avowed</em>, The Last Light of Day, an immensely strong fire sword with one of the most useful enchantments in the game.</p><h2 id="h7964"><a id=""></a><strong>Sword and Pistol</strong></h2><p>If you’re not really feeling the magic thing, maybe you should opt for a sword and pistol combo. The Ranger skill tree has some really great abilities for this playstyle, such as slowing down time for you to line up perfect shots on enemy noggins. When enemies close in, you can beat ‘em down with your sword (or other one-handed weapon of choice).</p><p>Do note, though, that going this route will mean investing fairly equally in the Fighter and Ranger trees to get the most out of the playstyle. As such, you’ll probably want to analyze how you’re approaching fights and make a build that capitalizes just a bit more on one or the other.</p><h2 id="h7965"><a id=""></a><strong>Pistol and Grimoire</strong></h2><p>If you’d like to go for a Bible thumper build, wield a pistol and grimoire. Slinging spells and poppin’ heads is a ranged player’s dream. It might be a good idea to invest in some frost spells if you choose this build, however, as pistols reload a bit slowly.</p><p>As with a Sword and Pistol loadout, opting for this playstyle may stretch your ability points a little thin. But you’re likely to benefit most from leaning more on the Ranger tree, as magic is pretty damn incredible even with limited investment, while pistols require you to level some passive abilities to really shine.</p><h2 id="h7966"><a id=""></a><strong>Wand and Wand</strong></h2><p>Hear me out. You may think dual-wielding is best suited for pistols and one-handed melee weapons, but you might be shocked at how powerful dual wands can be. The rapid attack speed of wands can result in some damn good DPS without the need to line up critical shots as precisely as you would with guns.</p><p>Even more, if you combine two elemental wands, you can rapidly build up status effects on your foes for even more damage. Add in a few magic spells and you’ll be whittling down health bars like you wouldn’t believe.</p><hr><p><em>Avowed</em> is available now on Xbox Series X and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
