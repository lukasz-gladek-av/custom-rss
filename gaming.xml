		<p>A new Fellowship patch is being released on November 13th, bringing more changes to the game. Those changes include removing the Haunting of Stronghold event, adjusting character stats with some attacks getting major buffs, and adjusting armour values for cloth and leather armour. You can check out the full patch notes below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fellowship | Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BCJPI8DIDQ8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<ul>
<li>Removed the ‘Haunting of Stronghold’ Event.<wbr></li>
<li>Updated the Stronghold’s appearance.<wbr></li>
<li>Updated the Stronghold music, emitters, and ambience.<wbr></li>
<li>Updated Stronghold Loading Screen.<wbr></li>
<li>Removed the ‘Caretaker of Fallen Heroes’<wbr></li>
<li>Added the ability to bind Left and Right mouse buttons but only when used with modifiers.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where middle-mouse clicks weren’t registering when clicking on health bars.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where non-party leaders were still getting AFK kicked while matchmaking.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the ‘select previous target’ functionality where the history could be lost.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed various translation issues in text throughout the game.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Added feedback so health bars on the party frame will now fade down when the other player is out of range, or line of sight to them is blocked. The distance check is based on the standard max range of ranged hero abilities.<wbr></li>
<li>Added a ‘Refresh Regions’ button to the start menu to force the refresh of each region’s state. Previously players needed to restart the client.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Cloth &amp; Leather Armor Adjustments</b>&nbsp;We have increased the amount of armor provided by Cloth and Leather items. Our intention is to have a noticeable difference in between the Armor Classes in the game – and to overtime supply players with a variation of ways to deal with encounters where Physical damage specifically becomes a problem for them as we continue expanding on the game’s systems. However, we have noticed that the difference was larger than intended on higher difficulties and decided to increase the amount of armor found on Cloth and Leather items to reduce that gap. This will affect all cloaks and Rime and Ardeos (cloth) – and Sylvie, Mara, Elarion, and Meiko (leather).<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>At 330 item level, Cloth heroes will now have around 25% physical damage reduction from their armor (was 14.5%).<wbr></li>
<li>At 330 item level, Leather heroes will now have around 32% physical damage reduction from their armor (was 22%).<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Armor Adjustments and Meiko</b>&nbsp;Adjusting for the changes to Leather armor values, we have adjusted Meiko’s kit in some places to make sure her defensive power does not increase while she has all her buffs and effects active. The change will increase Meiko’s defensive power when she has no buffs or effects active.<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>[Stone Shield] now increases Meiko’s Armor by 20% (was 50%) per stone up to a maximum of 60% at 3 stones (was 150% at 3 stones).<wbr></li>
<li>[Spirited Armor] (spirit refund passive) now increases Meiko’s Armor by 20% (was 30%).<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>To clarify how the above changes affect Meiko’s defensive power in various situations (using 330 item level without gems as the reference point):<wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>With no buffs or effects, Meiko now has 48.95% Physical DR (was 41.04%).<wbr></li>
<li>With [Stone Shield] at 3 charges, Meiko now has 68,17% Physical DR (was 66,95%).<wbr></li>
<li>With [Stone Shield] at 3 charges + [Spirited Armor] proc Meiko now has 70.88% Physical DR (was 70.82%).<wbr></li>
<li>With [Stone Shield] at 3 charges + [Resonance] from talent + [Serenity] DR from legendary boots Meiko now has 83.45% Physical DR (was 82.23%).<wbr></li>
<li>With [Stone Shield] at 3 charges + [Resonance] from talent + [Serenity] DR from legendary boots + [Spirited Armor] proc Meiko has 84.86% Physical DR (was 84.32%).<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ardeos</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>The direct damage dealt while channeling [Incinerate] has been increased by 312%.<wbr></li>
<li>The damage over time of [Incinerate] now deals 62.5% increased damage.<wbr></li>
<li>The damage over time of [Incinerate] now gains +30% increased damage for each stack applied.<wbr></li>
<li>[Incinerate] now has a static channel time of 2.5 seconds, and its tick rate is now affected by your Haste.<wbr></li>
<li>[Incinerate] no longer generates Cinders.<wbr></li>
<li><u>Note: Ardeos Spirit Ability, Incinerate, was underperforming and did not have enough of an impact beyond its ability to generate Cinders and extend the duration of his other damage over time effects. In addition to this, Ardeos’; ramp time has been a bit too long – especially in the early game. As such, the ability no longer generates cinders and deals heavy damage on its own, to allow Ardeos players to get into their big burst moment earlier.</u><wbr></li>
<li>The initial direct damage of [Apocalypse] has been increased by 50%.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tariq</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>[Heavy Strike] damage increased by 50% and the static portion of its Fury Generation increased to 7% (was 4%).<wbr></li>
<li>[Face Breaker] damage increased by 50% and the static portion of its Fury Generation increased to 6% (was 5%).<wbr></li>
<li>Wild Swing damage increased by 100%.<wbr></li>
<li>Chain Lightning now deals damage 6 times baseline (was 5 times).<wbr></li>
<li>Thunderstruck talent now grants Chain Lightning 2 additional bounces (was 3).<wbr></li>
<li>Chain Lightning damage reduced by 50%.<wbr></li>
<li>Skull Crusher damage increased by 10%.<wbr></li>
<li>Culling Strike damage increased by 54%.<wbr></li>
<li>The additional Lightning Damage dealt by Heavy Strike, Skull Crusher, and Hammer Storm during Thunder Call was reduced to 30% of the initial hit (was 50%).<wbr></li>
<li>Schism talent now has 3.2 PPM (was 1.2 PPM) and the damage bonus has been reduced to +200% (was +300%).<wbr></li>
<li>Bloodied Brass necklace (legendary necklace) now deals 350% of Face Breaker’s damage to the target of 24 seconds (was 450%).<wbr></li>
<li><u>Note: The lightning damage in Tariq’s kit has been reduced, while the power of his other abilities have been increased. Overall, his total damage should be at a similar place as before, but more of the damage is coming from your non-lightning mechanics – with the intention of making other legendaries and talents more competitive.</u><wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Rime</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where [Wrath of Winter] would cancel when Rime was being moved by a force push such as High Tide or the Rivers in Sailor’s Abyss.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Sylvie</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where spawning [Life Petal] through [Dryad’s Haven] (Legendary Boots) could cancel other abilities or be canceled by other abilities.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Vigour</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where Vigour’s orb would pull enemies too far beneath him.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Dungeon Timer Adjustments</b><wbr></p>

<li>Urrak Markets: +20 seconds<wbr></li>
<li>Godfall Quarry: +35 seconds<wbr></li>
<li>Everdawn Grove: +48 seconds<wbr></li>
<li>Silken Hollow: +50 seconds<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cithrel’s Fall</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Cithrel’s [Path of Oblivion] damage from the initial hit has been reduced by 20%.<wbr></li>
<li>Cithrel’s [Bloodhunt] initial hit damage has been reduced by 10%.<wbr></li>
<li>Cithrel’s [Bloodhunt] bleed damage has been reduced by 20%.<wbr></li>
<li>Damage from the Blade of Cithrel’s [Spinning Blades] ability can now be Blocked, Dodged, and Parried.<wbr></li>
<li>The Blade of Cithrel’s [Ice Breaker] ability now detaches from the player after 1 second – allowing players time to move out of the impact area.<wbr></li>
<li>The Tundra Stalker’s [Rapid Fire] now has a 1.5 second precast (uninterruptable).<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Wyrmheart</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>The Coldheart Assassin’s [Coldheart Poison] ability now has a 2 second, uninterruptable cast.<wbr></li>

<li>The Blade of Cithrel’s [Ice Breaker] ability now detaches from the player after 1 second – allowing players time to move out of the impact area.<wbr></li>
<li>The Tundra Stalker’s [Rapid Fire] now has a 1.5 second precast (uninterruptable).<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Cithrel’s ‘fly away’ animation would not play if one player reached the boss before the others.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Empyrean Sands</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Damage from the Tombguard Reaver’s [Whirlwind] ability can now be Blocked, Dodged, and Parried.<wbr></li>

			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-november-grand-theft-auto-v-pacific-drive-still-wakes-the-deep-and-more/">announced the full lineup of games</a> joining the PS Plus Extra Games Catalog for November 2025, and the big headlining title is one that we already expected, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-reportedly-heading-back-to-ps-plus-extra-catalog/">thanks to a leak from last week</a>. As expected, Grand Theft Auto V is indeed making a return to the library of PS Plus Extra titles, and it's doing so alongside BAFTA-winning games like Still Wakes the Deep and Thank Goodness You're Here. </p>



<p>There are eight titles joining the library of PS Plus Extra games, and one game entering the library of PS Plus Premium Classic games. </p>



<p>Starting with the games entering the Extra tier library, while GTA V is the big headlining title that is also re-entering the service ahead of Grand Theft Auto VI launching next year in November 2026, it's not the only interesting title joining the library. Thank Goodness You're Here, for example, is arguably one of the funniest video games ever made and a BAFTA-winning title from 2024.</p>



<p>Pacific Drive is another notable title entering the service, as it excellently captures the Pacific Northwest in a mysterious journey where players build a strong bond with a mystical station wagon that you customize the more you explore. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/">Still Wakes the Deep</a> is another BAFTA-winning title from 2024 that's entering the library, and another game that's well worth checking out if you haven't already.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games entering the PS Plus Extra Games Library for November 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Grand Theft Auto V (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Pacific Drive (PS5)</li>



<li>Thank Goodness You're Here (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>The Talos Principle 2 (PS5)</li>



<li>Insurgency Sandstorm (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Still Wakes the Deep (PS5)</li>



<li>Monster Jam Showdown (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>MotoGP 25 (PS5, PS4)</li>
</ul>



<p>The lone game joining the PS Plus Premium Classics catalog this month is Tomb Raider: Anniversary, which will be playable on PS5 and PS4.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-and-new-steam-controller-all-coming-in-early-2026.1351720/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-rumored-to-announce-something-big-shortly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As hinted by the latest rumors</a>, Valve has just dropped three big announcements: the new Steam Frame Virtual Reality headset, a new Steam Machine, and a new Steam Controller, all of which are coming early next year. No pricing details have been disclosed yet, though.</p>



<p>Let's start with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamframe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Frame</a>. The project codenamed Deckard is much more than a mere upgrade of the Valve Index. This is instead a wireless 'streaming-first' headset that features a 6GHz wireless adapter for a dedicated link. Moreover, its dual radios promise to make the connection even more stable, as one radio is dedicated to streaming audio and visuals, while the other connects to the local Wi-Fi network, thus avoiding bandwidth competition.</p>



<p>The headset, designed for both VR and non-VR gaming, can function as a standalone PC, thanks to the 4nm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor and the SteamOS environment. Equipped with 16GB of Unified LPDDR5X RAM and 256GB/1TB storage options, it supports standalone play on certain games, and you'll see the Steam Frame Verified tag on those games that can work that way, similar to Steam Deck Verified.</p>



<p>The Steam Frame is very light (around 440g, lighter than Meta's Quest devices), has a built-in microphone and high-fidelity audio powered by dual speaker drivers per ear (integrated into the headstrap). Its display's optics support 2160 x 2160 LCD resolution per eye and a refresh rate range of 72-144Hz (with 144Hz currently labeled as experimental). The lenses are custom pancake with a large Field of View of up to 110°, and there's support for IPD (interpupillary distance) customization from 60 to 70 mm.</p>



<p>For VR applications, the Frame takes advantage of inside-out camera-based tracking. This means you won't need to set up cumbersome base stations around the room anymore. Instead, the headset has been designed with four outward-facing monochrome cameras for controller and headset tracking, and two interior cameras for eye tracking and foveated streaming.</p>



<p>The latter is one of the main innovations of the VR gaming experience. By tracking exactly where your gaze is directed, it optimizes detail in that area, offering an improvement in image quality and effective bandwidth of over 10 times. Valve stated that the Steam Frame utilizes low-latency eye-tracking data to direct the highest-quality pixels to the user's line of sight. Foveated streaming will work across all games.</p>



<p>Of course, there are also new controllers that can be used both in VR and non-VR games. For VR games, the controllers support capacitive finger tracking. For traditional games, users will find a D-pad, thumbsticks, triggers, bumpers, and ABXY face buttons. The controllers are powered by AA batteries, which are expected to last approximately 40 hours of playtime.</p>

<iframe title="Steam Hardware Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Next, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Machine</a>. Following the ill-fated venture of the first iteration (which launched ten years ago, in November 2015), this new console-like PC is a 6-inch, 2.6kg cube that Valve says is more than six times more powerful than the Steam Deck. It's powered by a semi-custom AMD Zen 4 processor with 6 Cores and 12 Threads. Its frequency goes up to 4.8 GHz and it consumes up to 30W TDP. The GPU is semi-custom, powered by the AMD RDNA3 architecture, and features 28 Compute Units with a maximum sustained clock of 2.45 GHz and a 110W TDP. Memory-wise, there are 16GB of DDR5 RAM and 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM.</p>



<p>Clearly, this is no monster PC. In fact, even the PlayStation 5 Pro has it beat with a combination of RDNA 3 and 4 architecture and a lot more Compute Units (60). That said, it supports up to 4K@60 FPS gaming through AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution, according to Valve. One of its perks is that it should run 'whisper quiet' even in the most demanding games. It can even be used as a host PC to stream to other devices, like Steam Link, Steam Deck, or the Steam Frame.</p>



<p>The Steam Machine is, of course, powered by SteamOS and designed to be paired with the new Steam Controller thanks to a built-in wireless adapter. Users can pair up to four controllers that way, in fact. The hardware will be available with 512GB and 2TB storage options, though it can be further expanded via microSD. </p>

<p>Lastly, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamcontroller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Controller</a> (not to be confused with the controllers for the Steam Frame) features next-generation magnetic thumbsticks powered by TMR (Tunneling Magnetoresistance) technology. They support capacitive touch, enabling motion controls, and include high-definition rumble for an immersive haptic experience. The major new feature is Grip Sense, a new input for the Steam Controller that enables gyro aiming with capacitive touch. Users can hold and release to enable or disable gyro, and this can also be mapped like any other button.</p>



<p>The Steam Controller, which weighs 292g and enables up to 35 hours of wireless gameplay, also comes with a 'Puck', a transmitter that enables a fast and stable wireless connection and doubles as a charging station, connecting to the Controller magnetically. Again, the Steam Controller can be used with the Steam Deck, Steam Frame, Steam Machine, and regular PC. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve has just announced the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Steam Frame</a>, its new VR headset that can play games streamed directly from your PC using a dedicated streaming stick <em>and</em> run Windows games locally thanks to an Arm chip in the headset itself. At the same time, Valve is also moving on from its previous VR headset, the Valve Index, which it’s “no longer manufacturing,” designer Lawrence Yang tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>The Index, a high-end headset that had to be tethered to your PC to work and used external “lighthouse” base stations for tracking, was released in 2019. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today">her review</a>, my colleague Adi Robertson praised its visuals and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18639084/valve-index-steamvr-headset-knuckles-controllers-preview">its controllers</a>, though dinged it for its $999 cost.</p><p>But corded headsets have also fallen out of favor since then. Meta has sold <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23619730/meta-vr-oculus-ar-glasses-smartwatch-plans">tens of millions</a> of its standalone Quest VR headsets that can play games without a PC connection and track your position without extra base stations. Even more expensive headsets like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/807963/apple-vision-pro-m5-review-specs-release-date">Apple Vision Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/802299/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-price-release-date">Samsung’s Galaxy XR</a> have taken the standalone approach.</p><p>The Frame isn’t exactly a sequel to the Index. But it does improve upon the older headset with some of its specs; the Index’s LCD screens have 1440 x 1600 per-eye resolution, while the Frame offers 2160 x 2160 per eye, for example. If you like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18639084/valve-index-steamvr-headset-knuckles-controllers-preview">Index’s “Knuckles” controllers</a> and how you can strap them right onto your hand, you’ll be able to buy optional straps for the Frame’s controllers so you can do the same thing.</p><p>And Valve is extremely confident in the Frame’s 6GHz wireless streaming adapter as a replacement for a physical cord. In our brief demos at Valve HQ, the streaming worked extremely well.</p><p>This may be the end for Valve’s lighthouse base stations, which were actually first released in 2016 with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/5/11358618/htc-vive-vr-review">the HTC Vive</a>. If you’ve got lighthouse base stations set up in your home already, don’t expect to use them with the Frame anytime soon, if ever.</p><p>“With Steam Frame, we’re not working on lighthouse support for it,” Yang says. Instead of sweeping a room with lasers like the lighthouses, the Frame currently uses four monochrome cameras and IR illuminators to determine its position in 3D space, though it also has a modular accessory port that could support additional cameras.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET.

Oh I do love a win! Today's is quite a surprising one, coming in the form of Jagex willingly removing some microtransactions from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> after more than 120,000 people voted in favour of having them permanently removed from the game. To be frank, I am genuinely unsure if I have… well, ever seen a company do this simply because everyone hated them so much.
</p>
<p>
To provide some context, Treasure Hunter is a daily activity that was introduced into the game in 2014, and essentially you can win prizes that can grant XP boosts, gold, and gameplay-skipping items. You'd only get a certain number of these for free a day, but it was also possible to buy extra keys with real money, which sucks a tremendous amount, obviously.

<p>
It's not just the Treasure Hunter microtransactions that are being removed, it's the entire system and then some. Come January 19th, 2026, the day this update will be implemented, 225 direct XP and skilling related items will also be gone from the game. According to Jagex, this is the start of what it's calling a year-long integrity roadmap, with the studio's CEO Jon Bellamy saying in a press release that they plan to tackle "some of the game's biggest friction points head-on."
</p>
<p>
January 19th will also see the arrival of a new RuneScape Ahead showcase which will go into a lot more detail about these roadmap plans, as well as other bits and bobs planned for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> across 2026.
</p>
<p>
I won't give outright kudos to Jagex for these changes, as we don't pat companies on the back for deciding they don't want to con people any more. But it is certainly a breath of fresh air at a time when just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnites-adding-pets-and-changing-your-invincible-banana-dogs-colour-will-require-buying-another-invincible-banana-dog">changing the skin of a virtual companion requires that you buy an entirely new companion first</a>. A hearty congrats to those that voted for the removal of these microtransactions, though. Hooray!

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve%E2%80%99s-steam-machine-could-cost-more-than-a-ps5-pro.1351708/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">The Steam Machine</a> marks Valve’s long-awaited return to the console wars. It looks slick and sounds powerful enough to play modern games on decent settings. But Valve is leaving the biggest question of all unanswered: how much will it cost? There’s no official price tag yet, though we do have some early clues that point to the Steam Machine being at least $800 or more.</p>

 <p>Valve probably wants to wait until closer to launch before committing to a price tag for both the 512GB and 2TB models. It wouldn’t want a repeat of what happened to the Nintendo Switch 2 when President Trump <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438">torpedoed the <em>Mario</em> maker’s initial pre-order plans</a> by announcing massive tariffs days before they were set to begin. Valve is promising to reveal more information in early 2026. But that doesn’t mean we’re completely in the dark about how much the Steam Machine will cost.</p>

 <p>“Steam Machine’s pricing is comparable to a PC with similar specs,” Valve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">told <em>The Verge</em></a> when it asked it if would cost more than PS5 Pro. Designer Pierre-Loup Griffais elaborated a bit more. “We intend for it to be positioned closer to the entry level of the PC space, but to be very competitive with a PC you could build yourself from parts,” he said.</p>

 <p>Based on <em>The Verge</em>‘s napkin math, building a PC from off-the-shelf parts to match the Steam Machine’s specs would start at around $800, but it wouldn’t get you anywhere close to the living room device’s small, compact footprint. That would require spending closer to $1,000, before taking into account things like storage. The PS5 Pro starts at $750 and comes with 2TB of storage, but it’s also benefitting from a massive supply chain operation from a company that’s been mass-manufacturing home consoles for decades.</p>

  <p>Still, it sounds like Valve doesn’t just want the Steam Machine to cater to existing PC gamers who are used to investing $1,500 and beyond in new rigs. Affordability also sounds like a top priority and there’s always the question of how much of the upfront cost of the hardware Valve is willing to eat on its end. A bigger Steam install base ultimately means more people paying Valve a 30-percent commission on every game they buy.</p>

 <p>“But we obviously also wanted to make the device affordable,” Valve engineer Yazan Aldehayyat <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview">told<em> IGN</em></a> “We understand that affordability is really important, so we kept that in mind and made sure that’s a device that’s going to be reachable for a lot of people.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “The affordability piece you mentioned is one of the reasons why we think a Steam Machine makes a lot of sense right now. So it’s just something that we thought about every time we made a hardware decision, a feature decision, is to make sure that we keep it as approachable, as affordable as possible.”</p> <p>Whether Valve can keep the Steam Machine pricing “console-level” will ultimately determine whether it ends up feeling like a pricey PC accessory like the ROG Xbox Ally X or a real competitor in the broader console gaming space. It could also be a bellwether indicating if the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">next-gen Xbox and PlayStation 6</a> stay in the realm of $500-$600 or start pushing the barrier to entry even higher.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-controller-steamos-reaction-price-date-2000643563</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In a world where video game consoles are largely becoming PCs for your TV, it makes sense that Valve would be jumping back into the console market with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535"><span>a new Steam Machine</span></a><span>. The original Steam Machine launched in 2015 and let you play your PC games on your TV, but the project was short-lived. Valve </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/a-brief-history-of-steam-machines-1824290873"><span>stopped selling the thing in 2018</span></a><span>, but hasn’t stopped trying to bring PC gaming and the SteamOS to new formats. Just take a look at the Steam Deck. Now, the Steam Machine is back with a new model for a new era. Will the public be more receptive this time around?</span></p>

 <p><span>We don’t have a price or release date for the new Steam Machine just yet beyond a 2026 window, and the cost will likely color how folks react to the device overall. We do know that the cube-like computer is around six times more powerful than the Steam Deck is. The six-inch tall box has a sleek, lowkey design that the PlayStation 5’s Seto-Kaiba-ass popped collar could learn from, and its controller has traditional analog sticks on top of the signature trackpad that made the original’s controller an oddity. It also doubles as a full-blown PC you can install non-gaming apps on. If Valve makes it a reasonable price, I could see it popping off, especially with the libraries of many consoles being nearly indistinguishable from that of the PC these days. A PC you play on your TV could easily become a viable alternative to buying a PlayStation or Xbox down the line.</span></p>

 <p><span>When the new Steam Machine launches, Valve’s digital storefront will be adding a new indicator for games that perform optimally on the device, similar to the Steam Deck verification games go through now. </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-machine-hands-on-first-impressions?utm_source=threads,twitter"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> says that the Steam Machine is about as powerful as a last-generation PC, which means some modern games may have some performance struggles, but their experience with the device was an overall positive one.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Valve says it intends for the Steam Machine to be able to play all current games at 4K with FSR upscaling, but there are going to be plenty of games – especially ones running on Unreal Engine 5 – where you’ll have to lower settings to get it running at a smooth frame rate,” Jacqueline Thomas writes. “Ultimately, I’ll have to get it in the lab to benchmark it to see exactly what it’ll be capable of, but I have little doubt this PC will be running most things – it’s just that the quality settings are definitely going to vary.”</span></p>

 <p><span>For now, the device is giving people a lot to speculate about, from the impact it could have on the console market to what kind of faceplates they can slap on the side of the thing to just how much it’s actually going to cost.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Valve just casually dropping a complete game changer for the console space with their own home console, the Steam Machine.</p> <p>This is going to be a gigantic shake-up for Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox.

                <p>Less than two weeks after its official launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> now has duo matchmaking. Developer Embark Studios quietly tested the feature before fully unveiling it to players and explaining how it works.</p><p>In a post on Arc Raiders' <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>, the devs noted that duo matchmaking "is not a 100% guaranteed system." Solo players and squads are prioritized to play separately, and duos are ideally paired up with other duos, while trios get to play bands of trios. However, Embark warns that "you may at times run into differing constellations of players other than your own."</p><p>Following up on feedback from fans, Embark will lower the prices on some of the cosmetic items in the store starting on November 13. Anyone who purchased items for their original price will be refunded the difference.</p><p>Embark also stated that there are no pay-to-win items in the game's premium Raider Decks. Those are being reserved for items of "cosmetics and convenience."

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has weighed in with his thoughts on Valve's just-announced new line of gaming hardware, saying the company welcomes the new Steam Frame and Steam Machine devices.</p><p>"Gaming moves forward when players and developers have more ways to play and create, especially across open platforms. Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox's vision from the start," he said. "As one of the largest publishers on Steam, we welcome new options for players to access games everywhere."</p><p>Another Xbox employee, senior social marketing manager Josh Stein, said the new Steam Machine device bears a resemblance to the leaked images of the Xbox Series S, which didn't turn out to be real.</p><p>Valve's announcements include a new Steam Controller, a cube-like Steam Machine that allows people to play PC games on their TV, and a Steam Frame virtual reality headset. Be sure to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">read up on GameSpot's extended coverage of the new devices.</a></p><p>The new Steam Machine comes after the success of the Steam Deck handheld device. Valve's new slate of hardware is set to launch in 2026, though pricing has not been announced as of yet.</p><p>In terms of new Valve games, the company is working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valves-deadlock-has-a-super-secret-invite-only-alpha-different-from-the-known-invite-only-alpha/1100-6531294/" data-ref-id="1100-6531294">brand-new MOBA game called Deadlock</a>. The secretive game has been available for testing, but still has no release date or full details.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Essential Starter Guide</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The first major changes outlined will come alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">November 18 California Resistance update</a>, which adds a new California-based map as well as an additional weapon and vehicle. Top of the list is an additional "tuning pass" for weapon dispersion and recoil buildup. Battlefield Studios notes that the dispersion changes apply to all weapons, while most weapons have also received recoil tuning.</p><p dir="ltr">"These changes make weapons feel smoother and more consistent, especially at longer ranges where we've seen players engage more often," Battlefield Studios states.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside recoil updates, aim assist is also seeing changes that will make it feel more similar to the game's open beta. That should make aim assist "feel smoother and more predictable," according to Battlefield Studios.</p><p dir="ltr">Another point of feedback being addressed with the update is soldier visibility. Players have complained about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-biggest-enemy-may-be-the-in-game-sun/1100-6535525/" data-ref-id="1100-6535525">Battlefield 6's oppressive sunlight</a> and how transitioning from indoor and outdoor spaces can make it challenging to see. The November 18 will make improvements to lighting to help enemies be more visible in varying light conditions. Challenges will additionally have their descriptions "refined" to be more clear and make progress easier to understand.</p><p dir="ltr">Next, in the December 9 update, Battlefield Studios will be making adjustments to Breakthrough and Rush on certain maps, as well as vehicle-balance changes. On Breakthrough, several maps, including the first sector of Mirak Valley, will be adjusted to help attackers make easier progress. For Rush, MCOM placements on Manhattan Bridge and Liberation peak will be adjusted.</p><p dir="ltr">That's what Battlefield Studios is working on in the weeks ahead, but looking even further out, the post lists other potential changes that are on the studio's radar and are currently being investigated. Those include further challenge adjustments, UI and menu improvements, updates to hit registration, vehicle balance, and, of course, map design.</p><p dir="ltr">The smaller size of many of Battlefield 6's maps has been a point of contention for many players. Battlefield Studios states that it is "committed to a variety of map types across future seasons" and will be looking to learn from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-are-making-larger-maps-because-the-game-doesnt-have-them-yet/1100-6536010/" data-ref-id="1100-6536010">community-made maps in the game's Portal mode</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-battlefield-redsec-with-or-without-battlefield-6/1100-6535767/" data-ref-id="1100-6535767">Battlefield Redsec</a>, the game's free-to-play battle royale mode that launched alongside Season 1, there are a few tweaks on the team's radar for the future. Those include a solo queue, a review of the game's armor-plating mechanic, the availability of tanks, and audio improvements to make hearing vehicles and footsteps more consistent.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 launched strongly, with one analyst estimating the game has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">sold 10 million copies</a>. The most recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-and-redsec-1-1-1-5-update-will-patch-out-an-infamous-exploit/1100-6536103/" data-ref-id="1100-6536103">Battlefield 6 update patched out the game's most infamous exploit</a>. Meanwhile, sales from a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-12-veterans-day-pack-for-battlefield-6-but-proceeds-wont-be-donated/1100-6536113/" data-ref-id="1100-6536113">Veteran's Day Battlefield 6 DLC pack won't be donated</a>, with EA instead making a separate donation to the National Ranger Association.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>There are few things in this world more insufferable than a rich person trying to force their shitty ideas on everyone else. And in 2025, there are very few things that feel more forced than “Generative AI.”</p><p>Like Gretchen Wieners from the classic Y2K teen comedy <em>Mean Girls</em>, the tech industry is desperately trying to make ‘Fetch’ happen—contorting itself in cartoon-like fashion to carry the mountains of investor capital that keep the AI hype train chugging. In the first half of 2025 alone, AI startups<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/22/ai-startups-raised-104-billion-in-first-half-exits-different-story.html?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>raised over $104 billion</u></a>, just shy of the amount that <em>all</em> startups had raised the previous year. The resulting AI bubble is now<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-ai-bubble-is-17-times-the-size-of-the-dot-com-frenzy-this-analyst-argues-046e7c5c?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>17 times bigger than the infamous dot-com boom</u></a>, ensnaring chip manufacturers like<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/openai-nvidia-amd-deals-risks-rcna234806?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Nvidia and AMD</u></a> in a chaotic tangle of business deals like some kind of late-capitalist katamari.</p><p>This multi trillion-dollar ouroboros is backed by an unrelenting campaign to convince us normal folk that GenAI will transform society for the better, and therefore should receive infinity dollars. Companies like OpenAI and Google have spared no expense, hiring<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/13/openai-lobbies-trump-admin-to-focus-ai-on-speed-light-regulation.html?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>lobbyists</u></a> and running<a href="https://gizmodo.com/googles-ai-super-bowl-ad-fiasco-somehow-gets-worse-2000561146?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Superbowl ads</u></a> in an attempt to sell their still-unproven technology as both useful and inevitable. Unfortunately for them, this plan has a major roadblock: the growing number of normal, non-techpilled people who are<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/generative-ai-backlash/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>calling bullshit</u></a>.</p><blockquote>The derisive label of Forced Meme is essentially the internet calling bullshit.</blockquote><p>By now you’re probably familiar with the long list of sins the tech industry is committing with the machine learning models it insists on calling “Artificial Intelligence.” These tools<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/openai-has-a-fix-for-hallucinations-but-you-really-wont-like-it?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>regularly hallucinate</u></a> made-up nonsense,<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/visual-artists-fight-back-ai-companies-repurposing-work-rcna102760?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>plagiarize</u></a> peoples’ art, pollute the internet with disinformation and<a href="https://www.404media.co/ai-generated-boring-history-videos-are-flooding-youtube-and-drowning-out-real-history/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>low-quality content-slop</u></a>, use<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-data-centers-electricity-prices/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>multiple cities worth of electricity</u></a>, consume a preposterous amount of<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/ai-zuckerberg-tech-regulation-data-security/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>fresh water</u></a>, and have also started to induce<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ftc-complaints-chatgpt-ai-psychosis/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>novel forms of psychosis</u></a> in the people who use them. But beyond all this, perhaps the most maddening aspect of the AI trend is that it’s being forced on us.</p><p>While trying to describe this recently, I remembered the concept of the “Forced Meme,” which gained popularity on forums like 4chan and Something Awful in the mid-00s. If you’ve had the good fortune to avoid those particular cesspools of internet culture, the derisive label of Forced Meme is essentially the internet calling bullshit—usually in response to someone trying to seed an unpopular idea or unfunny joke into the online zeitgeist.</p><p>According to the long-running meme encyclopedia<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/forced-memes--2?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>KnowYourMeme</u></a>, a Forced Meme is any meme “made with the intent of becoming a meme” and which is “aggressively promoted by their creators, small dedicated groups, or companies attempting to use them for viral marketing or astroturfing.” In other words, it was internet shorthand for Regina George’s response to Gretchen: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pubd-spHN-0&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>stop trying to make “fetch” happen, it’s not going to happen</u></a>. Calling something a Forced Meme was a way of mocking others for their sad attempts to make something a Thing in the days before algorithmic social media and influencer-driven content.</p><p>With that definition in mind, here is an incomplete list of the ways tech companies have been trying to get people to adopt AI tools over the past year:</p><ul><li>Microsoft sent a memo instructing its employees to either <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ai-is-no-longer-optional-microsoft-is-allegedly-pressuring-employees-to-use-ai-tools-through-manager-evaluations/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>use the company’s AI tools or be fired</u></a>.</li><li>YouTube is now testing AI “hosts” that<a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/09/youtube-music-is-testing-ai-hosts-that-will-interrupt-your-tunes/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>interrupt your music listening</u></a> with trivia and ads.</li><li>Google told its employees to give their health information to an AI tool<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-health-tool-opt-in-risk-losing-benefits-2025-10?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>or they’d lose their healthcare benefits</u></a><u>.</u></li><li>Companies like Coca-Cola are desperately trying to normalize AI slop in ads. The soda giant said it plans to release another <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/coke-new-ai-holiday-ad-video-1236416491/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>AI-generated holiday ad this year</u></a>, despite everyone hating the last one.&nbsp;</li><li>“AI summaries” have become ubiquitous at the top of search engine results, compelling users to <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/search-engines/i-finally-figured-out-how-to-turn-off-googles-ai-overviews-and-search-is-actually-useful-again?ref=aftermath.site"><u>find loopholes to turn them off</u></a>.</li><li>Companies are embedding AI tools into the core functionality of operating systems. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-7-usage-skyrockets-as-users-refuse-to-upgrade-to-windows-11-in-wake-of-windows-10-end-of-support?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Downloads for Windows 7 jumped</u></a> after Microsoft announced the end of support for Windows 10,<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-7-usage-skyrockets-as-users-refuse-to-upgrade-to-windows-11-in-wake-of-windows-10-end-of-support?ref=aftermath.site"> </a>as some users sought to avoid upgrading to the AI-centric Windows 11.</li></ul><p>There’s a pattern here. Unlike previous tech trends like crypto and NFTs, AI boosters aren’t just making goofy attempts to convince people Generative AI is cool and useful. They’ve decided that if people aren’t going to adopt these tools willingly, they will simply bake them into things people already use and create so much friction that the average person will effectively be forced to. The end result—like so many things these days—is a tiny clique of billionaires and monied executives enriching themselves by injecting everything with over-hyped crap that most people don’t want.</p><p>There’s plenty of data to support this. Recent polls have shown that<a href="https://futurism.com/new-poll-americans-loathe-ai?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>relatively few</u></a> Americans—in one survey, as little as<a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/52615-americans-increasingly-likely-say-ai-artificial-intelligence-negatively-affect-society-poll?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>26 percent</u></a>—believe AI tools will have mostly positive impacts on society. A recent study also found that the people who are most optimistic about the technology are overwhelmingly<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00222429251314491?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>the ones who understand it the least</u></a>. This holds true within the industry itself, at least anecdotally. As countless conversations I’ve had with tech workers over the past year can attest, the average engineer doesn’t buy into the AI hype.<a href="https://www.anildash.com/2025/10/17/the-majority-ai-view/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>They are simply being forced to play along</u></a> with the cult-like, AI-maximalist delusions of tech billionaires and their cheerleaders in order to remain employed.</p><p>The Forced Meme is a useful concept not just for understanding the tech industry and its AI obsession, but as a mirror of global fascism as a whole. As a political ideology, fascism by definition depends on the use of force. Fascists seek to impose their warped reality by “flooding the zone”—overwhelming a populace both through the physical manifestation of violence and the nonstop dissemination of propaganda. Heavily-armed <a href="https://apnews.com/video/chicago-day-care-teacher-arrested-by-ice-agents-at-preschool-d97eed19e9b24afa96868745487afb70?ref=aftermath.site"><u>ICE agents kidnapping people</u></a> and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/snap-welfare-queen-ai-memes-1235460824/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>racist AI-generated videos</u></a> depicting fake Black women complaining about losing SNAP benefits work toward this same end. The goal is to destabilize and disorient political opposition by short-circuiting our ability to discern fact from fiction, which just happens to be the one thing “AI” is very good at.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image Source: </span><a href="https://nightdivestudios.com/system-shock-3/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>System Shock</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>But it’s not going as planned. Communities in cities across the country have <a href="https://documentedny.com/2025/10/24/chicago-ice-immigration-raid-whistles/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>mobilized to sabotage and confront ICE</u></a>. Artists and workers have rejected AI tools and <a href="https://subvert.fm/docs/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>built new platforms</u></a> that combat the vulgar slop they produce. It’s proof of the political shift that has defined our post-information era: The old playbooks of social control are simply no longer effective at making people like things that suck ass.</p><p>This is good news if you’re someone who hates bullshit as much as I do. The gap between our lived experience and the narratives that have been sold to us about how to live and what to believe have grown into an un-crossable chasm, ever-widened by the ubiquity of mass-communication platforms.</p><p>Whether it’s the AI bubble, the genocide in Gaza, or <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/11/andrew-cuomo-nyc-mayor-election-zohran-mamdani.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Andrew Cuomo’s 0-for-2 loss to Zohran Mamdani</u></a> in the NYC mayoral race, it’s clear that the infrastructure of consent-manufacturing the powers that be have relied on for decades has broken down. Governments and institutions also realize this. It’s why their default response has shifted to overwhelming people with disinformation and imposing their mythologies on us by force. Two years after Israel escalated its ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, polls show a<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/us-polling-israel?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>complete reversal of public opinion</u></a> on all sides of the political spectrum. The data shows that Democrats’ near-uniform and unquestioning support for Israel has<a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/198559/democratic-support-israel-single-digit-poll?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>fallen completely out of sync</u></a> with their voters, as livestreamed atrocities and on-the-ground reporting from Palestinian journalists contradicts the “official” narrative<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/turns-out-the-israelis-lied-probe-dismantles-idf-s-al-shifa-hospital-claim?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>again</u></a> and<a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-palestine-war-personnel-false-information-7-october-attack?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>again</u></a> and<a href="https://www.trtworld.com/article/1eb43ff64136?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>again</u></a>.</p><blockquote>Everything about the “AI” trend feels fake, forced, and depraved in a way that threatens to unwind our social fabric in the name of short-term gains.</blockquote><p>Mainstream media, governments, and academic institutions have responded not by including these facts and perspectives, but by doubling down on orthodoxy and purging their ranks of anyone who won’t play along. We saw this clearly in the<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/politics-elections/2025/07/22/columbia-expels-suspends-student-protesters?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>violent response to campus protests</u></a> against the genocide, which saw students expelled by school administrations, beaten by police, and<a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/04/student-protests-antisemitism-war-gaza?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>slandered by the media</u></a> as “antisemitic.” We saw it again in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s murder, where anyone who presented the fact of Kirk’s bigotry or merely quoted the numerous racist and misogynist things he’d said was targeted, doxxed, and fired by the same people who once pearl-clutched about ‘cancel culture.’ And it’s the same force driving the censorious, US-led corporate takeover of Tiktok—where queer and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/472070/democrats-sympathies-middle-east-shift-palestinians.aspx?ref=aftermath.site"><u>pro-Palestine Gen-Zers</u></a> seem to trigger every right-wing moral panic <em>du jour</em>—by Oracle, the software giant owned by pro-Trump and pro-Israel billionaire Larry Ellison.&nbsp;</p><p>In all of these cases, the Forced Memers have laid bare the aims of those in power—not to persuade people but to command them, in classic Orwellian fashion, to deny the evidence of their own eyes and ears under threat of expulsion, termination, and blacklisting.</p><p>Silicon Valley’s GenAI pushers are following this same authoritarian blueprint. Over and over, we are told that AI chatbots can solve social problems, make art, replace therapists and doctors, and even revive our dead loved ones with zombie-like digital simulacra. And time and again, the reality of these experiments has not only utterly failed to measure up to their claims, but actively threatened to make life worse for everyone. We’ve seen the <a href="https://futurism.com/woman-suicide-openai-therapist?ref=aftermath.site"><u>grisly results</u></a> of forcing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/us/openai-chatgpt-suicide-lawsuit-invs-vis?ref=aftermath.site"><u>sycophantic chatbots</u></a> to replace specialized care and human empathy. And we’ve seen the backlash to GenAI in Hollywood and the games industry, where it <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/hollywood-writers-went-on-strike-to-protect-their-livelihoods-from-generative-ai-their-remarkable-victory-matters-for-all-workers/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>became a major focus of labor strikes</u></a> as bosses seek to replace skilled workers with Silicon Valley slop machines.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image Source: </span><a href="https://nightdivestudios.com/system-shock-3/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>System Shock</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Everything about the “AI” trend feels fake, forced, and depraved in a way that threatens to unwind our social fabric in the name of short-term gains. It all feels like a massive social experiment nobody asked for, imposed on us by casino speculators taking a few final lever-pulls on the slot machine of capitalism before the whole thing comes tumbling down.</p><p>Still, I don’t think this is cause for despair. The clarity of these actions gives us an opportunity not only to reject the cruel future that tech companies and politicians claim is inevitable, but to organize and build the kind of world we actually want. Whether it’s <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democrats-election-winners-trans-rights-rcna242214?ref=aftermath.site"><u>voters rejecting the false idea</u></a> that Democrats must abandon trans people to gain political ground, or <a href="https://www.thefader.com/2025/07/29/all-artists-bands-boycotting-spotify?ref=aftermath.site"><u>artists and fans leaving AI-infested Spotify</u></a> to join new co-operatively-owned music platforms, the cognitive rupture of the Forced Meme shows us that the old tools of control are no longer working. It shows that we’re no longer buying what the people upstairs are selling, and that we can pursue our own ideas about how we want to live.</p><p>History shows that when the machinery of soft power breaks down, authoritarians always return to the ancient language of force. The more that this façade slips away, the more we realize our power to collectively reject the realities that are forced on us and create something better.</p>

<p>The Evil Empire expands</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've assumed that it would be coming our way for some time now, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a> developer Evil Empire has today finally given its slick roguelike, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, a Switch release date.</p>
<p>This one will be arriving on the eShop (for both Switch <em>and</em> Switch 2) on <strong>16th December</strong>, with a physical edition following behind on <strong>10th April 2026</strong>... albeit as a Game-Key Card.</p>
<p>We've been keeping an eye on this one ever since it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/prince-of-persia-roguelite-from-dead-cells-dev-revealed-switch-not-confirmed">first revealed</a> early last year, but just in case it hasn't popped up on your radar yet, here's a brief rundown of what you can expect.</p>
<p>The Rogue Prince of Persia is a roguelike that mixes stylish platforming action with build-based combat. You can expect procedurally-generated levels, over 100 different weapons and medallions to power-up your build, and lots (we mean <em>lots</em>) of Dead Cells-style retries.</p>
<p>We've included some pictures of the platforming action below, so you can get an idea of what you can expect.</p>

<p>After a time in early access, this one launched on Steam, PS5 and Xbox Series earlier this year. It has since racked up over 1,000 '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2717880/The_Rogue_Prince_of_Persia/#app_reviews_hash">Very Positive</a>' reviews on PC, so let's hope that the Switch's portability promise can keep the good times coming when it arrives for us next month.</p>

			<p>Epic Games has been involved in intense <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-returns-to-iphone-in-australia-after-epic-games-wins-legal-battle-against-apple-and-google-marking-major-shift-in-app-store-rules-and-player-freedom/">legal battles with both Apple</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-wins-landmark-anticompetitive-lawsuit-against-google-with-unanimous-verdict/">Google for years now</a>, though last week, it seemed like this era of Epic's battles with Google was coming to an end. The two sides <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-google-finally-reach-settlement-open-android-platform-lower-service-fees/">reached a settlement last week</a> that seemed to please everyone involved, and all that was left was for the presiding judge, Judge James Donato, to slap his stamp of approval on the deal.</p>



<p>In the proposed settlement, the Android platform would become more open, and Google would lower its service fees for Google Play. Epic Games chief executive officer, Tim Sweeney, called the settlement "<em></em><em>a comprehensive solution</em>" to the dispute and would have definitively concluded the legal battle between the two.</p>



<p>Except Judge James Donato is not exactly convinced that he can approve this settlement, and has a few lingering concerns, including a concern around why Epic and Google, after years of legal vitriol back and forth, "<em>are suddenly BFFs</em>."</p>



<p>Reported by <a href="https://80.lv/articles/epic-games-google-settlement-under-review-as-us-judge-raises-concerns">80 Level</a>, Judge Donato's concern, besides the fact that the two juggernaut companies suddenly seem like best friends, is that the proposed settlement does not reach the legal threshold needed for Judge Donato to revise a court ruling.</p>



<p>"<em>The only changed circumstance that I can see right now is Epic and Google - two mortal enemies who pounded each other relentlessly in this courtroom for many years - are suddenly BFFs</em>," said Donato, per 80 Level.</p>



<p>Another hearing has been set for sometime between December 2025 and January 2026, giving Judge Donato time to review the proposed settlement and its potential implications, should he approve it as it currently is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Valve has just announced its biggest hardware push that it’s arguably ever made — a living room game console called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">the Steam Machine</a>, a headset called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">the Steam Frame</a>, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">long-awaited sequel</a> to its Steam Controller <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022">it hinted about three years back</a>.</p></div><p>But Valve won’t say the first word about its next gaming handheld, the Steam Deck 2.</p><p>“Steam Deck is not what we’re here to talk about today,” Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais told us at the very beginning of our briefing. “It’s sort of related but not really,” he said, before launching into a discussion of how the Steam Deck’s learnings underpinned every new product that it’s announcing today.</p><p>The company wouldn’t tell us if the new drift-resistant TMR joysticks it’s introducing in the Steam Controller and Steam Frame’s wands will make it into a future Steam Deck, either. “We’re always thinking about Steam Deck and ways to improve it in the future,” says Valve hardware engineer Steve Cardinali when I ask. (He also says Valve currently has no plans to offer the TMR joysticks as a drop-in module for the original Deck.)</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET. Drop your questions <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818113/valve-steam-frame-machine-controller-vr-headset-pc-ask-us-anything-ama">here</a> and we’ll do our best to answer them.</p></blockquote></div></div><p>While Valve has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/25/23322516/valve-steam-deck-long-term-vision-digital-book-ebook-booklet">repeatedly confirmed</a> that the Steam Deck will have sequels, the company’s also repeatedly been clear that it’s in no hurry to bring them to market. Since 2022, Griffais <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022">has consistently</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">told us</a> that Valve wants to see a significant leap in performance and efficiency before it takes the plunge. “We really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck,” is how Valve’s Lawrence Yang concisely <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/">reiterated it to <em>Reviews.org</em></a> in 2024.</p><p>The question now is: Will Valve find that leap in performance and efficiency from x86? Because while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview#:~:text=But%20Coomer%20did%20light%20up">Valve initially thought</a> its standalone VR headset might run on the existing Steam Deck’s chip, the company just announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">the Steam Frame</a> with an Arm processor instead — using emulation to let it play some Windows games locally on the headset. Griffais tells me he thinks Arm has “a lot of potential” in future handhelds someday.</p><p>Valve tells us the Frame has a lower performance target than the nearly four-year-old Steam Deck, so it would need a far more potent Arm chip to power such a handheld. Qualcomm, in particular, has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631005/qualcomm-snapdragon-g3-gen-3-onexsugar-handheld-ayaneo-pocket">working on Arm chips for handhelds</a>, though, and one of its customers for the latest was even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/711116/onexsugar-sugar-1-hands-on-preview-transforming-dual-screen#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cvery%20interesting%E2%80%9D%20to%20discuss%20a%20potential%20SteamOS%20handheld.">interested in discussing a possible SteamOS handheld</a> with Valve.</p><p>It’s also possible Valve already found its next Steam Deck chip in AMD’s future roadmaps — like it did with the original Steam Deck — and is simply waiting for it to arrive.</p><div><p>None of that necessarily means you should expect <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818313/valve-has-no-news-about-a-steam-deck-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an Arm-based Steam Deck 2 just yet</a>, though.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/818313/valve-has-no-news-about-a-steam-deck-2]]></content:encoded>

Customize it with different colors and animations. Or turn it off!</p><p><strong>Optimized for Gaming…</strong></p><ul><li><strong>It Runs SteamOS</strong> – Steam Machine runs Valve’s gaming-first operating system. SteamOS is designed to provide a plug-and-play user experience, while keeping the power and flexibility of a <a title="Platforms > PC [24,757 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>. <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> SteamOS in the same way as other Steam hardware, like Steam Deck and Steam Frame.</li><li><strong>Steam Machine Verified</strong> – We are expanding our Verified program to include ratings for Steam Machine, so customers can understand how their games will run.</li></ul><p><strong>…and it’s a PC</strong></p><p>Yes, Steam Machine is optimized for gaming, but it’s still your PC. Install your own apps, or even another operating system. Who are we to tell you how to use your computer?</p><p><strong>Steam Machine Plays Well, Wherever Steam is</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Made for Steam Controller</strong> – Steam Machine comes with a built-in wireless adapter, just for pairing with Steam Controller. (Up to four with a single adapter!) This means you can pair your Steam Controller without its puck, and you can wake your Steam Machine without leaving your couch.</li><li><strong>Great for Streaming</strong> – With enough horsepower to take on the most demanding games, Steam Machine is the perfect host PC for streaming to other devices. Easily stream to your Steam Deck, Steam Frame, or any other device running Steam or Steam Link.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>SteamOS</strong> – An OS optimized for gaming, with fast suspend/resume, and cloud saves. And that’s just the start.</li><li><strong>Small Form Factor</strong> – Put it under your TV. Set it on your desk. Hide it under a banana. It’s powerful PC gaming packed into a roughly 6-inch (~160mm) cube.</li><li><strong>Cool and Quiet</strong> – Steam Machine keeps cool and runs whisper-quiet, even while running the most demanding games.</li><li><strong>I/O for Days</strong> – Ready for all the peripherals and monitors you can throw* at it: 1 Gigabit Ethernet. DisplayPort 1.4. HDMI 2.0. One USB-C and four USB-A ports. *But, like, don’t actually throw things at it.</li><li><strong>CPU and GPU</strong> – 4K gaming at 60 frames per second with FSR, thanks to a discrete semi-custom AMD desktop class CPU and GPU.</li><li><strong>Storage</strong> – Available in two storage sizes: 512GB and 2TB. Both come with expandable storage via microSD.</li><li><strong>Connectivity</strong> – 2×2 Wi-Fi 6E, plus Bluetooth 5.3 with a dedicated antenna. Steam Controller’s wireless adapter is built right into Steam Machine for direct pairing.</li><li><strong>Power</strong> – No giant brick!

Step into immersive VR, or lean back and enjoy your non-VR catalog. And it supports stand-alone play too.</p><p><strong>Designed for Comfort. Easy to Use</strong></p><p>The Steam Frame headset is lightweight and compact, with the weight balanced front-to-rear for a comfortable experience. It’s also easy to just slip on and play, with no wires and no setup.</p><p><strong>A High Quality Streaming-First Experience</strong></p><p>Streaming can be highly variable, so we prioritized making Steam Frame a stable, high quality streaming experience.</p><ul><li><strong>Wireless Adapter and Dual Radios</strong> – The included plug-and-play 6GHz wireless adapter provides a dedicated link for both VR and non-VR streaming. Steam Frame’s dual radios make this connection even more stable: One radio is dedicated to streaming the audio and visuals, and the other connects to your Wi-Fi. Two dedicated links, no competition for bandwidth.</li><li><strong>Introducing Foveated Streaming</strong> – Foveated Streaming is a new feature that optimizes detail where your eyes are looking, and typically offers over a 10x improvement in image quality and effective bandwidth. Behind the scenes, we’re using low-latency eye tracking data to steer the best quality pixels only to where you’re looking. This is all happening without you noticing, and works for your entire Steam library.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Jump Right Into Your Games</strong> – Just wake up the headset, and you’re gaming. No fuss, no setup; just games</li><li><strong>Who Wants Pancakes?</strong> – Thin and light custom pancake lenses provide edge-to-edge sharpness and a large eye box. Optics feature 2160 x 2160 LCD panels, one per eye. Supported refresh rates are 72-144Hz.</li><li><strong>Seamless Audio Experience</strong> – Steam Frame has high fidelity audio via dual stereo speakers on each side. The speakers within each pair are oriented in opposite directions to cancel out vibrations, which can be a tracking system buzzkill.</li><li><strong>Camera Tracking</strong> – No setup required. Four high-resolution, monochrome cameras provide controller and headset tracking. Infrared LEDs on the outside make tracking great even in dark environments.</li><li><strong>Controllers for All Your Games</strong> – Hop between your VR and non-VR games. Steam Frame Controllers are designed with a split gamepad layout to work with your whole Steam library.</li><li><strong>The VR Inputs You’d Expect…</strong> – Steam Frame controllers are tracked in space by the headset, and come with all the inputs needed for your VR games. Capacitive finger tracking enhances immersion. These controls are fully backwards compatible and support the full SteamVR catalog.</li><li><strong>…And Inputs for Non-VR Games, Too</strong> – The Steam Frame controllers also have all the familiar inputs you need to play non-VR games: D-pad, ABXY, thumbsticks, triggers, and bumpers, all right where you’d expect them.</li><li><strong>Magnetic Thumbsticks</strong> – Steam Frame includes next-generation magnetic thumbsticks for precision and capacitive finger sensing. These are the same thumbsticks included in Steam Controller.</li><li><strong>Easy Battery Access</strong> – Each Steam Frame controller runs on a single AA battery, offering ~40 hours of play time.</li></ul><p><strong>Supports Standalone Play, Too</strong></p><p>Steam Frame is a PC, and runs SteamOS powered by a Snapdragon 8 Series Processor. With 16GB of RAM, Steam Frame supports stand-alone play on a growing number of both VR and non-VR games without needing to stream from your PC.</p><p><strong>Steam Frame is a PC</strong></p><ul><li><strong>It Runs SteamOS</strong> – Quick suspend / resume. Cloud saves. All the features of SteamOS that make for a great user experience are now available in VR. Just like any SteamOS device, install your own apps, open a browser, do what you want: It’s your PC.</li><li><strong>Steam Frame Verified, for Standalone Games</strong> – Just like Steam Deck and Steam Machine, Steam Frame will have a verified program that helps you see which games in your library (VR and non-VR) will work stand-alone.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, There’s a Developer Kit!</strong></p><p>Hi devs! We want a great experience on Steam Frame for as many Steam games as possible, whether it’s via streaming or stand-alone. We’re opening up a Steam Frame Developer Kit program to help.</p><p>The more developers with Steam Frames in hand, the more feedback we can grab; and the better we can make Proton and SteamOS and improve compatibility for the entire Steam library. You can request a Steam Frame developer kit in your Steam partner dashboard. Supplies are limited, but we will be sending out kits on an ongoing basis.</p><p><strong>Steam Frame Plays Well, Wherever Steam Is</strong></p><p>Your Steam Frame headset easily pairs with your Steam Controller; you’ll even see a virtual Steam Controller floating in your VR space. Stream from your PC, laptop, Steam Deck or Steam Machine for an immersive experience with any of your favorite games.</p><p><strong>Headset Technical Specifications</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan="2">General</th></tr><tr><td>Processor</td><td>4 nm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3<br>Architecture: ARM64</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB Unified LPDDR5X RAM</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>256GB / 1TB UFS storage options<br>microSD card slot for expanded storage</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td><a title="Games > Recharge" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/recharge">Recharge</a>able 21.6 Wh Li-ion battery<br>One USB-C 2.0 port in the rear, for charging and data<br>Charge with USB-C, 45W</td></tr><tr><td>Modular Headstrap</td><td>Headstrap includes integrated dual audio drivers and and rechargeable battery on rear.<br>Headstrap weight: 245g<br>Core module can be separated from headstrap, for other headstrap solutions.</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">Connectivity</th></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi</td><td>2×2 Wi-Fi 6E</td></tr><tr><td>Bluetooth</td><td>Bluetooth 5.3 dedicated antenna</td></tr><tr><td>Steam Controller</td><td>Integrated 2.4 GHz Steam Controller wireless adapter</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">Display and Optics</th></tr><tr><td>Display</td><td>2160 x 2160 LCD (per eye)<br>72-144Hz refresh rate (144Hz experimental)</td></tr><tr><td>Optics</td><td>Custom pancake lenses<br>Glass and non-glass optical elements<br>Large FOV (up to 110 degrees)</td></tr><tr><td>IPD Target Range</td><td>60mm – 70mm</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Glasses Max Width</td><td>140mm</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">Cameras and Tracking</th></tr><tr><td>Tracking</td><td>Inside-out camera based tracking</td></tr><tr><td>Cameras</td><td>4x outward facing monochrome cameras for controller and headset tracking<br>2x interior cameras for eye tracking and foveated streaming</td></tr><tr><td>Passthrough</td><td>Monochrome passthrough via outward facing cameras</td></tr><tr><td>Low-Light Support</td><td>IR illuminators for tracking and passthrough in dark environments</td></tr><tr><td>Expansion</td><td>User accessible front expansion port<br>Dual high speed camera interface (8 lanes at 2.5Gbps MIPI) / PCIe Gen 4 interface (1-lane)</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">Connectivity</th></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi</td><td>Wi-Fi 7, 2×2<br>Dual radios enable concurrent 5Ghz Wi-Fi and 6Ghz VR streaming</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless Adapter</td><td>Wireless adapter included in the box<br>Wi-Fi 6E (6GHz)<br>Provides direct, low-latency link between headset and PC</td></tr><tr><td>Bluetooth</td><td>Bluetooth 5.3</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">Audio</th></tr><tr><td>Speakers</td><td>Dual speaker drivers per ear, integrated into headstrap</td></tr><tr><td>Microphone</td><td>Dual microphone array</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">Size and Weight</th></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>175mm x 95mm x 110mm (core module + facial interface)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>440 g – core module + headstrap<br>185 g – core module</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">Software</th></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>SteamOS 3 (Arch-based)</td></tr><tr><td>Desktop</td><td>KDE Plasma</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Controller Technical Specifications</strong></p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan="2">Controls and Input</th></tr><tr><td>Motion Controls</td><td>Full 6-DOF tracking and IMU support</td></tr><tr><td>Gamepad Controls</td><td>A B X Y buttons (right controller)<br>D-pad (left controller)<br>Full-size magnetic thumbsticks (TMR) with capacitive touch<br>L &amp; R analog triggers<br>L &amp; R bumpers<br>View / Menu / Steam buttons<br>Dual stage grip buttons</td></tr><tr><td>Haptics</td><td>Haptic motor in each controller</td></tr><tr><td>Finger Tracking</td><td>Capacitive sensing for all input surfaces<br>Capacitive finger tracking</td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">General</th></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi</td><td>2.4ghz link to dedicated headset radio</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>126mm x 73mm x 87mm per controller</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>With battery 130 g per controller<br>Without battery 107 g per controller</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>One replaceable AA battery per controller<br>40hr battery life</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span>Steam Controller</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Steam-Hardware_11-12-25_Steam-Controller.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Play Your Whole Steam Library</strong></p><p>Built for Steam, and configurable with Steam Input.

                <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and French developer Oh BiBi have announced Ratchet &amp; Clank: Ranger Rumble, a free-to-play multiplayer arena shooter coming to iOS and Android. Fans can now pre-register for the game through <a href="https://www.rangerrumble.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official website</a>. It's been four years since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-a-riveting-adventure/1900-6417686/" data-ref-id="1900-6417686">the last Ratchet and Clank game</a>, and this takes the duo into the mobile gaming space for the first time in years, offering a new way for players to experience its well-known humor and action.</p><p>Ranger Rumble brings back familiar characters from the Ratchet &amp; Clank universe in a fast-paced, real-time multiplayer format. Players can choose to fight solo or team up with others in exciting online matches. Each hero comes with unique abilities and access to a variety of powerful, over-the-top weapons. The game aims to capture the fun and energy of the series while introducing gameplay designed specifically for mobile devices.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlblXRS14Mg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AlblXRS14Mg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This release aligns with PlayStation's broader strategy to expand its presence in the mobile market. In 2021, former PlayStation president Jim Ryan mentioned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-mobile-games-might-be-coming-sony-exec-says/1100-6491989/" data-ref-id="1100-6491989">that mobile gaming was one of the company's key growth areas</a>, noting that PlayStation planned to bring some of its most popular franchises to mobile platforms.</p><p>It's unclear how Ranger Rumble will fit into the overall Ratchet &amp; Clank narrative, if at all. The last entry in the franchise, 2021's Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, was one of the best-received games in the series, but was also a standalone story.</p>

<p>Valve says the Steam Machine is over six times more powerful than the Steam Deck, and can play all of your Steam library – just sign in with your Steam account via the device and you're set. It features SteamOS, an "OS optimized for gaming, with fast suspend/resume, and cloud saves," and it's all packed into a small form factor roughly the size of a 6-inch cube. The company says it keeps itself cool, is whisper-quiet, and can handle any peripherals you attach to it thanks to a 1 Gigabit Ethernet port, DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0, one USB-C port, and four USB-A ports.&nbsp;</p><p>As for what's happening inside the Machine, Valve says you can expect 4K gaming at 60 FPS with FSR, thanks to a semi-custom AMD desktop-class CPU and GPU, and it will come in either a 512GB or 2TB storage capacity. However, both can be expanded via a microSD. In terms of connectivity, the Steam Machine has 2x2 Wi-Fi 6E plus Bluetooth 5.3 with a dedicated antenna. The Steam Controller's wireless adapter is built right into the cube, too, which Valve says makes for easy pairing. And finally, the Steam Machine's power supply is built in, so there's no large power brick.&nbsp;</p><p>An LED strip along the bottom of the cube lets you keep an eye on system status, such as download progress, even when the screen is off. You can change the colors and animations, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Valve says it is expanding its Verified program (for Steam Deck) to include ratings for Steam Machine "so customers can understand how their games will run." Also, despite functioning like a plug-and-play console, it's still a PC, so you can install your own apps or a completely different operating system, if you want.&nbsp;</p><h2>Steam Controller</h2>

<p>The new Steam Controller has been built for Steam and is configurable with Steam Input, allowing you to use it on a PC, a laptop, the Steam Deck, the Steam Machine, and even the Steam Frame. It comes with the Steam Controller Puck, which is both a wireless transmitter that "provides a fast, stable connection for your Steam Controller" and is also a charging station that connects to the controller magnetically. You can still use Bluetooth or USB, if you prefer, though.&nbsp;</p><p>Valve says the Steam Controller features magnetic thumbsticks with TMR technology, "designed for improved feel, responsiveness, and long-term reliability." Plus, they support capacitive touch for motion controls, and the entire controller features high-definition rumble and a grip-enabled gyro.&nbsp;</p><p>It features all the other usual controller features like thumbsticks, buttons, bumpers, and triggers designed for comfort, motion controls, grip buttons, the Steam button, a quick menu access button, and even trackpads like those seen on the Steam Deck. It's due out sometime in early 2026, though Valve didn't reveal a specific release date or the device's cost.&nbsp;</p><h2>Steam Frame</h2>

<p>The final new piece of Steam hardware Valve revealed today is the Steam Frame, a "VR and non-VR" gaming device. Valve calls it a streaming-first, wireless VR headset that includes unique controllers, and the entire package "can handle your whole Steam library.&nbsp;</p><p>"Step into immersive VR, or lean back and enjoy your non-VR catalog," Valve writes on the announcement page. "And it supports stand-alone, too. The Steam Frame headset is lightweight and compact, with the weight balanced front-to-rear for a comfortable experience. It's also easy to just slip on and play, with no wires and no setup."&nbsp;</p><p>With the included plug-and-play 6GHz wireless adapter, you can play both VR and non-VR games via streaming, and the device includes something Valve calls "Foveated Streaming," which optimizes details based on where your eyes are looking. Like the Steam Deck and Steam Machine, Valve is expanding its Verified program to include Steam Frame as well.&nbsp;</p><p>It's due out sometime in early 2026, though Valve didn't reveal any specific release date or price.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What are your thoughts on all this new hardware? Let us know in the comments below!</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/12/valve-announces-console-like-steam-machine-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-new-steam]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Quarantine Zone may not be released in November, according to an update from developer Brigada Games, but the studio is still aiming for a 2025 release. The change to the release date has come due to feedback from players who are testing Quarantine Zone in a closed playtest, and that feedback has led to the team needing to make changes before release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Quarantine Zone: The Last Check | Demo Gameplay Trailer | Demo releases on May 22nd, 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kH06uTaVMTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Brigada Games wrote, <em>“Hello, everyone! Some of you have seen that info on our Steam page was first changed from November to simply 2025. Currently we are running a closed playtest and while it is ongoing – us (the developer team) and the publisher will determine the exact release date but as of yesterday we’re still working toward a 2025 release. We might require some extra time to polish the game, thanks to the copius amount of feedback we are receiving and processing at the moment. The decision on the exact release date and price will be made soon, and we will update everyone the moment it is made. We apologize for the uncertainty but rest assured we’re furiously working on the game, taking in feedback, and working to figure out the best release date to get you all into Quarantine Zone!”</em></p>
<p>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is set in a world that is facing a zombie outbreak, and you are a checkpoint guard. Your job is to stop anyone infected with the zombie virus, as well as anyone carrying contraband, from passing your checkpoint to a safe zone. Fail and it could lead to catastrophe. As a guard, players are equipped with scanners to detect the virus, but other resources are limited so decisions will need to be made to keep the camp safe.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-yakuza-kiwami-switch-2-kiryus-debut-smoother-than-ever.1351621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It only feels like yesterday that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yakuza_kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> finally made its way onto the Switch, and yet here we are with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">a beefed-up Switch 2 version</a>. This new release is effectively the same game, but Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have taken advantage of the newer console’s specs for a much smoother, crisper experience.</p>
<p>Crucially, the frame rate has been greatly improved here, sticking to 60fps that (to my eyes, at least) never falters. It makes exploring Kamurocho all the more enjoyable, and even the busiest scraps with Yakuza thugs run smoothly. The resolution has been bumped up considerably in docked and handheld, bringing it more in line with launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a>. It looks wonderful.</p>
<p>And yes, the game itself is still the same, which, in my opinion, is a good thing. There’s really nothing else quite like Yakuza, except maybe, well… other Yakuza games. You’ve got this super-compelling narrative at its core involving backstabbing criminals, corrupt politicians, and devoted friends that succumb to darkness, and it does a great job at keeping you engaged with superb Japanese voice performances (no Western dub here, though).</p>
<p>It’s stuffed with utterly ridiculous moments that, in anything else, would undoubtedly detract from the overarching plot, but it just works so well here. You can play bowling, pool, darts, and even sing karaoke. The juxtaposition between the serious narrative and the ludicrous sidequests is sublime – it’s just such a <em>video game</em>.</p>
<p>A lot of the focus is on melee combat, and with the combination of several distinct fighting styles with the option to purchase a plethora of upgrades throughout, it never quite loses its edge. Swapping between Rush, Brawler, Beast, and Dragon styles provides ample variety, and if you don’t fancy using your fists, you can always just pick up a bicycle and smash it into your foes' faces. Lovely stuff.</p>
<p>Some aspects can be a little grating, for sure. Boss fights go on for a little too long at times, while the overall pacing isn’t quite as satisfying as the aforementioned Yakuza 0. This is fundamentally a 2016 remake of a 2005 game, and the developers have taken great strides in subsequent years to polish the series further and ditch the features and mechanics that don’t <em>quite</em> work.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I’d still recommend starting with Yakuza 0 if you’re completely new to the series, but Kiwami is a perfectly fine place to dive in, too. It doesn’t feel quite so bloated as some of the later entries, yet it still flexes a peerless sense of style at every opportunity. Playing Kiwami portably on Switch 2 is a joy, and I sincerely hope Sega brings the entire series to the console. It’s found itself a great home.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>developer Embark Studios has revealed that it intends to lower the price of some of the extraction shooter's cosmetics soon, and that Duo-prioritized matchmaking has already been "silently tested and enabled".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> addressing some of the community's most common concerns, Embark says that its new system first prioritizes solo and squad players to play with those of their own kind, then "Duos to play with other Duos" and "Trios to play with Trios".</p>

<p>However, Embark says that the new system is "not 100% guaranteed", so it's possible you'll still find yourself running into "differing constellations of players other than your own". Still, given that this is one of the community's <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-players-plead-with-embark-studios-to-make-a-duos-mode-but-not-all-fans-of-the-new-shooter-are-convinced-this-game-isnt-meant-to-be-a-balanced-team-death-match/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">most-requested features</a>, it's a nice tip of the hat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arc-raiders-duos-cosmetics-aiming.jpg?itok=l6M-XOE4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arc-raiders-duos-cosmetics-aiming.jpg?itok=xVuNPjSs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>will now try to put Duos with other Duos in games.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as making things a little easier for duos, Embark says it will also lower the price of some of&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>' cosmetic items after hearing players' "feedback" on the matter.</p>

<p>The studio says it's "reviewed [its] prices and made adjustments to lower prices where applicable", and that new cosmetic item prices will come into effect tomorrow at 10:30 CET (that's around 4:30am Eastern).</p>

<p>If you've already bought the cosmetics in question, then you'll be compensated for the difference, with the Raider Tokens you've spent being "refunded back into your account automatically in the coming week".</p>

<p>Embark also says it will start to introduce new Raider Decks in the future, and that some of those decks will be paid, but that gameplay items will only be in free decks and that "no pay to win items" will be featured in premium decks.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders&nbsp;</em>is, it's a post-apocalyptic extraction shooter in which players must contend with deadly mechs and squads of other players as they loot areas and attempt to escape.</p>

<p>After multiple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-delay-pushes-release-date-to-2023" rel="nofollow">delays</a>, the game was released in late October, quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" rel="nofollow">racking up millions of sales</a>&nbsp;within the first two weeks of its launch.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-steam-frame-is-a-surprising-new-twist-on-vr.1351609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve is about to launch a new virtual reality headset, and with it, a comprehensive new approach to what a VR device should be. Most VR headsets I’ve tried have ended up collecting dust after the novelty wore off, and I thought I had sworn off VR for good. But after trying Valve’s new headset for myself at the company’s headquarters, I was nearly ready to put down my credit card before I walked out the door.</p><p>The new headset is called the Steam Frame, and it’s trying to do several things at once. It’s a standalone VR headset with a smartphone-caliber Arm chip inside that lets you play flat-screen Windows games locally off the onboard storage or a microSD card. But the Frame’s arguably bigger trick is that it can <em>stream</em> games directly to the headset, bypassing your unreliable home Wi-Fi by using a short-range, high-bandwidth wireless dongle that plugs into your gaming PC. And its new controllers are packed with all the buttons and inputs you need for both flat-screen games <em>and</em> VR games.</p><p>The pitch: Either locally or over streaming, you can play every game in your Steam library on this lightweight headset, no cord required. I think Valve may be on to something.</p><p>As I explored an industrial level in <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, jumping from floor to floor and blasting headcrabs, I couldn’t tell at all that the game was being streamed to me from a nearby PC. I felt like I was playing it through a hardwired connection or natively on the headset itself.</p><p>The dongle, which comes in the box with the headset, streams your games over 6GHz spectrum — that’s its only job. It means that the experience has “low latency, high bandwidth, and lots of robustness,” Valve hardware engineer Jeremy Selan tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>When you’re streaming, to make what you’re looking at appear sharp and with low latency, the Frame uses a technique Valve calls “foveated streaming.”</p><p>You might be familiar with foveated <em>rendering</em>, which, in VR, enhances what’s directly in front of your eyes and lowers the resolution in your peripheral vision to optimize the performance of a headset. With foveated <em>streaming</em>, the Frame instead uses its two eye-tracking cameras to make it easier to sling compressed images from your PC. “Anywhere the user is looking, we spend as many bits as possible to give them a very high-fidelity, super-high-quality representation of where they’re looking, and we’ve borrowed those bits from everywhere else in the image,” Selan says.</p><p>It’s “always on and always active,” so game developers don’t have to do anything to make it work. The headset checks the position of your eyes more than 80 times a second.</p><p>At one point, Valve staffers entered a special command that placed a square in front of wherever my eyes were focused. While it was on, I couldn’t tell that the bits around the square were lower-fidelity, and as I whipped my eyes all over the virtual room, the square kept up without any discernible lag.</p><p>It was extremely impressive, and it means that, depending on your PC, the Frame could let you play high-end VR games on a light headset. The Frame weighs 440 grams with the headset and battery strap, roughly half as much as the approximately 809-gram Valve Index, which, unlike the Frame, also needed to be physically wired to a PC. Valve’s headset is also lighter than the 560-gram PSVR 2 and the 515-gram Meta Quest 3.</p><p>It’s nice to wear right out of the box, too, with an especially plush and silky face cushion and well-balanced counterweight thanks to the battery being placed on the back of the head strap. The strap also contains speakers — two per side, Valve says, spaced apart so they can cancel out their own vibrations before they affect the headset’s positioning sensors.</p><p>The comfort might come at the cost of performance, though. While it might seem like a Steam Deck for your face, the Frame won’t hit Steam Deck-levels of performance and battery when you’re playing on its own lightweight Arm system.</p><p>The Frame runs SteamOS on a last-generation phone chip, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it has to recompile Windows x86 game code on the fly using an emulator, named Fex, to let titles run on Arm. Valve is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame">welcoming Android games into Steam</a> so you can play on the Frame, too — and you’ll be able to sideload APKs as well, the company <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWUxObt1efQ">confirmed to <em>Gamers Nexus</em></a>.) And at 21.6 watt-hours, the Frame’s battery is about half the capacity of an original Steam Deck, though you can plug any sufficiently powerful USB-C battery (45W) into the headset to extend its life. Valve is working to make streaming battery life “as efficient as possible,” Selan says, though playing six hours of <em>Hades II</em> over streaming would be “unlikely.”</p><p>In one demo, I played the standard x86 version of <em>Hades II</em> installed on the Frame on a big, 2D virtual theater screen, and I noticed a couple small gameplay stutters I never see on my Steam Deck or my Nintendo Switch 2. In a later demo of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, I noticed more stutters right away — and to my surprise, a Valve employee brought them up proactively, calling them “hitches.”</p><p>According to Valve hardware engineer Gabe Rowe, the company plans to let you download preconverted versions of the code when you start up a game to help get rid of those hitches, similar to how the Steam Deck downloads precompiled shaders for many games before you even launch them.</p><p>Right now, the performance in those games felt a little worrying, and I didn’t get to try anything that might tax the headset even further. However, Selan told us after our visit that the choppiness we saw was actually a bug and that Valve expects performance and stability to improve leading up to and after launch.</p><p>Valve is also planning a Steam Frame Verified program, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22947274/steam-deck-verified-playable-compatibility-games-feature">the Steam Deck Verified program</a> that adds green checkmark on the Steam store pages of games that play well on the Steam Deck with no modifications, so you can know which games run well locally.</p><p>But playing games locally isn’t the main point of the device — it’s mostly designed for streaming.</p><p>“Steam Frame is a wireless streaming headset, first and foremost,” designer Lawrence Yang tells <em>The Verge</em>. “That is what we’ve optimized a lot of things and a lot of decisions around, not only for hardware, but also in terms of software.”</p><p>Assuming Valve gets the issues worked out, the Frame could be a decent place to locally play lower-end games. Most of the time, it seems like you’re going to want to stream your games from a PC to the headset instead.</p><p>Regardless of how you boot up your games on the Frame, its two new included controllers should give you everything you need to actually play them. Between the controllers, you have access to two drift-resistant TMR joysticks, a D-pad, four face buttons, two bumpers, and two shoulder triggers, all of which should serve you well for flat-screen games. For more immersive VR games, the controllers also have two triggers on the grips and enough sensors to enable five-finger capacitive sensing. The controllers run off of AA batteries, and Valve says they can get up to 40 hours of battery life. (The headset supports Valve’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">new Steam Controller</a>, too.)</p><p>Valve isn’t sharing a price for the Frame yet. The company plans to reveal that in early 2026, and it’s only telling us that it’s targeting a price that’s less than an Index — Valve’s previous headset, which cost $999. But there are other hints that Valve’s new headset won’t be as expensive as competitors.</p><p>While the Frame does have pancake lenses with an up-to-110-degree field of view and LCD screens with a 2160 x 2160 per eye resolution, that’s no longer class-leading. The Frame offers monochrome passthrough, but Apple’s and Samsung’s expensive headsets have more impressive micro-OLED displays and <em>color</em> passthrough, which can help with more immersive mixed reality experiences. Even the $299.99 Meta Quest 3S has color passthrough and outward IR illuminators so it can track in dark rooms.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>A Steam Frame prototype with a clear case. Valve isn’t selling this version, unfortunately.</em></figcaption> <cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The Frame’s four outward-facing monochrome cameras and IR illuminator seem to provide excellent tracking, though in a brief demo, the black-and-white passthrough view wasn’t useful for much except getting a general idea of my surroundings. Rowe says sticking with monochrome passthrough was an intentional choice because color passthrough would have added to the Frame’s price. “The core focus of the device is the gaming,” Rowe says.</p><p>For those who want color passthrough and other changes to the headset, Valve has made its headset modular, including a dedicated expansion port in the nose piece designed to support extra cameras. The expansion port offers 2.5Gbps of bandwidth via MIPI and one lane of PCIe data.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve is about to challenge the Xbox and PlayStation on their home turf. Ten years to the month after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9705234/valve-steam-machines-controller-link-launch">Valve’s original Steam Machines</a> went on sale, the company is announcing… the Steam Machine.</p><p>I flew to Valve’s headquarters to try the company’s new PC-based game console, alongside a brand-new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">Steam Controller</a> and the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Steam Frame</a> gaming headset. It’s the culmination of Valve’s hardware and software efforts over the last decade, and it looks a lot like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">leaks that have been coming out over the past year</a>.</p><p>Here’s what the new Steam Machine is all about.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="the-promise"><h2>The promise</h2></p></div><p>Shipping early 2026 in every region where the Steam Deck is sold today, Valve’s new living room box is best thought of as a far more powerful, stationary version of the same technology. It’s a 6-inch cube that runs Windows games, but without Windows at the helm. Like the Steam Deck, it runs Valve’s Linux-based SteamOS operating system, using a compatibility layer called Proton to make games <em>think</em> they’re running on Windows and translate their API calls.</p><div><p>If that sounds like a huge compromise, you should know that countless happy Steam Deck users disagree. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc">The Steam Deck has dramatically outsold Windows handhelds</a> through word of mouth alone, because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/807711/xbox-ally-sleep-fail-bazzite-fix-performance">Linux now runs Windows games better than Windows</a>, and because Windows is <em>far</em> from the Steam Deck’s pick-up-and-play console experience. I’ve heard many lapsed gamers say the Steam Deck brought them back.</p></div><p>But the Steam Machine has two things the Steam Deck does not: raw power, and the promise that you’ll never be waiting around for a game to update. “The Steam Machine has the ability to keep all your software, your OS, your games, and your cloud saves updated in the background … so the games are always ready for you to play,” says Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat.</p><p>While the Steam Deck is more powerful than a Nintendo Switch, it’s nowhere near a PS5. Big-budget games are beginning to leave it behind, and even the Nintendo Switch 2 can provide better 4K-upscaled TV graphics <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/703058/steam-deck-vs-switch-2-power-performance">in its docked mode</a>.</p><p>The Steam Machine is Valve’s answer, bringing the Deck experience to your TV with far more powerful guts. Valve says it offers six times the power of a Steam Deck, and it looks like it’ll offer at least PS5-level performance and possibly beat the PS5 Pro.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="two-chips-for-ps5-plus-performance"><h2>Two chips for PS5-plus performance</h2></p></div><p>Under the hood, you get not one but two AMD chips along with 16GB of DDR5 RAM: The CPU is a six-core AMD Zen 4 chip with up to 30 watts of headroom and 4.8GHz boost, while the graphics are a semi-custom discrete AMD RDNA 3 “Navi 33” GPU, with 28 compute units, up to 130-watt TDP, and 8GB of GDDR6 memory. These are unusual components for a gaming PC, but they might work well together!</p><div><p>While the former sounds a lot like <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/8000-series/amd-ryzen-5-8540u.html">the entry-level AMD Ryzen 5 8540U laptop chip</a>, right down to its two big cores and four small ones, there’s no direct equivalent to that GPU: the closest are AMD’s <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Radeon-RX-7600M-XT-vs-Radeon-RX-7700S-vs-Radeon-RX-7600M_11550_11554_11552.247598.0.html">Radeon RX 7700 and 7600 mobile parts</a>, which have almost exclusively appeared <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152087/ayaneo-plans-ornate-ag01-graphics-starship-egpu-dock">in <em>external</em> graphics cards</a> (with two <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review">notable</a> <a href="https://www.minisforum.com/products/atomman-g7-pt">exceptions</a>) and offer similar or better theoretical performance to the PS5 Pro’s graphics.</p></div><p>While I didn’t have time for robust testing at Valve’s headquarters, my first impressions were promising. On a 4K TV, the demanding <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> benchmark averaged a smooth 65fps at medium settings with basic ray tracing turned on, while being upscaled to 4K from a native 1080p output using AMD’s FSR 3.0. The benchmark never dipped below 58 frames per second, and when I took the controls for a spin in one of the more demanding regions of the game, the lowest I saw was 55fps in a quick firefight. It looked nice and crisp from about 9 feet away.</p><p>The prototype didn’t do nearly as well at native 4K — just 24fps average — but consoles generally don’t play the most demanding games at native 4K, either. I also benched with the same 720p settings I use to test every handheld and saw a solid 131fps, though the low resolution looked pretty ugly on a 4K TV!</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="compressed-steam"><h2>Compressed steam</h2></p></div><p>How did Valve fit PS5 power into a box around <em>half</em> the size of a PS5 at just 3.8 liters, including an internal power supply so you don’t need a separate brick? When Valve hands me a peeled-apart Steam Machine to let me peek inside, the answer is: there’s almost no wasted space within.</p><p>Aldehayyat says the team designed the entire Steam Machine around its cooling system — starting with a whisper-quiet 120mm PC fan with custom blade geometry. “We probably have more computational fluid dynamics time on this than an F1 team in a calendar year,” he jokes. “We have a lot of wind tunnel time on it as well.”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->10</strong><span><figcaption><em>Gallery: Peek inside Valve’s new Steam Machine with our photos.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>Then, Valve and component partners built a massive finned heatsink just as tall as that fan, with embedded heat pipes — and made it pull double duty as the RF shielding between the motherboard and its <em>four</em> dedicated antennas, including two for Wi-Fi 6E, one for Bluetooth, and one just for connecting to its new Steam Controllers. Below the custom motherboard is a custom Chicony power supply that <em>also</em> doubles as RF shielding for the Steam Machine’s bottom components, including a full-size M.2 2280 SSD bay that also accepts the smaller M.2 2230 drives the Steam Deck uses.</p><p>It’s all sandwiched together into an incredibly dense, weighty package where the main gaps are all dedicated to airflow: the space around the massive heatsink’s fins, the vents on the bottom, and the multiple vents in front. Aldehayyat says Valve knew it couldn’t count on a lot of airflow in the living room, so it designed a lot of redundancy. “It’s really hard to block every single one of those vents.”</p><p>Plus, those vents on the front are where the Steam Machine’s swappable magnetic front panel lives. While the basic design is plain black, Valve shows me a wood panel that gives the Steam Machine <a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/terra/terra/terra-graphite/">a Fractal vibe</a> and a <em>Team Fortress 2</em>-themed panel, and I even spot a panel with an embedded e-paper display which reveals that the Steam Machine is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr#:~:text=a%20codename%20Fremont%20living%20room%20console%20too">codenamed “Fremont” after all</a>.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="expandability"><h2>Expandability</h2></p></div><p>Valve won’t necessarily sell any of those extra panels, but says it’ll release the CAD files so you can design and 3D print your own. “I’m sure someone will make a [<em>Portal</em>] Companion Cube out of this, but we did not,” Valve engineer Steve Cardinali tells us when we ask. Below the panel, Valve also has a customizable RGB light bar that it plans to turn into a progress indicator for downloads and updates.</p><p>And this Steam Machine will finally be (optionally) sold with a gamepad that’s both familiar <em>and</em> worthy of playing PC games from the couch. The new Steam Controller is no longer a bulbous experiment in precision but now a comfortable, familiar, and powerful twist on a traditional gamepad (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">read my colleague Jay Peters’ story</a> for more).</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The downside of Valve’s impressive sandwich is that the Steam Machine isn’t really upgradable beyond the SSD and — if you dig deep — the 16GB of memory, which does come on standard laptop memory sticks. But the upside is an incredibly tiny game console that can alternatively double as a full desktop PC.</p><p>The Steam Machine has twin display outputs (HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4) so you can hook up two desktop monitors at a time or daisy-chain DisplayPort for a third. Across the front and back are four USB-A ports (two USB 2, two USB 3) for peripherals, with both a 10Gbps USB-C port and Gigabit Ethernet around back.</p><p>You should be able to plug in just about anything — including Valve’s new 6GHz dongle that gives the console a direct wireless connection to the Steam Frame headset — and you can install Windows if you really want.</p><div><div><p id="got-any-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>Got any burning questions about Valve’s new hardware?</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We’re holding a subscriber-exclusive AMA today, November 12th, at 3PM ET. Drop your questions <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818113/valve-steam-frame-machine-controller-vr-headset-pc-ask-us-anything-ama">here</a> and we’ll do our best to answer them.</p></blockquote></div></div><p>If this exact Steam Machine is not your cup of tea, the company hints that other versions might be available through partners in the future. While Valve won’t repeat history, letting companies go wild and create a ragtag band of various kinds of Steam Box like it did a decade ago, Valve says it’s willing to let end users try desktop SteamOS on their own PCs — and selectively work with companies, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">like it did with Lenovo</a>, to bring future Steam Machines to market.</p><p>But partners probably will want to see how Valve’s own Steam Machine fares first, designer Pierre-Loup Griffais suggests to me.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Everything Time Studio / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p id="the-burning-question"><h2>The burning question</h2></p></div><p>In the two weeks since I set foot in Valve’s headquarters, there’s only been one big question on my mind: What will this cost? Will Valve price it like a console, putting the Steam Machine toe-to-toe with PS5 Pro? Or will it be priced like a PC, making buyers weigh a heftier price against the opportunity to tap the PC’s wider library of games?</p><p>Valve says it hasn’t finalized pricing yet. But when I explicitly ask if the console will cost more than a PS5 Pro, the answer is: “Steam Machine’s pricing is comparable to a PC with similar specs.” When I listen to my interview audio, I find an additional hint from Griffais: “We intend for it to be positioned closer to the entry level of the PC space, but to be very competitive with a PC you could build yourself from parts.”</p><p>Poking around the web, I find I could probably assemble a computer with this performance for $800, not including labor. But it could easily consume half the room under my TV. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/minisforum-atomman-g7-pt-mini-pc-review/">A compact system with a similar GPU</a> can cost $1,000 <em>without</em> storage, memory, operating system, or a gamepad.</p><p>But hey, everything about buying video games is getting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789734/game-consoles-too-expensive">more confusing and expensive these days</a>. If Valve can deliver a pick-up-and-play console that supports decades of inexpensive PC games, I know people who’ll put down PC amounts of money to get it.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement]]></content:encoded>

But now that the company is preparing to sell an Arm headset, one that can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame">even run Android apps</a>, there’s an obvious question.

But another way to think about it is that Valve is finally entering the mobile realm. The Frame doesn’t just run Windows games on its Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon chip — Valve will now support and encourage developers to bring their Android apps to Steam as well.</p><p>It’ll try to make some of them first-class citizens, too, Valve engineer Jeremy Selan tells <em>The Verge</em>. “From the user’s perspective, our preference is that they don’t even have to think about it, they just have their titles on Steam, they download them and hit play.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODE4MzEz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818313/valve-has-no-news-about-a-steam-deck-2">Valve has no news about Steam Deck 2</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODE4NjIy" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818622/valve-console-wars-price-sony-microsoft-nintendo-windows">Valve enters the console wars</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: Kristen Radtke / The Verge, Valve</cite></p></div><div><p>On the 15th floor of an upscale office building in Bellevue, Washington, security guards line the halls. They’re here to make sure we don’t stray — because I’m visiting Valve’s headquarters, a place few journalists ever get to go. The guards help escort me to a tiny demo room, where a pair of Valve engineers show me their pride and joy: a glowing 6-inch cube, barely bigger than a box of Kleenex, that they hope might be the future of video game consoles.</p><p>For a moment, I feel like I’m watching history repeat itself. Twelve years ago, in a different Valve office half a mile away, the maker of <em>Half-Life</em> and <em>Portal</em> showed me what ultimately became one of the biggest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019">technology flops of the decade</a>, a new gaming system called the Steam Machine.

Most VR headsets I’ve tried have ended up collecting dust after the novelty wore off, and I thought I had sworn off VR for good. But after trying Valve’s new headset for myself at the company’s headquarters, I was nearly ready to put down my credit card before I walked out the door.</p><p>The new headset is called the Steam Frame, and it’s trying to do several things at once. It’s a standalone VR headset with a smartphone-caliber Arm chip inside that lets you play flat-screen Windows games locally off the onboard storage or a microSD card. But the Frame’s arguably bigger trick is that it can <em>stream</em> games directly to the headset, bypassing your unreliable home Wi-Fi by using a short-range, high-bandwidth wireless dongle that plugs into your gaming PC. And its new controllers are packed with all the buttons and inputs you need for both flat-screen games <em>and</em> VR games.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODE1MDYx" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/815061/valve-steam-controller-hands-on-deck-frame-machine">Valve’s new Steam Controller might be my dream controller</a></h2><div><p>One of the best parts of the Steam Deck is its many different controls, and how you can customize them to let you do whatever you want with every single one of your games.

Late last week, Valve invited a host of new users into the Steam In-Home Streaming beta, and we made it in. Read on for our first impressions.</p><p>The first, most striking thing about Steam In-Home Streaming is how little setup it requires. You don’t even need to be in front of both computers to pair them together. As long as both computers are signed into your Steam account and connected to the same network, you’ll automatically have access to any game or program in either computer’s Steam library. That means you can stream Windows games to a Mac or Linux machine, and Valve is planning to add support for the reverse, too. If you’ve got a copy of a game that works on both operating systems, you can pick whether to stream it or run it locally, or even start installing it on the remote computer. You can even launch some non-Steam apps, like Adobe Photoshop and Media Player Classic, if you add them to Steam. They don’t properly display their menu bars, though.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/26/5345364/steam-in-home-streaming-preview-a-short-range-slingbox-for-your">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NDA1Mzc1" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5312452/steam-controller-ditches-the-touchscreen-for-better-backwards">Steam Controller ditches the touchscreen for better backwards compatibility</a></h2><div><p><figcaption>Gallery Photo: Steam Controller and Steam Machine press pictures</figcaption></p></div><div><p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future">The Steam Controller</a> is going to change. According to two game developers tweeting from Valve’s Steam Dev Days developer summit, Valve has decided to remove the controller’s central touchscreen.

Players will simply use a feature that Valve’s calling “ghost mode.”</p><p>We saw an early demo of “ghost mode” at Valve’s headquarters a few months ago, and it’s fairly simple: when you move your thumb on the Steam Controller’s touchpad, you can see a ghostly image of your thumb on your TV screen as well, and you can press virtual buttons placed there.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5312452/steam-controller-ditches-the-touchscreen-for-better-backwards">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NDA1NDY3" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/15/5312224/alienwares-steam-machine-will-arrive-in-september">Alienware’s Steam Machine will arrive in September</a></h2><div><p><figcaption>alienware steam machine stock 1020</figcaption></p></div><div><p>Alienware has <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5281824/steam-machines-are-here-how-alienware-is-realizing-valve-console-dream#">perhaps the most exciting Steam Machine</a> coming to market, and now we know when it will arrive.

But one thing is for sure: the 300 prototypes that Valve sent out in 2013 aren’t going to be making a further appearance. “That was an exercise to kind of prove the concept and get them in customers’ hands to get real honest feedback,” says Powers. “We don’t have further plans to manufacture more of those boxes and run a bigger beta or sell them.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5282122/valve-13-steam-machine-partners">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li></ul><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/819080/valve-brings-back-steam-machines-steam-os-steam-frame-news-announcements/archives/2"><span>More Stories</span></a></section></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/819080/valve-brings-back-steam-machines-steam-os-steam-frame-news-announcements]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> is, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">in Dominic's own words</a>, "merely okay." I haven't played it myself, so I can't comment there, the general consensus seems to be in agreement on that point however. The Chinese Room are working on turning that around at least! Today they released a new patch for the RPG, containing a bunch of fixes, and offered up a small roadmap of improvements and DLC to come.
</p>
<p>
Let's start with what this patch, patch 1.0.4, offers up. The big one is that previously, if you would exit to the main menu or quit the game, the game wouldn't save, resulting in a lost of lost hours of playtime. Now, the game does autosave, updating progress for collectables, blood resonance, and ability points.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that, there's just a whole bunch of general fixes. Most of them are for specific sections of the game, like one where an enemy would clip out of bounds meaning you couldn't kill it in A Kiss From Prospero, and multiple cases of the player character falling out of bounds after performing certain actions in particular places have been fixed. You can read the full list in this handy <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/bloodlines-2-hotfix-1-0-4">blog post</a>.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what's next, before the end of the year patch 1.0.5 should be in your hands. This one will add in an FOV slider and motion blue toggle, and progress saving should be improved too. Then, in the winter update, there'll be some Christmas-themed cosmetics, and a custom difficulty mode will be added in. You won't be able to engage with this feature until after beating the game, however. It's been framed as a sort of new game plus type situation, just one where you can toggle specific things like your starting health or enemy awareness.
</p>
<p>
After that, in early 2026 a Valentine's update will arrive, with the game's Loose Cannon and The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flower">Flower</a> and the Flame DLC coming throughout the year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been five years since the PS5 was released, and here are the statistics it has accumulated during this time frame. </p>



<p>There is still a long way to go before we see the next generation of PlayStation consoles, the PS6, which is reportedly set to arrive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime in 2027</a>. As we await the next generation of PlayStation consoles, let’s take a look back at what the PlayStation 5 has accomplished since its release. </p>







<h2 id="h-from-2020-to-2025-here-s-how-the-ps5-has-grown-over-the-past-five-years">From 2020 to 2025, Here’s How the PS5 Has Grown Over the Past Five Years</h2>







<figure></figure>



<p>Starting in 2020, the console was released with a high-speed SSD, immersive 3D Audio, and the DualSense wireless controller. It also debuted features like Share Screen, which allows players to watch friends’ gameplay in real-time. The feature was used more than&nbsp;1.6 billion&nbsp;times, totaling over&nbsp;900 million hours of usage. Regarding accessibility, the console has expanded from 11 features at launch to 20 by 2025. </p>







<figure></figure>



<p>The following year, we saw innovation towards Share Play, with cross-gen share-play allowing PS5 players with PS Plus to virtually ‘pass the controller’ to friends using PS4. The feature has been used over 700 million times since launch. M.2 SSD storage expansion was introduced for players to grow their libraries further. </p>



<p>PS5 Game Captures received the ability to be shared through the PS App, resulting in 5.6 billion captures uploaded and over 1 billion voice chat sessions conducted through the app. The Midnight Black and Cosmic Red colour variations for the DualSense were also released in 2021. </p>



<h3 id="h-2022-vrr-new-ps-plus-tiers-and-more-colors">2022 – VRR, New PS Plus Tiers, and More Colors</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Then the next year, PlayStation 5 received variable refresh rate or VRR, which helped enhance visual performance by minimizing visual artifacts for smoother, crisper gameplay. 96% of players with VRR-compatible monitors use this feature regularly. We also saw PlayStation Plus being turned into a three-tier service: Essential, Extra, and Premium/Deluxe. “The total gameplay hours for Game Catalog and Classic Catalog have also increased – cumulatively hitting&nbsp;14 billion hours.”</p>



<p>Three more galaxy-inspired color variations were introduced for the DualSense in 2022: Nova Pink, Starlight Blue, and Galactic Purple.</p>



<h3 id="h-2023-playstation-vr2-playstation-portal-dualsense-edge-and-more">2023 – PlayStation VR2, PlayStation Portal, DualSense Edge, and More</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>2023 was the year of accessories; we first saw the release of the PSVR2, which featured eye tracking, headset feedback, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers through the PSVR2 Sense Controllers. Discord voice chat has been introduced to the PS5, with more than 1 billion voice chat sessions taking place on the platform, averaging 105 minutes per session.</p>



<p>Then, the next device, PlayStation Portal, was introduced to redefine their remote play features, with the device accounting for over 50%&nbsp;of all PS5 Remote Play sessions. Innovation was also introduced to the controller space with the high-performance, ultra-customizable DualSense Edge and the Access Controller, designed to make games more accessible. </p>



<p>Cloud streaming for PS5 games also introduced new options for PlayStation Plus Premium members to stream supported PS5 digital games from the Game Catalog, Game Trials, and purchases made on the PS Store directly on their PS5 console. Lastly, a whole line of audio products was released with planar magnetic drivers, PlayStation Link technology, and lightning-fast, lossless audio connection. </p>







<h3 id="h-2024-community-game-help-welcome-hub-and-ps5-pro">2024 –  Community Game Help, Welcome Hub, and PS5 Pro</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>2024 was the year when Community Game Help was introduced, allowing players to share gameplay hint videos generated by opt-in contributors. The Welcome Hub was also added this year to bring a personalized PS5 home screen space with customizable widgets and backgrounds. Lastly, the mid-gen update, PS5 Pro, and the PlayStation 30th Anniversary Collection were also released that year. </p>



<h3 id="h-2025-here-s-where-everything-adds-up">2025 – Here’s Where Everything Adds Up</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>2025 marks the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/12/five-years-of-play-the-evolution-of-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">5th Anniversary</a> of the PS5, and it has racked up some huge numbers in this time span. The console has sold over 84 million units globally, and if players “lined up every PS5 ever sold, together they’d stretch over&nbsp;28,600 kilometers”. Moreover, over 7,500 PS5 games have been published by more than 4,000 creators. </p>



<p>The top 3 multiplayer games on the PS5, based on playtime, are Fortnite, Grand Theft Auto V, and Call of Duty Modern Warfare II. The top 3 single-player games on PS5 are Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, God of War Ragnarök, and Hogwarts Legacy. Combined, players have acquired over 40 billion Trophies and 110 million Platinum Trophies. Last but not least by any means, across the five years, PS5 players have&nbsp;logged a total of 100 billion hours of gameplay.</p>



<p>In other news, a PS5 &amp; PC cross-buy option has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-ps5-pc-cross-buy-option-has-been-discovered-verified/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered and verified</a>.
