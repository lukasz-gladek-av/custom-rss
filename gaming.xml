            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has just greenlit an official <em>Clue</em> TV show. The major streaming platform's latest show will be an unscripted competitive experience where players will need to solve a murder mystery straight from the iconic social deduction board game.</p>

<h2>The Clue TV Show Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official report <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/clue-competition-series-netflix-1236571635/" rel="nofollow">by Deadline</a>, the <em>Clue</em> TV show will feature a competitive game show experience. Contestants will face physical and mental challenges to collect clues. Those clues will aid them in a real-life game of social deduction. Contestants will need to outwit their opponents and identify who killed whom, where, and with what.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clue-classic-game-board.jpg?itok=3eR3zsPv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clue-classic-game-board.jpg?itok=EdouKvqz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If the contestants guess correctly, money will be added a major prize pot. If they guess incorrectly, they are eliminated. The report does confirm that the usual suspects from the Clue board game, Colonel Mustard, Professor Plum, Mrs. White, and Miss Scarlett, will be present for these sections. The show will be produced by&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Like so many families and friends over the years, we’ve gathered around the table trying to figure out who did it—making Clue a source of nostalgia that everyone shares,” said Jeff Gaspin, VP of Unscripted Series, Netflix. “Thanks to the incredible vision of our partners at Hasbro Entertainment, IPC, and B17, we’re delivering a fresh, imaginative whodunit competition that will invite today’s audiences into that iconic world.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Netflix <em>Clue</em> TV show is a notable departure from the board game's roots. It was originally a broad tabletop experience imitating posh Agatha Christie murder mysteries.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clue-movie-screenshot.jpg?itok=88EHWKUH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clue-movie-screenshot.jpg?itok=fc2WQSMl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But it is not the first time <em>Clue</em> has gotten the cinematic treatment. There was the 1985 feature film directed by Jonathan Lynn starring major stars like Tim Curry and Christopher Lloyd. The film was a dark murder mystery satire,, complete with outrageous murder methods, convoluted character motivations, and farcical slapstick. It even had three different endings, meant to invoke the replayability of the <em>Clue</em> board game.</p>

<p>The <em>Clue</em> TV show is in keeping with company Hasbro's recent stint of adapting their various properties to film and tv. Those projects include another game show based on Monopoly and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-screenwriters-have-been-summoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">feature film</a> based on the iconic card game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/baby-steps-punishes-serial-cutscene-skippers-with-a-28-minute-long-cutscene</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps-punishes-serial-cutscene-skippers-with-a-28-minute-long-cutscene.1320112/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's a cutscene about nothing.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Baby Steps, the literal walking simulator recently released from Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett Foddy is silly, absurdist, and often just plain weird...in a good way. But one of it's goofiest gags is one that few players are likely to see: a 28-minute long cutscene that plays only if you successfully skip all or most of the game's other cutscenes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I say successfully, I do mean that. Skipping cutscenes in Baby Steps isn't just a matter of pushing a "Skip" button. Each cutscene skip forces you to play a weird little minigame of sorts with the Skip button, where it's almost as though the Skip button is trying to actively stop you from doing the skip. You can fail these skips too, and if you don't skip enough of them, you won't trigger the ridiculous, lengthy reward (or punishment) that ensues from being a skip-a-holic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The cutscene itself occurs when Nate visits Moose at the cabin at the end of the game. If the player skipped everything else but doesn't skip this last cutscene, the cutscene proceeds with Nate breaking the fourth wall to tell Moose about the cutscene skipping, and express that he's not really up to performing the final scene as a result. The two sit outside and chat as their actors, Cuzzillo and Foddy, shoot the breeze about everything from broccolli sandwiches to the fact that their characters can't raise their eyebrows individually to the challenges of audio recording under a busy flight path. At one point they try to take a nap, but that proves awkward, and they get sidetracked talking about mold, the human need to pee as a useful writing device, and localization struggles. They repeatedly lambast the player's incessant cutscene skipping and their feelings about it, then grow frustrated when the player doesn't skip this particular one, forcing them to continue recording dialogue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cutscene goes on for around 28 minutes of silly, inane discussion between the two before they finally decide it's important to show the credits and a cat starts meowing at them to hurry things along. Beautiful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players who just want to watch all this without skipping every other scene can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQahQACsvPU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find the whole thing on YouTube</a>. Whether or not you see this sort of thing as a punishment or a reward for your or someone else's abuse of the skip button is entirely up to you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baby-steps-review">gave Baby Steps a 9/10</a> calling it "an infuriating ordeal of intentionally awkward physics that’s brutal, unbelievably stupid, and downright awesome."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="d24447042aaa7"><a title="C16 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d24447042aaa7/c16-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A short while back, I looked at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/hautepad-x-arcade-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-a-modular-masterclass-at-a-premium-price">Hautepad X</a>, Cosmox Gaming’s premium arcade controller that boasts modular components for a highly customisable experience - with an equally high price to boot.</p>
<p>For those who might not be on board with such an ambitious product but still want to see why Cosmox has been garnering praise in the fighting game community, the C16 and C16-S might be more up your alley.</p>
<p>Coming in at just under <strong>$90</strong> (roughly <strong>£67</strong>) each, these new wired models are roughly the same price as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-arcade-controller-for-switch-plus-switch-2-the-best-way-to-play-street-fighter-6">8BitDo Arcade Controller</a>, yet neither skimps on quality or features. Compatible with Switch and Switch 2 after you follow the instructions and set the right profile (PS5 and Xbox owners will need to spend more on a converter like the <a href="https://www.brookaccessory.com/products/wingmanfgc/index.html">Brook Wingman</a>), the C16 and C16-S weigh in at 789g. Slim yet sturdy.</p>

<p>You’ve got hot-swappable key caps with <a href="https://www.kailh.net/">Kailh Wind Engine switches</a>, which feel tactile without making too much noise. Just like the Hautepad X, however, you can swap out the switches for something more to your liking with the included switch puller. There's a function bar at the top, and this is where you’ll find a small OLED screen to display real-time button inputs, lights and tournament toggles, and buttons like 'start', 'select', 'capture', and 'turbo'. These all come with their own light-up labels, too, provided you have tournament mode turned off.</p>
<p>What’s the difference between the C16 and C16-S? Functionally, the two are identical; they look similar, the function bar remains the same, and the USB slots are in the same positions.</p>
<p>They both have 16 switches on the top, but the key difference is the layout. The C16 is what I’d deem a more ‘traditional’ layout; it’s the same as what you’d see on the Hautepad X, 8BitDo’s Arcade Controller, and many other models making the rounds. The C16-S, meanwhile, boasts a ‘split’ layout that shifts a few of the switches around for something more unique.</p>
<p>So essentially, if you lay your hands on top of the C16-S, all 10 fingers will rest comfortably on the switches, with your pinkies sitting on the pill-shaped buttons on the far sides, and your thumbs on the same buttons located toward the lower middle.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with a more traditional layout, this can take a bit of getting used to; with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, for example, the macro for Drive Impact would be on the far right, so you’d whack your pinky down to activate it. On the C16-S, the same macro has moved over to the middle, requiring you to shift your right thumb over to hit it.</p>
<p>Naturally, you can remap the buttons however you like via the web configuration tool, so if you want to simply move the Drive Impact macro back over to the right, you can. It’s worth keeping in mind, however, that if you’re keen to just plug in and play, you’ll need to spend a bit of time getting used to the layout. One key downside is that the OLED screen doesn't match the layout on the C16-S, so you can't really use this as an accurate guide.</p>
<p>Ultimately, neither option is 'better' than the other here; it really comes down to personal preference. If you’re a complete beginner to the world of leverless arcade sticks, then consider the C16; its tried-and-tested layout is used widely across all arcade stick manufacturers, so moving from one to another is relatively painless. If you’re after something different, then the C16-S is a pretty cool little setup - one that you won’t easily find elsewhere.</p>

<p>Whichever model you opt for, the switches themselves feel great. The spacing is appropriate, so unless you have really tiny hands, you’ll find that all of the buttons are within easy reach, and combos on the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive-</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> will feel effortlessly natural. Down on the bottom, the surface curves downward slightly, which makes for a lovely space on which to rest your wrists while boasting a pretty sweet pixelated design that shimmers in the light.</p>
<p>On the back, you’ll find two basic non-slip strips on either side to prevent the controller from sliding about on smooth surfaces, while a button labelled ‘push’ is on the right. Pressing this in produces a pin on the other side which pushes the magnetic acrylic cover away from the main body for easy customisation – kind of like how the magnetic Joy-Con 2 work.</p>
<p>As standard, Cosmox includes four design templates for each model, with an additional two blank sheets in case you want to create your own little masterpiece. Aluminium covers have also been released which add a nice bit of extra weight to the controller, but these are sold separately. As for the acrylic cover, the frosted matte design feels lovely and repels nasty fingerprints, but it does slightly blur the artwork underneath.</p>

<p>Finally, both controllers feature some really lovely RGB lighting. All main buttons come with their own light-up rims around the outside which change colour by default. Pressing the buttons results in a white light to indicate the input, but you can also disable this completely via the function bar.</p>
<p>Around the outside of the controller, you'll also find an RGB strip, and this looks awesome when laid on a flat surface in a dark room. It really helps the controller stand out in the crowd, and this combined with some custom artwork allows for some self-expression. Of course, you can take this a step further by customising the lights to your liking via the configuration tool. You can make it so the buttons and RGB strip present specific colours, or you can simply prevent them from changing on their own.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The C16 and C16-S are both great options if you're after an affordable arcade controller that punches well above its weight. Which one you opt for ultimately comes down to personal preference: the C16 offers a more traditional layout, while the C16-S goes for something more unique that experienced players might want to try out.</p>
<p>Otherwise, minor quibbles aside, these are feature-rich controllers with remapping available via the web configuration tool, and the ability to easily swap out custom artwork makes for a tempting prospect for those who like to showcase their personalities via their hardware.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, the gaming industry was rocked by two big announcements: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive 50% Xbox Game Pass price hike</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leveraged buyout of EA for $55 billion from a Consortium of investors</a>. With both likely to influence the industry in their own ways, we have contacted MIDiA Research Games Analyst Brandon Sutton to get his opinion on what will happen to Electronic Arts and the Xbox brand.</p>



<p><strong><em>Brandon, what's your take on both news?</em></strong></p>



<p><em>While the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debt burden is notable</a>, Saudi Arabia and its partners purchasing EA makes sense on several levels. Financially, EA owns some of the most profitable gaming franchises with proven monetization models. Culturally, its partnerships with leading sports and entertainment brands give it a rare connection with global audiences that its new owners can leverage. Technologically, video game development offers a powerful testing ground for emerging tools like generative AI. This creates a natural compatibility for investors who are already invested in that space as well.</em></p>



<p><em>The increase in Xbox Game Pass prices are part of a wider pattern of rising costs across the industry. Inflation and rising costs of operation are certainly factors, but so is the growing consolidation of the market. This has emboldened major industry players to increase prices. The risk, however, is that consumers will still see gaming as a luxury and steep increases from larger companies could ultimately push them toward cheaper, indie alternatives</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Do you think EA will soon implement layoffs or even studio divestitures to reduce costs, and if so, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-devs-reportedly-worried-55-billion-ea-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is BioWare the main candidate</a>?</em></strong></p>



<p><em>Prior to the acquisition news, EA was already enacting layoffs, with Respawn being hit especially hard earlier this year, so the acquisition could slow some of that down. However, new ownership will likely be taking stock of where workers and teams can be cut, perhaps replaced with generative AI, in order to trim costs once the deal is finalized. Post-acquisition, it wouldn't be surprising to see studio divestitures or the sale of IP to recoup costs. BioWare is certainly a strong candidate, given the recent underperformance of Dragon Age: Veilguard.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Is there a risk that Microsoft will alienate some of its oldest Xbox fans with such a steep increase in Game Pass pricing and the fact that they have walked back on some promises? For instance, they have now removed Call of Duty from the Premium tier, so only the Ultimate tier will get access to the popular game.</em></strong></p>



<p><em>I think the move will alienate many longtime Xbox fans. However, Microsoft is likely calculating that an increase in negative sentiment will not translate into a meaningful amount of canceled subscriptions. That said, consumers are feeling a financial crunch right now and so rising prices combined with a sense of broken trust will likely have lasting consequences for the wider Xbox brand and Microsoft ecosystem even if Game Pass subscription revenue remains strong.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></em></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Many are hoping to see these "open" playlists stick around for launch, and in fact, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1974646289347575911" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one report said that is indeed the plan</a>. However, Activision has yet to make any official announcements.</p><p>SBMM is a hot-button issue in a lot of multiplayer games, including Call of Duty. Some portion of the audience enjoys and embraces SBMM because they say it helps place them into matches with people more aligned with their skills. Other people, including hardcore players, want to see less SBMM.</p><p>For years, hardcore Call of Duty fans have bemoaned how <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1974517777450045878" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision reportedly "turned up" SBMM</a> and created what some thought was a negative experience because of it. With this new change for the Black Ops 7 beta, people are saying it's exactly what they've wanted to see for years, with faster matchmaking times, lower pings, and matches populated by players with a variety of skill levels.</p><p>The Black Ops 7 multiplayer beta wraps up on October 9, and on that very same day, Activision will launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-season-6-arrives-to-black-ops-6-and-warzone-with-chucky-a-chainsaw-and-a-slasher-mode/2900-7113/" data-ref-id="2900-7113">Black Ops 6 and Warzone's Season 6, including the new Halloween content</a>. Also going live on October 9 is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-free-trial-starts-just-before-battlefield-6-launch/1100-6535286/" data-ref-id="1100-6535286">free week-long Black Ops 6 trial</a> that allows people to try the multiplayer and Zombies, as well as campaign. The timing is notable given that the free trial is going live just before the rival FPS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a> launches on October 10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cady “Fandy” Hoffmann can usually be found on Twitch streaming <em>World of Warcraft</em> or <em>Overwatch 2</em>. This week, fans found her livestreaming the birth of her first kid. They’re calling Fandy the first streamer to give birth on Twitch. Many are not sure how to feel about the newest breakthrough in streaming culture.</p> <p>“Hi twitter my water just broke so I think I’m going this live Baby time&nbsp;:)” Fandy <a href="https://x.com/fandybtw/status/1975712190050279688">wrote on X</a> at 7:57 p.m. ET on October 7. The birth took place at home surrounded by friends and family with the camera on the far side of the room and privacy when mom needed it. A nurse appeared to be present as well. The Twitch chat was displayed on the living room TV with Fandy occasionally interacting in-between contractions.</p>

 <p>“I’ve waited forever for her,” she said at one point. “Get the hell out already.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" src="about:blank" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2585966702&amp;parent=kotaku.com"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start"></span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start"></span></iframe></p> <p>Giving birth in real life doesn’t happen as fast as in the movies. Fandy walks around, bounces on a yoga ball, and rests at various points during the livestream marathon before eventually getting into an inflatable water birth pool. Twitch CEO Dan Clancy even appeared in the chat at one point to wish her well. “Fandy, best of luck and congratulations. Wishing you the best in this journey,” Clancy wrote. Others in the chat said to <a href="https://x.com/Alykkat/status/1975775572845613449">fill the pool with Tylenol</a> for “optimum chances of raising a human genius.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">literally staying up late to watch someone livestream their birth spamming "lock in" and "push"</p> <p>you know what hell yeah</p> <p>— Liquid Eiya (@EiyaWoW) <a href="https://twitter.com/EiyaWoW/status/1975819858874110405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The stream peaked at over 30,000 viewers, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/twitch-streamer-fandy-gives-birth-live-on-stream-as-tens-of-thousands-tune-in-3263532/">according to<em> Dexerto</em></a>, with thousands hanging around to witness the moment the baby came out over seven hours later. Fady named her Luna and both mom and kid appear to be perfectly healthy following the landmark milestone for the Amazon-owned video platform. The two are resting peacefully at the end of the stream. Even <em>TMZ</em> felt the need to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/10/08/streamer-fandy-gives-birth-live-on-twitch/">blur the newborn’s face out</a>.</p>

 <p>The stream was a wholesome look inside one of the most important and intimate moments in a person’s life. Maybe some fans preparing to have a child of their own will find it reassuring to see how smoothly it went. So why does it feel like there are just some things that don’t need to be recorded, let alone shared with the whole world in real-time? How will the child feel about it later on in her life? Why am I, a complete stranger, even in a position to have questions like this?</p> <p>“That’s a plus one baby, boys!” said husband Adamax after seeing his newborn for the first time. May they all live happily ever after.</p>

Here are our picks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Save On Tech And Toys At Target</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Kicking off with a doozy, you can get this <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4DAqD?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>LEGO Star Wars Darth Vader Helmet</u></a> for under $50 with Target’s deals. It’s an 834-piece build, so is ideal for intermediate builders, and shows off arguably the most iconic helmet in cinematic history (seriously, who comes close other than Stormtroopers?).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Target also has some Apple tech deals. The <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6eNY?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Apple Watch Series 10</u></a> is down to just over $300 now that the Series 11 is here, and considering the new model adds very little on top of what the Series 10 offers, it’s well worth that if you want a device that’s a seamless extension of your current iPhone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up for Apple, there’s a $100 discount on the ridiculously powerful <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmOVL6?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>iPad Pro M4</u></a>. I’ll be honest, there’s a good chance an M5 version arrives in a few weeks, but this is a phenomenally powerful tablet that can take advantage of iOS 26’s new features like multitasking and more Mac-like features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Apple deals continue, with half off the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8MwE?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Beats Studio Pro</u></a> over-ear headphones, and 32% off the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2VOd?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>AirPods Pro 2</u></a>, although expect the latter to get cheaper for Black Friday since the third-generation ones are out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, you can get a compact <a href="https://zdcs.link/QdpMl6?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Anker Power Bank</u></a> for $14.99, saving around $10 - ideal for charging your phone while out and about. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up Target is running a <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBDd54?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Buy 2, Get One Free</u></a> promotion across books, movies, music, and uh, Funko Pop figurines. If you’ve been lacking in any of those areas, now’s the time to splurge, with books like the recently released Alchemised, movies like Moana 2 and Thunderbolts, and more included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 gamers can pick up some first-party exclusives on the cheap, too. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8Vg0?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>The Last of Us Part 1</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjld0?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Gran Turismo 7</u></a> both see 56% discounts, dropping to $29.99 each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally (ha!) the <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwnv0?object_uuid=dcdf9c04-d80f-4a83-91b5-232ae365a822&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Final Fantasy Limit Break Commander Deck</u></a> is now cheaper than MSRP. This is the one that’s tended to hold its value since launch in June, and it’s now reduced by 22% - and you don’t even have to be a Target Circle member for this one, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.

That makes Switch 2 the fastest-selling home console in the US through this timeframe.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3m2op7dqxt226" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidkuv7smumtaswzqyh3q2gypza4667mg2ayayu2jcm5ef2lazidyu" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><p>Hardware - With 2.4M units sold LTD over its first 3 months market, Nintendo Switch 2 is now 5% ahead of the previous record setting pace of PlayStation 4, which sold 2.2M units during the 3 months ending January 2014.</p>  — Mat Piscatella (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">@matpiscatella.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3m2op7dqxt226?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">October 8, 2025 at 9:02 AM</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>Piscatella added that Switch 2 sales are pacing 77% ahead of the original Nintendo Switch when comparing their respective first three months on sale.

In fact, Piscatella said that the success of the Switch 2 actually "offset double-digit percentage declines" for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and even the original Switch; all three of those platforms received at least one price hike this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">most recently the Xbox Series consoles.</a></p><p>That's all to say that Switch 2 is thriving in its early months, giving the industry as a whole a much-needed boost in momentum.</p><p>The hybrid console already claimed the title of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/" data-ref-id="1100-6532341">fastest-selling home console in the world</a> less than a week after its launch, and it's been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-helps-shatter-a-us-hardware-june-sales-record-that-stood-for-17-years-circana/1100-6533373/" data-ref-id="1100-6533373">breaking records left and right</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/08/xbox-game-pass-october-2025-wave-1/">confirmed the next batch of games</a> coming to Xbox Game Pass for October 2025, which is also the first batch of titles to come in under the new changes Microsoft and Xbox recently made to the service, specifically <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">the fact that prices were raised by 50% for a Game Pass subscription</a>.</p>



<p>Twelve games will join the now more expensive subscription service over the course of October, with three titles set to exit the service; as the cycle is always that with new games entering, old games leave. Some of the highlights for games entering this month include Ninja Gaiden 4, the first new entry in the Ninja Gaiden series in years, which is also launching into the service for those subscribed to the top Ultimate tier of Game Pass.</p>



<p>Ball x Pit is another of the 12 games that is launching into the service on day one, with Double Fine Productions' new game, Keeper, rounding out the three games launching into Xbox Game Pass this month.</p>



<p>Other titles not launching day one into the service, but still notable, include the return of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, Evil West, Pax Dei, Eternal Strands, and a preview for RPG auto-battler, He Is Coming.</p>



<p>Here's a list of all the games arriving in Game Pass this month, the dates they'll come, where they're playable, and which tiers they'll be available for, since each tier now only gets access to a certain number of games. </p>



<ul>
<li>Supermarket Simulator - October 8 - Cloud, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC - All tiers </li>



<li>Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II Enhanced Editions - October 9 - PC - All tiers</li>



<li>The Casting of Frank Stone - October 14 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - All tiers</li>



<li>Ball x Pit - October 15 - Cloud, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures - October 15 - Cloud, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC - All tiers</li>



<li>Eternal Strands - October 15 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Premium/Ultimate</li>



<li>He Is Coming (Game Preview) - October 15 - PC - Game Pass Premium/Ultimate</li>



<li>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black - October 15 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Premium/Ultimate</li>



<li>Pax Dei - October 16 - PC - All tiers</li>



<li>Keeper - October 17 - Cloud, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Evil West - October 21 - Cloud, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC - All tiers</li>



<li>Ninja Gaiden 4 - October 21 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
</ul>



<p>As far as the game's leaving the service this month, as of October 15, Game Pass subscribers can say goodbye to Coccon, Core Keeper, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.</p>

            <p>
Online video games! They're the future of the medium! Or, I guess they're already here, but still, online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> is very much in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivor's</a> future. It's a feature that's been promised for a little while now, and developer Poncle have shared a little look at it, as well as a confirmation as to when you can expect it: autumn! This autumn, to be precise, which we're currently experiencing, though a more specific window of time wasn't provided.
</p>
<p>
In a short but sweet little trailer, which shows how all you need to do to make a game online is by pressing the online button (that fabled button far too many people think is effectively real), Poncle showed the simple steps you need to take to go online. You start by setting up a lobby with a unique ID, and when your friends (or enemies) start to join, it'll show you what DLC is and isn't available to play through, presumably depending on whether everyone involved owns a specific piece or not.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The wait is nearly over 🗣️ </p><p>Online co-op is coming to Vampire Survivors on PC and consoles THIS Autumn! (yeah it's autumn right now shh) 🍂</p><p>⚠️ dial-up tones will not be included</p><p>come back next week for another new announcement! 👀 <a href="https://t.co/NEK0aWr1rS">pic.twitter.com/NEK0aWr1rS</a></p></div>— Vampire Survivors 🦇 Emerald Diorama OUT NOW 🧄 (@poncle_vampire) <a href="https://twitter.com/poncle_vampire/status/1975546530238013703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
After that, everyone selects their character of choice, and you get to surviving vampires! There's also a short, jokey comment that I genuinely find quite fascinating: "We know no one plays together anyway lmao." This doesn't surprise me! As someone who's put a good few hours into Vampire Survivors, I can't see the appeal of playing with someone else in the slightest, it's a game I play to completely shut off - perhaps shutting off with someone else is the appeal for some, or just having something other than a fidget cube to play around with in your hands while yapping on Discord.
</p>
<p>
And yet, this feature still exists, because clearly either enough people have asked for it, no matter how small a number, or Poncle wanted the option there for anyone who might ever want it. There's a value in options like these, options for requests that come from the minority, and as long as they can be completed relatively sustainably, I hope we see more of them. Yes, I know I'm reading too much into what is obviously a joke! That is the curse called writing, I'm afraid.
</p><p>
In any case, Poncle also said there's another announcement coming next week which looks like it has something to do with someone in a crappy skeleton custom in the woods. There's also a visual suggestion that there'll be more announcements in the weeks following that one, so I guess there's big plans for update 1.4 you'll have to keep an eye out for!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stop-relying-on-game-creators-to-validate-your-player-choices.1320001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>One of the many consequences of modern fandom’s obsession with “canon” is that stories that have open-ended themes or choices are now held to a new standard of scrutiny. Swaths of the video games we play are about choice, whether that be in the weapons we wield or the sacrifices we make; however, because the internet has become fixated on listing events in bullet points on wikis, the act of making choices and watching the consequences unfold isn’t enough. Some players want to be “right,” and they want video games and their creators to tell them so. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402?_gl=1*9icn1w*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcyMzIxNjAkbzU4JGcxJHQxNzQ3MjQ1MDg0JGo2MCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw.."><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>is not primarily a choice-based game, but it does offer one at the very end that changes the story entirely. Since the RPG launched back in April, fans have debated the merits of both outcomes, but because a sequel is coming and some people need validation, the developers at Sandfall Interactive have come out and said there is no “correct” ending.</span></p>  <p><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i> <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-verso-maelle-choice-1851778284"><span>ends in one of two ways</span></a><span>, depending on whether or not the player chooses to play the final duel as either the paintress Maelle or Verso, the painted version of her deceased brother. In an interview with Lits Play, </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen spoke about how both endings of the game are valid and were made with purpose. Neither was meant to be the “other” or “wrong” choice.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I tell everyone there is no ‘correct’ ending, there is no ‘canon’ ending, there is no ‘official Sandfall’ ending,” Svedberg-Yen said. “Both endings are there for a reason; we put them both there for a reason; they were designed in a very particular way. Neither is perfect. Both are heartbreaking in their own ways. Both of them have parts that make you glad, parts that you feel like, ‘okay, I want a happy ending for these characters,’ but both of them also have their own cost. It’s a reflection of reality. You know, a lot of times, some people’s happiness does come with its costs. Things are very rarely perfect. And I think we were really trying to also show both sides of the story.”</span></p>

  <p><span>She’s right. Obviously, the debate over which is the morally correct answer is a whole different discussion. I personally chose the Maelle ending because it felt thematically appropriate, while also understanding that the Verso choice is probably the one that provides the most closure. Both have their merits and drawbacks, and one of the rewarding things about choice-based games is that we get to argue about those forever. However, this modern need to have these decisions declared “correct,” either by the text or by the developers, has added an often dismissive layer to those discussions.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>To some extent, this goes back to an attachment players have to their own “canon.” If a sequel like </span><i><span>Infamous Second Son </span></i><span>chooses one of its predecessor’s endings to build off of, it raises questions about the other choice. Why was it there if it was going to be cast aside? What does it say about players who chose the other option? Were they wrong? Was any debate about the morality or merits of that choice for nothing? This is a cloud that has been hanging over the next </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>game for nearly a decade, as the remnants of BioWare have to figure out how they’re going to make a fifth game set in the Milky Way that either works for all of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435"><i><span>Mass Effect 3</span></i><span>’s galaxy-defining final choices</span></a><span>, or picks one and moves the timeline forward from there.</span></p>

 <p><span>BioWare is an interesting example to point to when it comes to this dilemma, because even though the </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>communities love to throw around terminology like “canon” to refer to specific choices that are chosen by default if players don’t import a world state or save from a previous game, the studio doesn’t view it that way at all. The team has even said it would </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112"><span>rather not acknowledge a decision</span></a><span> in a sequel like </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </span></i><span>than contradict it. This allows players to feel like their world state is valid, even if they’re not staring the ramifications of it in the face every game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Maybe it’s because I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-cyberpunk-mass-effect-character-creator-1851422575"><span>grew up spending a lot of my early roleplaying days</span></a><span> working within the gaps that developers didn’t fill, but I’ve never looked for confirmation from games that I was “right” when I made a decision.&nbsp; The need for a game or developer to justify what you’ve done suggests that making choices in games is about aligning your actions with the “true vision” of the developers, rather than actually expressing your own agency within the story. I almost always treat roleplaying in games as an opportunity for self-reflection. It’s a big part of why I make myself in character creators. These are my stories, and I’ll write them how I want. I’d rather a developer not pat me on the head and tell me everything I did was “correct” or aligned with canon; that’s not what it’s about, and it shouldn’t be a factor in our decision-making process.</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps the uncertainty about “what really happened” is too much for some people. For me, that flexibility, the co-existence of multiple possibilities and my ability to shape which way things go, is the best part of when games give me that autonomy.&nbsp; But the best choice-based games are the ones we’re still debating years later, not the ones for which the developers have retroactively decided which was the “one true choice.” So shoutout to Sandfall Interactive and Svedberg-Yen for sticking beside the decision they handed players, rather than capitulating to some imagined idea of “canon.” I hope they stay true to that in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sequel-sandfall-interactive-2000620688"><span>the inevitable sequel</span></a><span>.</span></p>

              <p>Building a gaming PC can be a rewarding experience. I can also be frustrating as all hell. Sometimes, it is better to just get something that’s already assembled. It saves time both on shopping side of things when you’re trying to source each part you need as well as after it arrives. No delicate assembly. No headache-inducing cable management in the case. No dropping screws off the table and having them roll under the couch. Just take it out of the box and and start downloading&nbsp;<em>Hades II</em>. Right now for Prime Big Deals Days, you can save quite a big on a pre-built gaming PC. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4653/">The Alienware Aurora gaming desktop has dropped by 17%. That’s doesn’t sound like a lot, but it’s taking the price down from $1,845 to just $1,535. You’ll save $310.</a> That extra cash can buy an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription for… just shy of one year? Wow, Microsoft needs to get a grip.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4653/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Top-tier Gaming Versatility</h2>
<p>Let’s talk specs. This Alienware gaming PC tower is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7F processor and is packing the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card. You’ll be able to play any modern AAA game and even be able to push the settings quite a bit, maintaining a high and stutter-free framerate. It can even handle livestream your gaming to Twitch or YouTube.</p>
<p>You get a whopping 32GB of RAM plus a whole 1TB of storage. That’s a ton of space to get your started downloading all sorts of games off Steam, the Epic Games Store, or any of the other PC gaming storefronts. This build will also prove to perform reliably outside of gaming. Graphics and processor intensive workflows will be breezy on this machine. Touch up large files in Photoshop or edit together videos in 4K without a problem.</p>



<p>If you’re worried about overheating, this PC employs a 240mm heat exchanger which uses liquid cooling on the CPU to heighten thermal resistance. That should keep the temperatures relatively low during longer gaming sessions. It’s well ventilated allowing for efficient airflow, cooling and acoustics.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be a capital G “Gaming” PC without some RGB lighting. You can create and edit the AlienFX lighting across the whole ecosystem using the free Alienware Command Center software.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4653/">During Prime Big Deals Days, this RTX 5070 gaming PC from Alienware has come down by a dramatic $310.</a> Get it for just $1,535 for a limited time before the Amazon sales event is over.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A Universal Time is an action-adventure game within <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-roblox-safe-for-kids-truth-parental-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a>, boasting core RPG elements and a world that’s been heavily inspired by Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure and other similar anime stories. A Universal Time requires players to explore a large world and gain powers along the way. Alongside their exploration of the map, they will be required to take on various opponents, including NPCs as well as real players. Although the biggest inspiration for A Universal Time is Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, with the game including many of the anime’s ‘Stands’, it also showcases characters from other popular anime, including Dragon Ball, One Piece, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You will have to progress through the game to get stronger and unlock more powerful moves, and for newer players to the game, that can be a daunting task. With both PvP and PvE fights involved, getting ahead of the competition fast is of utmost importance, and using codes is a good way to make some quick progress. A Universal Time codes give players various rewards in the game, including Skin Chests, UCoins, UShards, and more, all of which will come in handy to the average player.</p>

<p>Although the game currently has only two active codes, more are likely to be added in the future. A Universal Time codes often have fixed timeframes when they will be usable, meaning that when existing codes expire, new ones will be added. </p>

There are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda plans to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps it’s more likely that we’ll get further updates on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, which just announced the upcoming Burning Springs update and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walton-goggins-is-set-to-play-the-ghoul-from-the-fallout-tv-show-in-fallout-76-but-how-does-the-character-fit-in-the-fallout-76-timeline">the addition of The Ghoul from Prime Video’s Fallout TV show</a>, featuring the likeness and voice work from Walton Goggins himself.

Howard opened up about the future of the hit post-apocalyptic RPG series during <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?si=Ua6SywsuPtdIr0yv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with YouTube content creator MrMattyPlays</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say, sort of rushing through them, or we kind of need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76… we don’t feel like we need to rush any of that," he said. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76.

"And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been trying to climb the side of this sheer cliff face for several hours using only my feet. The path is tricky and winding but at this point I know the footholds better than the faces of some of my friends. Some of them involve slightly shimmying my feet on a thin ridge of rock. Others involve lifting my leg out from the cliff face, swinging it over, and planting my foot until I feel something firm enough to lift my body up. I misjudge a step, my character tumbles; his body ping pongs back and forth between the side of the path and the conveniently built spiral stairwell next to the path, his head catching the green steel railing. I feel numb at this point. My character groans, gets up, I try again. This is the Manbreaker in <em>Baby Steps</em>, an unpleasant task that I have been told I do not need to do.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>This article contains some plot spoilers for <em>Baby Steps</em></strong>.</h3><p><em>Baby Steps </em>is the latest game from Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and, of course, Bennett Foddy. You may know Foddy from <em>QWOP,</em> <em>GIRP </em>and <em>Getting Over It, </em>games infamous for abstracting movement so that the player will often cartoonishly fall down<em>. </em>&nbsp;It follows an emotionally stunted thirty five year old man named Nate (played by Cuzzillo)&nbsp;who is stuck in a cocoon of permanent social isolation. Nate smokes a lot of weed, lives in his parents' basement, watches <em>One Piece, </em>and eats a lot of pizza. Suddenly he is Isekai’d from his couch to a surreal, looping, mountainous world that gradually slopes upwards to a mountain top. A helpful man named Jim (played by Foddy) attempts to explain the situation to him and give him shoes, but Nate refuses any help, instead insisting he’s just gonna go. The only thing he wants is to find a toilet because he needs to pee quite badly and refuses to pee outdoors.</p><figure></figure><p>Like <em>QWOP</em>, <em>Baby Steps</em> approximates natural movement in a way that feels stilted and unnatural at first. Whereas <em>QWOP </em>binds your thighs to the Q and W and your calves to O and P on the keyboard, <em>Baby Steps </em>binds the act of raising your left and right legs to L2 and R2 respectively, with trigger depth determining how much you raise your leg. A raised leg is then moved using the left analogue stick. This, along with <em>Returnal</em>, is one of the few games that uses the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_AE21WqhU4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adaptive Triggers</a> on the DualSense beautifully as it adds real texture to the sensation of walking. When you actually get good at using your legs, the sensation of walking feels organic in a jarring way.</p><p><em>Baby Steps </em>hit me at a strange time in my life. I currently have a broken foot with several pins sticking out of it. I have been sleeping on my couch since early August so that I can properly elevate my leg and not disturb my girlfriend’s sleep. I am a month into using <a href="https://aftermath.site/iwalkfree-review-broken-foot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a prosthetic crutch that is not unlike a peg leg,</a> a device that forces you to learn how to walk again in a stilted and alien way, but one that becomes second nature over time. I even went to a four day techno festival in nature that I have been going to for over a decade because my pride refused to let the broken foot win. The experience was brutal on my body, yet rewarding. I frequently climbed a steep incline to my cabin and crossed a treacherous floating bridge over a lake using trekking poles to stabilize myself. People kept offering help that I often refused. I was alarmed by how quickly I parsed <em>Baby Steps</em>’ internal logic.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the game, Jim constantly offers Nate help. He is like a bodhisattva, a sherpa whose only purpose in this world is to help the others get to the top of the mountain. And yet, through a combination of anxiety and stubbornness, Nate steadfastly refuses to outwardly accept help. His repeated rebukes of Jim builds throughout the entire game, and Nate’s bullshit attitude and awkwardness increasingly wear away at Jim’s patience. As you climb the mountain, going from biome to biome, you eventually see Jim’s masterpiece in the distance: a 250 story green spiral staircase (seemingly based on a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2221883/Taihang-Mountains-300ft-spiral-staircase-Chinese-tourists-taste-high-life.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real one in the Taihang mountains</a>) that he built for all the hikers to get to the top of the mountain easily.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>Jim is pleased with his staircase. It helps a lot of people achieve their goal of climbing up the mountain where they had previously toiled. But Nate is Nate, and he does not want to take it, instead pointing to a winding and dangerous mountain path.&nbsp;</p><p>JIM: “You can’t, it’s too hard for you.”</p><p>NATE: “It’s not that hard.”</p><p>JIM: “They call it the Manbreaker.”</p><p>NATE: “The Manbreaker?”</p><p>JIM: “Yeah, because many men have been broken trying to get up that thing.”</p><p>Nate boasts that he’s going to do it while Jim tells him if he does that he’s going to be bashing his head against the Manbreaker for the next five years. This devolves into childish bickering, with Jim forbidding Nate from climbing the stairs, insisting that if and when he gives up on the Manbreaker, he must call Jim “lord,” because he is the lord of the stairs.&nbsp;</p><p>Narratively this is a beautiful setup. <em>Baby Steps </em>is ultimately a game about swallowing your pride and accepting help, but one that fills itself with many totally optional challenges. It can be a brutally difficult game, but it is often only as hard as you want it to be. Nate has fucked you here a little bit, because he is objectively in the wrong and should just take the stairs. But Jim is being a dick, something he has every right to be given Nate’s behavior. It’s not that I wanted Nate to win, I just had to know what happened if Nate actually pulled that off. So my long journey on the Manbreaker began.</p><figure></figure><h2><strong>The Journey Begins</strong></h2><figure></figure><p>What makes the Manbreaker so punishing is not that the individual steps are harder than what you’ve faced, it’s that there’s a lot of them. The cliffs are constructed in a way that if you fall you are unlikely to go further than the base of the stairs, but you will often have to start from the beginning. Individual steps are just difficult enough to seem doable with a handful of distinct choke points in between. If you know what you are doing and don’t miss a single step, you can scale the entire thing in about twelve to twenty minutes. The real problem lies in landing every step, not slipping once. </p><figure><figcaption>This is actually way easier to pull off than shimmying on the right.</figcaption></figure><p>There’s an annoying slope that requires you to quickly scurry early on that will regularly cause you to slide off until you figure out the momentum of a scurry step. Sometimes the game gives you multiple ways to approach the same obstacle: one challenge right before the halfway point can be solved either by shimmying in a narrow ledge to your right or, more consistently I discovered, by placing your foot on a tiny outcropping to the left of the rock and swinging your legs over a few ledges back and forth twice.</p><figure><figcaption>The cutscene if you take the stairs up.</figcaption></figure><p>At the halfway point through the climb, either on the stairs or the Manbreaker, you will receive one of two cutscenes. Both involve Mike, a friendly hiker also played by Foddy who you have interacted with in the past. If you are on the stairs, Mike will be on the Manbreaker. He says Jim told him not to take the stairs, saying “Mike, you’re ready.” He feels confident in how far he has come in his abilities and expounds on the rapturous, sublime nature of climbing the path. Nate says the stairs are pretty good too. If you are on the Manbreaker, Mike instead is on the stairs. He asks you why you are doing that, and instead suggests you give up and take the stairs. No matter what path you take, the game tests your conviction by suggesting you are taking the wrong one.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>If cutscene if you take the manbreaker.</figcaption></figure><p>My girlfriend watched with a combination of bewilderment and schadenfreude as I subjected myself to this over several evenings. “Oh yeah you see you should not have done that,” she would chime in when my foot slipped and I tumbled hundreds of painful feet. At first I would get exceedingly pissed off whenever I fell off. And yet every time I fell off, I got less pissed. As the number of falls increased and I memorized my footholds, I realized that the Manbreaker was teaching me <em>Baby Steps</em> at a higher level. The frustration subsided. The Manbreaker could not hurt me. I locked in.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><h2><strong><strong>On locking in</strong></strong></h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="the most confusing motivational speech of all time" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yutsIpLK2Rs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>When I lock in, I think of a particular edit from streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/northernlion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Northernlion</a>. He is playing <em>The Game of Sisyphus</em>, a game clearly indebted to Foddy’s <em>Getting Over It</em>. The video is a supercut of him shouting a mixture of zenlike phrases and Instagram grindset guy advice. He is attempting to push the rock up the hill while the song "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPiAzPuxRG4&amp;list=RDwPiAzPuxRG4&amp;start_radio=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paranoia"<em> </em></a>by Kentenshi (itself a remix of the song "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqI97zHMoQw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Young Girl A</a>") plays. Northernlion’s advice is sublime and contradictory, punctuated by an aggressive drum machine and distorted Vocaloid samples. It is a speech that seems to suggest that everything is possible and nothing is possible, that your actions are both meaningless and, simultaneously, the only point in the world. If you listen to it enough times, you begin to reconcile those contradictions. On an even longer timeline, it begins to resemble a prayer.</p><p>“Lock in. Lock in. Get it twisted,” Northernlion begins. “If you lock in you can do anything. Motherfucker. Get it twisted, your actions impact nothing, your fate is predetermined, the only thing that you can change is your reaction to it. You can do anything you set your mind to, the world is a playground designed for you and only you to achieve your highest level ambitions. If you wait 90 minutes to wake up until you drink your first cup of coffee, nothing can stop you. If you duct tape your mouth when you fall asleep, nothing can stop you. Get it twisted. You are a pawn in a universe chess match. You mean nothing to God if they even exist. You’re a rounding error. You’re two pennies on a Fortune 500 company’s balance sheet; they don’t care about you in the slightest. Get it twisted. Everybody gets what they deserve in this life. If you put in effort you can achieve anything. Successful people are better people. Get it twisted! The circumstances of your birth determine where you are going to go. Nothing else matters at all: your own level of education, your attitude, your level of effort, your friends, your network, your business, your credentials. Motherfucker!”&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I consider this post a companion piece to the video.<span></span><span>@BPDboymoder</span></figcaption></figure><p>Those words swirled around in my head with every attempt, their contradictions becoming a centering hum. Waves of frustration would hit me, subside, and the words would redouble my resolve. Nothing was preventing me from leaving, but I could not leave. I had spent too much time studying the cliff face, learning its contours, the end was in sight. I would finish this. Lock in. Get it twisted.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Other broken men</strong></h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Baby Steps: Manbreaker breaks Grubb some more and more | GB Plays" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6C0qHaPwDRM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I was not the only broken man attempting the Manbreaker. As I was throwing myself off the mountain I saw others attempt this. Frequent contributor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/iantothemax.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ian Walker</a> was being punished by the path, as was Giant Bomb’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Grubb</a>, who streamed his attempts and got to the top before I did.</p><p>“I was already really into <em>Baby Steps</em> by the time I got to the manbreaker, and I was already onboard with the game's central metaphor (as I see it),” Grubb told me. “That is that all you can control in life is the next step that you take. Even if you're not that great at taking steps, that's the only option you have. Even if you get lost, that's the only option you have. So just take the next step, and eventually you'll take enough steps and you can look back and say: look how far I've come.When I got to the Manbreaker, it felt like the culmination of that idea but also an argument against it.”</p><p>“I think a lot of people will take the cutscene between Jim and Nate at the Manbreaker as a challenge to take the Manbreaker. But I definitely took it as a challenge to take the stairs—to ask for help,” he said. "Someone built this tool to help me get to where I'm going, but the toxic individualism—that has fueled me in life and that has been ingrained in me by my culture—wouldn't let me.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Grubb Breaker part 5 or something | GB Plays" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kwhFYM0dt-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“I need to feel like I did it on my own,” Grubb continued. “And I think that's actually a weakness. A flaw inserted into me strategically by a ruling class that does not want me to rely on others because then we might actually start working together.”</p><h2><strong>Mercy in design</strong></h2><figure><figcaption>A shortcut, either out or in. This is useful when the first part of the path stops being fun.</figcaption></figure><p>For as intricate and brutal as the design of the Manbreaker is, it is also compassionate. Each time you hit a new part of the Manbreaker you have to learn the encounter, and by the time you get to the upper layers of it, the prior parts begin to be tedious. But halfway through the run, at the point where you talk to Mike, the stairwell and path become close enough to almost touch for two levels. It is possible to give up on the Manbreaker at this point and take the stairs, or to use the stairs as a shortcut for finishing the end of the Manbreaker. If you decide to take the shortcut after you’ve already gotten the cutscene, the game does not penalize you for this and gives you the same outcome as if you had done it in one go. This is how both Jeff Grubb and I attempted the final climb. I refuse to call anybody "lord," but I’m old enough to know that repeating the bottom wasn’t proving anything.</p><figure></figure><p>The last series of steps in the Manbreaker are by far the worst in the whole run. The first step requires you to place your foot gently on a declining slope, let your body slide for half a second, then catch the platform with your other foot. You could spend an hour just mastering the timing of this one step. But the game dispenses this complex task with a small kindness, and positions most of these steps save the last few over your previous path. If you fall, you will more than likely have a second chance.</p><h2><strong>This is the end</strong></h2><p>(<strong>SPOILERS FOR THE END OF THE MANBREAKER/STAIRS BELOW</strong>)</p><p>This scenario has two potential endings. If you swallow your pride and take the stairs the whole way up, you are ambushed by Jim at the top. He is glowing and smug and makes you call him lord. He gives you a little ribbon and proclaims you are in an elite club called “Jiminny’s Crickets,” and the game gives you an achievement for this, almost condescendingly.</p><figure></figure><p>If, on the other hand, you decide to take the Manbraker then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OE_L57Bqak&amp;pp=0gcJCfwJAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nate arrives at the top gasping and gloating.</a> Jim is confused, unable to comprehend how Nate did it. Nate boasts that the climb was easy and suggests that perhaps the stairs were superfluous.</p><p>“But if the stairs are superfluous then maybe…Jim was superfluous,” Jim says in a broken voice, adding, “Lord.”&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>Jim then proceeds to throw himself off the cliff face (he is probably fine considering everyone in this world is immortal.). Nate broke a helpful man’s spirit, shattered Jim’s purpose in life, learned nothing about accepting help, and the game gives you no achievement for it.</p><figure><figcaption>Almooooost.</figcaption></figure><p>As toxic as it is, the Manbreaker felt worth it. After learning to carefully bottle up and regulate my emotions, triggering the cutscene caused a rush of relief to flood through my body all at once. The Manbreaker did not break me, but it changed me significantly. It is not simply a crucible of difficulty, but a beautifully written and designed riddle about rancid pride and sublime challenge chiseled directly into the cliff face. To beat it transforms you into a <em>Baby Steps</em> climbing god just as the game reaches its logical conclusion.</p><figure><figcaption>I am the lord.</figcaption></figure><p>“What do you do now?” my girlfriend asked.&nbsp;</p><p>“I guess I’ll just finish the game,” I responded, and climbed to the game’s conclusion at a breezy, unworried pace.</p><p><em><strong>Correction, 10/8/25, 12:55pm--</strong>An original version of this article occasionally misstated the name of character Jim. </em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-patch-notes-impaled-swordfishes"><h3>Good Patch Notes</h3></a><p>"The trash chute now ignores impaled swordfishes"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/epic-games-suing-two-fortnite-island-makers-over-inflated-bot-engagement"><h3>Epic Games Suing Two Fortnite Island Makers Over Inflated ‘Bot’ Engagement</h3></a><p>Epic Games says Idris Nahdi and Ayob Nasser made tens of thousands of dollars worth of ‘unwarranted payouts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending"><h3>Hades 2’s Story Doesn’t Change The Status Quo</h3></a><p>Melinoë's journey is more about acceptance than change</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-mori-calliope-vtuber-opening-anime-crunchyroll"><h3>VTuber Mori Calliope’s Anime Dream Came Full Circle In Creating Gachiakuta’s New Theme Song</h3></a><p>Mori Colliope's longtime love for Gachiakuta’s manga and her close bond with creator Kei Urana helped shape its explosive new song “Let’s Just Crash”</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-day-2025-broadcast-announced-for-october-23.1319962/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Bethesda Game Studios announced that the Fallout Day 2025 broadcast would be streamed live on October 23, 2025, at 1 PM Eastern Time via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch</a>, and Steam. Bethesda said fans can tune in to learn new information and announcements about 'existing Fallout games, community celebrations, and upcoming fan events'. October 23 is no random date: it's when the two-hour-long nuclear exchange between the United States and China led to the post-nuclear setting of Fallout.</p>



<p>When Bethesda mentions existing games, the mind immediately goes to Fallout 76, since it's the only franchise game that gets regular updates. However, Fallout 76 just got a major reveal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-dev-qa-bringing-ghoul-tv-show-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the deep dive of the Burning Springs update</a>. In December, Bethesda Game Studios will release a major land expansion, bringing Fallout players to Ohio for the first time in the franchise. The new region draws heavily on Fallout 3 and New Vegas aesthetics, aiming to recapture the feel of a harsh, depraved wasteland seen in those games. </p>



<p>Then there's the introduction of The Ghoul, the character played by Walton Goggins in the TV show, who is coming to the game and will introduce the bounty hunting feature with tiered contracts (grunt and head hunts). Bethesda hopes this will create ongoing, repeatable content that encourages both solo and cooperative play. The randomization of contract locations and the public event nature of head hunts foster community interaction and provide a robust source of rewards, addressing players’ desires for challenging but rewarding activities. </p>



<p>There might be some additional tidbits about the Burning Springs update to be shared in the upcoming Fallout Day broadcast, but by and large, the reveal for Fallout 76 already happened. As such, franchise fans are already hoping to hear something about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-3-oblivion-remasters-xbox-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-rumored Fallout 3 remaster</a>, as that might fall under 'existing Fallout games'. Of course, it's always possible that Bethesda has just found a new platform to launch Fallout 4 on, like the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

              <p>Like the original game, <i>Silent Hill f</i> sends players to an “abandoned” school during its protagonist’s attempts to escape the horrors of the fog. And similar to the original, the halls and classrooms of the school are adorned with everything you’d expect to find in an institution of learning: posters, calendars, lockers, bookshelves, cubbies; you name it, it’s there. That includes a bit of simple sheet music that many are likely to overlook as just part of the set dressing.</p> <p>It turns out, however that this slice of music, if performed, will sound awfully familiar to fans of the original <i>Silent Hill</i>. And it’s kinda spooky once you hear it, especially if you’re willing to indulge in the perilous, though fun, art of headcanoning. (Maybe kids singing this in school was what brought the fog to Ebisugaoka?)</p>

And with the help of a viewer who played the melody on guitar, the sheet music revealed itself to be none other than the opening song to the original <i>Silent Hill</i>.</p>  <p>While I can read and write music, my sight reading skills <i>suck</i>, so I wasn’t sure what music was on the sheet when I first saw it. That said, it doesn’t surprise me to find this little nugget packed into the game. <i>Silent Hill f</i>’s environmental storytelling is really on point. And if you don’t speak Japanese, I highly recommend using a simple translation tool like Google’s auto-translate to find all sorts of interesting messages that speak to the various themes in <i>Silent Hill f</i>, be they on signs that encourage traditional subservient roles for women in society or other creepy posters in the school that suggest you’re being watched.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000633283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633283"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633283">© Image: NeoBards Entertainment / Google / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure>
