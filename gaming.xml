			<p>The free-to-play third-person shooter game Star Wars: Hunters will debut soon <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2842320/STAR_WARS_Hunters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>, as announced yesterday by publisher Zynga (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-interactive-completes-merger-with-farmville-publisher-zynga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> a couple of years ago by Take-Two). Star Wars: Hunters debuted last June on iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Developed by British studio NaturalMotion, the game focuses on fast-paced 4v4 battles featuring a varied roster of characters to choose from: Ewok Grenadier Pilbush, Zabrak Archer Nox, Imperial Heavy Gunner Sentinel, Wookiee Juggernaught Grozz, Dark Side Assassin Rieve, Rodian Sawbones Skora, Mandalorian Vanguard Aran Tal, Twin Shield Droid K-AOS, Jedi Droid J-3DI, Jawa Scavenger Utooni, Unrelenting Bounty Hunter Imara Vex, Miraluka Sharpshooter Diago, Rebel War Hero Zaina, Mon Calamari Prodigy Sprocket, Droideka Speedster Slingshot, and Trandoshan Trapper Charr. Each character comes with their own weapons and abilities.</p>
<p>Star Wars: Hunters currently features four modes: Squad Brawl, Dynamic Control, Power Control, and Trophy Chase. It was also supposed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/huttball-from-swtor-will-be-available-in-star-wars-hunters-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">include</a> Star Wars: The Old Republic's unique Huttball mode, but it seems it was removed before the launch.</p>
<p>While the official PC launch is scheduled for January 27, interested players can sign up right now on the Steam page for the upcoming playtests, which will take place between December 13 and 16 and again between January 10 and 13. The best news, though, is that Star Wars: Hunters will feature full cross-play and cross-progression between all the available platforms. As such, you will be able to carry over your existing progress, provided you connect your Zinga ID account.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars: Hunters™ | PC Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qubow1v9zFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The main perk of the PC version will be enhanced graphics compared to the mobile platforms. Even so, the system requirements are very low, as you can see below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Minimum:</em></strong><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i3-4130 or AMD FX-8320</em><br>
<em>Memory: 4 GB</em><br>
<em>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GT 730 or AMD Radeon R7 240</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 11</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Recommended</strong>:</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i5 4570 or AMD Ryzen 3 1200</em><br>
<em>Memory: 8 GB</em><br>
<em>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 660 or AMD Radeon R9 270</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 11</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Recommended 4K:</em></strong><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i5 7500 or AMD Ryzen 5 1400</em><br>
<em>Memory: 8 GB</em><br>
<em>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB or AMD Radeon R9 390X</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 11</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB</em></p>
<p>The current plan is to launch Star Wars: Hunters out of early access at some point in the middle of 2025.</p>

"I was the first non-technical person to join the team as the company, Sony Corporation at the time, started to plan to bring PlayStation to market," he explained, noting how the initial team formed by Ken Kutanagi was largely comprised of engineers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When I joined [PlayStation], it was still just a department.

He described the role as fun but challenging, largely because there weren't many people who believed in 3D graphics at the time.

            <p>Three more classic Sega Mega Drive games have today joined Nintendo's Switch Online catalogue.</p>
<p>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron, Vectorman, and Wolf of the Battlefield: Mercs are now available for Expansion Pack members.</p>
<p>The former two games are both platformers exclusive to the Mega Drive.</p>

<p>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron, released in 1993, followed the first ToeJam &amp; Earl game from 1991, continuing the adventures of its whacky alien protagonists. However, it's a straightforward side-scrolling platformer where the previous game was inspired by Rogue.</p>
<p>Vectorman, meanwhile, was released in 1995 and was notable for its pre-rendered 3D models, rivalling those of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> on the SNES.</p>
<p>Wolf of the Battlefield: Mercs, meanwhile, is an earlier game from the platform: a top-down shooter adapted by Sega from the Capcom arcade game.</p>

		<p>Shuhei Yoshida has announced that he is leaving PlayStation in January 2025, bringing an end to a 31 year stint at the company that has gone hand-in-hand with the 30 years of PlayStation itself.</p>
<p>Making the announcement in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/">an interview on the PS Blog</a> and PlayStation Podcast, Yoshida-san said:</p>


<p>“I’ve been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation. And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on. You know, the company’s been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation.</p>
<p>“So you know, PlayStation is in really good hands. I thought, okay, this is my time.”</p>
<p>One of the first members of the PlayStation project at Sony in February 1993, Yoshida-san is best known for his stint as&nbsp;President of PlayStation Studios from 2008 to 2019 (then known as SIE Worldwide Studios). In that time he was the steward to the PlayStation 3’s continued revival through the second half of the generation, helped to being indie gaming to PlayStation in a major way through the PlayStation Store, and was one of PlayStation’s main figureheads around the time of the PlayStation 4 launch, affectionately known as Shu throughout the PlayStation fanbase.</p>

<p>He even featured in one of the single defining moments of the run up to the PS4 and Xbox One launch, featuring in a video alongside Adam Boyes as the company dunked on Microsoft’s unpopular planned changes to physical game ownership and digital rights at that time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Official PlayStation Used Game Instructional Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kWSIFh8ICaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since stepping down from head of PlayStation Studios in 2019, Yoshida-san has had the role of Head of Indies Initiative at PlayStation. This has largely taken him out of the spotlight, though indie games have been on of his biggest passions over the last 15 years.</p>
<p>“One time stood out for me in my memory as something really, really special was when Journey got the Game of the Year Award,” he explained. “Journey was distributed through PlayStation Network. It was a digital-only, small game. You can finish playing the game within like three hours.</p>
<p>“But that game…[won] Game of the Year against all these AAA titles, I think for the first time in the industry….the creator Jenova Chen did a talk at the summit, and he talked about a letter he received from a girl who lost her father and she thought about her father and she was able to move on in her life.</p>
<p>“The whole audience stood up and the whole room was filled with happiness and an amazing feeling that this small game could have such a big impact on people’s lives.”</p>
<p>We wish him all the best with whatever he has planned next.</p>

            <p>The next round of cards joining <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> have leaked ahead of December's events.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-events-revealed-in-datamine">datamines revealed multiple cards and events arriving in December</a> with gen one starter Bulbasaur and its evolutions as the focus.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to a new update of the app, promo cards for the next Wonder Pick and Solo Battle events have leaked. And yes, Bulbasaur is included.</p>

<p>As shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1h01lva/new_app_update_confirms_new_promo_cards_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a>, the following Pokémon will feature and all have new card artwork: Jigglypuff, Onix, Greninja, Haunter, Bulbasaur, and Magnemite.</p>
<p>The latter two are particularly important as they reportedly will be the focus of the forthcoming Wonder Pick event. That Onix artwork looks a little interesting though.</p>
<p>These cards will all feature in a Venusaur PvE event set to begin on 29th November and run until 13th December. Much like the Lapras Ex event, players will battle against AI in solo battles for the rewards.</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has already proven incredibly popular since its launch last month - in its first three weeks it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-already-surpassed-120m-since-release">surpassed $120m in total earnings</a>.</p>
<p>Don't forget to also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-dont-forget-to-spend-your-pokemon-tcg-pocket-pack-points">spend your pack points</a>: these are earned by opening booster packs and can be spent on specific cards, but they have an unknown expiry date.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-writer-and-director-announces-worlds-untold-split-with-netease-work-on-the-sci-fi-game-is-paused/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the span of a few hours, two promising projects from former Mass Effect developers were abruptly halted. Both were sci-fi titles that fans hoped could be reminiscent of BioWare's acclaimed RPG saga.</p>
<p>The first one, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-director-shuts-down-his-new-studio-due-to-lack-of-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> two days ago, was Casey Hudson's Humanoid Origin studio, which had to be shut down due to a sudden lack of funding. A few hours ago, Mac Walters announced similar news (though not as dire) for his Worlds Untold studio <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>As you might recall, Mac Walters, a writer on Mass Effect 3 and game director on Andromeda and the Legendary Edition compilation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/worlds-untold-qa-ex-mass-effect-writer-gets-netease-funding-to-make-a-sci-fi-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> Worlds Untold last year with funding from NetEase. That's the problem: they have split with NetEase and are now seeking another partner. In the meantime, work on the project had to be stopped.</p>
<p><em>It’s hard to find the right words for this, but I wanted to share that we’ve made the very difficult decision to pause operations at Worlds Untold while we search for a new partner to help bring our vision to life. This was not a decision we made lightly—it’s been a deeply personal journey, and we’re all so proud of everything this team has built together. </em><em>In the meantime, our incredible team members will be exploring new opportunities.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a heartbreaking moment for everyone involved, but I’m deeply grateful for the support of our partners, friends and family, and for the time we’ve had together at Worlds Untold. While we’re pausing for now, this isn’t goodbye—there’s more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right.</em></p>
<p>We interviewed former Mass Effect writer and director Mac Walters last year as part of the news announcement, and we learned that the project would be more of an action/adventure title rather than an RPG, more story-driven and linear.</p>
<p><em>I've done RPGs and I love them, but I wanted to do something that led with story. It's an action RPG but with a lot of story and as much as we were always able to blend that into the RPG choose-your-own-adventure style, I really like the idea of telling something that's perhaps a little bit more linear. It looks at choice and consequence and things like that but in a different light.</em></p>
<p><em>I was also looking at some of the games that I had enjoyed recently, whether it was The Last of Us, Uncharted, or Tomb Raider that I get kind of get swept away in. I really wanted to focus on building a game that allowed me to tell a great adventure story.</em></p>
<p>We wish Walters and all the Worlds Untold team members involved the very best.</p>

            <p>I just played the neon bathroom graffiti on magic mushrooms stylings of<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games"> puzzle</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/children-of-the-sun">Children Of The Sun</a> for the first time last night, and it is very much my thing. It’s glowy! It’s violent! It’s thinky! You can <em>be</em> a <em>bullet, </em>and <em>then</em> you can be <em>another bullet</em>! Mental! (It’s technically the same bullet, but still!)</p>
<p>The basic idea is you take out stages of dudes, but you lose if you ever shoot without killing something. You move to where your bullet lands, so you have to plan routes through all the enemies, making sure one target is in view of the next. Also, you can steer the bullets if you want. Sometimes you can snipe a bird and feel the soaring freedom of a top down-view. Sometimes you snipe a fish and feel like a bastard. It’s great.</p>
<p>It’s also currently 40% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309950/Children_of_the_Sun/">on Steam</a>, alongside a new horde mode update. Trailer below, and details below-erer.</p>

<p>“Take on entire platoons of THE CULT’s brainwashed minions, but watch out for a new enemy that can fire back,” reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1309950/view/4481739601737681384">the update</a>. “The sniper cultist has a bullet with your name on it, and will put a premature end to your quest for vengeance if you don’t find a way to deal with them”. I am literally just learning about this now. I’m only about eight levels in. Enemies that can fire back sound silly, in a good way.</p><p>“If you’re wondering how THE GIRL can take on an entire horde of cultists with only one bullet, well, now she can reload: by shooting herself,” it continues. Ahhhh. Now that does sound interesting - factoring your own position into the puzzle routes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-over-30-million-units-says-cdpr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, during their financial report for Q3 2024, CD Projekt RED announced that Cyberpunk 2077 has now surpassed 30 million units sold, while its expansion, Phantom Liberty, has sold 8 million in around a year.</p>
<p>Michał Nowakowski, Joint CEO of CDPR, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>In less than four years since release, we’ve already sold 30 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077, and as for Phantom Liberty – in just over a year, it has sold over 8 million copies. These are impressive figures. I’m very happy to see a large, dedicated community coalesce around our Cyberpunk games. In the coming year, the base game, along with its expansion, will be released to a new group of users: owners of Mac devices powered by Apple Silicon chips.</em></p>
<p>Despite the controversial launch that featured many bugs and issues, especially on consoles, Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the most anticipated games of all time, following up on what was arguably the best game of the previous generation - The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. As such, even with all those caveats, it was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-the-biggest-digital-launch-ever-refunds-didnt-substantially-affect-aggregate-sales-says-superdata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest digital launch ever</a>, with an estimated 10.2 million units by January 2021. Sales probably slowed down for a while after that due to word of mouth and the fact that Sony outright removed the game from its PlayStation Store for several months.</p>
<p>However, CD Projekt RED's constant updates completely turned around the reception, culminating in the release of Update 2.0 and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. All this work paid off, allowing what was already a rough diamond to properly shine. The sales are only the obvious consequence.</p>
<p>It wasn't just Cyberpunk 2077 that performed well for the Polish studio, as The Witcher 3 continues to sell even nine years after its launch. Overall, total revenue amounted to $55.7 million, while the company registered a consolidated net profit of $19 million.</p>
<p>The other big news of the day was, as already <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, the announcement that The Witcher 4 (codenamed Project Polaris) is officially in full-scale production. On this, Nowakowski said:</p>
<p><em>I'm proud to confirm that several weeks ago the Polaris team wrapped up preproduction and moved on to full-scale production – the most intensive phase of development. We are very pleased with our progress on this project, and I wish to thank the team for its dedication.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Cyberpunk 2077 sequel Project Orion <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-gets-high-profile-hires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has its own North American-based team</a>, so work on that game continues separately. However, it's clear that most of CDPR's attention will be on the upcoming The Witcher game for the next few years.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kai-cenat-twitch-sub-record-hanging/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kai-cenat-beats-twitch-sub-record-%E2%80%93-but-he-had-to-hang-someone-along-the-way.1046229/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kai-cenat-twitch-sub-record-hanging/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kai Cenat has beaten his subscriber world record, racking up more than 580,000 concurrent Twitch subscribers during his Mafiathon 2 superstream. He has easily stormed past all previously set records, and since November 2, his channel has been live 24 hours a day. There’s no sign of the subathon slowing down.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the superstar streamer found himself in hot water following a bit on his broadcast that saw him and his friends ‘hang’ someone, prompting Kai to be concerned about getting banned from Twitch for what was later revealed to be a planned prank.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-did-kai-hang-someone">Did Kai Hang Someone?</h2>



<p>On social media, clips of the event are being circulated like wildfire, showing a topless man hanging from a high bar on Kai Cenat’s stream. A rope is pulled and the man, whose hands are bound, hangs for a few seconds, kicking his legs, until he’s brought down from the noose.</p>



<p>He’s then tended to by a medical team.</p>



<p>At first blush, Kai and his team seemed to be shocked and perplexed about the event. They’d strolled out into Kai’s garden not knowing what to expect, then they found a man willing to be hoisted <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2311951387?t=4h29m49s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">up in a noose live on stream</a> – for clout and content, of course.</p>



<p>As a preface, it was revealed that the man being hung was Max Major, a YouTube ‘magician’ with a professional penchant for tricks like this. Later on, Kai shared a video, in which Major explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>What you don’t know is that was all according to my plan. See, at the start of my performance, I said that tonight was all about choices. But not just the choices that you made tonight, but the choices that you made since the day that we met. </em></p>



<p><em>Since the first time we met, you pushed me, you challenged me, and you wanted to see me fail. And I thought tonight, I’ll give you exactly what you asked for.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>By that point, Kai had already beaten his Twitch subscriber record, but the stunt was able to push him even further and put him in a high-ranking position on various social media platforms as a trending topic.</p>

That said, Advent Children's highly detailed CGI quality was lauded upon release, and even today, it stands as a testament to Square Enix's powerful tech--especially this 4K Blu-ray edition.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray\/dp\/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (4K Blu-ray)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray\/dp\/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$11.89 (was $31)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>While Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within has a notorious reputation as a failure that cost Square Enix (at the time Squaresoft) millions of dollars and eventually led to Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi leaving the company, it's still worth checking out for die-hard Final Fantasy fans--especially when the 4K edition is on sale for this low--click the coupon box on the listing to get the full discount.</p><p>Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within looks and sounds unlike most other Final Fantasy properties, especially of the era, taking place on Earth in the distant future, and featuring a hard sci-fi plot with only the most tenuous ties to the rest of the franchise.

While he was executive producer on early games like C<em>rash Bandicoot: Warped</em> and <em>The Legend of Dragoon</em>, he later moved into leadership role across the business group, eventually becoming president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide studios. </p><p>He told the PlayStation podcast that <em>Journey</em>’s release in 2012 on PS3 as a download-only indie hit that went on to win Game of the Year was a career highlight. “But that game…[won] Game of the Year against all these AAA titles, I think for the first time in the industry….the creator Jenova Chen did a talk at the summit, and he talked about a letter he received from a girl who lost her father and she thought about her father and she was able to move on in her life,” Yoshida said. “The whole audience stood up and the whole room was filled with happiness and an amazing feeling that this small game could have such a big impact on people’s lives.”</p><p>The executive was also well know for his own development experience and design sense.

He eventually stepped down from being the head of Worldwide studios in 2019, at which point then-Guerrilla Games studio head Hermen Hulst stepped into the role amid a reshuffling of PlayStation leadership. Hulst is now co-CEO of PlayStation alongside Hideaki Nishino.</p><p>Yoshida’s announcement marks the second major departure from PlayStation in under a year, after previous Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan retired last spring. It will also leave the console maker without one of its most high-profile execs and visible faces in the community, with a long track record of popularity among fans.

<p>PlayStation veteran&nbsp;Shuhei Yoshida is leaving PlayStation in January. His retirement comes after more than 30 years with Sony, spending his time with PlayStation since its beginnings in 1993.</p>



<p>Yoshida, who made the announcement on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official PlayStation Blog</a>, is set to leave PlayStation on January 15, 2025.</p>



<p>“I’ve been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation,” he said. “And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on.</p>



<p>“You know, the company’s been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yoshida has spent the last while as Head of Indies Initiative for Sony. Prior to that, he was President of SIE Worldwide Studis from 2008 to 2019.</p>



<p>While he’s been a part of large moments in PlayStation history, one may stand out to fans the most. In 2013, while Sony was unveiling the PlayStation 4 (PS4) at E3 2013, Sony took a jab at Microsoft’s disastrous Xbox One reveal earlier the same day. In short tutorial video, Yoshida and former Vice President of Publisher and Developer Relations Adam Boyes showed fans how they can share used games on the PS4.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>At the time of publishing, Sony hasn’t made any official announcement regarding who will take over for Yoshida as Head of Indies Initiative.</p>



<p>When making his decision to leave, Yoshida said that he believes PlayStation “is in really good hands” moving forward.</p>



<p>“I thought, okay, this is my time,” he said.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review-in-progress.1046148/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like its predecessor, with the entirety of planet Earth available to explore, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has a whole lot to do. 2020’s Microsoft Flight Simulator was the first (and, so far, only) 10 I've given in a review, and the enormity of the options available in this year’s follow-up have only been tempered by the lingering problems that accompany them. Because codes weren’t available early and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-steam-reviews-collapse-to-overwhelmingly-negative-dev-admits-it-completely-underestimated-excitement-for-the-game">unexpected turbulence</a> at takeoff made it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/flight-sim-2024-players-getting-stuck-in-hours-long-loading-screens-xbox-says-its-working-on-the-issue">literally impossible to play</a> for the first 24 hours, I’m still working on my up and coming aviation career, as well as this review. For now, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has some extraordinary features to set it apart, but its impact is also falling short of how blown away I was by the last edition, and I really wanted to be blown away. Instead, I'm "merely" impressed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right off the rip, the biggest new addition to Flight Simulator 2024 is its career mode. You pick a starting airport as your home base, get hired by a fictional aviation company, and begin progressing through your career as a pilot. It all plays out like a traditional video game skill tree: after you master the beginner missions, you open up new options, and completing them opens up further opportunities still. So you can get a tail wheel endorsement, for example, after you complete the requirements for a commercial pilots license, which then opens up options for newer planes and jobs like search and rescue, or you can get certified in rotor craft (helicopters) which leads to stuff like operating a sky crane. Which, to me personally, elicits a "hell yeah." Each new certification or endorsement also opens up different jobs you can pick from, ranging from simple stuff like flightseeing, to more complex operations like, well, anything to do with the helicopters, basically.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Real-World Locations</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually you earn enough money and reputation to throw off the bonds of your employment and start your own aviation company. I haven't gotten that far yet, but I am moving along with my fixed wing endorsements at a pretty good pace. To what end, I haven't yet decided, but I'm looking forward to opening my own company and taking the lion's share of the profits. Those profits are used to further grow your business, and I can’t wait until I can afford my own fleet of aircraft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first few missions in career mode are just basic flight training, meant to familiarize you with the ins and outs of flying a plane. What I found disappointing is that the flight training is pretty much identical to the tutorials from 2020. All the training missions take place at the same airfield in Sedona, Arizona as 2020 and the actual tasks are exactly the same. The only real difference is that the AI-generated instruction and on-screen advice is a little more clear about what's expected of you in any given mission. I do appreciate the default tooltips in 2024 because there are about a million different buttons that do a million different things, and I used to have to go to Google whenever I'd forget how to release my parking brake. (I don't even think I'll end up turning them off like I did in 2020, just because I'm a forgetful fellow.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The further you get in career mode, the more mission types open up.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After the initial training missions, you do a few flights to get enough hours in to test for your commercial pilot's license. Taking the tests costs in-game currency, but you only need to pay for it once and you can retake it as many times as you need. You also need to have enough experience and do well enough in the training missions – but if you are already an experienced pilot, you can just jump right into the test and skip the lessons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The further along you get, the more missions and mission types open up. What I thought was a little strange, however, was that they don't all open up near your home airport. I picked a small airfield in the deepest parts of eastern Maine, KMVM Machias Valley Airfield, but after my initial missions, I was being sent to Europe to complete aircraft delivery and skydive missions. It's not something that bothers me too much, but it did come across as odd, which pulled me out of the “career” illusion I had built up for myself. Lousy imagination!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, I'm actually really loving career mode. In 2020’s iteration, I would make-up little missions for myself, like delivering pizza by air from Knox County Regional Airport in Owl's Head, Maine to the remote Matinicus Island 20 miles off the coast (a real thing that happens, by the way). Having structured reasons to better familiarize myself with the aircraft and patterns in the sky is going to keep me on course, so to speak, and stealthily make me into a better sim-pilot. So far it's my favorite part of Flight Simulator 2024 and I'm looking forward to starting either my own airline or a helicopter sky crane company. Or both! I've got time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new addition is the challenge league. This mode is the most game-y of them all, but retains all the simulation flight models and physics I love. There are three challenges each week, as well as leaderboards, which I am a huge fan of because I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the three available in the first round, my favorite is the F/A-18 rally race through the Grand Canyon. You fly Maverick's modern jet of choice through a section of the canyon, slaloming gates in a hunt for pure speed. Since it's still the same flight model under the hood, that’s not as easy as it seems – but holy crap is it fun as hell. It took me a lot of tries to get to my final score of around 1 minute 54 seconds, and that's not even a <em>good </em>score: it only put me in the Bronze league. But the satisfaction of seeing my time raised up above the Xbox Live Gamertag of someone who I don't know at all, but is unknowingly my arch-nemesis, is great. I'm looking forward to revisiting the challenges each week. The previous Flight Simulator had landing challenges with leaderboards, too, but as fun as those were, they didn't quite hit the dynamism of flying a fighter jet through one of the world's seven natural wonders.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Take Your Pic</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the things I liked the most about the last Flight Simulator was how it let me visit places I'd either never been before or would almost certainly never visit again. In Flight Simulator 2024, sightseeing has been placed front and center in the photo challenges mode. You visit famous landmarks and places around the world and take photos of them. The type and criteria of the photos changes with each landmark. For example, in the first photo challenge, you need to take a picture of the Great Sphinx while the sun is above its right shoulder on the equinox. Oh, and you need to do it on foot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's one of the biggest and coolest new features: you can land, get out of your plane, and walk around. However, it's not quite as elegant as I had hoped it would be. First of all, your walking speed is paced realistically, just like the rest of the simulator, (who would have guessed?) so if you've been playing first-person video games all your life, walking at an actual human's pace feels almost painfully slow. Secondly, the level of detail is going to depend on a whole bunch of different factors, like the power of your PC, the strength of your internet connection, and the health of the cloud servers, so your mileage can (and probably will) vary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, in spite of some weirdly GoldenEye-esque objects around the Great Pyramid complex, the up-close terrain itself is really detailed. The sand and desert rocks look incredibly realistic, and the ground in general now seems to look more like how ground is actually supposed to look around the world. If you taxi through tall grass at the end of a rural runway, for example, the tracks from your wheels remain even when you return later. Same thing with snow or mud. Mud will even stick to your wheels and supposedly have an effect on your aerodynamics, although I can't speak to how true that is on account of never having flown an actual plane with mud-caked tires. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also way more animals now. Instead of static points on a map telling you "there is a giraffe here," animals now pop up in the places you'd expect them to be. I very much felt like I was actually at an airfield in Maine when a bull moose plodded its way across the airstrip as I held short of the active runway. I haven't seen any other animals myself, but I know they're there because Flight Simulator 2024 uses an open-source database of animal locations to put them where they're supposed to be – so with some luck, I can go to Africa and see some lions before long.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Graphical Improvements</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And when you lift your head up from the ground, Flight Simulator 2024 can look much better than its predecessor across the board (with an emphasis on <em>can</em>). The improvement is especially stark in a place like the Grand Canyon, which I visited many times in 2020’s Flight Simulator. Whereas before it looked very obviously like a smooth, texture-mapped computer model up close, now it looks amazingly like the real thing. I am currently running Flight Simulator 2024 on a pretty beastly PC: it has an i9-13900K processor, a Radeon RX 7900XT GPU, and 64GBs of DDR5 RAM (disclosure, the RAM was provided by Corsair). With that setup, this year’s Flight Simulator looks and runs way better. Mostly. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem comes from the fact Flight Simulator 2024 is streamed from the cloud, and so far they haven't ironed out all the issues. In career mode, I did a flightseeing mission around Venice, Italy, and St. Mark's Basilica was a purple-checkered polygonal model with no textures whatsoever, while the rest of Venice was rendered in perfect detail. I honestly would rather have something like the world map packs of 2020’s Flight Simulator living on my SSD and only stream the boring parts. Right now, though, there's no way to do that, and the reliance on cloud streaming was something the Flight Simulator team really hammered on the importance of leading up to launch, so I'd be surprised if they switched to some kind of hybrid model at this point. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in spite of everything looking really good on my beastly PC, it's worth noting that my GPU is running at 100% capacity at the recommended settings in order to make that happen. When I turned the graphics down to the next lower preset, it only brought GPU usage down to 98%. That ain't good. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Current Thoughts</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In spite of what can reasonably be described as a catastrophic launch, I'm already pretty much in love with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 – I'm just not blown away like I was five years ago, when I first found myself faced with the opportunity to fly to literally any place on Earth. That option remains, of course, and it's been vastly improved by some smart new features, but it doesn't have that same impact, either. As we move away from the rocky launch, I'm encountering fewer and fewer issues, which gives me the chance to focus on what I love about Flight Simulator. Usually that’s flying around aimlessly, but this time career mode is also giving me real reasons to take off, as well as a better understanding of the world of commercial aviation. I'm going to keep at it before I render my final verdict, but right now, in spite of its initial problems, I think Flight Simulator 2024 is pretty damn great, even if it hasn’t caught the lightning in a bottle that was the last Flight Simulator once again.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on. You know, the company’s been doing great. I love [<a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,426 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>], I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation. So you know, PlayStation is in really good hands. I thought, okay, this is my time.”</p><p>Yoshida joined Sony Interactive Entertainment, then Sony Computer Entertainment, when it was still just a department under PlayStation creator Ken Kutaragi.</p><p>“Ken’s team was doing the development, and there was another team under <a title="Companies > Sony Music Entertainment Japan [246 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-music-entertainment-japan">Sony Music Entertainment Japan</a> making games for Super <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [21,174 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a>, and that was another small team preparing to make games for PlayStation,” Yoshida said. “So the two teams merged, Ken’s team under Sony and Sato-san’s team under Sony Music Entertainment Japan, to create Sony Computer Entertainment in November 1993. When the company was established as a joint venture, we held a party and everybody was in one room at the hotel [laughs]. I remember we had about 80 people total. We were very small.”</p><p>Yoshida’s job was to talk to publishers and developers in Japan, making phone calls and visits in hopes that they would make games for PlayStation. Yoshida eventually became president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, today known as PlayStation Studios, before stepping down to lead Sony Interactive Entertainment’s indie games initiative.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“When I was managing [PlayStation Studios] working with big studios, making AAA games was great,” Yoshida said. “However, when I went to events like E3 or Gamescom, I always went to the indie game area. And I found games that I liked, and oftentimes the developer was there showcasing it. So I’d take a photo with the developer, trying to help promote these games.”</p><p>As for what the future holds, Yoshida said while he has no plans yet, he <a href="https://twitter.com/yosp/status/1861562394251825531" rel="noopener" target="_blank">would like to stay in the industry</a>, helping independent game developers.</p><p>“I have a couple of events to visit. The Game Awards are in December. I have commitments to the Taipei Game Show in January and <a title="Companies > DICE [231 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/electronic-arts/dice">DICE</a> Summit in February, because I’m on the board… so that I’ll continue to do. But other than that, I have no plan. I enjoy my free time… I would like to continue to help indie developers or indie publishers if they need me. So I’ll probably continue to help these creative, talented indie teams in the future.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They each possess characteristics and sport trademarks of the great Zombies maps of yore. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle des Morts</a> on the way, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> Zombies fans are being spoiled.</p>



<p>With three Zombies maps already confirmed, the internet is already rife with speculation about a potential fourth. If gossip is to be believed, the fourth—or any subsequent maps—may turn back the pages of history and welcome back Tranzit to a new audience.</p>

<figure><figcaption>No time for food. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no confirmation of Tranzit returning in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and nothing has leaked via data mining at this moment.</strong></p>



<p>Anything you read about Tranzit returning in Black Ops 6 is pure speculation and conjecture. There is genuinely nothing to substantiate this rumor, but there is a reason why the Tranzit conversation continues to lurk around every undead corner.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-tranzit-rumored-for-black-ops-6">Why is Tranzit rumored for Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 Tranzit rumor is based on the <strong>“Black Ops 6: ‘The Truth Lies’ – Live Action Reveal Trailer”</strong> launched on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty’s official YouTube channel</a> back on <strong>May 28</strong>.</p>



<p>Several references pertaining to Tranzit pop up during the 57-second trailer. You can see the footage in its entirety below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Interestingly, one of Call of Duty’s leading social media personalities, where Zombies is concerned—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MrRoflWaffles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MrRoflWaffles</a>—broke down why they think Tranzit is destined for a revisit in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>They found several familiar-looking objects and locations in the trailer, and went as far as to say a “<strong>Tranzit-inspired remake</strong>” could be on the cards, but stressed it’s only a “<strong>theory</strong>.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Again, this is all we have on the Tranzit rumors right now. Trust me, I want to see the map return just as badly as many of you reading this right now do. </p>



<p>If you’re a newer CoD player, Black Ops 2’s Tranzit has a special place for many due to its unique map design—featuring a moving bus taking you to several mini-locations all within the overall confines of the map. You could also customize and upgrade the bus mid-round, and it’s still one of the most original Zombies maps to date.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as you never, we may find official information confirming or shutting down the Tranzit rumor.</p>

Additionally, Torvenius stated that The Great Circle won't have instant fails during stealth missions, which is something that another game based on a Lucasfilm property, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/" data-ref-id="1900-6418273">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, only recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-is-dropping-forced-stealth-so-you-can-start-blasting-your-way-out-of-trouble/1100-6527925/" data-ref-id="1100-6527925">fixed with a new patch</a>.</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will arrive on Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9.

                <p>Ubisoft is reportedly working on an Animal Crossing-inspired game called Alterra. In the game, players will build their home on an island inhabited by NPCs called "Matterlings." Players can leave their home to discover new biomes, Matterlings, and materials out in broader environs.</p><p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-alterra-animal-crossing-inspired-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> first reported on Alterra's development. According to the report, the game will use voxels to generate its world. For the unfamiliar, voxel graphics display cubes on a grid, a la Minecraft. Alterra is also set to feature building and crafting mechanics, letting players construct items and locations out of materials they find out in the world. The report claims Alterra was developed from a cancelled project which also used voxel graphics.</p><p>Insider Gaming claims they have seen images of Alterra's NPCs. The Matterlings are reported to resemble Funko Pops, i.e. cartoon figures with large heads, albeit in a voxel style. Some Matterlings resemble fictional creatures like dragons, others real-world animals like birds and polar bears.</p><p>The report asserts that Alterra is under development at Ubisoft Montreal. Patrick Redding (formerly lead on Gotham Knights) is the project's creative director. Fabien Lhéraud--who has worked as a marketing, brand, and media manager at Ubisoft for over 20 years--is Alterra's lead producer. The report indicates that the game has been in development for 18 months and is likely still years away.</p>

But it’s also become ground zero for a newly invigorated debate about theater etiquette that’s been raging for a few years now and is only getting more heated as more people than ever whip out their phones to take photos and videos of the latest big movie. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/wicked-movie-release-fans-singing-amc-theaters-b2653257.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/wicked-movie-release-fans-singing-amc-theaters-b2653257.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Or start singing</a></span>.

They asked people to share their photos of seeing <em>Wicked</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/nat_dwbua_/status/1860541618060943677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/nat_dwbua_/status/1860541618060943677" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hundreds of people did</a></span>. It was all very depressing and frustrating to see. It then led to even more people calling out the initial post and getting into online debates.</p><p>The arguments that the people taking photos usually trot out include things like, “I had my screen dimmed and only took one or two pictures!” or “I paid money, I’m allowed to use my phone!” or even “I want to chat with my friends while watching a movie.” </p><p>All of these arguments are dumb. </p><p>I don’t care how dim your device’s screen is, you taking a photo is annoying. I’d also wager that anyone willing to hoist their camera up—possibly blocking other people’s view of the screen—to take an image of the movie in a packed theater is likely the kind of person who might also start singing or talking loudly, ruining the experience for other people trying to enjoy the film.</p><p>Also, you paid money for a ticket to watch a movie. That’s it. That ticket doesn’t magically make you more important than anyone else or absolve you from following the same rules that apply to all moviegoers at your theater. How many fucking ads and videos begging you to turn off your phone and be quiet do you need to see before the movie starts? </p><p>And if you want to chat with your friends or text or video call them or whatever, why are you doing that in a theater? If you are trying to reach someone because of an emergency, step outside. If someone you really want to talk to DMs you, step outside. If you get a phone call, please, step outside! </p><p>One time while at a movie, I got a phone call from my father. I had my phone set to vibrate and when I got the call, I looked down, saw he called, got up and texted him from the hallway. It wasn’t an emergency, so I told him I’d call back later, put my phone away, and went back to my seat. It’s really that easy. </p><h2 id="h169017"><a id=""></a>Stop ruining the  experience</h2><p>As for taking photos or videos of the screen for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-game-tiktok-ban-baldurs-gate-3-genshin-impact-1851335795&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-tiktok-ban-baldurs-gate-3-genshin-impact-1851335795">TikTok or whichever social media platform</a></span> you prefer, just don’t do it. Perhaps you don’t care about the experience of seeing a movie in a dark theater, but a lot of people do. A lot of folks pay money, not a small amount these days, to eat some popcorn and enjoy a movie on a big screen in a room where we all collectively agree to be quiet and focused on one thing: the movie. </p><p>It’s a truly amazing and magical experience. </p><p>That might sound corny or like I’m taking movies super seriously, but I’m just being honest. I think you should watch movies however you want at home. Watch the latest arthouse flick on your phone. Binge the same MCU movies over and over and claim they are true cinema. Fine! But when you are in public in a theater, you have to act better. You have to have good movie manners. </p><p>And look, I get it. I’m far too online. My job forces me to be online all the time. My phone is with me 24/7. I check the news at 2 a.m. and work on my vacation. I understand it might be hard to disconnect. But what I love about seeing a movie in a theater is that it forces me, for a few hours, to truly disconnect from reality and all the stresses of living online and just... disappear into a movie. Take advantage of this one rare moment where society (mostly) agrees on disconnecting and being quiet. </p><p>When some jackass starts using their phone, it breaks all of that, especially if the screen is bright or they are being loud. I don’t want to hear your text message notification noise. I don’t want to see your phone’s glowing screen in the corner of my eye. I just want to watch a movie in a dark, quiet room on a giant screen for like three hours, and I paid money to do so. Don’t ruin that. </p><p>If you can’t stop using your phone or talking, then go watch a movie at home and do whatever you want. That’s fine! Just leave theaters for people able to keep their phones in their pockets, muted and mostly forgotten, for a few precious hours. Please. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo's Switch might be nipping at its heels, but PlayStation 2 continues to hold the record as the best-selling console of all time - with Sony now confirming the machine has shifted a whopping 160m units since launching all the way back in March 2000.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time we've heard that figure, of course; former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan casually claimed a total of 160m PlayStation 2s had been sold during a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/03/29/official-playstation-podcast-episode-481-heres-to-you-jim/">farewell edition of PlayStation Podcast</a> earlier this year, but Sony has now updated its <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/playstation-history/2000-ps2-psp/">PlayStation history page</a> to reflect that number, finally making it <em>officially</em> official.
</p>
<p>
PlayStation 2's last major sales milestone was trumpeted back in 2011, when Sony revealed the console had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-2-ships-over-150-million">surpassed 150m sales</a> - although it only took another year for that number to jump up by a further 5m. So while sales have undoubtedly slowed - not exactly surprising seeing as Sony hasn't produced a PS2 since January 2013 - the fact the console has successfully managed to shift another 5m units in the interim is still pretty wild.

To put that into some sort of perspective, PlayStation 5 is currently at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">65m lifetime sales</a>, while PS4 has sold 117m units, PS3 is at the 87m mark, and PS1 was snapped up by 102m Vib-Ribbon fans. Nintendo's DS handheld <em>almost</em> came close to matching PS2's previously announced figure, shifting 154m units, but it now trails someway behind. As for Switch (<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">currently at 146m sales</a>), it could still reign victorious if <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> doesn't get in its way.
</p><p>
For all this competitive chatter, 160m PS2s sold is still an impressive achievement, and you can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps2-the-insiders-story-article">read more about the console's success elsewhere on Eurogamer</a>. It's not Sony's only cause for celebration, of course, given the entire PlayStation brand is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-playstations-30th-anniversary-london-tube-carriage-looks">marking its 30th anniversary</a> in exactly one week's time. And all this because of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ultra-rare-nintendo-playstation-prototype-sells-at-auction-for-gbp230-000">falling out with Nintendo</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/stalker-2-ssd-hdd<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have come into possession of <em>Stalker 2</em>, a game people keep telling me I would like. I’ve actually never played a <em>Stalker</em>, but I do like the idea of the series a lot. The problem I have now is that I have no idea where to put it on my PC.</p><p>Let’s get this out of the way: I’m not the most <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-dont-understand-my-pc-which-i-built" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC-savvy guy</a> out there. Since first building (or, being party to the building of) my PC in 2014, I’ve upgraded it in little bits. One part I’ve largely neglected is my drives: at some point, my most competent friend added an SSD to boot from, while I keep all my games on a much bigger hard drive. This has served me pretty well, even if my PC-building role model Kirk Hamilton thinks it’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kirkhamilton.bsky.social/post/3lbj6khewbc2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outdated</a>, and even as more and more games claim they require an SSD.</p><p>But here comes <em>Stalker 2</em>, requiring a whopping 160 GB and <em>demanding</em> an SSD. At first glance, neither of my drives had the space for it, which was honestly a bit perplexing. What the fuck is on here? And which drive should I prioritize clearing–does it <em>really</em> need an SSD, or is this just the intimidating kind of thing games tell you more and more these days? Comparison videos on YouTube haven’t been entirely helpful–I’m willing to sit through long load times, but there are so many other system variables that it’s hard to get a clear sense of how the game would run on my HDD. Meanwhile, people in the forums are engaged in heated debates about the SSD requirement, with some saying the game ran fine on their HDDs, and others calling people idiots for even asking.</p><p>I took a trip through both my drives, trying to understand why they’re so full. It’s like the world’s worst guessing game: Is <em>Cyberpunk</em> still on here, hidden away in wherever the hell the GOG launcher is? How many times have I installed and uninstalled <em>Red Dead Redemption II</em>, and what could my Rockstar launcher password be? Is <em>Overwatch </em>in here somewhere? <em>Apex Legends</em>? Are they on Steam or Epic or in their own launchers? Can I live without <em>The Witcher 3</em> on my computer? Should I just finish that <em>Dishonored 2</em> <a href="https://aftermath.site/stealth-game-no-detection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stealth run</a> instead of all this, which would explain why the game is still installed?</p><p>Other discoveries were just baffling. How did 2020’s <em>Tell Me Why</em> get on my SSD? Why do I still have the <em>Mirror’s Edge Catalyst</em> beta from 2016? When did I own a flight stick, such that I have flight stick software? Is Xsplit even still around? When was I so into pixel art that I have <em>three</em> different programs for it? What the fuck is a virtual cable, and why do I have so many?</p><p>This is the problem with having owned the same drives for so long: all that digital detritus piles up, until it’s an unfathomable tangle of things I have no idea how to go about cleaning out, especially with my shaky PC knowledge. Some of these mysterious programs are probably badly-named but foundational, while others are just junk. How do I even start figuring this out? And is all of this even worth it for a game I might not like?&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve managed to clear <em>just enough</em> space on my SSD, and much more space on my HDD, which has now led me back to the first question of where I should put <em>Stalker 2</em>. Is it exactly 160, or does it need some headroom, meaning my HDD would be the better choice? Is this question itself a fundamental misunderstanding of disk space? My gut is to just put it on my HHD and see how I get along, because I’ve always considered the SSD the sacred space where the most important workaday stuff goes (a category I guess<em> Tell Me Why</em> fell into?), and also because now I want to know for sure how essential an SSD truly is. But also, I only have so much time in my day, and on this planet. I am also, despite being an anarchist, a stickler for the rules; if the game demands an SSD, is it folly to fight it?</p><p>The obvious solution here is to join the current decade, get my PC-building friend to take me to Microcenter, buy an SSD which are now cheap and plentiful, and solve this problem once and for all. But they’re currently out of town, and the thought of shopping on Black Friday is a bit chilling. Damn you, <em>Stalker 2</em>. You’d better be worth it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It just became way less of a hassle to launch 2K games from your Steam library. The publisher has officially removed its launcher from every game that used it on Steam (and the Epic Games Store). The removal went through on November 18, but a follow-up update to ensure the Launcher was fully removed dropped on November 25.</p><p>Many games, including Bioshock Remastered, Marvel's Midnight Suns, and The Quarry, will now launch directly through Steam. Other games used the launcher for additional functionality. Those games will now launch a small submenu before opening the game itself.</p><p>For example, XCOM 2 and XCOM: Chimera Squad used the 2K launcher for mod management. Now, launching the game will open a small menu which will let you open the mod launcher or the selected game directly. For both games, this change lets you install and use mods on Steam Deck, though the Chimera Squad menu may have some graphical and interface glitches on the portable device.</p><p>Some files from the launcher may remain. The 2K launcher folder has been replaced with a text file entitled 2kLauncherRemoved.txt, which can be safely deleted. You can also search for remaining files in your Windows search bar with the following text: "%localappdata%\T2GP Launcher" and "%appdata%\T2GP Launcher." You can find a more detailed tutorial for deleting the launcher's files on the <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/32209414429203--2K-Launcher-Removing-2K-Launcher-Files" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2K support site</a>.</p><p>This update follows confirmation that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-wont-require-2k-launcher-on-pc/1100-6525824/" data-ref-id="1100-6525824">Civilization 7 would not require the 2K launcher</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-arc-line-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-a-crpg-full-of-potential.1046085/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-hands-on-preview-a-crpg-full-of-potential/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Considering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-gamescom-first-look-and-qa-a-crpg-about-magic-vs-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">style of game</a> that New Arc Line was shaping up to be, it had some pretty big boots to fill. I wasn't sure what to expect with my time with New Arc Line, but I found that for the vast majority of my playthrough of the cRPG that is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458310/New_Arc_Line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now available in early access</a>, I was pleasantly surprised. The game has a lot of potential but still needs just a little bit more fine-tuning to really make it shine.</p>
<p>Diving into the game, you are greeted with character creation, as with any proper roleplaying game. While it doesn't quite live up to the extensive customization options featured in Baldur's Gate 3, there is enough variety to still make your character yours. What I found disappointing was the chance to choose between only two classes. Whether this was just for this early access or a permanent feature, I'm unsure at the moment. Regardless, instead of choosing the tech themed class, I went for the Voodoo class. Anything with magic or necromancy is always up my alley, and I won't pass up an opportunity to play it. The other main gripe I had with character creation was the inability to zoom in on your character's face, meaning you can't tweak the fine details exactly how you'd like.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/new-arc-line.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Getting into the prologue of the game, I was stunned by how beautiful the game was. It felt like a mix between BioShock Infinite and Disco Elysium, and I was all here for it. It reproduced the entirely underrated <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-is-a-gorgeous-fantasy-steampunk-crpg-in-development-at-a-new-ukrainian-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steampunk fantasy setting</a> through a highly immersive dystopia. However, while I did enjoy the world-building throughout my time with New Arc Line, I would understand if people stopped playing during the prologue. It's a bit of a grind to get through, as your character shuffles about at a snail's pace, and there is a rather wide region to explore, especially if you like getting all the knickknacks as I do.</p>
<p>I was continuously impressed by the finer graphical details. The water was so beautifully animated and had sparkles in all the right places, which helped add to that utopia versus dystopia vibe, especially when you're first entering the New World. I liked that, to find out which of the nearby items was interactable, I could just hold down Alt, and it would highlight them, similar to the system in Baldur's Gate 3. On the flip side, the hitboxes were a little bit off. You had to have your mouse a fair amount of space away from the marker to be able to collect anything or speak with someone. During battles, this made it far too difficult, and this is where I started to lose interest.</p>
<p>The voice-acting felt fitting to New Arc Line, but it was also a tad confusing trying to guess which messages would be voice-acted. Sometimes, I was expecting the paragraph to be narrated, and it simply wasn't, with other insignificant paragraphs being narrated instead. The narration and voice-acting felt very inconsistent, as if they couldn't decide which parts should be narrated and which should be left for the player to read themselves.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/new-arc-line-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When it came to battling for the first time, I didn't really enjoy the UI layout. It felt very small and cramped, and it was easy to miss details beneficial to the fight. Additionally, the hitbox issue proved to cause a lot of problems during the battle and led to my companion dying on the docks because of this. I would try to target one of the enemies, and it would very clearly hover over that specific enemy, only for my character to attack the other enemy. This happened multiple times throughout, which is what led to my companion dying, as he was taking unnecessary hits from an enemy that should have already died.</p>
<p>Overall, New Arc Line has a ton of potential, and I'm excited to see the game develop over time. If the hitboxes were fixed, and some of the rougher edges were smoothed over, I would most likely sink more time into it. Additionally, the combat could do with a little fine-tuning to make the UI a bit more readable. This game has a lot of potential, and you can see the amount of love and effort that has gone into the game's worldbuilding to provide the balance between dystopia and utopia. I'm excited to see how New Arc Line develops throughout its early access journey, which the studio expects will last until late 2025.</p>
