Then, you have the new R-2124 Constitution—a modern iteration of the iconic M1903 Springfield, complete with a fixed bayonet for recklessly charging bugs head-on. It’s the latest weapon introduced to <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and it’s become something of a meme due to how horrendous the rifle is in-game.

It’s accessible to all players alongside the DP-00 Tactical Armor. The next time you log in to <em>Helldivers 2</em>, you should receive a reward notification with the rifle and armor, and you can equip them straight away from the pop-up.<br></p><p>“In accordance with the signing of the Liberty Day Pact, all Helldivers will spend 24 hours in contemplation of freedom and Managed Democracy.

They’ll position themselves facing an oncoming horde of bugs, then make quick work of their enemies with rapid-firing, bolt-slinging rifles that shouldn’t be this effective on an extraterrestrial world, and yet here we are. It’s safe to say that people love the Constitution. I will say that, while you can certainly challenge yourself, consider bringing a different weapon for eradication missions.<br></p><p>It’s not entirely useless, though. The R-2124 Constitution deals 180 standard damage, boasts a max penetration power of 3 - Medium, and a recoil of 15. It’s a highly accurate, albeit slow-firing, rifle capable of putting down bugs with extreme prejudice.<br></p><p>If you’re not a fan of the Constitution, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-breaker-nerf-buff-update-chemical-warbond-1851647067&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-breaker-nerf-buff-update-chemical-warbond-1851647067">everyone’s favorite <em>Helldivers 2</em> shotgun received a buff</a></span>, making it a viable close-quarters option.

                <p>Older console maintenance is a must-do habit for collectors to keep on playing their favorite games. From more difficult tasks like soddering in circuits to exponentially easier ones like replacing a battery, it's all part of keeping consoles up and running. The latter though, is something becoming more prominent over the last few years, especially with portable consoles using lithium batteries.</p><p>Earlier in October, some <a href="https://x.com/violetokami_/status/1849030351152148787" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter users found out</a> that lithium batteries tend to swell up after a few years, potentially causing serious trouble. Now, this is not the first time this sort of incident has come up. The Playstation Vita had a similar situation, and even people reported PSP <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSP/comments/psdk76/dug_my_psp_1000_out_of_storage_is_this_a_swollen/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">issues a few years ago</a>.</p><p>"If you own any lipo battery I recommend buying yourself a lipo safe bag that is fire and explosion proof. I own a few of these and you never know when your batteries will burst due to swelling," one poster <a href="https://x.com/CyberJoules/status/1849459869146910910" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">suggested</a>. "You may just save your home from a fire or worse by spending an extra $15-$20."</p><p>So while some gamers might be experiencing this for the first time, it's hardly some new or sudden threat. This is a wise practice to periodically follow as your devices continue to age. When you notice it, it's not always an immediate threat, but something to make sure gets replaced.</p><p>"Swelling certainly isn't good, and it's an indicator of decreased performance," said David Mitlin, a battery researcher and professor at the University of Texas at Austin, in an interview with the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/18/lithium-ion-battery-swelling-why/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington Post</a> about the subject. "But it doesn't instantly mean the battery is going to catch on fire."</p><p>The condition is caused by the gases created lithium ions flow from one end to the other, moving in the opposite direction when the battery is being used to power something. Those ions move through something called the electrolyte. As you keep charging and discharging the battery over time, the electrolyte begins to decompose and produce gases as a byproduct.</p><p>Mitlin continued with the fact that that not all rechargeable batteries are equal. Some big name companies invest even bigger money into researching and developing batteries that stall this decay. In the meantime, there are a few things to keep an eye on such as if the battery gets too hot and what the charge percentage is.</p>

        <p>Changes begin this weekend.</p>

            <p>
Epic has <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience?lang=en-US">announced</a> an overhaul of its different mode-specific <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> passes that'll soon make it possible to progress through each one simultaneously, regardless of the mode players are currently playing in - and that's on top of a tease that the company readying to introduce an "easy way to snag all premium passes at once".
</p>
<p>
As things stand at present, players can progress through Fortnite's Battle Royale Battle Pass by earning XP from any in-game experience, but the Festival Pass and LEGO Pass can only be levelled by playing in their respective modes (that is, Fortnite Festival and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>). However, that's all set to change starting on 2nd November.
</p>
<p>
From that date, all earned XP, regardless of the mode it was generated in, will progress the Battle Pass and Music Pass (the new name for the Festival Pass) simultaneously. Then, from 1st December, the changes will apply to the LEGO Pass too. As part of this overhaul, the Music and LEGO Pass will change to a format resembling the Battle Pass, meaning one track containing both free and premium rewards for each - although this won't come into effect until the current Lego Pass and Music Pass have run their course.

<p>
To accommodate these changes, Epic is ditching Festival Points (from 2nd November) alongside Battle Stars and Studs (from 1st December), so that the only earnable currency required to unlock tiers across each pass is XP. It'll be possible to claim rewards in non-sequential order on all unlocked pages of each pass, as is currently the case with the Battle Pass, and players can configure their passes to auto-unlock rewards as XP is earned. Furthermore, players will be able to directly purchase pass rewards (up to an unspecified limit) if they want something they haven't managed to unlock yet.
</p><p>
Epic notes players will still need to purchase the Battle Pass, Music Pass, and LEGO Pass separately if they want to unlock each pass' premium rewards, but teases that an "easy way to snag all premium passes at once" will be introduced soon. There's no word on how this will work - or if, say, Epic will offer a bundle discount for players who want passes across all three modes - but it shouldn't be long until we hear more.
</p>
<p>
"We hope this change encourages you to play where you want, how you want!," Epic concludes. "Soon it’ll be even easier to unlock awesome rewards in Fortnite."
</p>
<p>
Word that Fortnite's pass changes come into effect this Saturday, 2nd November, lends credence to unconfirmed reports Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix will launch on the same date. This mini-season will presumably follow the same format as last year's hugely popular Chapter 1 Remix, which - as its name suggests - brought back elements of Fortnite's inaugural chapter for some nostalgia-baiting fun. Although details are thin, Chapter 2 Remix is expected to include numerous map options alongside the return of Midas, Meowscles, TNTina, Slurp Commando Ripley, and 8-Ball (possibly now 1-Ball), as you can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-estimated-release-date-and-time">read about elsewhere on Eurogamer</a>.

Instead,  Bungie’s new sci-fi extraction shooter was delayed until 2025 and still hasn’t reemerged with new gameplay since its initial PlayStation Showcase reveal. At least now, however, we do have a new development update from the project’s game director, Joe Ziegler. It details what fans can expect from the bold reboot, including “harsh” survival mechanics that might not be for everybody, but is surprisingly light on information about a game expected to arrive in just a year.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195371,195386" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE&amp;t=4s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE&amp;t=4s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new YouTube video</a></span> outlines the core mechanics and game loop that players will hopefully be diving into sometime in the not-too-distant future. The core gameplay revolves around customizing characters called runners that players take into matches, collecting loot and fending off rivals in order to escape alive lest they lose everything they earned during the outing. If you’ve played <em>Escape From Tarkov </em>or <em>Hunt: Showdown</em>, you probably already know the drill. </p><p>“It’s a game that’s not for everybody, but if you are interested in having sort of that tense survival experience and having a game where the stakes really matter and you’re challenged to survive in a really, really harsh and interesting world, then <em>Marathon</em>’s right up your alley,” Ziegler said. He added that the world of <em>Marathon</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-steam-release-free-1851470109&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-steam-release-free-1851470109">which is based on Bungie’s classic 1990s sci-fi trilogy that recently re-released on Steam</a></span>, will evolve as fans play so that there are new things for them to learn and discover. </p><figure id="" data-id="305ab849d41703f11265e109d7a31164" data-recommend-id="image://305ab849d41703f11265e109d7a31164" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A runner prepares for extraction " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A runner prepares for extraction " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="305ab849d41703f11265e109d7a31164" data-recommend-id="image://305ab849d41703f11265e109d7a31164" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A runner prepares for extraction " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So far, that’s all old news. What we did get from Ziegler for the first time was a glimpse of a couple of Runner archetypes codenamed “Thief” and “Stealth.” What exactly they’ll do remains a mystery, but the concept art, as with everything else in the game, looks really neat. He also gave a very light update on the state of development, including that environments are “coming together” really well while character models are not “completely there yet” and  enemy models are still in an early state. “It’s a little early to show you all of it as one piece,” Ziegler said, which isn’t exactly reassuring for a game players expected to see at the recent PlayStation State of Play in September.</p><p><em>Marathon</em>’s big delay came a year ago amid the first round of seismic cuts at Bungie following its acquisition by Sony.  Ziegler, who previously worked on <em>Valorant</em> at Riot Games, was announced as the new game director earlier this year, with it only being <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported later by <em>Bloomberg</em></a></span> that previous director and longtime Bungie veteran Chris Barrett had been fired for misconduct. Rumors of a $40 price point and new playtests have taken hold in the meantime, with questions about whether <em>Marathon</em> is actually really on track yet or not still up in the air. </p><p> “For the past couple of years we’ve been doing a lot of aggressive change to the game and we’ve been iterating pretty heavily,” Ziegler said today. That certainly paints a picture of a game very much still in the middle of development. Perhaps instead of a cold launch in 2025, there will be a series of closed and open betas to get player feedback and grow a fan community around the game instead. <em>Concord</em>’s recent failure may have put new pressure on the live-service prospects of <em>Marathon</em>, as well as <em>Destiny 2</em>'s evolving future. Ziegler signed off his video by asking players to Wishlist the game on the PlayStation store so they know how interested everyone is.</p><p>You can watch the full video below:</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This lets you vacuum the part out of the top-right window of the barbershop.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Build the LTG device</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391660-maineeltg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391660" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391660-maineeltg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391660"></a><figcaption>Build the LTG on bank rooftop</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391660-maineeltg.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With all three LTG parts collected, you can now head to the bank's rooftop. Just unlock and use either the zipline or ascender connected to the roof. There is a special crafting bench on the roof just for this device.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Use the LTG device</h2><h3 dir="ltr">Grab an Aether canister</h3><p dir="ltr">Head back into the church after building the LTG. Interact with the machine again to <strong>pick up an Aether canister</strong>. Whoever holds this item is going to be weighed down and moving slowly.</p><p dir="ltr">Take the canister to either of the two Dark Aether storms on the map. There's one at the Cemetery and another just right of the Pump and Pay gas station. The order doesn't matter here, but we'll start the guide at the gas station.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Collect an HVT essence</h3><p dir="ltr">Place your canister near the trap at the gas station. Then, interact with the trap piece located directly under the purple storm. Doing so will place the LTG device down.</p><p dir="ltr">This will spawn zombies for a 60-second window. You need to protect the device from taking damage from zombies during this time. Then, the device will turn red, and a portal will spawn the HVT. This enemy will be either a Mangler or an Abomination.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391661-maineemanglerhvt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391661" data-ratio="0.56214953271028" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391661-maineemanglerhvt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391661"></a><figcaption>Mangler HVT at the gas station trap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391661-maineemanglerhvt.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You <strong>need to weaken but not kill</strong> the HVT right away. Get the health low and lead the HVT back to the canister you placed down near the trap. The HVT emits purple sparks when the health gets low enough. When this happens, you need to quickly activate the trap. You need to <strong>kill the HVT by the canister while the trap is still active</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">With the HVT's essence now captured in the trap, you must collect that canister and carry it back to the church. <strong>This step is timed</strong> at 90 seconds, plus you still move slowly carrying it, so make haste toward the church.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Deposit the filled Aether canister</h3><p dir="ltr">Deposit this canister back into the machine inside the church. Once the canister is deposited, a tray on the machine will dispense a new item to pick up. This is called a Strauss Counter. Grab it.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Use the Strauss Counter</h2><p dir="ltr">The Strauss Counter is used to sync up three items on the map that look like old-school film projectors. Using the Strauss Counter is the same button prompt as activating your tactical equipment, and you'll want to activate it while standing beside each of these small devices.</p><p dir="ltr">The Strauss Counter will give you a color, which can be green, yellow, or red. Interact with the projector device on the ground until it matches the color shown on your Strauss Counter. Repeat this step for all three devices. These are found as follows:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391662-maineehillsideprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391662" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391662-maineehillsideprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391662"></a><figcaption>Device on hillside leading down to the bowling alley</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391662-maineehillsideprojector.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Church hillside</h3><p dir="ltr">The closest one is on the hill leading down from the church to the bowling alley.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391663-maineewhitehouseprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391663" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391663-maineewhitehouseprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391663"></a><figcaption>Found behind the white house on the church street</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391663-maineewhitehouseprojector.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Near tool shed</h3><p dir="ltr">Behind the white house on the church street, which is near the Groundskeeper's Tool Shed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391666-maineerooftopprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391666" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391666-maineerooftopprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391666"></a><figcaption>Rooftop device overlooking the gas station</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391666-maineerooftopprojector.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Bank rooftop</h3><p dir="ltr">On the lower portion of the bank's roof.

This marks the next place you need to go.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Note: </strong>This step was oddly buggy for my playthrough. All devices were synced to the corresponding color, but nothing happened. We ended up advancing the round, and then we tried to turn them all back to green to reset them. Once they all turned green, the devices powered up and worked. So, try this if they don't activate the color combo on the Strauss Counter.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Fill the second Aether canister</h3><p dir="ltr">A new Aether canister has spawned at the gas station. Pick it up.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, make sure to pick up the LTG Device off the trap where you left when you captured the first essence.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391667-maineechurchstreetcanisterlocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391667" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391667-maineechurchstreetcanisterlocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391667"></a><figcaption>Place the canister next to the trap on the street downhill from the church</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391667-maineechurchstreetcanisterlocation.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Take the LTG and the canister to the cemetery. This is the same process as before with the HVT. This will be either a Mangler or an Abomination, whichever you didn't get as an HVT the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">Place the canister near one of the cemetery traps, which is in the street outside the church, and then place the LTG on the trap piece under the storm. Fight off the zombies for 60 seconds at the LTG until the HVT spawns.</p><p dir="ltr">Weaken the HVT, but <strong>do not kill it right away</strong>. Make sure to lead it near the canister and trap it in the street. This HVT should also spark purple when weak. Activate the trap and make sure it dies while the trap is active to collect the essence into the canister.</p><p dir="ltr">Take this filled canister to the church and deposit into the machine before the timer runs out, <strong>but do not interact with the machine again</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the canister is deposited, the machine will prompt you to interact with it, but <strong>this will start the boss fight</strong>. Now, you'll want to gear up before the boss encounter.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Boss fight prep</h2><p dir="ltr">If you're able to get all the steps done before round 25, you should be able to make do with level 2 armor and tier 2 Pack-a-Punched weapons. You'll want at least essential perks like Juggernog and Quick Revive. Craft a self-revive if possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Helpful equipment includes Decoy grenades and Monkey Bombs to distract zombies. Napalm ammo mod will help against the larger enemies. Don't bother with aerial killstreaks as you'll be indoors. Try using sentry guns or the Mutant Injection instead.</p><p dir="ltr">Shotguns and LGMs with a high ammo count might be helpful here.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Boss fight</h2><p dir="ltr">This takes place inside the church, so you don't have a lot of wiggle room. This fight is played out in three waves.</p><p dir="ltr">The first wave is just clearing out a ton of zombies, then you'll get an elite Mangler, and finally an elite Abomination. Survive and clear the waves.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the fight is over, there will be a prompt where all of your team gets knocked. So, don't panic. This gives you a final cutscene.

                <p>After more than a year of silence, Bungie has given an update on the development progress of its extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a>. The lengthy video is surprisingly light on details, however, with only a hint of future playtests coming in 2025.</p><p>The update, delivered by game director Joe Ziegler, acts more like a reintroduction to Bungie's latest shooter as opposed to a meaningful update. Ziegler spends time explaining what an extraction shooter is, breaking down the high risk, high reward nature of the genre, while also giving brief hints as to how the games different classes might work. It aligns with a lot of<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617"> what we already know about Bungie's shooter</a>, making it a gameplay update light on new details</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r8WgMQuPwRE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the video, Ziegler briefly speaks about two of the game's Runners--the name given to Marathon's playable characters--with each of their descriptions suggesting that Marathon is taking hints from existing hero shooters. The first is simply codenamed "Thief", with Ziegler assuming you'll have an idea of their gameplay style from the name alone. The other, codenamed "Stealth", is described as using deception to their advantage on the battlefield, with Ziegler remarking that he's enjoyed playing as the character in tests recently.</p><p>Ziegler stressed that Marathon is still not in a state where the team can show it off just yet, pointing at the various states at which distinct elements are at currently.</p><p>"Where the game is at right now, there's a variety of different things at different states inside of the game. Some things are a little more complete, like our environments are starting to come together in a really beautiful way. Some of the character models we've been iterating through; they're coming together but they're not fully there yet. Our enemy models are still kind of in an early state so we're still iterating through things to make those land in a strong way," said Ziegler.</p><p>"It's a little early to show you all of it in one piece," he continued. "But as you've noticed, as many of you are familiar with if you're familiar with game development, all of these things are on track. They're not all together, but when they all do come together we really, really are looking forward to showing you what that looks like and play.</p><p>Zielger ended off by inviting players interested in being invited to further tests to wishlist the game on Xbox Series X, PS5, and Steam, with store pages up for Marathon right now. This is the first time Bungie has spoken about<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-revival-of-pre-halo-sci-fi-series-marathon/1100-6514533/" data-ref-id="1100-6514533"> Marathon since it's announcement in May 2023</a>, where it said that the next time, writing at the time, "now we’re going dark to focus on the game... and when we come back – we’ll have gameplay to show!". Marathon is still slated for release in 2025, although the Steam listing omits this and simply reads "Coming soon".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jackbox-games-announces-fakin-it-card-game-bringing-their-party-games-to-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A Fakin' It card game is on its way. This is a tabletop adaptation of one of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/jackbox-games-10-years-of-laughing-quipping-and-fibbing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jackbox Games'</a> large catalog of digital party games. It is also the studio's first foray into making a physical card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fakin' It</em> Card Game Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Fakin' It</em> card game is, understandably, a social deduction card game based on the <em>Fakin' It</em> videogame designed for 3-6 players.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fakin-it-card-game-set-up.jpg?itok=tUzca2eB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fakin-it-card-game-set-up.jpg?itok=FDUH8ql6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In each game, a single card is drawn from the deck. Each card has a task written on it, that the players must read through their secret wallets. The twist is that one of these wallets won't reveal what the card says, meaning the player has to fake the task to score points.</p>

<p>The <em>Fakin' It</em> card game is broken up into five categories. Hands of Truth involves players raising their hands or keeping them down. Number Pressure has players raising a certain number of fingers between 1-10. You Gotta Point has you pointing fingers at another player or yourself. Face Value is about making facial expressions. Finally, Text You Up is about answering the question on the card truthfully.</p>

<p>If you enjoy a rowdier, raunchier party environment, the <em>Fakin' It</em> card game will be releasing alongside <em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em>, a version of the game aimed at the 17+ crowd.</p>

<p>This marks the first tabletop game released by Jackbox Games. The studio has made a reputation for itself with entertaining digital party games that can be played on PCs, consoles, or smart phones. Their past work includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-survey-scramble-review-wed-like-to-play-steve" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Survey Scramble</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/quiplash-review-perfect-you-your-friends-or-strangers-internet" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Quiplash</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-naughty-pack-review-spicier-but-not-too-crass" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Naughty Pack</em></a>.</p>

<p>Given their body of work has consistently been about simple but fun party game shenanigans, the move from digital to physical is an understandable one.</p>

<p>The Fakin' It card game will be available on Amazon storefronts November 1. Fakin' It will contain 300 cards and will be sold at an MSRP of $19.99. Fakin' It All Night Long will include 150 cards and will be available at an MSRP of $9.99.</p>

Early in the game, you’ll post up in a safehouse and discover that you can purchase three upgrade stations within, each offering you a variety of perks to buy with the money you gather during missions.</p><p>While it may seem like these perks are just supplementary at first, it soon becomes clear that the campaign is balanced around them—you’ll absolutely want to be finding all the cash you can while you’re out shooting bad guys (pro tip: keep an eye out for safes). Each time you return to the safehouse, you can head to one of the upgrade stations and spend your hard-earned money on some new perks.</p><p>There are a lot of perks to choose from, and they’re all useful in their own ways.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/purearts%E2%80%99-1-300-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-syndicate-statue-can-be-pre-ordered-now.1021317/</guid>

<p>PureArts is now accepting pre-orders for one of the most remarkable Assassin’s Creed collectables ever marketed. The ‘Assassin’s Creed Animus: Jacob &amp; Evie’ statue, which stands at a whopping 24 inches tall and weighs a hefty 39lbs, is available to order now and will be shipped Q4 2025.</p>



<p>If you want to secure an exclusive edition that comes with a wearable replica of Jacob Frye’s necklace, you’ll need to move fast – only 250 will be made.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-greatest-collector">The Greatest Collector</h2>



<p>This is an item that only the most hardcore fans will consider copping.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate was released in 2015 to a relatively stellar reception, emerging as the last of the ‘original formula’ games that were sunsetted when Origins was released in 2017. It saw players assume control of two protagonists – Jacob and Evie Frye – as they explored Victorian London.</p>



<p>The setting was superb, the map was meticulously created, and the story was great – if a little predictable. It had brilliant expansions, and for me, it was on home turf, so that was a bonus.</p>



<p>PureArts’ Jacob and Evie statue is 1/4 scale, which means it’s <strong>massive</strong>. For $1,299, you’re getting a hefty polyresin figure with incredible details. It has onboard LED lighting, a ‘hyperdetailed’ sculpt, and the most accurate thing you’ll see from the game short of downloading it and pressing ‘play’.</p>



<p>The Jacob and Evie statue joins a long line-up of similar figures from PureArts, who historically has poured effort into creating some of the finest collectables from the world of Assassin’s Creed.</p>



<p>Could you see yourself parting ways with $1,299 in celebration of Assassin’s Creed Syndicate? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It's the first mainline game in the series to feature a first-person camera perspective and introduces an all-new protagonist, Ethan Winters, whose storyline continues into Resident Evil 8. Even though it's almost a decade old, the game still looks fantastic thanks to the RE Engine powering its grotesque graphics, and remains one of the scariest games in the series.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-update-44-adds-ranked-4v4-pvp-battlegrounds-two-new-companions-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, ZeniMax Online Studios has released Elder Scrolls Online Update 44 on PC and Mac (console users will have to wait until November 13). As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-gamescom-2024-qa-beyond-the-10th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a>, this free update is highlighted by a major overhaul of the Battlegrounds, the game's version of instanced PvP.</p>
<p>If you've played the MMORPG before, you're probably aware that Battlegrounds was a 4v4v4 affair, mimicking the Alliance War between Daggerfall Covenant, Aldmeri Dominion, and Ebonheart Pact on a smaller scale. The three-way fight offered a lot of dynamic and unpredictable situations; however, Battlegrounds remained strictly a casual affair ever since their introduction back in 2017 with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-online-morrowind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morrowind Chapter</a>. This is all changing with Update 44, which tweaks Battlegrounds to 4v4 and 8v8 formats with players split between two factions.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls Online developers have designed seven brand new PvP maps, of which four are available in the 8v8 format and three in the 4v4 format. The 8v8 Battlegrounds will feature the full breadth of modes (Capture the Relic, Team Death Match, Domination, Chaos Ball, and Crazy King) as well as power-ups scattered throughout the map to make things more hectic. The 4v4 Battlegrounds are limited to just Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Crazy King. However, they include exclusive features like Rounds, Lives, and Spectator Camera.</p>
<p>Round matches are best of three and last five minutes each round. Some matches have lives, and they are displayed in the top right corner of the player's HUD (Heads-Up Display). Lives are per person, not per team. If you run out of lives, you will not be able to respawn any longer in that match. The Spectator Camera will only work in matches where there are lives, and you can only watch members of your team who are still alive. Moreover, the 4v4 Battlegrounds also have a competitive leaderboard which is based on the medals earned in each match.</p>
<p>Both formats have added Tiebreakers to the scoring system. If a match ends with both teams tied, the match will be decided by medals won and remaining lives for tiebreakers. In the rare case of a 'true tie' on all other metrics, both teams will be considered not winning but also not losing for reward purposes. Lastly, the old 4v4v4 game mode will no longer be available in Elder Scrolls Online for queues, but it may return in the future for limited times during special mini-PvP events.</p>
<p>The oft-neglected Imperial City PvPvE zone has had some improvements in this patch, too. Imperial City keys and key fragments have been converted to Imperial Fragments, and vault treasure chests have become vendors. Furthermore, many of the area's existing vendors have enjoyed upgrades to their wares, including their quality and selection.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1ac957846eeb4ca1aef76999becc34a1-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Update 44 also adds two new Companions to Elder Scrolls Online: the High Elf outcast Tanlorin and the Khajiit Necromancer Zerith-var, which come with unique passive abilities and questlines. These companions are available for free for ESO Plus members, while everyone else may purchase them with the in-game Crowns. ESO Plus members also get a 10% boost to PvP Alliance Points earned, PvP Skill Line ranks, Alliance rank, and Tel Var Stones gained from killing monsters. The patch also sees new Homes, new Furnishings, new Skill Styles, new Scripts, and a new Grimoire.</p>
<p>Last but not least, HDR is finally supported on PC (provided you have an HDR display) with extensive tweaking options: HDR Mode, HDR Peak Brightness, HDR Scene Brightness, HDR Scene Contrast, HDR UI Brightness, and HDR UI Contrast. For the full patch notes, <a href="https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/667797/pc-mac-patch-notes-v10-02-5-update-44" target="_blank" rel="noopener">head to the official forums.</a></p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/what-remains-of-edith-finch">What Remains Of Edith Finch</a> is a very upsetting collection of interactive short stories about the brief, tragic lives of a cursed family who live in a monstrous treehouse. It's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/what-remains-of-edith-finch">a wonderful show of experimentation</a>, switching genres from story to story - one minute you're a playable bestiary on shuffle, the next you're beheading fish in a cannery as the worktable disappears beneath your scrolling daydreams. The developer's next project seems to be pursuing a similar balance of whimsy and darkness. It's another anthology experience, which casts you as a field biologist studying "the strangeness of organic life". Also, chicken-legged houses.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
While the project has yet to be formally announced, Giant Sparrow's founder and director Ian Dallas has shared a little about its wiggly inner workings with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/24/arts/giant-sparrow-next-game-edith-finch.html">New York Times</a>. There's also a smidgeon of info on <a href="https://www.giantsparrow.com/games/heron/">the developer's blog</a> - the URL suggests the project's working title is "Heron" - according to which Giant Sparrow are "drawing inspiration from places like Ico, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/windosill">Windosill</a>, Spirited Away, and David Attenborough nature documentaries, along with the spirit of early animators like Winsor McCay and Walt Disney who used (for the time) cutting edge technology to build something that didn't feel technical at all but instead felt weirdly alive."
</p>
<p>
If the project takes inspiration from nature documentaries, it also takes inspiration from Dallas's disappointment about nature documentaries. He feels they're often rather broad and superficial, with too much cutting between creatures and places. "They work in part because it's like a distraction for a toddler," he told the NYT. Careful, Dallas, I hear David Attenborough's got a mean left hook for a guy his age. 
</p>
<p>
Giant Sparrow's designers have also found the nature documentary premise to be a bit of a glass ceiling, resulting in lukewarm concepts "like a photographing mini game, or like collecting 10 ladybugs or whatever." Hence, in part, the planned introduction of more fantastical creatures that might give rise to more complex approaches. Going by the concept artworks from the NYT piece, the menagerie currently ranges from regular chickens (complete with pooping functionality) to chickens that have gotten themselves confused with mobile homes. "When we started adding a few slightly goofy elements, that led us to some stranger and more interesting places," Dallas went on.

<p>
That said, part of the aim here is simply "to call out just how weird biology is" and encourage reflection on "how many bizarre things are going on around us all the time", rather than weaving a fairytale. 
</p>
<p>
They're also aiming for a more "exploratory and playful" world, with Dallas commenting that "single-player games often feel like a chess board - a world that's highly predictable and entirely designed to facilitate the limited set of actions a player is capable of." Here's a work-in-progress example of an in-game scenario: trying to coax a giraffe into coming over and lowering its head at the right angle, so that you can put something on it.
</p><p>
There's an element of horror, which has intensified as Giant Sparrow have investigated various creatures and realised just how bizarre, say, a butterfly's reproductive cycle is by the standards of stinky, non-holometabolous human beings. "What we have slowly found our way to is a game where animals feel gross and maybe you have this visceral reaction to, in the way that like, when a caterpillar walks over your finger there's something about all those legs moving that's really disturbing but also fascinating," Dallas said. 
</p>
<p>
Long story short, Giant Sparrow's new game is a real blend of emotions, which is just how I like my emotions, personally. Going beyond the constraint of the nature documentary format, I'd love to know if the developers have thought about how their design expertise and experience may have structured their ideas about nonhuman creatures in advance.</p>
<p>I'm also interested to know whether the animals in the game are portrayed as passive, with the player making choices that progress the simulation, and whether there will be any interrogation of biology as a knowledge-making discipline. I have a lot of questions, yes.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, I definitely get a Jeff Vandermeer/New Weird vibe from all this. It sounds a bit like the up-market version of the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zoochosis">Zoochosis</a>, in which you'd best avoid getting too cosy with the giraffes. Incidentally, if your first thought on seeing the chicken house was "I want one", maybe check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reka">Reka</a>.

In 2025, they’re expanding further with <em>Final Fantasy,</em> featuring cards spread across all sixteen mainline franchise entries—initially teased in late summer of 2023. So far, we’ve seen Sephiroth, Lightning, and a Moogle. However, Square Enix producer Shoichi Ichikawa revealed we’d also see Cloud Strife and Noctis, along with a few summons, fan-favorite monsters, and iconic weapons. Maybe the Buster Sword?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195896" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="112" data-playlist="195896,194600,195859" data-current="195896"><div><p>Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21410.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>While this announcement leaves <em>Final Fantasy</em> and <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> fans jumping for joy, Wizards of the Coast didn’t stop there.

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie Gives Official Update On Status Of Marathon]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon.1021272/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bungie has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released an official</a> update on the status of Marathon. The update came in the form of a nearly 10-minute long video on the game’s official YouTube channel.</p>



<p>In the video, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-replaces-marathon-game-director-with-former-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Director Joe Ziegler</a> gives an update on what’s been worked on since the last update on Marathon. He covers the direction of the game as well as plans for future updates about the game.</p>



<p>The update also doesn’t include any look at official gameplay, but does come with some concept art for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-heroes/">few of the game’s heroes</a>. If you want to watch the video for yourself, you can below.</p>



<p>As far as what was covered, Ziegler discusses the game being an extraction shooter, including diving into to what an extraction shooter is for those who may be unfamiliar with the subgenre. Ziegler also talks about taking elements from the original Marathon and expanding them for a new game with a modern audience. </p>



<p>“We’re taking a lot of familiar elements, especially a lot of the mysterious and kind of eeriness and the — how do I put it —  the psychological kind of the entire IP as it exists before,” he said. </p>



<p>“But we’re layering on some elements that we think really help modernize it, and also bring it to a new story and new world that we can sort of continue to update and delight all of you with over the course of time.”</p>



<p>Regarding how the game’s been changing during development and where things currently stand, Ziegler says that changes to the game have been “aggressive” for the past couple years along with holding multiple playtests.</p>



<p>“We’ve been testing with a lot of players,” he said. “A lot of players like yourself, also with creators. It’s sort of insanely awesome and I’m filled with gratitude when I think about it because there’s so many people who contributed by telling us, ‘Hey, this thing sucks’ or ‘This thing’s great’.”</p>



<p>He then added that there are a number of things within the game that are at different states of development. Things like the game’s environments are in a more complete state while the character models continue to be iterated through.  Marathon’s enemy models, he said, are “still kind of a little bit in an early state.”</p>



<p>Back to the characters, Ziegler gave a sneak peak at a couple of the characters in development: a runner codenamed Thief and one codenamed Stealth..</p>



<p>Ziegler then wrapped up the video stating that more content reveals are coming in 2025 for Marathon. Also coming in 2025 will be an expansion of Bungie’s playtests for Marathon to include more players. There was no hint as to when that would happen, however.</p>

<p>It’s a given at this point; an expectation that we all foster when a new Call of Duty title launches. It’s axiomatic: within a matter of days following the release of a new game, there <strong>will be </strong>a 24/7 playlist. On November 1, Nuketown lands in Black Ops 6 – and dataminers have found that when it does, a 24/7 playlist for the map will go live.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-written-in-the-stars">Written in the Stars</h2>



<p>On Twitter, ‘SemtexLeaks’ uncovered a reference to a Nuketown 24/7 playlist in Black Ops 6, which will assumedly arrive when the map is added to the public pool on November 1. That means that players far and wide will be spending hours grinding the iconic, small-form map – just as our Call of Duty masters intended.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This year’s Nuketown is a ‘reimagining’ of the original map that surfaced in 2010, and by all accounts, it looks fantastic while at the same time retaining the familiar feel of the decade-and-a-bit-old environment that has re-appeared in every Black Ops game.</p>



<p>From the code uncovered in the game’s files, Nuketown 24/7 will feature a rotation of Team Deathmatch, Kill Confirmed, Domination, Hardpoint, and Kill Order. Except for Kill Order, which is new for Black Ops 6, this is a fairly standard rotation that players have come to expect from Activision’s teams.</p>



<p>Most of the maps in Black Ops 6 have proven to be troublesome for one reason or another, so perhaps the familiarity of Nuketown will give some players a feeling of comfort after this first week of struggling.</p>



<p>Will you be jumping into Nuketown 24/7 when it drops on November 1? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/conclave-ending</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-shouldn%E2%80%99t-have-seen-conclave-in-theaters.1021260/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/conclave-ending<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On a whim over the weekend, I went to see <em>Conclave</em>, a Ralph Fiennes movie about choosing a new Pope. I wish I’d watched it at home.</p><p><em>Conclave</em>, based on a 2016 book, starts with the Pope being dead, and Fiennes’ character Cardinal Lawrence in charge of running the show of picking a new one. This is not a straightforward process; through the course of the conclave, cardinals politick and backstab, secrets are revealed, and characters wrestle with their responsibility to shape the future of the Catholic Church and their own ambitions. There’s no way to explain my experience without talking about the end of the movie, which only came out last week. So I feel obligated to add a <strong>spoiler warning</strong>, even though doing so is exactly the thing I want to write about. So there you go; read on below to find out why I hate myself for this choice.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="CONCLAVE - Official Trailer 2 [HD] - Only In Theaters October 25" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t915aZmyEBg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>A small handful of papal candidates emerges through the film. I was rooting for the liberal-minded Bellini, played by Stanley Tucci, but it’s clear from the beginning that he doesn’t have the votes. Middle-of-the-road candidates get cut from the running as their past misdeeds or bad behavior regarding the conclave get revealed, and a lot of the drama of the film comes from a quietly intense Fiennes wrestling with his duty to the papacy and how he has to participate in the sneaking and backstabbing in pursuit of that duty. At the end, the two most viable candidates are the frighteningly conservative Cardinal Tedesco and the mysterious Cardinal Benitez, whom the Pope secretly made Cardinal of Kabul following his ministries in the Congo and Iraq. World events outside the conclave put Tedesco and Benitez in stark opposition and make the choice feel much bigger than just who the next Pope will be.</p><p>In the end, Benitez gets the most votes. But before he can be announced, Lawrence puts together the remaining pieces of his past. The Pope had paid for Benitez to go to a clinic in Geneva, and we find out in the movie’s penultimate scene that this was because Benitez learned in adulthood that he’s intersex, and the clinic visit was to get his uterus and ovaries removed. But Benitez ultimately didn’t get the surgery; he tells Lawrence “I am what God made me” and explains that he thought it would be sinful to alter God’s design. Lawrence says nothing about the conversation, and the movie ends with Benitez presumably becoming Pope.</p><p>As a trans man who is religious, I found Benitez’s position a very moving take on the usual line regarding gender-related surgeries from some corners of religion, and I loved the radical idea of a non-cis Pope. I gasped in delight when Benitez explained his situation. But the other people in my theater–on a Saturday afternoon, primarily elderly couples–didn’t have the same reaction: The majority of them laughed. Maybe it was because they saw the reveal itself as comical, or as a sign that for all Lawrence’s efforts to do the right thing he had picked the wrong Pope anyway, or just because the movie had one last secret up its sleeve. But their reaction was a shitty thing to experience, and as the lights came up, I rushed from the theater, not wanting to overhear anyone discussing the ending.</p><p>Director Edward Berger told <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/conclave-movie-ending-spoilers-edward-berger-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a> that he didn’t intend the end to be a shock, saying&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We didn’t want to play it for shock value, by the way. We really wanted it to feel very natural and soft. This is Benitez. This is who he is; this is part of him. We wanted it to play as subtly and as sensitively as possible, and really not go for the big twist, sensational reveal.</p><p>…I do feel that we try to deal with [the reveal] with diligence, sensitivity, and not using it as a plot device or anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>It’s hard for me to buy this. Characters’ trans identities coming to light has a <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-have-mixed-feelings-about-the-last-of-us-part-2s-tran-1844245756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long history</a> of being played for drama, which Berger cannot excuse himself from simply by saying that’s not what he meant to do. Though every character in the film has secrets, by coming at the very end Benitez’s naturally gets more dramatic weight. As such, it inevitably gets painted as the movie’s <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=conclave+ending&amp;sca_esv=db7f7e8d65832db1&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIJenApzwn0I1Mlr375PiuruhFDN3g%3A1730054385826&amp;ei=8YgeZ4OOMuas5NoP3qDg-Q8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDyu_omq-JAxVmFlkFHV4QOP8Q4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=conclave+ending&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiD2NvbmNsYXZlIGVuZGluZzILEAAYgAQYsQMYgwEyCxAAGIAEGLEDGIMBMgQQABgDMgsQABiABBixAxiDATIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjILEAAYgAQYhgMYigUyCxAAGIAEGIYDGIoFMgsQABiABBiGAxiKBUjjEFDuAVilDHABeAGQAQCYAUqgAdkFqgECMTG4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgygAoUGwgIKEAAYsAMY1gQYR8ICChAjGIAEGCcYigXCAgUQABiABMICCBAAGIAEGKIEwgILEC4YgAQYsQMYgwHCAg4QABiABBixAxiDARiKBcICERAAGIAEGLEDGIMBGMkDGIoFwgILEAAYgAQYkgMYigXCAgsQABiABBiRAhiKBcICCBAAGBYYHhgPmAMAiAYBkAYFkgcCMTKgB_ZU&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest twist</a> in coverage. Placing it at the end also means anyone writing about it–myself included–has to talk around it as a spoiler, which fits it into a long-standing trope of non-cis people’s genders being played as a <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1278714964816076800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprise</a>. All of this is surely what made my theater erupt in laughter, whether Berger intended that reaction or not.</p><p>In fairness to Berger, the moment is indeed played with subtlety, with both Fiennes and Carlos Diehz as Benitez tackling it with the same tenor as the rest of <em>Conclave</em>’s secrets. Everyone’s pasts raise questions about whether they are the right choice for Pope, as well as questions about what the “right” choice even means; while Benitez’s identity would be disqualifying based on the traditions of the Church, both it and his politics fit into the bigger questions about the future direction of the Church that <em>Conclave</em> highlights through its various papal candidates. <em>Conclave</em> features an understated subplot about <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vatican-womens-magazine-women-church-world-editors-quit-climate-distrust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nuns</a>, which when combined with Benitez’s character, suggests gender issues in the Church are one theme the movie wants to explore, and one that fits within the movie’s bigger themes about progress versus tradition. If Lawrence had discovered the reason behind Benitez’s cancelled trip to Geneva sooner, if it had been just one more piece of information he had to wrestle with, gender might have taken center stage as the movie's defining issue. That’s a movie I, personally, would have seen, but it also would have made <em>Conclave</em> a movie about a different topic than it is. It also, let’s be honest, would have turned it into a movie that was unlikely to have drawn the audience full of elderly Brooklynites I saw it with.&nbsp;</p><p>A search headline from Slate highlights this: on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=slate+conclave&amp;oq=slate+conclave&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRifBTIHCAUQIRifBTIHCAYQIRifBTIHCAcQIRifBTIHCAgQIRifBTIHCAkQIRifBdIBCDIzNjRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google</a>, the hed reads “It Seemed Like This Year’s Safest Oscar Pick–Until It Revealed One Final Surprise.” On the <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/10/conclave-movie-ending-explained-benitez-oscars-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">page</a>, that Slate hed reads “Is <em>Conclave</em>’s Twist Ending Honorable, Offensive, Or Just Plain Ridiculous?,” and the article itself digs into <em>Conclave</em>’s choice not to use the Church’s prevalent sex scandals as its primary topic, as well as whether Benitez’s election does justice to questions about gender in the Church. Writer Dana Stevens says of her viewing experience that “The climactic reveal did provoke some scattered laughs, but those struck me as guffaws of surprise, not derision. Translated into a verbal response, that laughter might have meant something like 'You got me, Berger—whatever I was expecting, it was not <em>that</em>.'”</p><p>I appreciate this interpretation, but it still can’t avoid casting Benitez’s identity as a “gotcha.” Berger can’t control the response of the audience, and was working with the source material of the book (which I haven’t read). But I think it’s naive of him to believe the ending would play the way he says he intended it, instead of how it played out in my theater experience.&nbsp;</p><p>I think I would be more likely to agree with Berger’s explanation of his intentions for that moment if I’d watched <em>Conclave</em> at home, where my reaction to the ending would have been the only one. Instead, I feel like I spent $16 to be surrounded by a bunch of people laughing at a character who wasn’t cis. And now, reading about the movie, I’m inundated with sensationalist headlines about twists and surprises like I’ve read about so many movies featuring trans characters. I tried to avoid the same choice in my own headline, but I also worry I'm playing into the same problem by writing about <em>Conclave</em> and its ending at all.</p><p>All this aside, <em>Conclave</em> was a fine semi-thriller, and I can appreciate what Berger was trying to do. At the end of the day the film probably has more to say about <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/conclave-director-edward-berger-interview-the-power-of-self-doubt-long-road-to-the-a-list-those-pesky-rumors-he-will-revive-007-1236081714/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electoral politics</a> than gender. I wish seeing it had been nothing more than a way to spend some time on a Saturday.  &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That is because cats will not stoop to such frivolities, where it can be reasonably avoided. Cats are too self-respecting to get caught up in silly online multiplayer party games. Please. Don't insult their intelligence, their divinity, their mastery of the environment and of your emotions. Cats don't need 2-9 player scrambles across the rooms of an eccentric manor house, with customisable outfits and various minigames. What? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jumping-jazz-cats">Jumping Jazz Cats</a>? No. I won't recognise it. This is a work of impossible sedition. Impossible, cute sedition.

<p>Jumping Jazz Cats describes itself as "pussycat parkour", skillfully avoiding a far naughtier way of wording the same idea. Well done, Team 17 copywriter. I would not have been able to resist.</p>
<p>"These amical mini-games are played in teams," says the game's blurb, "and include rip-roaring races, fat cat collectathons and epic showdowns between shadow cats and mighty lions."</p>
<p>It's basically a party game about sliding down rails, scratching up furniture, bounding from table jelly, and clambering up bookcases in a fright. As the owner of a cat I can only say: correct. If anything, it is not chaotic enough. There's local multiplayer for 4 people, and you can unlock certain collar tags that will buff your cat in as-yet-unexplained ways. </p><p>Jazz music also appears to be a big theme, with some minigames sporting rhythm game prompts, and other levels featuring big dreamlike musical instruments stretching across the rooms. My favourite jazz musician cat remains fellow Irish stray <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRET1vsfiJM">Thomas O'Malley</a> from The Aristocats, aka Baloo but small and ginger.</p>
<p>You know, we have a list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-cats-in-games">the best cats in games</a>. But that was sadly written before the release of both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stray">Stray</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-kitty-big-city">Little Kitty Big City</a> (<em>Pipclosure: former RPS writer Pip Warr worked on the latter</em>). Do we need to update that listicle? I don't know. What would a cat do? </p>
<p>Yes, you're right. They'd climb the curtains, shred the sofa, and then go to sleep. The list update can wait. Just like anyone waiting for Jumping Jazz Cats, which has aloofly set its release date as "coming soon". </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’ll use them frequently, and even a basic grasp of these can put you ahead of your competition, and lead you to the winning circle.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cbe160f0dce1b3fa8e84a32c7dfaa830" data-recommend-id="image://cbe160f0dce1b3fa8e84a32c7dfaa830" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Ops 6 Omnimovement in action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Ops 6 Omnimovement in action" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cbe160f0dce1b3fa8e84a32c7dfaa830" data-recommend-id="image://cbe160f0dce1b3fa8e84a32c7dfaa830" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Ops 6 Omnimovement in action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>You’re liable to blame it on age, waning reflexes, or children who have nothing but free time, but learning Omnimovement in <em>Black Ops 6</em> initially feels downright painful. Everyone feels faster, more fluid, than you. But they’re not. They’re using the same control schemes and hotkeys as you, but more effectively.</p><p>The best way to learn Omnimovement, aside from spending considerable time in the Training Course, is to throw yourself into the fray. Load into the core playlist, ideally Team Deathmatch, Domination, or Hardpoint—a team-oriented game mode—and practice. You’ll likely lose, and you may wind up suffering text or voice abuse from your teammates—this is <em>Call of Duty</em> after all—but you’ll find that after a few rounds of leaping around like a fool, you’re beginning to gain ground with Omnimovement.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0fca0adea705b1a8182b14adeff68487" data-recommend-id="image://0fca0adea705b1a8182b14adeff68487" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The reloading animation for the AK-47 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The reloading animation for the AK-47 in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0fca0adea705b1a8182b14adeff68487" data-recommend-id="image://0fca0adea705b1a8182b14adeff68487" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The reloading animation for the AK-47 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you ask anyone online, especially on social media, they’re going to tell you to stick with the meta—the best weapons in the game that everyone uses. Right now, most players opt for the AS VAL or C9. They’re excellent, fast-firing, and hard-hitting weapons that make quick work of players. But they’re only a small part of the game.</p><p>Personally, I almost always use the AK-74. I like its crosshairs, powerful feel, and its sound design. Do those aspects make for a meta weapon? No, but I still frequently place in the top three on my team. The point is, find a weapon that you enjoy using, then practice with it. You don’t have to stick with the meta, you can still dominate <em>Black Ops 6</em> multiplayer with any gun in the game.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f5955ede19752fe00a8bb14ba303ea80" data-recommend-id="image://f5955ede19752fe00a8bb14ba303ea80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Deathmatch game mode in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Deathmatch game mode in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5955ede19752fe00a8bb14ba303ea80" data-recommend-id="image://f5955ede19752fe00a8bb14ba303ea80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Deathmatch game mode in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>At least in the beginning. While everyone certainly has a few favorite game modes, Team Deathmatch and Domination offer team-centric matches with simple objectives that give new players an opportunity to learn. They’re not overly dramatic or complex, but straightforward, in-your-face gunfights and a point-scoring method that doesn’t demand too much of beginners.</p><p>Inevitably, you’ll move on to test other game modes, and quickly find favorites.

As such, if you have your sights set on a specific gun, for instance, you’ll want to level quickly. How? The best way is, of course, by playing multiplayer. But more importantly, focus on your daily challenges. These swap out every 24 hours, and they include challenges such as scoring specific types of kills, or a certain number of headshots.</p><p>Every time you complete a daily challenge, you’ll earn a few thousand XP. Once you complete all three, you’ll unlock the fourth bonus, rewarding you with even more XP. It’s an excellent way to jump two or three levels simply by playing the game.</p><hr><p>Once you nail down the basics of multiplayer, don’t forget to check out the other modes.

Choose your loadout and enter quantum unstable zones rich with active matter—the most valuable and the most dangerous resource in all multiverse. Fight against rivals from other timelines, survive physics-breaking anomalies and try to stay alive. Harvest active matter, gather loot and extract to a safe place before the whole zone ceases to exist with everything inside it.</p><p>Active matter changes things and bends space and time, so you might encounter operatives and other survivors that lost their mind and humanity after exposure to this substance. Other players, though, would always be your most dangerous enemy. Expand your syndicate base, upgrade your arsenal and participate in fierce battles between syndicates over the key sources of active matter, as they’re your only chance to break out of the loop and gain control over your destiny.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_924259"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Player-Versus-Player-Versus-Environment Extraction-Style Raids</strong> – Players go solo or in small squads inside the quantum unstable zones in their quest for active matter and other loot. Active matter can be harvested by killing AM-transformed creatures, taken away from other players or picked up directly from active matter clusters. Join this never ending hunt to improve your chances to find the way out of the time loop.</li><li><strong>Realistic Weapons and Gear</strong> – Active matter randomly brings things from other timelines to the quantum unstable zones and allows you to replicate a specific item from other timelines in the safety of your base. Despite the mysterious origin of your weapons, your arsenal is always rooted in real-world military technologies and tactics, as war seems to be the only constant in this chaotic multiverse.</li><li><strong>Gameplay-Influencing Active Matter Effects</strong> – Mind-bending anomalies that change gravitational force and space topology right in front of your eyes. Thrilling encounters with eerie SCP-inspired objects would send shivers down your spine, and creatures transformed by active matter would attack you on sight.</li><li><strong>Intense Player-Versus-Player Battles</strong> – Syndicates of operatives fight over control of a passive source of active matter, using all the weapons and other gear they can bring into battle or craft on site. Join player-versus-player battles you like and make a real impact on the fate of the multiverse!</li><li><strong>Fascinating Maps</strong> – Battles take place at locations that exist outside of space and time boundaries. Active Matter features a variety of maps, including a huge island with rusty Soviet industrial complexes and cryptic science labs that were among the first to study this new phenomena. Explore these places to find hints on the origin of active matter.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
