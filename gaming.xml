		<p>Artefacts Studio and New Tale have announced the first videogame adaptation of Fantasy Flight Games’ Descent board game, with this first game being Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent. The story of Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent will be a new one, and not based on the board game so it will be something new for fans of Descent, as well as an entry point for those who have not played Descent before.</p>
<p><iframe title="Terrinoth®: Heroes of Descent | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/66iyYCF771o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent takes place one year before the events of Descent: Legends of the Dark, adding to the lore of the world while introducing new events. The gameplay will be a turn based RPG along with exploring different dungeons with a group of heroes. Additionally, players can choose to play through the entire campaign or play through self contained questlines outside of the main story that can be completed in a few hours. Both the story campaign and standalone quests can be played solo or in co-op.</p>
<p><em>“As fans of Descent, stepping into Terrinoth has been both a huge responsibility and an incredible joy,”&nbsp;</em>said Bruno Chabanel, CEO of Artefacts Studio.&nbsp;<em>“With Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent we wanted to capture the feeling of a tense tabletop dungeon crawl and translate it into a tactical RPG that flows naturally on PC and consoles with a multiplayer cooperative mode to accurately convey the atmosphere of the board game. It’s easy to pick up, but there is always another strategy, another synergy or another build to discover.”</em></p>

<p>There is a demo available on Steam to try out what Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent has to offer ahead of its planned release this Spring for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="f277304b26af4"><a title="Mario Tennis Fever" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f277304b26af4/mario-tennis-fever.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>September 2025 feels like an awful long time ago. It was in this Direct that we first locked eyes on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, and while the marketing hasn't been all that in-yer-face in the months since, the occasional trailer drop or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> update has kept us eager to learn what Mario's latest sporting escapade would bring to the table.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's not long to wait. Fever launches on Switch 2 later this week on <strong>12th February</strong>, and today, we can start to get an idea of the critical consensus as the reviews start rolling in.</p>
<p>Here at Nintendo Life, we had a great time with just about everything the game served up to us. While the wonderful PJ O'Reilly was a little let down by the single-player Adventure Mode in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">our 8/10 review</a>, he found that there was a lot to like about the central tennis matches and their wacky Fever mechanics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's lucky, given the disappointing adventure offering, that the tennis here is so sweet, and easily the sort of thing I reckon has a long online life ahead. It helps, too, that it looks superb, never dropping a notable frame in docked or handheld</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196982 @ 1770739203 -->
<p>But of course, we're not the only ones with a review out there. Below, we've assembled a roundup to help you see the breadth of opinions at a glance — and yes, there are quite a few different takes on this one.</p>
<p>Kicking things off at the top with <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/mario-tennis-fever-review-scores-ace-pinpoint-precision-507991-20260210">GAMINGbible</a>, which awarded Fever a 9/10 thanks to its fun-filled whimsy and the "pleasant surprise" of its short-but-sweet Adventure Mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With its surprisingly charming Adventure Mode and more match variations than you could possibly imagine, <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> is a bountifully delightful release that conjures up the pure, whimsical escapism that only Nintendo so wonderfully nails</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/mario-tennis-fever-review-3315802/">Dexerto</a> was similarly optimistic in its 4/5 review, describing Fever as "the most fun sports game in years":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As chaotic as Mario Kart, it stands alongside the likes of Mario Golf Toadstool Tour and Mario Strikers Charged as the best Mario sports games. It’s completely thrilling</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-tennis-fever-review-bringing-the-heat/1900-6418460/">GameSpot</a> also came in with an 8/10, praising the arcade-y addition of the special-powered rackets and the sheer variety of gameplay options:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mario's various dalliances into sports have been inconsistent, often because they feel so bare-bones and perfunctory. Mario Tennis Fever breaks this trend with a multitude of modes and a playful, flexible gimmick that makes it more wild and unpredictable while also testing your tennis skills in a new way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things were marginally lower in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mario-tennis-fever/running-hot">Game Informer</a>'s 7.5/10 review, which still found a lot to like about Fever despite an all-too-short Adventure Mode and some occasional stutters in the review-period online matches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mario Tennis Fever is hardly a revolutionary entry, but it nails the series' most important element by offering a well-rounded experience with myriad ways for players of all skill levels to enjoy the game of tennis</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>For many of the same reasons, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-review">IGN</a> awarded Fever a 7/10, where the stellar party vibes and stacked character roster are only let down by the single-player content and occasional repetitiveness of certain modes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 20 hours, I already feel like I’ve had my fill, and I see it as more of a fun distraction to play for a few minutes here and there while my group warms up for something else rather than one that’s going to get a serious amount of playtime</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, we have <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/mario-tennis-fever/">VGC</a>, which gave Fever a "solid" 3/5 on account of that much-discussed Adventure Mode and the risk of things becoming rather unbalanced in online matches:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before long, you’ll realise that of the 30 rackets on offer, less than a third of them can have a major impact on the game. I’d imagine that once the online community turns up, it’ll only be a matter of time before the metagame kicks in and the vast majority of these rackets are dismissed in favour of the handful that have the most obvious advantage</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>There you have it, not the most divisive game in recent memory, but certainly a good range of opinions — it currently sits at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mario-tennis-fever/">Metascore</a> of 77 based on 64 critic reviews.</p>
<p>You'll be able to see it all for yourself later this week, when Mario Tennis Fever arrives on 12th February.</p>

			<p>The <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">February Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</strong></a> brought new information about several <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">third-party games</strong> launching on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2. A good portion of the presentation focused on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ports</strong> launching this year for the current-generation Nintendo system, including <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-trio-of-bethesda-ports-are-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026-fallout-4-indiana-jones-and-oblivion-remastered/"><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-arrives-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-june/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.</strong></a></em></p>



<p>With the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">recent Nintendo Switch 2 port of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</em> running and looking great on the system</strong>, many are wondering how the console will ha<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ndle the second entry in the series</strong>, which is a more complex game in pretty much every aspect. Though too early to say, an early analysis of the only footage available to date suggests that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 could deliver a better experience than the Steam Deck</strong>.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">During the latest episode of their weekly podcast</a></strong>, the tech experts at Digital Foundry provided <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">an early analysis of the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Nintendo Switch 2 footage</strong> shared last week. At a glance, the new version of the game looks like a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">pared-down version of the PlayStation 5</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">version</strong> running at a lower resolution, but a deeper look shows <strong>how much the game had to be scaled down.</strong></p>



<p>Besides running at an internal resolution of <strong>720p</strong>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> on Nintendo Switch 2 will sport <strong>lower texture quality</strong> than on PlayStation 5 (which also brought a sensible reduction of the game's file size, which will be around 100 GB on Switch 2), <strong>reduced foliage, particle and density, removed shadows</strong> in some instances and <strong>lower shadows resolution</strong> in places where they are still in, and a <strong>sensibly worse hair rendering</strong>. Performance also seems iffy, with visible <strong>frame pacing issues</strong>, though these could be fixed in time for release.</p>



<p>While on paper these visual cutbacks may seem like a lot, the tech experts noted how <strong>they are only truly noticeable with side-by-side comparisons</strong> with the PlayStation 5 release. Ultimately, with platform-specific optimizations, the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 could deliver a better experience than the Steam Deck</strong>, which obviously did not benefit from such optimizations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first game in the next season of Supermassive Games’ Dark Pictures anthology is now available for pre-order.</p>



<p>As revealed in a new trailer, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/directive-8020/" id="90789">Directive 8020</a> will release on May 12, and players can now pre-order it for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles. The game was originally scheduled for early October 2025; however, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/supermassive-games/" id="1159">Supermassive </a>announced layoffs in July 2025, which pushed the release to 2026.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-directive-8020">What to Expect From Directive 8020</h2>



<p>Directive 8020 is a Sci-Fi survival horror game where the Earth is dying, and a crew travels to a new planet that can hopefully be the next home for Humanity. However, the planet is home to an alien organism that can take the form of any crew member, setting the stage for a tense experience.</p>



<p>Lashana Lynch, known for her work in The Woman King, stars in the title, where choices matter and will affect the outcome of the main campaign.</p>



<p>This is the first non-VR Dark Pictures Anthology game since 2022’s The Devil in Me. The games were originally released annually, but the team ultimately decided they didn’t want to be tied to such a demanding schedule.</p>



<p>“We don’t want to be tied down to a game every six months or one every year or anything like that. This game’s big, and we want it to be treated as such,” Will Doyle, creative director of Directive 8020, told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/directive-8020-is-a-notable-upgrade-to-the-dark-pictures-anthologys-formula" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer </a>back in 2024 about the upcoming title.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>There's no denying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> was the big mainstream moment of the series after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">3</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> successfully turned the post-apocalyptic RPG series into something more in line with The Elder Scrolls. More than a decade later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-new-vegas-player-numbers-skyrocket-thanks-to-the-unavoidable-impact-of-fallout-season-2">its player numbers are skyrocketing again</a> after each season of the TV show and we're waiting for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">Switch 2 port</a> coming later this month.</p>
<p>Even if a fifth mainline Fallout is nowhere to be seen, the franchise is enjoying its moment in the spotlight, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/FalloutOralHistory-PartII">Game Informer's excellent multi-part Oral History</a> has been exploring the past, present, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">future of the game series</a>. When talking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> big honcho <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> and other key creatives like lead designer Emil Pagliarulo, more on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>'s genesis and success was uncovered, and it appears everyone at the studio is agreeing on that entry being the franchise's most important one.</p>
<p>"In 4, we swung the other way, really making the world as dense as possible, because we came up with the whole crafting system where every piece of junk you can find, you could use to build and craft things," lead artist Istvan Pely said of the studio's approach to Fallout 4's overarching world design when compared to 3. Most players would tell you what defines the fourth game is the bigger focus on sandbox elements and "endless" content generation through the settlement system and building/crafting mechanics. At the same time, longtime Fallout fans maintain the series lost its way a bit when all that surpassed its RPG core.</p>
<p>Regardless, Fallout 4 remains <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/6rjeDJD4sMW6KGgcyqgQ2Y/fallout-4-sets-record-sales">the series' biggest success</a> to this day, with <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/fallout-4-has-shipped-25-million-units-as-of-2020-as-per-leaked-microsoft-documents">over 25m copies sold by 2020</a> (who knows what the official number is nowadays) and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/377160/charts/#max">Steam data</a> showing it's got the biggest concurrent players, 24-hour peak, and all-time peak numbers versus the rest of the series. Even the online-only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1151340/charts/#max">which is doing mighty fine nowadays</a>, doesn't compare.</p><p>Pagliarulo pointed to the gap between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> and Fallout 4 being a turning point for the studio, as casual "game jams" started to push the developers to try new things that often were fun enough to be kept around as part of the next game. After The Elder Scrolls V's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elder-scrolls-5-skyrim-hearthfire">Hearthfire</a> DLC, additional experimentation led to the now-iconic settlement system that allowed players to put all the once useless loot to good use. "It was a long road to get it functional, to figure out how the U.I. is going to work. We had a sort of team dedicated to that," Pely explained.</p>

<p>In the age of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> becoming a sensation and player expression-oriented games taking off, that entire layer of Fallout 4 added tons of replay value to an already massive RPG. "It was our first go at [player-generated content], but it was worth it, because I think we realized, like, if we can figure this out, that can become sort of a Bethesda staple," Pely added. After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/starfield">Starfield</a>'s focus on player creations of various sorts, including spaceships, it's easy to see how important the 2015 game's reception was for the studio, no matter what you think of it.</p>
<p>More than 10 years after it launched, Todd Howard also seems impressed by how well Fallout 4 has endured: "You feel incredibly fortunate. Like, we’re talking about it 10 years later. I think it’s still probably the most played Fallout game right now, and you just feel really blessed that the fans have taken to it and stuck with it." When you combine everything these Bethesda veterans have to say with the game's astounding financial performance over time, it's easy to see why Fallout 4 on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> has become a priority.</p>

	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>A little more than two years ago, while <strong>Capcom</strong> was enjoying the critical and commercial success of its latest <strong>Resident Evil</strong> remake at the time, <strong>Resident Evil 4 Remake</strong>, the company confirmed that players could expect <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-more-remakes-coming-capcom/">more remakes in the future</a></strong>. We didn't get any indication as to which games would get the RE Remake treatment next, but at this point, there are only so many options left.</p>



<p>Now, despite most of the rumours in the time since Capcom gave that confirmation circling around <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-remake-could-launch-h1-2027/">Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a></strong>, a <strong>new ESRB rating</strong> (spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-5-re5-remake-capcom-xbox-series-2000667258">Kotaku</a>) may have just spoiled Capcom's plans for what's next: <strong>Resident Evil 5 Remake</strong>.</p>



<p>A couple of things point to the <strong><a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40376/resident-evil-5/">new rating</a></strong> indicating a full remake. For one thing, it's a rating for the game on <strong>Xbox Series</strong> consoles, and not to be confused with the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/26295/resident-evil-5/">original rating</a> that lists the PC, PS3, Xbox 360, and Nintendo Switch as its available platforms. Second, it's the mention of "<em>in-game purchases</em>" that points to a remake rather than a re-release. </p>



<p>Anyone who has played the recent RE Remakes and modern RE games (or just modern Capcom games) will know that Capcom has started to include microtransactions that let players buy their way to unlocking everything in the game. If you don't want to bother with grinding to buy everything in the shop or earning all of the in-game rewards, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-ca/product/UP0102-PPSA01556_00-UNLOCKALLREWARDS">you can spend a few bucks</a> to just have it all unlocked. A feature that is notably only included in modern RE titles, which in this case means all of the RE Remakes and everything after RE Biohazard. The re-releases of the original games do not include any such microtransactions.</p>



<p>Add to that the fact that <strong>Eva La Dare,</strong> who played <strong>Sheva Alomar</strong> in RE5, recently shared a post that seemed to hint towards new RE5-related news coming, and it seems like everything is coming together for an RE5 Remake reveal. That said, it's also worth noting that notable RE leaker, Dusk Golem, denies that we'll get a reveal for an RE5 Remake this year, and claims that La Dare's post is related to something else.</p>



<p>Golem instead insists that the next RE remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-resident-evil-remake-that-starts-with-c-and-ends-ode-veronica-will-be-announced-this-year-insider-claims/">we'll see is Code Veronica</a>, even going so far as to "<em>promise</em>" RE fans that it'll be announced over an RE5 Remake.</p>



<p>Of course, while leakers like Dusk Golem have been able to accurately predict announcements from Capcom before, their claims are rarely a guarantee. The only people we can confidently say really know what La Dare's post is about are La Dare and the developers at Capcom. If an RE5 Remake is announced, then that doesn't mean Code Veronica has been shelved permanently, if that is still on its way. </p>



<p>The reverse is also true, because this listing at least implies that Capcom is preparing some kind of new release for RE5. It's possible that we'll find out more at this week's upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-announced/">State of Play</a></strong>, though that'll depend on whether Capcom wants to take any attention away from Requiem, which is launching at the end of this month.</p>

Pre-orders are open now if you're so inclined.</p><p>The announcement of the game's release date comes after Supermassive was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4db18d67-941e-4b12-935b-7652cefa5397" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs back in July</a>, which also resulted in the game being delayed beyond its originally-intended 2025 release window. Evidently, the studio has now arrived at a point at which it feels comfortable releasing <em>Directive 8020</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As for the game itself, Supermassive is promising "immersive cinematic storytelling and edge-of-your-seat horror" in <em>Directive 8020</em>, and it sounds as though Supermassive has put some work into the gameplay so things are a little more interactive this time around.</p><p>With that said, if you've played a Supermassive game (think <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/quarry" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9c41b165-ee61-4a44-9922-2f8e10b4b214" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>The Quarry</em></a>, the <em>Dark Pictures </em>games, or the original <em>Until Dawn</em>), then you'll probably know roughly what to expect from this one; it'll be a choice-focused horror adventure with plenty of tough decisions to make.</p><p>Story-wise, the game takes a lot of influence from movies like John Carpenter's iconic <em>The Thing</em>. The crew of the colony ship Cassiopeia crash-lands on the planet Tau Ceti f, and before long, they're being hunted by an alien capable of mimicking humans.</p><p>You'll have to "overcome your enemies using improvised weapons, lightning reflexes, and stealth", according to Supermassive, but you'll also need to make decisions about who might be hiding in plain sight as your alien enemy.</p>
<p><em>Directive 8020 </em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2255370/Directive_8020/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/directive-8020/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S on May 12th.

<p>May 12th, to be exact. Supermassive have put out the fresh trailer above to celebrate, and as you can see, Directive 8020's a game with plenty of 'do one thing or do other thing' bits. The key is trying to work out which of your shipmates has been replaced with a body double secretly made of weird fleshslime. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassives-next-dark-pictures-horror-game-directive-2080-is-out-2025-and-looks-like-alien-meets-the-thing">Edwin wrote a while ago</a>, it's very much aiming for the same paranoid vibes as the likes of The Thing and Alien.</p>
<p>You make choices, those choices have consequences that can often prove fatal for others, and those consequences feed into how future scenarios play out as the corridors of the ship grow to resemble the insides of alien intestines. Forming a key wrinkle to this are "Turning Points" a new mechanic making its Dark Pictures debut. Basically, it lets you "rewind and revisit key decisions", allowing you to save characters or see alternative paths without having to start over.</p><p>For those who reckon that undermines the weight of what you pick, there's a survivor mode which ensures every death is permanent, as has been the case in Dark Pictures entries up to now. In good news for fans of the outdoors, the trailer also offers a first glimpse of the crew heading out for a wander on the surface of Tau Ceti f. The weather's a bit grim, but hey, as long as you wrap up in your spacesuit you shouldn't suffer too much.</p>
<p>Directive 8020'll have both single-player and co-op for upto five players when it barges through the airlock on May 12th, will Supermassive indicating that online multiplayer will follow via a free post-launch update. If you're so inclined, you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2255370/Directive_8020/">Steam</a>.</p>

 <p>“We are currently at work on a large-scale expansion similar to <em>Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</em> for <em>Monster Hunter: Wild</em>s,” said Tsujimoto. “We plan to share more information with you this summer.”</p>  <p>While Tsujimoto didn’t share any other details about the expansion, the producer did provide more details on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/09/monster-hunter-wilds-new-content-update-and-arch-tempered-arkveld-arrive-february-18/"><em>Wilds</em>‘ big anniversary update arriving on February 18</a>. Players can expect some crossover content with the upcoming spin-off <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3,</em> as well as an anniversary event that will make most previous rewards and quests “re-available.” Each previous seasonal event will also return for a weekly rotation. Players who log in during the event will also receive a free item pack.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, the producer shared some encouraging news about improving <em>Wilds</em>‘ performance, <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-update-optimization-tu4-capcom-when-2000618404">an issue that has plagued and continues to be a problem for the game since its release last February.</a></p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“We have been implementing improvements to game stability and performance since Title Update 4,” Tsujimoto added, “and this [February 18] update will introduce even further improvements.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">This anniversary update is the final “major content update” for the game as the <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> team moves on to developing the upcoming expansion, so hopefully this last big update for the base game can improve performance on PC in a big way. <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149">If not, well, I expect modders will keep doing good work on that front</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“It just didn't make sense for us to just disregard that part of our experience.”</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Take one look at Zero Parades: For Dead Spies, the upcoming RPG from ZA/UM, and you can immediately see the similarities between it and the studio’s previous game, Disco Elysium. It’s an isometric game with a striking art style, featuring dialogue-heavy gameplay where conversations are displayed vertically on the right-hand side of the screen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take a closer look and there are even more similarities. There’s a “Conditioning” system that replicates many of the functions of Disco Elysium’s unique Thought Cabinet. Its story aims to be deeply political and introspective. And then there’s the skills system, which manifests as a sentient inner monologue, commenting on your choices and the world around you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some Disco Elysium fans, this overlap may feel uneasy. In 2022, game director Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov – creatives key to the look, feel, and vision of the celebrated RPG – were among a number of staff who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-developers-involuntarily-left-zaum-responds"><u>left the studio in an "involuntary" manner</u></a>. ZA/UM claimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-directors-accuse-zaum-shareholders-of-fraud-as-the-company-says-they-were-fired-for-misconduct"><u>they were fired for misconduct</u></a>, while Kurvitz and Rostov accused the company’s majority shareholders of fraud. Many fans believe those fired to be victims of corporate conspiracy. Those same fans may now be concerned to see the studio building a Disco Elysium successor based on such similar design foundations without the involvement of those original creatives.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview, IGN discussed these concerns with Jim Ashilevi, writer and VO director at ZA/UM, and asked why the studio didn’t consider finding a new direction for Zero Parades. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it would have made sense for us to go in a completely different direction if the entire team was comprised of new talent,” Ashilevi said. “But since such a large number of the key players that built Disco Elysium are here to build Zero Parades, it just didn't make sense for us to just disregard that part of our experience as amateur game makers and start learning new ways of telling stories.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">ZA/UM’s head of studio, Allen Murray, estimates that around 35% of the studio’s current staff roster is made up of people who worked on either the original version of Disco Elysium or the expanded “Final Cut” release. The studio’s total staff numbers around 90. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're still the same people,” Ashilevi continued. “We still have the same interests. The stuff that interests us in the world of video games, but also in other media – in film and literature and theater – that hasn't changed. Hopefully it has evolved, but I think we're still basically the same people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're just going by our gut, basically, and we're following our own obsessions,” he said. “And a lot of that was present in Disco Elysium. It will be present in Zero Parades as well, largely due to the fact that those are the same people who were there to build that cool world.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a previous interview with members of ZA/UM, which took place just prior to Gamescom 2025, IGN asked Ashilevi and lead technical artist Nicolas Pirot how they felt about fans who may be feeling cautious about a new ZA/UM RPG following the departures of Kurvitz, Rostov, and others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I understand why some people might have reservations,” said Pirot. “It's not up to me to tell them what to think or what to experience. I think what we are trying to do is tell an incredible story. And I think all we can do is hope that, when Zero Parades is ready, that people like it enough to participate and to see who we are as a group.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are here to write more stories,” Ashilevi added. “That's all we're here for. And if that upsets people or makes them feel cautious, fair. But there is a new game coming out soon and I hope you check it out. And if you don't like it, that's fine. That's completely fine.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ZA/UM intends to launch Zero Parades this year. An espionage RPG themed around power struggles and failure, the team hopes it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/power-comic-books-and-zero-parades-for-dead-spies-how-zaum-found-its-disco-elysium-successor"><u>will stand distinct from Disco Elysium without “fully re-inventing the wheel.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/zaums-new-rpg-is-similar-to-disco-elysium-because-were-still-the-same-people]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Mario Tennis Fever Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-review</link>
            <guid>1431133</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Tennis Fever has the soul of a GameCube game. Its wacky, over-the-top take on tennis is at its best when you have four friends together on the couch. And for the first time since the GameCube era, series developer Camelot has delivered an entry that feels feature complete on day one, with the most unique characters, solo and multiplayer modes, and silly gimmicks we’ve ever seen crammed into a Mario Tennis game. Sadly, that doesn’t mean it’s all <em>good </em>content, as the single-player adventure once again comes up woefully short in terms of both its length and quality. But when playing locally or online, Fever’s tight, responsive controls and crazy abilities result in a chaotic party game that’s a lot of fun in short bursts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The headline twist this time around are the mighty Fever Rackets, which dominate the action. There are 30 to choose from, and each comes with a unique special ability that can swing the game in your favor. Those powers are activated by pulling off a Fever Shot once your gauge is full, and they range from offensive, like planting a rotating Fire Bar straight from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> on your opponent’s side of the court, to defensive, like creating a shadow double of yourself to cover more ground. They can also block your screen with ink, litter piles of banana peels on both sides of the court, or grant time-limited buffs, like making your shots curvier for the next 20 seconds. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Tennis Fever Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fever Rackets are a blast to experiment with, and their inclusion adds a different flavor to each match. At their best, they force you to think about all the special quirks in play. If I place a slippery sheet of ice on one quadrant of my rival’s turf, we both know I’m probably going to try and hit my next shot right at it to force them onto the uncomfortable terrain. Or… will I? Shot placement in tennis is full of mindgames, and the Fever Racket’s transformative effects enhance that dynamic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also checks and balances to each that are fun to uncover. The Bullet Bill Racket transforms the ball into a wicked fast line drive that appears<em> </em>overpowered at first glance, until you learn it can be easily neutralized by playing up close at the net. And when both players use this racket, it can result in a hilarious, rapid Bullet Bill rally that usually ends with a demoralizing body shot. Mixing and matching racket types to see what happens is great, which is why it really bothers me that there’s no way to randomly select your Fever Racket for either human players or CPU opponents, as it would be fun to try to make the most of the cards you’re dealt. You <em>can </em>randomly select characters and courts, just not rackets, so that feels like a prime candidate to be added in a post-launch update.</p><p>The Fever Rackets are a blast to experiment with, and they add a different flavor to each match.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some Fever Rackets are definitely stronger than others, but Mario Tennis Fever adds a smart mechanic to somewhat balance them out. When a player initiates a Fever Shot, most offensive effects don’t take place until the ball hits the ground, leading to a tense back-and-forth volley where both players desperately try to hit the ball before it bounces. You have to be confident in choosing which one to bring into the match and when to unleash it, because the wrong decision can see your opponent sending your big shot right back at you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flipside, Fever Rackets can also make things feel more luck-based at times, especially in doubles. Four separate powers in play can lead to courts that are completely covered in mud, fire, and unregulated chaos, similar to playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/06/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review"><u>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</u></a> with all items cranked to the max. When your health hits zero – which forces you to sit on the sidelines in doubles or move at a slower speed in singles – it often doesn’t feel like your fault because of how unavoidable taking damage becomes. Even your doubles partner’s Fever Shot can hurt you. This isn’t necessarily bad; Fever just leans harder into the party game side of things than its predecessor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/20/mario-tennis-aces-review"><u>Mario Tennis Aces</u></a>, which almost resembled a competitive fighting game with high-level mechanics like bar management and perfect blocks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Rally Time</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">To account for all the mayhem that Fever Rackets entail, the actual tennis is a bit simpler. The overall speed is slightly slower and floatier, last-second dives for the ball make mistakes less punishing, and the court is a little smaller, meaning it’s easier to reach cross-court shots and keep a point going. I understand this choice: Aces’ intense pace combined with Fever’s increased madness would probably be too much to keep up with. On one hand, I miss the more hardcore version of tennis Aces provided. I played that game online for years because of its high skill ceiling and rewarding mechanics – it was a truly inspired take on the sport. On the other hand, Fever is way more fun to invite friends over to play for a casual game night since it’s easier for newcomers to pick up. It’s worse as a competitive tennis game, but better as a party tennis game. Plus, most modes let you use a high-speed ball that leads to a more upbeat rhythm, even if it doesn’t entirely resolve my disappointment that Aces’ thrilling trick shots, racket health, and time-bending abilities have been replaced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, it still feels really good to anticipate where the ball is going, get in position, and release a fully-charged topspin shot, complete with great, punchy sound effects. Camelot has been refining the same control scheme of drop shots, lobs, and angled smashes for decades, and it’s still fun to return to, especially with CPUs that actually put up a fight at higher difficulties and the largest roster the series has ever seen. There are 38 characters to choose from, each with their own stats and unique traits. Newcomer Baby Waluigi has been a breakout star online, but I’ve actually gravitated towards the overlooked Baby Wario, whose powered-up topspin shot helps me control the pace of each point. I’m also happy to see the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> redesigns of DK and Diddy Kong show up.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The character models are probably the best-looking part of Fever, with detailed clothes and facial animations, like the texture on Luigi’s shirt or even more bristles in Mario’s mustache than before. However, it doesn’t blow me away visually as a Switch 2 exclusive. Its cartoony art style looks good, as Mario games generally do, but it doesn’t feel like a significant leap forward. It targets 60 fps and <em>usually </em>hits that, but I noticed a few times in splitscreen doubles matches where it dipped before the ball was served. At least it’s always consistent when it matters most during the point, even with all the wild Fever effects on screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping in line with Fever’s GameCube spirit, you have to unlock a bunch of characters, rackets, courts, and special costumes by clearing specific challenges, playing a certain number of matches, and progressing through the Adventure mode. Recent Mario sport games have tied progression and unlockables to online play, so it was a welcome sight to boot up Fever for the first time and see I had plenty to chase that wasn’t tied to my internet connection. That is, until I booted up the Adventure mode and discovered what I was in for.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Baby Fever</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re primarily looking forward to Mario Tennis Fever because of its single-player Adventure mode, I’m sad to share that it’s easily the most underwhelming part of this package. Mario, Luigi, Peach, Wario, and Waluigi get transformed into babies, and Mario must regain his tennis skills to save everyone, for some reason. It starts out promising, with a few gorgeous early cutscenes that throw Mario and friends into unexpected situations. Camelot upholds its reputation for surprisingly great cinematics like this, but the Adventure mode only goes downhill from there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first 90 minutes of this disappointingly short three-and-a-half hour campaign take place at a tennis academy, where Baby Mario undergoes painfully drawn-out, simplistic tutorials about the basics. You complete fairly one-note minigames to increase your stats, mash through text that reiterates each shot type, and partake in ridiculously easy qualification matches to move up the ranks. Throughout, you are also quizzed on your tennis knowledge, like one stumper where I was asked which character type was known for its speed: all-around, defensive, or <em>speedy. </em>Take a guess. This is clearly meant for young kids playing their first Mario Tennis game, and “Tutorial” would’ve been a more appropriate name than “Adventure”. It would be more enjoyable if the writing was funny or clever, but the characters all say very vanilla things that essentially only exist to teach you how to play. This is a far cry from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/03/golf-story-review"><u>Golf Story</u></a>, which remains the gold standard for how to do a proper campaign in an arcadey sports game that combines strong writing, interesting challenges, and off-the-wall diversions, all of which are missing here.</p><p>Adventure mode is filled with drawn-out tutorials and one-note minigames.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You eventually leave the academy to progress through a comically small world map. This part of Adventure strongly resembles Aces’ campaign, where you use your tennis skills to fight a handful of bosses and solve very light puzzles. There are a few challengers to find, but there’s a surprising lack of tennis matches in this tennis campaign – and just when I felt like things were ramping up, it was over, so I shrugged and moved onto the other single-player offerings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tournament mode is a staple of Mario Tennis, and this is unfortunately one of its worst forms. Playing through three separate brackets to win trophies is fine as always, but Fever introduces an announcer in the form of a Talking Flower from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-review">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> who never stops commentating. He reacts to every single shot, and I felt like I’d heard all of his voice lines multiple times before even wrapping up my second tournament. It gets grating very quickly, and I can’t imagine even kids would enjoy the nonstop commentary. The Talking Flower is turned on for all modes by default, but thankfully you can disable it everywhere… except in Tournament and Adventure.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The runaway best single-player mode is Trial Towers, a new addition that reminds me of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/12/03/super-smash-bros-melee"><u>Super Smash Bros. Melee</u></a>’s Events. Each trial throws a specific setup at you, like a match where your Fever Gauge is always full or a battle of three babies against a giant Bowser, and it’s up to you to figure out how to exploit the setup and win a brief five-point match. There are even optional, difficult achievements for completionists, like winning without taking damage, or never losing a point. It’s a lot of fun working your way through each challenge, and incorporating this concept into an Adventure mode with unique characters and an interesting story should be the way forward for this series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As always, Mario Tennis Fever shines in multiplayer, and there’s plenty of flexibility in that department. You can compete online in ranked matches split, between singles and doubles, either with Fever Rackets or without them. Winning boosts your point total as you work to improve your letter grade, with rankings scheduled to reset at the start of each month. I was only able to play online for a couple hours before launch, but my experience was smooth. In addition to playing with up to four people locally, you can bring two people from one console into a private online lobby and set up any type of casual match you’d like. </p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks Every Mario Tennis</h3><p>I haven't played Mario's Tennis on Virtual Boy (yet!!) so it's not ranked.</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/MrHurgy/lists/every-mario-tennis-ranked" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">When you want something besides the standard tennis, you and your friends can pick a special match like the motion-control-focused Swing Mode, the traditional Ring Shot mode where you compete to score the most points by hitting the ball through rings floating above the net, a pinball court that uses bumpers and paddles, or a court that introduces Mario Wonder’s Wonder Effects like floating hippos. These range from decent distractions, like carefully aiming your Fever Shots at Piranha Plants to grow the size of your opponent’s court, to completely uninteresting, like repeatedly lobbing and dropshotting the ball just out of reach of a mindless CPU opponent upwards of 30 times in a row.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t take long for even the best special modes to get repetitive, and I found myself quickly going back to the standard tennis matches. Thankfully, that specific mode has more than enough to shake things up thanks to the large roster of characters and rackets, but it ends up feeling like too much of a good thing. Fever is still a lot of fun in briefer sessions, but when I think of the breadth of worthwhile content found in Nintendo’s other recent multiplayer options like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review">Kirby Air Riders</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, Fever comes up a bit short. After 20 hours, I already feel like I’ve had my fill, and I see it as more of a fun distraction to play for a few minutes here and there while my group warms up for something else rather than one that’s going to get a serious amount of playtime.</p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Predictably, Mario Tennis Fever is the most fun when you’re playing with a few friends. The new Fever Rackets introduce wacky, over-the-top powers that put a different spin on each match and result in a chaotic party game that’s more approachable for newcomers. It’s tough to recommend to solo players, as Fever’s bland, uninspired Adventure mode is more of an extended tutorial than an actual adventure. But exciting multiplayer moments, great controls, and a huge character roster make it a good addition to your next in-person or online game night, even if it doesn’t have enough staying power to be the main event.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-review]]></content:encoded>

		<p dir="ltr">Supermassive Games has announced a new release date for their upcoming The Dark Pictures horror game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/directive-8020">Directive 8020</a>. The sci-fi scarer will launch on 12th May 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC with pre-orders now available.</p>

<p>The new trailer gives another glimpse into the decision-making and the absence of trust you might feel while playing Directive 8020. With the ship’s crew facing an alien threat that can morph into and inhabit their forms, you can’t trust that anyone is who they say they are.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cooper, the ship’s medic, features in this trailer, having to make a decision about whether to let their crewmate Mitchell through a sealed door. However, previous decisions could reshape this situation, so that Cooper and not Commander Stafford has a gun, and when faced with two identical versions of Engineer Cernan, you’ll have to decide which one is real.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The trailer also shows more of Brianna Young (played by Lashana Lynch), who’s the real lead of the tale, and gives a very first look at on-planet gameplay as the ship reaches Tau Ceti f.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A new feature for the series is Turning Points, which allows you to more easily rewind and revisit key moments in the story. This will allow for completionists to explore narrative branches, or for regret-filled players to go back and undo fatal mistakes, but there is still a survivors mode that removes this safety net and makes every death permanent within a playthrough.</p>
<p>Directive 8020 will launch first with single player and up to 5-player couch co-op, while online multiplayer will be coming in a free post-launch update sometime later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> will be getting a "<em><strong>large-scale expansion</strong></em>" later this year, with <strong>Capcom</strong> set to reveal the expansion at some point in <strong>Summer 2026</strong>, the company confirmed today in its update regarding what's coming to the game in February 2026.</p>



<p>After digging into what players can look forward to in Monster Hunter Wilds' new update, which is set to be out on <strong>February 18, 2026,</strong> producer <strong>Ryozo Tsujimoto </strong>concluded by looking ahead to what's next for Wilds as we move deeper into the year. </p>



<p>"<em>Now, I'd like to talk about what's next for Monster Hunter Wilds,</em>" Tsujimoto began. "<em>We are currently at work on a <strong>large-scale expansion</strong>, similar to <strong>Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</strong> and <strong>Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</strong> for Monster Hunter Wilds.</em> <em>We plan to share more information with you this summer, so please look forward to it."</em></p>



<p>That's about all the information we got on this coming expansion, but comparing it to both Iceborne and Sunbreak gives us an idea of how much will be included in this expansion. The added tease that it'll be revealed this summer also gives us two major options for when Capcom will reveal it: either <strong>Summer Game Fest</strong> or <strong>Gamescom</strong>. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>But that's all still months away. What's happening much, much sooner for Wilds players is the release of <strong>Update 1.041,</strong> which includes a 10-star Arch-tempered Arkveld quest (and 10-star quests for all the previous Arch-tempered monsters), a special collaboration with <strong>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</strong> to celebrate that game's coming arrival on <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/"><strong>March 13, 2026,</strong></a> and plenty of event quests to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Wilds' launch.</p>



<p>The coming update will also include a new weapon designed by the winning artist from Capcom's recent design contest. Only the winning design officially made it into the game, but all 16 finalists will be credited in the patch notes for the update.</p>

<p>Hopefully for Capcom, its 2026 plans and the coming expansion will be able to kick Monster Hunter Wilds into a new gear with regard to its commercial sales. Despite Capcom releasing several updates to address problems players had with the game, across its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-significant-performance-improvements/">technical issues</a></strong> and design issues, namely <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">a lack of challenge</a></strong> for veteran players, Wilds still isn't selling at the rate Capcom would hope.</p>



<p>That's not to say it has sold poorly. Its massive launch helped make it one of the best-selling games in 2025, but according to the company's latest financial results, Wilds is actually <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-pretty-damning-lapsed-players-may-not-be-coming-back-to-monster-hunter-wilds-after-all-as-monster-hunter-rise-continues-to-outsell-the-game/">selling less than its predecessor</a></strong>, <strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong>. That fact really puts into context why producer <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>Yuya Tokuda</strong> was pleading with players</a> who put the game down shortly after launch to return.</p>



<p>Of course, this coming expansion could be the thing to turn everything around for Wilds. It wouldn't be the first time a Monster Hunter game was sent into the stratosphere because of an expansion that completely changed the makeup of the game. </p>



<p>If you're a player who put down Monster Hunter Wilds shortly after launch for one reason or another, let us know below what it would take to get you to return.</p>

Fares revealed the news alongside a photo of himself in a motion-capture studio, with actors wearing mo-cap suits in the background.</p><p>Fares' arm artfully obscures the faces of the actors in question, however, so we don't know who's going to be in the game, nor do we know what the scene is that the group is working on. Still, it's nice to know Hazelight isn't resting on its laurels.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Unfortunately, Hazelight and Fares haven't revealed any further details about what they might be working on, so we don't know exactly what we can expect from the studio next.</p><p>However, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-sales-almost-27m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="584c9873-b01a-4f97-88c9-bc5b2b3ddb0b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">overwhelming success</a> of all of Hazelight's previous co-op titles (namely <em>Split Fiction</em>, <em>It Takes Two</em>, and <em>A Way Out</em>), it's probably pretty safe to assume that Hazelight's next game will be a co-op adventure along similar lines to its previous three titles.</p><p>Hazelight's last game, <em>Split Fiction</em>, has proven so popular among players that it's already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="249fa328-8f25-4975-b468-c4dc37526434" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">netted itself a movie adaptation</a>, with actress Sydney Sweeney <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="105b35be-df6f-4f5c-8f24-3e9c7adc0b61" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">already attached to the project</a> alongside <em>Deadpool and Wolverine </em>writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.</p><p>Indeed, movie and TV adaptations of Hazelight's previous adventure <em>It Takes Two </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-movie-and-tv-adaptations-in-works" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e533eb5a-c393-43f4-836a-16e1dbdf765e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">were announced back in 2022</a> as well, although we're yet to hear further details about those projects.</p>
