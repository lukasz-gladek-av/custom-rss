<p data-characters="233" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In the ever-crowded world of games inspired by the work of FromSoftware, you wouldn’t expect the story of a plucky hermit crab trying to recover his beloved shell from an undersea capitalist hellscape to hit the nail so thoroughly.</p> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">The setting of <em>Another Crab’s Treasure </em>couldn’t be any further from Lordran, or Drangelic, or Lothric, and so on. Instead of a grim expanse, players are immediately introduced to a colorful ecosystem in the depths of the ocean, at least for most of the adventure. Under that spongy veil, thorough challenges await, ready to pounce on the adorably naive Kril.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="782" data-injectable="true">The story starts innocently enough. Kril is minding his own business when a loan shark — you can probably imagine how literal this interpretation is — appears and reclaims his shell, citing the Duchy of Slacktide’s annexation of this particular tide pool. It turns out Kril owes more than his fair share of back taxes, so unless he can pony up he’s out one delightful little home-on-the-go.</p>
 <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">From there, Kril’s adventure begins, taking him through an aquatic world under the affliction of a mysterious curse. That curse, it turns out, is our good friend pollution, an inevitable side effect of the aforementioned capitalist hellscape. As above, so below.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false"><em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em> <strong>(PC [Reviewed], PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)</strong><br><strong>Developer: Aggro Crab</strong><br><strong>Publisher: Aggro Crab</strong><br><strong>Released: April 25, 2024</strong><br><strong>MSRP: $29.99</strong></p> <h2 id="h-wetter-is-better" data-injectable="false">Wetter is better</h2> <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">Despite his seemingly innocent nature, Kril isn’t going to take this one lying down. He quickly grabs a fork and sets off on a quest to get his shell back, getting more than he bargained for along the way. As he meets new allies and uncovers new, more intimidating parts of the sea, he’ll have to fend off all the crustaceans and similarly mad creatures that have already succumbed to the affliction known as “Gunk.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="700" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">Many of the classic Soulslike ponderments are answered right out of the gate. What’s the stand-in for Bonfires? Moon Snail Shells. Is there a parry and riposte system it would behoove you to master? Absolutely. There’s even a primary central location known as The Sands Between, so the team at Aggro Crab are having plenty of fun with the sub-genre. As Kril progresses, he’ll enter arenas littered with empty shells, taking in the scenery briefly before some hulking foe appears, health bar stretching across the screen like the yawning abyss itself.&nbsp;In many ways, especially with grappling present, it’s even closer to something like FromSoft’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-sekiro-shadows-die-twice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a></em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="581" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true">If Kril wants to survive more than a few hits in these and even the countless standard enemy battles, he’ll need to find the right shell for the job. Thankfully, the very detritus that contributes to the decline of maritime civilization can be used to your advantage. Soda bottle tops, shot glasses, and thimbles can become trusty means of defense. If you’re really in a pinch, you can slip into a banana peel, or maybe a discarded milk carton; they all have their own unique stats, from the amount of damage they can take to built-in secondary attacks and buffs.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="657" data-current-count="957" data-injectable="true">When the going gets tough — and it often does — you can always increase stats through leveling. Defeated enemies and bosses drop Microplastics, which are this game’s take on Souls. You can also sell junk you find, from clothespins to paperclips, for larger amounts of Microplastics. Aiding you further is a skill tree, the nodes of which can be purchased with crystals. It starts with the basic Shelleportation skill that lets you warp between Moon Snail Shells. From there, it branches off into everything from the essential parry and riposte to the ability to use consumable Barbed Hook items to reel in vulnerable enemies for a pummelin’.</p>
 <p data-characters="552" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">Toss in Stowaways, which can add passive benefits when you have a shell equipped, as well as powerful Adaptation moves, and you have an action game that gives you plenty of options for improvement and the eventual besting of some legitimately tough opponents. Despite its cute exterior, <em>Another Crab’s Treasure </em>doesn’t shy away from throwing you into the deep end quick, both literally and figuratively. In true genre fashion, you’ll die and die again at the hands of its many bosses, but Kril always has a fighting chance to survive.</p>
 <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">One of the advantages is the fact that you don’t respawn all the way back at the nearest Moon Snail Shell after a boss kills you. Instead, you have the option of returning to life right outside the arena. Said arenas always have more shells to pick up, and there are often extra Heartkelp Pods — the equivalent of flasks — lying around. If all of that isn’t enough of an advantage for you, you could always just shrug, cock your gun, and let the fight end before it even begins. &nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-armed-and-dangerous" data-injectable="false">Armed and dangerous</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="580" data-current-count="880" data-injectable="true">Let’s talk about the gun. Yes, Kril has a gun, and it packs some mighty heat. Kril’s gun isn’t something you’re going to find buried deep in the darkest depths of the ocean; it’s actually sitting right there waiting for you at the bottom of the accessibility menu. <em>Another Crab’s Treasure </em>is keen on letting you have fun, regardless of your skill level, so there are a wealth of options to choose from should you ever find yourself banging your head against a particularly rigid wall. Among those options is one especially powerful last resort.</p>
 <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">If you toggle the gun on, it appears as a literal gun in place of Kril’s shell, absolutely dwarfing him. Not that it takes much to dwarf a tiny hermit crab, but still, it’s really big. That makes it extra funny when Kril uses it to fire at enemies, most of which will go down in one shot from a very generous distance. This applies to bosses, as well. If your skills aren’t quite cutting it at any point in the journey, you can just toggle the gun on and one-shot that colossal creature that’s been thrashing you for the past hour or so.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="951" data-current-count="951" data-injectable="true">Naturally, if you choose to use the gun, you’re not going to get any better at <em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em>. Allow me to push my spectacles up and murmur, just loud enough to hear, <em>“”You cheated not only the game, but yourself,</em>“<em> etc. etc</em>. If you want to improve, you’ll have to brave Kril’s toughest challenges with the abilities you’ve earned. If you don’t, though, or if you just want to breeze through a section of the game? Hell, go for it. I know it’s controversial, but I believe games should be fun, and if you’re not having fun, you should either play a different game or let a crab use a gun. There are other less “final” options, too, like decreasing the damage Kril takes, lowering enemy health, or even increasing the parry and dodge windows. Whether you use them or not, it’s great that features like this exist and do nothing to detract from the game itself.</p>
 <h2 id="h-that-swamp-is-poisooon" data-injectable="false">That swamp is poisooon</h2> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">Circling back to that FromSoft checklist, the team at Aggro Crab decided to seal their loving missive to Hidetaka Miyazaki and co. with a deadly kiss. Yes, there is a poison swamp equivalent in <em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em>, and yes it is a pain in the ass. It’s very easy to fall in and boost your poison meter, or have some gnarly fish vomit on you and boost your poison meter, or, you get the picture. Somewhere, Miyazaki is smiling the most devilish of smiles, reflecting upon the hell he so effectively wrought.</p>
 <p data-characters="660" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">This area was really the turning point for me. While the whole of Flotsam Vale wasn’t actually that miserable, it sets the tone for the rest of the adventure. Kril eventually makes his way beyond a pier, to a factory that deals in magnet manipulation and platforming and very much overstays its welcome. I’ve certainly played 3D action games with worse platforming, but <em>Another Crab’s Treasure </em>never really makes a case for why it’s so prevalent. There’s a lot of verticality, and the punishment for falling is minimal, but between wrestling with the camera and just wanting to get on with it, the tuna was starting to turn.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">By the time I completed the area, I figured I was getting near the end anyway, but there’s actually a ton of game beyond that. Some of it is really great! Some of it, not so much. On one hand, I absolutely appreciate how much work went into Kril’s journey. Aggro Crab put a ton of care into this, from the surprisingly earnest and funny story to some excellent voice acting and an abundance of fully-realized locales and imaginative challenges.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="582" data-current-count="882" data-injectable="true">On the other hand, much of it left me feeling fatigued. Each individual area is typically populated with a handful of enemies that you’ll either love squaring off against or feel the need to avoid at all costs. I found myself being momentarily wowed in each new zone before quickly wanting to rush ahead and see what else they cooked up for me. You know what that sounds like? <em>Dark Souls</em>! Like I said, they absolutely nailed what they were going for. There comes a certain point, though, when seeing the credits roll sooner might have been a salve for a wounded warrior.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="587" data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true">As draining as I found some of the backend to be, most of the boss fights are really well done. Like all good games of the genre, I still find myself thinking about many of them well after completing the main story. I loved the moves of bosses like Heikea, Intimidation Crab, who stomps down atop a sunken boat and wails at Kril with a set of freshly-snapped chopsticks, the arena littered with sushi rolls that can serve as makeshift shells.&nbsp;Voltai, the Accumulator, is an electric eel with some novel stage-based gimmicks. Even the final boss has some interesting surprises in store. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="727" data-current-count="1027" data-injectable="true">Even with some crab-meat caveats, it’s really difficult to be too down on my overall experience. There’s so much to like about <em>Another Crab’s Treasure </em>that I keep coming back to everything they accomplished. The underwater world, the puns, the monster designs that include iconic threats like “crab with knives rubber-banded to its claws”; it is the very essence of commitment to the bit. Outside of some frustrating platforming, it’s also just really fun to move Kril around. The way he skitters across the ocean floor, fluidly dodge-rolls to and fro, uses his hook to zip higher up, and floats with all his might to get just a bit more distance under his little leggies; great stuff.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">Part of me wishes <em>Another Crab’s Treasure </em>predated the <em>Souls </em>games, just so we would have to refer to genre offshoots as Crablikes. The sauce is certainly thick on this one, and I’ll be thinking about it for quite some time. <em>Another Crab’s Treasure </em>pulls off exactly what it set out to do, and it’s going to be a favorite for many. Thanks to some of the less palatable late-game moments, it didn’t quite get to that level for me, but I very much appreciate all the shell-bound friends and pelagic puns I met along the way.&nbsp;</p>

Ubisoft revealed a remastered Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th anniversary edition  this week, out on 25th June, but that's not the Beyond Good &amp; Evil many are hungering for. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a> was announced back in 2008, around 16 years ago. I remember writing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/omigod-omigod-omigod">that trailer of Pey'j the porcine mechanic eating a fly</a> for a blog somewhere. "Fly-eating mechanics confirmed?" I probably scribbled, in the blessed innocence of youth.
</p>

<p>
Since then, it's been one long series of delays, reannouncements, key team departures and sad losses. Original director Michel Ancel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rayman-co-creator-michel-ancel-says-hes-leaving-video-games">left Ubisoft in 2020</a> following <a href="https://www.vg247.com/report-michel-ancel-accused-of-abusive-disruptive-practices-on-beyond-good-evil-2">accusations of disorganised and abusive management</a>, while creative director Emile Morel died suddenly in July 2023 at the age of 40. Many speculate that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 will never make it into the wilds. Ubisoft have, however, sought to restore the faith a little by adding a new mission to the Beyond Good &amp; Evil anniversary edition which links to the events of the sequel.
</p>
<p>
The mission in question is a treasure hunt in which players can learn about protagonist Jade's childhood by acquiring cosmetic rewards. "This exclusive new mission also reveals more about the narrative link to Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, showing Ubisoft's enduring commitment to the franchise," Ubisoft promised in a press release.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn't take this as a hint that a Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 re-reveal is imminent, but I find it more concrete as evidence that development is on-going than any of Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-worry-beyond-good-evil-2-has-survived-ubisofts-recent-game-cull">recent reassurances</a>. I imagine the game has changed a lot since its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/take-a-long-look-through-the-spyglass-at-beyond-good-and-evil-2-in-action">last big public splash at E3 2018</a>, which wowed us with talk of procedural planets, simulated solar system physics, jetpacks, swordfights and the ability to build your own starfighter. Here's that footage again, for auld time's sake.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24183139/league-of-legends-anima-squad-swarm-summer-event-2024-game-mode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="TCEmnc"><em>League of Legends</em>’ summer event is always a highlight for the year. In past years, we’ve seen visual novels and deep dives into alternate universes like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23760910/league-of-legends-soul-fighter-summer-event-arena-game-mode-new">Soul Fighter</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23363529/league-of-legends-spirit-blossom-skins-syndra-sett-soraka">Spirit Blossom</a>, or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23216757/league-of-legends-star-guardian-fan-response">Star Guardian</a>. This year, the Anima Squad skin line gets the spotlight, along with a new survivor-style bullet heaven game that can be played co-op or solo.</p>
<p id="oEb5JC">Anima Squad debuted in 2022, and depicts <em>League</em> champions as cybernetic, animal-themed warriors defending humanity. This year, we’re getting new crew members like Battle Bunny Aurora, the new champion’s debut skin; Battle Bear Illaoi; and Cyber Cat Yuumi. </p>
<p id="0apaqQ">In the lore of Anima Squad, humanity has been pushed back to a few bastions. Primordials, the white blood cells of Earth, have become hostile to humanity. These kaiju-like creatures are swarming out of the oceans, and only a few heroes wearing repurposed Primordial technology can protect what remains.</p>
<p id="Snc2jl">The new game mode is called Swarm, or Operation: Anima Squad. Players can queue up solo, or play with up to three friends. This game mode plays very differently than standard <em>League of Legends</em>; it’s much closer to <em>Vampire Survivors</em> with a WASD control scheme. The player must survive a showdown in Final City, mowing down waves of Primordials. Every match gives rewards that lead to greater power over time, so even a failed match can pay off down the road and eventually help you survive longer, kill more Primordials, and earn more rewards.</p>
<p id="FSjchJ">We’re also getting a huge list of new skins: Seraphine, Yuumi, Leona, Xayah, Illaoi, Aurora, and Yasuo join Anima Squad while Briar, Rek’Sai, and Bel’Veth play the antagonistic Primordials (although Briar defects to join the good guys, making her a bit of both). This year, the summer event runs from July 17 to Aug. 19. As with past game modes, it’s possible that Swarm could return to <em>League of Legends</em> in the future — we’ll have to wait and see what Riot thinks of player reception to Operation: Anima Squad first. </p>

<p>When Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-shutting-down-four-studios-including-tango-game-works-and-arkane-austin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced four studio closures</a> in May, seeing Tango Gameworks listed as one of them was of the most surprising. Now, in <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/xbox-studios-matt-booty-podast-game-pass-fallout-studio-closures-1236038120/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an interview with Variety</a>, Xbox Games Studio head Matt Booty gave some small insight as to what happened with the Hi-Fi Rush developer and why it was shut down.</p>



<p>Though he wouldn’t go into the “nitty gritty details” of what happened out of what he called respect for those who were at the studio, he did talk the decision being a “forward-looking situation” for Microsoft.</p>



<p>“I think the thing to be considered is that, for us, it’s as much a forward-looking situation as much as it is looking back at one certain game,” Booty said. “There are a lot of things that go into [delivering] success for a game. What leadership do you have? What creative leadership do you have? Is the team the same team that shipped something successful previously? </p>



<p>“We have to look at all of those things together and then ask ourselves ‘are we set up for success going forward?'”</p>



<p>Tango Gameworks founder Shinji Mikami <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tango-gameworks-founder-shinji-mikami-to-leave/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left the studio</a> in February 2023 after the release of Hi-Fi Rush, which Booty confirmed “did well” for Microsoft. While it wasn’t explicitly mentioned, Booty did make a comment regarding having proper leadership in place was a factor in a studio’s future.</p>



<p>He also that studio changes don’t always have to mean closures, and pointed to Toys for Bob specifically as one that went independent. </p>



<p>“We recently had Toys for Bob…go back out and become a new independent studio,” he said. “We’ve announced we’ve got a publishing deal with them and we’ll share more about that when it’s important.</p>



<p>“I think back to a studio called Twisted Pixel in Texas that we acquired, then we had a change in goals and it wasn’t a perfect match anymore. That studio today is still thriving. We wanted to set them up for success, so we absolutely look at what the possible business options are.”</p>



<p>Again, though not explicitly said, the comments on Toys for Bob and Twisted Pixel could be lead one to believe that Microsoft tried to either sell or make Tango Gameworks an independent studio before the decision to close. What ultimately led to the final decision, however, is anyone’s guess. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-prince-preview-wandering-through-an-empty-house-hasnt-been-this-fascinating-since-gone-home<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">One in-game day, 50 rooms, infinite choices.</h2></div><section><p>I’m never more excited than when I’m playing games where I’m not even sure the main mechanic is fundamentally interesting. Despite hours playing Blue Prince and still thinking about it when I’m doing anything else, somehow, delightfully, I can’t figure it out. This clawing madness - trying to get a sense of whether this is all a waste of time, while happily wasting that time - is a feeling few things have been able to evoke within me.</p><p>With Blue Prince, the first release from up-until-now film studio Dogubomb, that metagaming sense of not quite having the full picture in mind perfectly mirrors the in-game activity of exploring a procedurally generated mansion in search of its answers and rarely finding any.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Blue Prince Slideshow - Tribeca Festival</h3></div></output><p>Hurrying through the grand estate of Mt. Holly to ensure the retrieval of some inheritance from a departed family member, every time you open a door you’re presented with a choice of three additional rooms. Whichever one gets picked is instantly bolted on ahead, as if it was always there. Each room is carefully authored by the development team, but the order that they’re offered up is procedurally chosen from a pool that grows in size over the course of a run. Ideally every choice is the one that’s most beneficial for that moment. Often enough, it’s actually just the least worst. </p><p>A decent handful of these rooms are complete dead-ends. Maybe they’ll contain a useful item like a key or a gem, which will need to be spent to place more complicated structures. Some of the rooms have additional doors which lead on to other rooms. If you’re lucky, you’re facing the right direction, and there aren’t any other rooms already blocking the potential exits, a hallway or such with multiple additional doors will appear and you’ll be able to create even more options for how to proceed.
</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Certain techniques for making proper progress are beginning to occur to me after more than five hours playing the surprisingly generous demo. I’m deliberately drafting dead-end rooms without much clear need to return in the same area of the map so that I don’t waste time heading back to them. Each in-game day limits your exploration to entering just 50 rooms before having to start a new run, with the ability to gain more energy earned through making good room choices. Ideally, every room is placed with all the important stuff together to limit any back-tracking, but Man Plans, God Laughs.</p><p>Some of these rooms offer unique features and challenges. Drafting the Security Room gives access to a terminal showing all the items that have been missed during exploration. A photography Dark Room will completely obscure which of the three selections you’re actually picking for your next move, unless you’ve managed to find the mansion’s breaker box and manually turned the lights back on. Placing a chapel - which demands an immediate tithe of 1 gold coin every time you walk through it - would be terrible in a busy intersection, but it’d be great to put the bedroom walkway that replenishes some of your energy in a spot you’re likely to return to often. Certain rooms only seem to appear on the edges of the 9x5 grid, of which many are expensive green rooms which regularly need multiple gems to unlock, though that cost can be mitigated by getting lucky enough to select an early room that voids the expense toward any future green rooms entirely. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Strategy in Blue Prince is, then, all about location and timing. Picking bad rooms feels great when there’s a lot of options for where to move on to next, and it’s agonizingly tense when the only three options available, on the last free door of the run, are all glorified closets.</p><p>But I couldn’t help but wonder if it even works. I don't know if continually seeing the same environments in different orders is compelling, in and of itself. Maybe it’s the limited input. I’m not against a walking sim, but I’m hesitant to play a walking sim that asks me to continue to see the same things over and over. Blue Prince occasionally injects puzzles and surprise features - the Parlor Room, which appears with a unique guessing-game each time it’s drafted - is a fun reprieve every time, but the Billiards Room, which offers different takes on the same rudimentary math problem of addition, subtraction and multiplication, gets pretty dull after the second appearance.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Something strange happened in this place and you’re forced to both know that and still be there.&nbsp;</p></div><p>I’ve been thinking about it in contrast with 2021’s Phantom Abyss, another game about revisiting the same procedurally generated environments under different contexts, where the purpose was for you to make the perfect execution of movement to avoid danger and be quicker than everyone else that came before. Blue Prince’s mystery hasn’t hooked me, though the presentation – with gorgeous cutscenes that have far greater investment than you might expect – is really noteworthy.</p><p>Blue Prince isn’t a scary game. There are sparse musical cues in key moments of discovery that help build the atmosphere, but it’s un-scary in the same way Gone Home is un-scary. Nothing’s going to jump out and chase you, but something strange happened in this place and you’re forced to both know that and still be there. </p><p>Blue Prince’s demo is currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>. I wonder if you’ll end up any clearer than me on what you think about it.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now that the highly anticipated downloadable content is available, on June 21, that number has risen to 39.6%.</p><p>While a rise of almost two percentage points doesn't seem like a lot, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-reaches-25-million-units-sold-ahead-of-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring has sold a colossal 25 million units since its release in February 2022</a>. Even if just one million of those played on Steam (the actual number is likely much higher), that would mean 18,000 players jumped back into Elden Ring to make final preparations ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>FromSoftware games like Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and now Elden Ring demand more from players than a chunk of money to access their DLC. Mohg is just one of the bosses players must beat to access Shadow of the Erdtree, though the other one is part of the main story so anyone who's completed Elden Ring will have already ticked that box.</p><p>Many would assume this to be an issue for FromSoftware and Bandai Namco, given the game itself is essentially stopping more than half its player base from accessing the DLC and therefore wanting to spend more money. But Bandai Namco Europe's chief marketing and sales officer Anthony Macare told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-bandai-namcos-most-ambitious-expansion-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GI.biz</a> that Elden Ring has sold so many copies that it basically doesn't matter.</p><p>"That statistic does present a unique challenge," he said.

You'll get all the music from the original arcade releases, behind-the-scenes art, and some helpful gameplay assists like one-button combos if you're new to these games. Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics will be out later this year for PC, PS5, PS4, and Switch, but sadly, there's no planned Xbox release.</p></div>                      </div><p>The Marvel fighting games haven't been seen for quite some time on console, although they have popped up in <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1845746235896864888%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmarvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524422%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcade1Up cabinets</a> over the past couple years. Each game is a showcase of '90s fighting game magic, as Capcom's collection of brawlers featured fast-paced action, fantastic pixel art character designs, and rock-solid gameplay designed to liberate coins from your pockets. If you're looking to go online, the games will support rollback netcode, casual matches, and ranked play. Perfect for anyone looking to reawaken some muscle memory in their thumbs.</p><p>For something a little different, The Punisher is an action game in the same vein as Final Fight and Streets of Rage, as Frank Castle plies his deadly trade against an army of cannon fodder and Marvel villains. Minus its Sega Genesis port, The Punisher has skipped several console generations, so it's nice to finally see it revived for modern systems.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Mojang Studios has <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-playstation-5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that a native PlayStation 5 version of Minecraft is releasing today and it is looking for preview testers. Those who own the PS4 version of the game will be able to access it.</p><p>In order to test this early version on PS5, users just need to go into the PS4 version of the game, click "Settings" and then click "Preview." The preview is set to roll out at around 9:30 AM PT / 12:30 PM ET. Mojang also clarified that purchasing the PS4 version is currently the only way to play the PS5 version, and the reason for creating a native PS5 version is that it would run more smoothly on its hardware.</p><p>This preview includes the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-1-21-update-officially-named-tricky-trials-adds-a-new-weapon/1100-6523003/" data-ref-id="1100-6523003">Tricky Trials update</a> as well. Here, players can either team up or go solo to venture into a maze filled with traps and treasures. Furthermore, in this preview, multiplayer is only available between PS4 and PS5 and there is no access to the Minecraft Store.</p><p>Last year, Minecraft was rated in Germany for the Xbox Series X|S, the first sign that the game would be coming to current consoles. During the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wins-court-case-against-ftc-to-buy-activision-blizzard/1100-6515704/" data-ref-id="1100-6515704">FTC trial regarding Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, Xbox blamed the lack of a native PS5 version of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-doesnt-have-a-ps5-version-because-sony-didnt-send-microsoft-dev-kits-phil-spencer-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Minecraft on Sony</a> at the time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/inefficient-or-unexplored-insights-from-a-year-long-study-on-2d-normal-map-generators<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p>Image from Death Machine by Philip Froelich, an example of a 2D-dynamically lit game using 2D-Normal maps releasing in 2024.  <span></span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the past three decades, the gaming industry has seen major advances, transitioning from predominantly 2D games utilizing traditional pixel-art graphics to a more 3D-focused industry. However, 2D was never abandoned. Instead of the AAA industry, indies have since seen major success with titles such as Cuphead and Celeste proving the potential for 2D games. One niche technology used to enhance 2D games is dynamic lighting, which adds depth and realism to 2D visuals by simulating various light interactions as seen most recently in Sabotage Games’ Sea of Stars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite its potential, there are several major challenges involved with the implementation of 2D dynamic lighting. While there are sophisticated methods that involve 3D graphics, the traditional method utilizes 2D-Normal maps, which simulate depth and texture by encoding surface normals. While the AAA gaming industry has established and well-proven workflows for generating normal maps in 3D, similar tools for 2D game development remain underutilized. This led to my year-long research project, culminating in a thesis titled “Setting Standards for 2D-Normal Map Generators.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Understanding Normal Maps in 2D Game Development">Understanding Normal Maps in 2D Game Development</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unlike 3D models, which inherently possess depth information, 2D art relies on normal maps to create the illusion of three-dimensionality vital for dynamic lighting. However, the process of creating 2D normal maps is labor-intensive, typically forcing artists to manually draw them for each asset. This manual process adds not just development time but also significant cost, making dynamic lighting an overly expensive feature for the smaller studios often involved with 2D.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Quest for Automation">The Quest for Automation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To address these challenges, several tools have been developed to automate the generation of these 2D normal maps. Software such as Sprite Lamp, SpriteDLight, and Laighter have attempted to streamline this process, but they have yet to gain major industry adoption. Many of these tools operate as black boxes, with proprietary algorithms and limited customization options, making it more challenging to integrate into a development workflow. Thus, I set out to research my own set of standards, to figure out what it takes to create a more attractive 2D-Normal map generation tool.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Research Methodology: Q-Sort and Expert Interviews">Research Methodology: Q-Sort and Expert Interviews</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My research focused on two questions. Firstly, what makes a good normal map and how can we rate the output of tools? Additionally, I wanted to find out what features or qualities artists value most when utilizing such tools. My research employed a combination of an exploratory Q-Sort methodology and expert interviews. The Q-Sort methodology helped assess the needs and preferences of artists working with 2D-normal maps. Participants were asked to rank various features and aspects of normal map generators, providing a structured way to identify the most critical requirements. This was complemented by interviews with experienced 2D-Normal map artists and developers to gain deeper insights into the technical and practical aspects of normal map generation.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Key Findings and Guidelines">Key Findings and Guidelines</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The research revealed several key insights for the development of current and future 2D-normal map generators:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quality of output: Artists prioritize high-quality normal map generation that closely mimics hand-drawn maps. Tools should focus on improving the accuracy of automatically generated maps. Notable also is that the speed of the workflow was significantly less valued here, the artists involved made it clear that they don’t mind the output needing modification and/or minor fixes. As long as the bulk of the work is saved.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Trial and Error Workflow: An effective tool should support an iterative workflow, allowing artists to easily tweak and refine normal maps. This includes features for real-time preview and adjustment. Additionally, artists tend to like tools that resemble their own, so any great normal map generator should include staples such as a color picker, animation, and Undo/Redo features.&nbsp;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Objective Evaluation Metrics: The most disappointing conclusion was that there are currently no standardized metrics for evaluating the quality of 2D-normal maps. This means developers will have to work closely with actual 2D-normal mapping artists when evaluating the quality of their tools.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Integration with Existing Tools: Seamless integration with popular 2D art software and game engines is crucial. Often artists seemed far more interested in utilizing such technology within their established tools such as Aseprite rather than in a separate tool.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Public Learning Resources: The availability of comprehensive documentation and tutorials can help increase the accessibility of the field. The field is currently quite thin, and the hope is that an increase in public learning resources will generate more interest in young indie artists to learn these skills.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The generation of 2D-normal maps holds great potential, especially within the 2D-Indie scene. Great artists are already working on beautiful games such as @Philtacular and his upcoming Death Machine. By further streamlining the generation tools we should be able to make dynamic lighting in 2D games far more accessible and cost-effective to indie developers. I believe that it’s important that as a tiny community, we do all we can to spread the knowledge needed to pave the way for more innovative tools and techniques ultimately resulting in even more beautiful 2D games. I hope this research can be a great resource for tools developers interested in 2D-Normal maps and for researchers interested in continued exploration of this niche, but wonderful field.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My full thesis “Setting Standards for 2D-Normal Map Generators” will soon be available through the Breda University of Applied Sciences for those interested in delving deeper into my process and methodology. &nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="295" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Niantic has announced that the next set of Elite Raids will feature Mega Rayquaza, giving <em>Pokemon GO</em> players a chance to catch the legendary Pokemon. Rayquaza is a dragon and flying-type Pokemon. The Pokemon will be arriving as a Raid Boss on June 29 during different intervals on June 29, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="51" data-current-count="51" data-injectable="false">Here is the schedule for Mega Rayquaza Elite Raids:</p> <p data-characters="13" data-current-count="64" data-injectable="false"><strong>June 29, 2024</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="224" data-injectable="false"> <li>12 p.m. PT</li> <li>1 p.m. PT</li> <li>5 p.m. PT</li> <li>6 p.m. PT</li> </ul> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">There will also be a free Timed Research to take part in during this event, and completing the research tasks would allow players to earn a Meteorite. This is a rare item in <em>Pokemon GO</em> and is necessary to teach the Charged Attack Dragon Ascent to Rayquaza. Teaching this move is also a requirement to Mega Evolve this particular Pokemon.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-defeat-mega-rayquaza" data-injectable="false">How to defeat Mega Rayquaza?</h2> <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true">The legendary Rayquaza is weakest against Ice attacks. It is also vulnerable to Dragon, Fairy, and Rock moves. Rayquaza is strong against Fighting, Fire, Bug, Water, Grass, and Ground moves. Since its strengths outweigh its weaknesses, there are selective Pokemon who are equipped to deal with Rayquaza during a battle. Entering this battle with a Pokemon who knows Ice attacks are a must, and their secondary attack has to be a Dragon, Fairy, or Rock attack.</p>
 <p data-characters="13" data-current-count="13" data-injectable="false"><strong>Best counters</strong></p> <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">Mamoswine (its shadow variant will be a better choice), Mega Gardevoir, Shadow Mewtwo, Cetitan, and Mega Glalie are some of your best choices. Mamoswine is a relatively common Pokemon among these choices, and if you do not have others, you can also go with Glaceon, the ice-type evolution of Eevee. Keep in mind that this is not an easy raid to complete on your own, and it is best to enter this fight with at least two more trainers who are well-equipped for this encounter.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-are-elite-raids" data-injectable="false">What are Elite Raids?</h2> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">Elite Raids in <em>Pokemon GO</em> refers to special raid battles that arrive only for 45 minutes once a special Raid Egg hatches. Also, players can only engage in a raid battle by physically visiting a nearby gym, meaning that neither you nor your friends can join an Elite Raid battle using a Remote Raid Pass. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/level-zero-extraction-release-date-brings-alien-extraction-shooting-fun-in-august.907911/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/level-zero-extraction-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher tinyBuild and developer Doghowl Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>release date, and the alien-blasting extraction shooter is launching later this summer.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1456940/view/6339459950921613987" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC via Early Access on August 6th, and if Doghowl and tinyBuild are to be believed, a great many potential players will be happy to see it arrive.</p>
<p>In that same Steam post, the two studios share some stats regarding the game's recent open beta, which ran from June 9th to June 17th and coincided with Steam Next Fest, and it turns out that thousands of players checked this one out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/level-zero-extraction-release-date-alien.jpg?itok=rf3UksPp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/level-zero-extraction-release-date-alien.jpg?itok=rdm4BfZv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>brings more extraction shooter shenanigans (what else?) to Steam in August.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Doghowl and tinyBuild's stats,&nbsp;<em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>was one of the Next Fest's most-played demos, alongside titles like&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</em>.</p>
<p>The studios also say the game attracted almost 5,000 concurrent players during the open beta period, making it the second most popular demo on offer.</p>
<p><em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>attracted more than 300,000 players during the demo window, and it now has over 350,000 wishlists according to Doghowl and tinyBuild, so people are certainly interested in this project at the very least.</p>
<p>Around 2.36 million matches were played during the open beta, and the game's most popular firearm by far was the Nailgun, which racked up almost 400,000 kills, almost ten times as many as the next most popular option (the G-17).</p>

<p><em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>is, believe it or not, an extraction shooter with an emphasis on horror. It's explicitly being pitched by the devs as a game for those who enjoy the likes of&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>(although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-pve-eod-free">perhaps not so much anymore</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gray-zone-warfare-tarkov-players"><em>Gray Zone Warfare</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/content-warning-sales-two-million"><i>Content Warning</i></a>.</p>
<p>The game's asymmetric multiplayer pits "elite PMC mercenar[ies]" against alien horrors controlled by players, with teams of mercenaries facing off against aliens, each other, and the environment while gathering valuable loot.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Level Zero: Extraction&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1456940/Level_Zero_Extraction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on August 6th.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-dlss-future-versions-may-use-ai-to-generate-textures-objects-and-characters.907905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-generate-textures-objects/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Future versions of NVIDIA DLSS could use AI to generate textures and objects, among other things, potentially introducing another big game changer that could greatly impact the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://morethanmoore.substack.com/p/q-and-a-with-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore Than Moore</a>, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang provided some hints regarding what future versions of NVIDIA DLSS may feature. As of now, AI is being used for neural graphics, generating pixels based off a few input pixels (Super Resolution) and to generate frames (Frame Generation), but in the future, it will be possible to even generate textures and objects and the objects can even be of lower quality and can be made to look better with AI. Additionally, it will be possible to even generate characters in games, having, for example, among a group of six characters, two real ones, and others may be long-term use AIs. Ultimately, AI will become more dominant in the future, and NVIDIA cannot wait to let more people have it.</p>
<p><em>The games will be made with AI, they’ll have AI inside, and you’ll even have the PC become AI using G-Assist. You can use the PC as an AI assistant to help you game. &nbsp;GeForce is the biggest gaming brand in the world, we only see it growing, and a lot of them have AI in some capacity. We can’t wait to let more people have it.</em></p>

<p>While the NVIDIA CEO did not specify if any of these features will be among those offered by NVIDIA DLSS 4, it will be very interesting to see what the new version of the technology will offer in addition to the aforementioned Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction introduced in major previous versions. With a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-cut-down-gb202-gpu-448-bit-bus-28-gb-gddr7-memory/">GPU generation</a> launching later this year, it may not take much longer to learn what is next for NVIDIA's technology and how AI will continue influencing and possibly shaping gaming in the future.</p>

<p id="Ij99Vl">In addition to its broad spectrum of compatibility, the 8Bitdo Pro 2 is now one of the few Bluetooth controllers equipped with Hall Effect switches, which help to reduce or eliminate <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/23627127/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-gulikit-stick-hall-effect-fix-installation-buy">stick drift</a> (an issue that has plagued the Nintendo Switch since its launch).</p>
<p id="4VM1W8">For those of us old enough to remember, the layout of the 8Bitdo Pro 2 most closely resembles a classic SNES controller, albeit with a pair of analog sticks and some large grips built onto the side for improved ergonomics. The Pro 2 features the same number of inputs as contemporary controllers, which can all be remapped to different profiles via the 8Bitdo Ultimate app on your PC or mobile device.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24183043/dune-awakening-direct-story-gameplay-june-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="f5B2Zo">It’s not easy to adapt a fictional property — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Online">The Lord of the Rings</a>, say, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Universe_Online">DC Universe</a> —into a massively multiplayer online game, or any kind of living game. Many have failed. The demands of a set canon are seldom compatible with an evolving online world, or a universe in which thousands of players are living their own hero’s journeys.</p>
<p id="deXATv">Funcom knows this: The Norwegian developer has been making MMOs since 2001’s <em>Anarchy Online</em>, including a licensed effort, <em>Age of Conan</em>. So, for survival MMO <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24090204/dune-awakening-survival-game-2024"><em>Dune: Awakening</em></a>, Funcom, Frank Herbert’s estate, and Legendary (producers of the Dune movies) decided to do something very smart: change the Dune timeline and establish its own alternate history of Arrakis.</p>
<p id="VnHj0I">As teased in the game’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24167968/dune-awakening-story-trailer-summer-game-fest">Summer Game Fest trailer</a> and detailed in a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBRo-cotgkQ">half-hour deep dive video</a>, in <em>Dune: Awakening</em>’s setting, Paul Atreides was never born. His mother, Lady Jessica, chose to have a daughter instead of a son, tying her more closely to the Bene Gesserit; Jessica is trained as a truthsayer and foretells Doctor Yueh’s betrayal, so her husband, Duke Leto, survives and House Atreides isn’t wiped out in the attack on Arrakeen.</p>
<p id="2bRniw">With Paul out of the picture, there’s a power vacuum, and more narrative room for players to feel like the heroes of their own stories. And House Atreides and House Harkonnen are evenly matched in a war for the future of Arrakis — a convenient setup for the factional gameplay that MMOs thrive on. But the essential political motivations of all the characters and players remain the same as in Frank Herbert’s original vision.</p>
<p id="Wjb9hr">The Fremen are the final piece of this puzzle, and Funcom has chosen to put them at the center of a narrative mystery. The desert inhabitants of Arrakis have disappeared — supposedly wiped out, according to Imperium propaganda. What happened to them? Where did they go? Players are sent in search of the missing people, exploring their abandoned dwellings, rites, culture, and spirituality as they go. (I’d say the chances of the Fremen being added as a playable faction later on, perhaps in an expansion, seem pretty high.)</p>
<p id="MHUjZm">In terms of gameplay, the video is a little lighter on detail, but there are some interesting tidbits. A look at the character creator reveals that a choice of mentor determines your character’s starting ability: Choose a Mentat mentor and you’ll be able to scan enemies and objects for information; a Bene Gesserit mentor will teach you to use the Voice to compel characters to approach you (effectively a taunt); a Swordmaster background grants you a defensive stance. But you’ll be able to combine abilities from the different schools later in the game.</p>
<p id="MHDYo0">In a section of the video focused on the game’s closed beta and its online structure, creative director Joel Bylos said that <em>Dune: Awakening</em>’s endgame lies in an area called the Deep Desert. There, hundreds of concurrent players will engage in player-versus-player combat, harvest spice in big groups, and engage with an endgame political system.</p>
<p id="Lpygrz">Bylos also explained what makes the game an MMO. As opposed to a single-server, single-map game like <em>Ark: Survival Evolved, Dune: Awakening</em> will group multiple maps and servers together into “worlds” of thousands of players who can organize themselves into guilds. The starting area, Hagga Basin, supports a minimum of 40 players per server, but beyond that there are social hubs and the Deep Desert, where Bylos promised “many, many hundreds” of players will be able to play together. The Overland map is its own live server that links these locations, with players using Ornithopters and other transportation to move around it in real time.</p>
<p id="p2iIPD"><em>Dune: Awakening </em>has no announced release date, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. Funcom says it will show live gameplay at Gamescom, which runs from Aug. 21-25. </p>

  <p id="vNmqYa">Science fiction, to echo Ursula K. Le Guin, is not predictive, but descriptive. While most science fiction films attempt (and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22435082/zpg-1972-sci-fi-predictions-future-that-were-wrong">fail</a>) to extrapolate the ideas and concerns of their respective present to predict what the world may look like in the not-so-distant future, these extrapolations ultimately amount to stories that exist in conversation with the hopes and fears of the times in which they were conceived.</p>
<p id="R28g4x">All of this is to say that science fiction (i.e., speculative fiction) is a genre of possibilities and introspection, one whose long legacy through the medium of cinema has produced countless iconic works whose thematic depth and aesthetic resonance have enlivened and inspired the imaginations of countless more generations. From Fritz Lang’s <em>Metropolis</em> and Andrei Tarkovsky’s <em>Solaris</em> to Andrew Niccol’s <em>Gattaca</em> and more, the history and legacy of science fiction in film is one of futures past that have since gone on to shape and inform our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/21515948/what-science-fiction-means-today">view of the present</a>, all while entertaining and edifying audiences new and old alike.</p>
<p id="R4Srtd">We’ve created a list of some of our favorite sci-fi films currently available on streaming, movies that continue to inspire us look to the future and imagine worlds and ideas both fantastical yet nonetheless inextricably rooted in our reality. Here are the best sci-fi movies available to stream on Netflix, Hulu, Max, and more.</p>

<p id="3AGpLj"><strong>Director: </strong>Denis Villeneuve<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> <a href="https://play.max.com/movie/e7dc7b3a-a494-4ef1-8107-f4308aa6bbf7">Max</a></p>
<p id="uG7iaM">In 2021, Denis Villeneuve managed to achieve something <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22738264/dune-david-lynch-explained-galaxy-brains-podcast">not even the great David Lynch could</a>: successfully taking Frank Herbert’s notoriously idiosyncratic sci-fi epic <em>Dune</em> and transform it into a bona fide cultural phenomenon. Over the course of two films (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23712612/dune-how-many-parts-movies-sequels-messiah">so far</a>), Villeneuve takes the feudal politics, surreal world-building, and cerebral exploration of religion inherent to Herbert’s book and renders them in a way that feels not only legible, but electrifying.</p>
<p id="5kEqGt">The two-part epic follows the story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), the heir to a powerful noble family in the far future, who is taken in by the Fremen people of the desert planet Arrakis after his family’s longtime adversaries succeed in killing his father and defeating his armies. Eager for revenge, and blessed with supernatural cognitive abilities and intuition, Paul must win the loyalty of the Fremen in his bid to avenge his father, all the while knowing that such a path will set in motion a galaxy-spanning war of unimaginable bloodshed and horror.</p>
<p id="punm56"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/21358695/what-is-dune-about-plot-explained"><em>Dune</em> is many things</a>: a tragic love story, a treatise on the perils of putting faith in charismatic leaders, a biting critique of vampiristic imperialism and the subjugation of native populations. That <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22733349/dune-review-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet"><em>Dune: Part One</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24078649/dune-2-review-release-date-cast-zendaya-denis-villeneuve-part-two"><em>Dune: Part Two</em></a><em> </em>manage to be all these things, while also remaining a deeply entertaining story on their own, is a testament not only to the strength of the source material but to the clarity of Villeneuve and company’s vision in bringing it to life on screen. Here’s hoping that he can pull off a hat trick with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24085138/dune-2-messiah-sequel-underrated-classic-good-book"><em>Dune: Messiah</em></a>, the forthcoming third and final installment in the director’s trilogy. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="xhqvdU">Sometimes animation starts to look quaint or dated as styles and technologies change, but Katsuhiro Otomo’s landmark anime movie <em>Akira</em> still looks as startling on the screen today as it did back in 1988. Its ultimate intent, drawn from Otomo’s much longer and more in-depth manga series, can be hard to follow, depending on which translation you get — its point about human evolution is slightly fuzzy, and its impulsive, dim juvenile-delinquent protagonist isn’t up to seeing any of the scope or depth in what’s going on, let alone explaining it to the audience.</p>
<p id="fuB9tk">But the action is impeccably executed, and the emotions behind it are acute and powerful. When a bike gang in the far-future, post-apocalyptic setting of, er, 2019 Neo-Tokyo encounters a mysterious child with strange powers, one gang member gets abducted by the government, and another tries to hunt him down. Their history together and their shifting personal dynamic helps inform a sometimes gritty, sometimes hallucinogenic story about secret experiments in human potential, carried out as political unrest tears the city apart. The visuals are incredibly rich and vivid, and the tension runs high throughout the film, at all levels of its stratified society. <em>Akira</em> has been imitated for decades because there just wasn’t anything else like it in 1988. For the most part, there still isn’t. —<em>Tasha Robinson</em></p>

<p id="82jEV2"><strong>Director: </strong>Ridley Scott<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm, John Hurt<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD%2frLJHOac&amp;offerid=852731.1205&amp;bids=852731.1205&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hulu</a></p>
<p id="aaXLWW">In 1979, Ridley Scott changed the face of science fiction cinema forever. Then, three years later, he went and did it again. I’m not talking about <em>Blade Runner</em> (at least, not today), but rather the sci-fi horror classic that went on to spawn a legacy of sequels, prequels, and imitators much like a horde of hapless face-hugger-gripped humans incubating a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23593379/best-sci-fi-alien-xenomorph-ridley-scott">brood of acid-spewing nightmares</a>.</p>
<p id="TGCHHn">I don’t need to tell you what happens in <em>Alien</em>. After all, if you’re either a regular Polygon reader or someone even faintly familiar with science fiction horror, you know what the gist is. It’s the film that catapulted Sigourney Weaver to stardom, the movie that nearly every sci-fi horror game set in outer space lives in the shadow of, and an unambiguous masterpiece of world-building and creature design that is arguably yet to be eclipsed.</p>
<p id="5fdzIJ">If you somehow have never seen <em>Alien</em> before, you owe it to yourself to watch it at least once. And if you have seen it before, I have some good news for you: It’s just as good as your remember it was. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="SImeFl">Gareth Edwards’ long-awaited follow-up to <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em> was one of the most anticipated genre films of 2023. The logline of the story’s premise alone was enough to pique interest: An original sci-fi action adventure <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23892318/the-creator-movie-netflix-inspirations-movies-like-it">inspired by films like <em>Apocalypse Now</em> and <em>Baraka</em></a> about a special forces agent fighting in a war against artificially intelligent robots. </p>
<p id="HPOlKL">While the film didn’t quite manage to amass the audience 20th Century Studios would’ve like back when it released last September, I strongly believe the legacy of <em>The Creator</em> will endure in the years to come on the quality of its strongest aspect: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23892583/the-creator-production-designer-interview-nomad-pink-floyd">The art direction and worldbuilding</a> of its universe.</p>
<p id="PdYPLN">The futuristic world of <em>The Creator</em>’s vision of 2065 calls to mind the scrupulous iconic design of <em>Blade Runner</em>’s dystopian Los Angeles. It’s a world that feels fully lived-in, with human beings existing alongside a race of insectile-like androids; a world where towering angular megastructures loom opposite rolling hills of unspoiled pastoral landscape. </p>
<p id="scz5jK">There’s a lot of cool, speculative tech on display, from portable brain scanners that can neurologically revive people on the verge of death in android host bodies to floating fortresses that rain death from above via gigantic holographic crosshairs. Say what you might about the plot, but <em>The Creator</em> is unimpeachably one of the best looking sci-fi movies in recent memory, and well worth watching for that fact alone. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="uKKFHE"><strong>Director: </strong>Alex Proyas<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Rufus Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Available to stream on <a href="https://tubitv.com/movies/100017001/dark-city">Tubi</a> with ads</p>
<p id="ULQVQY">Alex Proyas’ neo-noir reality-bending movie <em>Dark City</em> came out just a year before <em>The Matrix</em>, and while they were both made in a vacuum, both sets of creators pick at similar themes (and <em>The Matrix </em>even reused some of <em>Dark City</em>’s sets, tying them even closer together). In any case, it’s a dope film.</p>
<p id="xQUljE">Set in a strange, inscrutable city seemingly cast under a veil of perpetual night, the film stars Rufus Sewell as John Murdoch, an amnesiac who mysteriously wakes up in bathtub and finds himself accused of the murder of a young woman. Evading capture, Murdoch wanders through the streets of this metropolis in search of answers to who he was and what happened, all the while stalked by mysterious trench coat-wearing figures who harbor the truth of the city’s true nature and function. </p>
<p id="nVq9uM">With supporting performances by William Hurt as Inspector Bumstead; Jennifer Connelly as Murdoch’s wife, Emma; Richard O’Brien as the sinister Mr. Hand; and an incredibly out-of-character performance by Kiefer Sutherland as a nebbish scientist named Daniel Schreber, <em>Dark City</em> may not be the same cultural juggernaut as the Wachowskis’ Matrix franchise, but it certainly stands as one of the most visually memorable and adventurous sci-fi movies of the late ’90s. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="cx2ZcF"><strong>Director: </strong>Val Guest<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Janet Munro, Leo McKern, Edward Judd<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> <a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/the-day-the-earth-caught-fire">Criterion Channel</a>, <a href="https://www.kanopy.com/en/product/11174734">Kanopy</a></p>
<p id="QsVA8Q">This haunting, prescient disaster movie from 1961 imagines that the Earth has been knocked out of its orbit by simultaneous nuclear bomb tests conducted by both the U.S. and the Soviet Union. As the world tilts off its axis and starts to spiral toward the sun, the poles change and the temperature rises, driving the inhabitants of postwar London into a delirious, sweaty fever. We see all this through the eyes of the journalists of the Daily Express newspaper as they cover the story and report on one last desperate attempt to save the planet.</p>
<p id="R7nApU">Although this British film directed by Hammer veteran Val Guest has a small scope and low budget, it manages to encapsulate the terrifying enormity of the situation through desolate, matte backgrounds; a burnt sepia tint on its crisp, widescreen monochrome photography; and telling details like melting road surfaces, mist rolling off an evaporating River Thames, and the bulky radiator strapped to the roof of every car. To keep the story moving, there’s a sweet romance between leads Edward Judd and Janet Munro, and a businesslike journalistic procedural led by the great Leo McKern as the paper’s science editor. (The film shot at the real Daily Express offices and featured the paper’s real editor, playing himself.)</p>
<p id="FdxrzH">The terrific script, by Guest and playwright Wolf Mankowitz, is spicy, impassioned, and precise in its doomsaying. Looking for a different angle on the then-gathering storm of nuclear apocalypse, Guest and Mankowitz hit upon a prophetic vision of global heating that would end up resonating long beyond the end of the Cold War. <em>The Day the Earth Caught Fire</em>’s<em> </em>bleak but open ending, more effective than any triumph or defeat could be, is even more relevant and chilling now than it was 60 years ago. —<em>Oli Welsh</em></p>

<p id="Cn7kW8"><em>Fantastic Planet</em> is one of those films that’s nearly impossible to describe, in part because no explanation can quite convey just how bizarre it is. It’s set on the fictional planet of Ygam, where gigantic blue humanoids (“Draags”) and humans (“Oms”) coexist. Humans are not the protagonists of this society, however. Their existence on Ygam is more akin to that of an insect: wild creatures who are mostly regarded as nuisances, and occasionally enslaved as pets. Their population is controlled through periodic genocide.</p>
<p id="EBR3DM">The film is based on the 1957 novel <em>Oms en série </em>by dental-surgeon-turned-author Stefan Wul, whose reputation for subverting the classic science fiction tropes of the era earned him cult status within the genre. The allegorical aspects of the story are arresting enough on their own, but the big-screen adaptation, coupled with its surrealist paper cutout animation style and psychedelic jazzy soundtrack, is basically a 70-minute-long acid trip. If you’re into that sort of thing, then <em>Fantastic Planet</em> is an absolute must-watch. And if you’re not, well, it’s still a great movie to play in the background at parties. —<em>Tara Long</em></p>

<p id="RdpbGU">Before launching <em>Snowpiercer</em> or setting <em>Okja</em> free, Oscar winner Bong Joon-ho unleashed The Host, a biting creature feature that draws as much from Steven Spielberg’s preoccupation with fatherhood as from American military intervention in South Korea. The tight-knit Park family — including stoic patriarch Hee-bong (Byun Hee-bong), his shiftless son Gang-du (regular Bong collaborator Song Kang-ho), and enterprising granddaughter Hyun-seo (Go Ah-sung) — find themselves at the center of a monster attack and a government conspiracy. </p>
<p id="mUJe9L">What starts off as a thrilling Godzilla riff, complete with an all-timer of a monster reveal, quickly morphs into what would become Bong’s signature style: a sly satire that’s surprisingly heartfelt. The familiar anger at the sight of incompetent military officials is quickly followed by shocked laughter at the Parks’ overwrought mourning, and later, more than a bit of sympathy for the beast. (OK, maybe that’s just me.) Bong’s nimble filmmaking — combining classic keep-away technique with the boldness of a rising talent — sets a new standard for not just monster films, but, more broadly, for sci-fi storytelling. —<em>Danette Chavez</em></p>

<p id="ghuRWs"><strong>Director: </strong>Fritz Lang<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Alfred Abel, Brigitte Helm, Gustav Fröhlich<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> <a href="https://tubitv.com/movies/666318/metropolis">Tubi</a>, <a href="https://pluto.tv/us/on-demand/movies/602ebf9130c7ec0013a283fc">Pluto TV</a></p>
<p id="bg0NAf">Fritz Lang’s 1927 silent masterpiece is one of the finest examples of German Expressionism and of science fiction storytelling on film. One of the first feature-length sci-fi movies ever made, <em>Metropolis </em>was a huge undertaking that took multiple years and the modern equivalent of about $24 million to make.</p>
<p id="PIw54e">Set in a dystopian future, <em>Metropolis </em>depicts a class struggle that unfolds around star-crossed lovers on opposite sides of the conflict. At about 150 minutes, it’s one of the longer silent movies from the era, but interested viewers will be rewarded with one of the most influential science fiction movies ever made and some of the most stark architecture and set design ever put on film. It’s a monumental achievement in practical filmmaking that still astonishes to this day, while doubling as a political message for social change. As the film’s closing intertitle says, “The Mediator Between the Head and the Hands Must Be the Heart.” —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="jC2BFx"><strong>Directors: </strong>Zeek Earl, Chris Caldwell<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Pedro Pascal, Sophie Thatcher, Jay Duplass<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Peacock, <a href="https://tubitv.com/movies/100014012/prospect">Tubi</a></p>
<p id="IUFkcE"><em>Prospect</em> is the sort of low-budget sci-fi film that punches way above its weight, with an attention to detail and earnest performances that so many blockbuster films lack. The film is about desperate lunar prospectors seeking out precious gems on an alien moon (shot on location in a lushly surreal Pacific Northwest). Pedro Pascal’s performance as a mercenary is a highlight, full of roguish charm and intimidating charisma that makes him instantly captivating whenever he’s on screen.</p>
<p id="qdz0Hu">The practical effects also do an extraordinary job of making this small-scale story feel like part of a much larger universe. For example, the gems sought by every major character in the film must be carefully harvested from fleshy spore pods. This requires an exacting process involving multiple chemical agents and precise timing, lest you spoil the treasure and make it worthless. Not only does this ratchet up the tension in many scenes, it says everything about the setting without saying a word; you quickly see just how hard these characters have to work just for a single little gem. It’s what <em>Prospect</em> is ultimately all about: what it takes to survive out here on the ragged edge. —<em>Clayton Ashley</em></p>

<p id="rZgvWz">What begins as an investigation into a space station’s severed communication lines becomes a contemplative deep dive into a mind untethered by grief. Although <em>Solaris </em>may be the most approachable of Andrei Tarkovsky’s movies — the Russian director’s portfolio ran the gamut from dazzling to confounding — it’s still one of the denser science fiction epics, acting as a sort of cousin to <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>. Both movies are obsessed with mining the inexplicable aspects of the cosmos. They also both place bewildered protagonists in situations too vast and complicated to ever understand. But while Kubrick’s adventure into the stars becomes colder and more removed as its run time progresses, <em>Solaris </em>is dead set on celebrating the humanity of its lost explorers, trapped in the orbit of a planet that knows their every regret. —<em>Mike Mahardy</em></p>

<p id="qA1G9N">This Korean space drama is a gorgeous sci-fi blockbuster with a little something for everyone. Jaw-dropping battle sequences in space! A lovable robot who wants to look human! A tough guy who becomes super protective of a vulnerable crewmate! Trenchant commentary on capitalism and how billionaires respond to the climate crisis! Seriously, <em>Space Sweepers </em>has it all.</p>
<p id="BzJ9eV">A crew of lovable scamps comes across a weapon of mass destruction ... that is also a robot child. Their desire for money and their fondness for said robot child clash as they grow into a real family unit together. Made for a fraction of the cost of its Hollywood counterparts, <em>Space Sweepers </em>looks better than most recent American sci-fi blockbusters and is carried by a core group of characters (and actors) that make you want to stay along for the ride well past its 136-minute running time. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="dhvMs8">I’m not going to say too much about <em>Timecrimes</em>; this Spanish time-travel chiller from 2007 is really best experienced if you know nothing past its first 10 minutes. A well-to-do, if slightly hangdog, middle-aged suburbanite called Héctor (Karra Elejalde) observes, through binoculars, a young woman take off her clothes and apparently collapse in the woods behind his home. Going to investigate, he is surprised and stabbed in the arm by a mysterious stranger with a bloody, bandaged head. So begins one of the most ingeniously plotted time-travel films of all time, and one of the few pieces of time-travel fiction I’ve ever encountered to successfully close its paradoxical loop — never mind do it so elegantly, and with such a wonderfully tart twist of Hitchcockian bitterness. —<em>OW</em></p>

Arrowhead Games acknowledged the problem via Discord, and the community is <em>not</em> happy about that.</p> <p data-characters="644" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true">Notably, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dk6sge/to_all_helldivers_please_avoid_using_faf14spear/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowhead Games community manager confirmed</a> they’re investigating the Spear as it seems to cause crashes for entire fireteams in combat. It’s good Arrowhead is looking into it, of course, but the issue the community has now is how it’s communicated. The<em> </em>bug isn’t prominently highlighted elsewhere. Those who simply aren’t in the loop with the recent goings-on in <em>Helldivers 2</em> might’ve heard that the Spear was recently buffed, for example, and if they’re not in the game’s official Discord, they’re going to crash the game for their whole squad without knowing why. Not great.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure>  <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="true">This isn’t the first time that the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community has asked for Arrowhead to communicate via something less transient than Discord, of course. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cktxtb/the_helldivers_official_discord_is_an_unmitigated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Time</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1asx1u0/the_helldivers_discord_server_is_an_absolutely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1co1v7z/arrowhead_devs_i_know_its_crazy_out_there_but_why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">again</a>, Arrowhead Games’ staff discussed ongoing problems, concerns, and/or simply engaged in dialogue with the players themselves to share helpful information only for it to stay on Discord because it wasn’t shared anywhere else.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">It’s not perfectly clear, of course, what the best alternative to Discord might be, but many players have proposed using the game itself as a news platform of sorts, either by adding a dedicated console to the Super Destroyer that players could use to get up-to-speed, or by repurposing the integrated news system to announce bugs, updates, and other such items.</p>
 <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">It would be easier still, of course, to simply rely more on other social media, Steam, and the PlayStation Network to announce news and get more players informed of what’s going on in the background. Whatever options Arrowhead ends up settling on, the community’s requests are clear: Discord shouldn’t be the sole source of <em>Helldivers 2</em> news at this point.</p> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="846" data-injectable="false">Now, it’s worth remembering that Arrowhead has been – slowly but certainly – making <em>Helldivers 2</em> way less obfuscating over time. For example, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/next-helldivers-2-patch-adds-visible-supply-lines-reworked-spawn-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest major update</a> straight-up displayed the planetary supply lines that have been in place from day one, but weren’t actually visible outside of the game’s API. This shows a willingness to improve, but Arrowhead clearly still has some ways to go before the community is happy with its efforts. </p>

<p data-characters="308" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>The Boys </em>Season 4 has soared in terms of viewership on Prime Video, with a 21% viewership increase as compared to Season 3, per Amazon (via <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-boys-season-4-premiere-viewership-prime-video/">TheWrap</a>). Amazon has also stated that <em>The Boys</em> Season 4 is now the second most-viewed Prime Video season within four days of its premiere, only behind <em>Reacher</em> Season 2.</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">Moreover, <em>The Boys</em> Season 4 is currently the top show on Prime Video in 160 countries, with 60% of the audience from regions outside the US. It has also been revealed that Brazil, UK, and India are the regions where <em>The Boys</em> is performing really well.</p> <figure data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="The Boys – Season 4 Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EzFXDvC-EwM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">Interestingly, the viewership record has arrived after the vitriol this season has received so far on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_boys_2019/s04">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. <em>The Boys</em> Season 4 has the lowest audience score of its season so far on the platform, as highlighted by <a href="https://screenrant.com/the-boys-season-4-audience-viewership-record/">Screen Rant</a>. This season has a 50% audience score with an aggregate 2.9 rating out of 5, at the time of writing. However, <em>The Boys</em> Season 4 carries a solid 95% score from critics on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>
 <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="211" data-injectable="false">While there are several negative reviews from users who feel that the show is not living up to its standards, other negative reviews are review-bombs that stem from allegations that the show has gone “woke”.</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">Eric Kripke, the creator of the show, responded to this, in an interview with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-boys-showrunner-erik-kripke-interview-trumpism-1235914642/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, by saying: “Go watch something else”. There are now negative reviews on Rotten Tomatoes that actually refer to Kripke’s comments as well, highlighting that the statement did not sit well with some fans.</p>
 <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="163" data-injectable="false">One of the users who gave <em>The Boys</em> Season 4 half-a-star in their review wrote, “The creator of the show wanted people to go watch something else, I will obey.”</p> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">Regardless of the review-bombing, the viewership records tell a different story. <em>The Boys</em> is officially set to receive another season which will <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/the-boys-season-5-final-season-1236033418/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be the final chapter</a> of this dark take on the superhero genre.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-native-ps5-version-of-minecraft.907860/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-native-ps5-version-of-minecraft/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-you-need-to-know-about-the-native-ps5-version-of-minecraft<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="268" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of the things that makes <em>Minecraft</em> so popular and accessible is its many ports to multiple systems. It even made its way to ChromeOS and Apple TV. However, for some reason, there’s never been a native version of the game on PlayStation 5. Until now, that is.</p> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">As of yesterday, Mojang Studios has made its gaming behemoth <em>Minecraft</em> available on the console, although it is just a preview for now. In a recent post on the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-playstation-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>, the developer invites people to check out the PS5 version, which you can access if you have it for PS4 by “navigating to ‘Settings’ and then ‘Preview’ within the game.”</p> <figure data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="226" data-injectable="false">Quite why it’s taken this long to roll out a current-gen version of it on the Sony system is not clear, but it’s here now, and you can enjoy all the same benefits as the Xbox Series port. Well, almost all the benefits.</p> <h2 id="h-what-you-can-and-can-t-do-in-the-ps5-version-of-minecraft" data-injectable="false">What you can and can’t do in the PS5 version of Minecraft</h2> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true">Even though it’s just a preview so far, you’ll still get access to <em>Minecraft</em> in its entirety. However, there are some things you won’t have until the final release. For example, Mojang says while there is multiplayer in the PS5 version, there’s no cross-play, except with the PS4. Also, for obvious reasons, you can’t play this port on previous-gen hardware.</p>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">However, you can cross-play if you use Realms – the subscription-based servers for <em>Minecraft</em> – which is available on the PlayStation 5 preview. But you don’t have access to the Minecraft Store currently, though you will get the new “Tricky Trials Update” with the download.</p> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="752" data-injectable="true">Essentially, this is a testing ground for running the game natively on the PS5, which is something the studio does quite often. As such, this particular build is likely to be “unstable” and “not representative of the final version quality.” With these previews, players are encouraged to send feedback and <a href="http://bugs.mojang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">submit bug reports</a> to the developer. As for when the full version will be getting a release, there’s no word on that yet.</p>
 <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="false">Still pulling in millions of players after all this time, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/minecraft-at-15-ish-heres-what-people-thought-of-the-game-when-it-first-went-public/"><em>Minecraft</em> recently celebrated its 15th birthday</a>. I still remember the first time I played it, not long after it went into beta. It’s been quite the trajectory for the sandbox game that went from a single person’s passion project to dominating the video gaming landscape for the better part of a decade. Maybe its popularity has waned slightly over the years, but I will always find myself back in its blocky world from time to time.</p>

		<p>It’s getting to be pretty toasty out there, as summer feels like it’s truly arrived in the UK, just in time for last night’s Summer Solstice. Did you mark Midsummer’s night in any way? Perhaps you just looked out the window around 9:30PM and thought “Huh, it’s still pretty bright out, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>This week I’ve been playing more of Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD for our upcoming review of the Switch remaster, as well as returning to Crime Boss: Rockay City, to see how it’s come along for the Steam launch this week. I’ve also shared some quick thoughts on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/20/cat-quest-3-preview-a-purrfectly-piratical-adventure/">Cat Quest 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-is-the-remake-this-legendary-rpg-deserves/">Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</a>, and have some more games to talk about next week.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> played SteamWorld Dig 2 this week, saying it’s “the perfect sequel to the original, with a fun story and fun gameplay.” I couldn’t agree more, and love its really distinctive take on the Metroidvania form.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Ade</strong> has been away on holiday, and so has been leaning in on local multiplayer gaming. That’s meant&nbsp;TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge,<br>
Guacamelee!, Overcooked! 2 and Cake Bash, and he can heartily recommend the lot of them!</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has naturally mixed together Destiny 2 with some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/17/still-wakes-the-deep-review/">Still Wakes the Deep</a> to wrap up our review, but has also been playing with Cubase and his CDJs as he’s got a big gig… tonight!</p>

<p>It was also Still Wakes the Deep for <strong>Nick</strong>, “which is very good.” And on the side, he’s been playing Street Fighter 6, Dead by Daylight and WWE 2K24.</p>
<p>Gamoc has had Minecraft with an S-tonne of mods, then Minecraft with a quarter tonne of mods. He’s also played Rebel Galaxy Outlaw, “which is basically a Freelancer clone”, as well as Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader, “which continues to be excellent but crashy.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round out this week with Steve:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have played some Survival: Fountain of Youth and Hauntii, just started Still Wakes the Deep which is braw (that’s Scots slang for good). My main gaming time involved my usual masochistic Next Fest Demo binge with about 120 demos played over the week (don’t ask me why, it’s just become a thing) including a fair few hours with Once Human – preview of this coming up soon. Loads of really exciting titles now added to my wishlist but desperately hoping that the PT ‘inspired’ horror game runs its course soon as almost every other horror tagged demo felt like the same house (often actually is the same Unity asset pack).</p></blockquote>
<p>Now then, what have you played? Holler in the comments below!</p>

The challenge with these emulators is that they don’t include any games. They rely on ROMs, digital copies of classic video games, that are plagued with complicated legal questions&nbsp;when it comes to using and acquiring them.</p><p>Antstream features a library of legally licensed retro titles that’s similar to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21271988/evercade-retro-games-handheld-review-classic-atari-namco-interplay">Evercade lineup</a> of gaming consoles, so users don’t have to visit the dark corners of the web to source their own. </p><p>There are <a href="https://www.antstream.com/games">hundreds of titles from ancient platforms</a> like the Commodore 64, the ZX Spectrum, and the Commodore Amiga, but you’ll find just 28 Atari 2600 games, five from the Game Boy, two from the original PlayStation, and 42 from the Super Nintendo. So, even with 1,300-plus games offered through the Antstream service, you might have to dig a little to find something you’ll actually want to play.</p><p>As much as we enjoyed the <em>Super Star Wars</em> trilogy on the SNES, that might not be enough to justify the price of an Antstream subscription. For a limited time after launching on the App Store on June 27th, subscriptions will be discounted to $3.99 per month or $29.99 per year, which is just slightly cheaper than the standard $4.99 per month or $39.99 per year that Antstream usually charges.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>German YouTube channel 'Digital Dreams' has released a new Cyberpunk 2077 showcase, aiming to imitate real life.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-unmatched-realism-path-tracing-8k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered plenty of graphical showcases</a> for CDPR's hit title, including several <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-path-tracing-100-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Digital Dreams</a>. Last year, we covered a showcase of the game running in 4K resolution with more than 100 mods, and today we wanted to share an impressive showcase of the game running in 8K resolution with over 300 mods on an NVIDIA RTX 4090. For the video, the content creator has used his own custom ReShade preset alongside an ultra path tracing mod as well as a real weather mod to simulate real life. As said, more than 300 mods were used in order to create this showcase, and the complete list of mods <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/haskeer212/mods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can be downloaded via Nexusmods here</a>.</p>
<p>As expected, you'll need quite the setup in order to run CDPR's game with this many mods in 8K resolution. The following configuration was used:</p>
<ul>
<li>MB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gigabyte Aorus X670 AX</li>
<li>CPU:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryzen 9 7950x</li>
<li>RAM:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kingston Fury 6000MHz</li>
<li>GPU:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NVIDIA RTX 4090</li>
<li>M2 SSD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Samsung 970 evo</li>
<li>SSD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crucial MX500 2TB</li>
<li>HDD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seagate Barracuda 14TB</li>
<li>AIO WC:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artic Liquid Freezer 420</li>
<li>PSU:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be quiet! Straight Power</li>
<li>Fans:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arctic P12</li>
</ul>

It will be interesting to see how further sales for both Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty will evolve over time.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-native-4k/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-latest-trailer-shows-the-game-at-native-4k-resolution.907845/</guid>

			<p>The latest Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater showed the game running at native 4K resolution, as well as a very faithful recreation of some the original release's cutscenes.</p>
<p>A new analysis shared today by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metal-gear-solid-delta-what-tech-does-the-new-remake-bring">Digital Foundry</a> confirms how the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-new-trailer-provides-an-impressive-new-look-at-the-boss-more-gameplay/">trailer</a> showed almost two weeks back during this year's Xbox Games Showcase featured the remake running at native 4K resolution, with dynamic resolution scaling kicking in rarely. Unfortunately, it hasn't been specified from which version of the game the footage was captured, so it's too early to say if the console versions will indeed run at native 4K resolution, at least in the Quality or Graphics mode the game is likely to feature.</p>
<p>The video also features some very interesting comparisons between some of the original version's cutscenes and their Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater recreations, highlighting how the remake will essentially retain the same scene composition of the original while enhancing it using the Unreal Engine 5. In Snake's HALO jump cutscene that opens the game, for example, the engine's more accurate lighting allows more detailed and diffuse shadows across the characters while ambient occlusion shades in under collars and beneath hair. High-quality assets, improved reflections, more realistic cloud rendering, and better lens flare also play a big part in making the cutscene look amazing. The Unreal Engine 5 also allowed the developer to massively improve character rendering, as all characters sport new facial details, which make them look great even with the animations and motion capture used in the original.</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24182791/kingdom-planet-apes-4k-blu-ray-special-feature-no-cgi<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="SOK167">It’s no secret that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152375/kingdom-planet-apes-visual-effects-weta-fx-mocap"><em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em> is a visual-effects-heavy movie</a>. After all, there are only two human characters, and every other speaking part in the movie belongs to a CGI ape. But just because there are a lot of digital characters doesn’t mean the actors portraying them weren’t giving full performances. In fact, most of the characters were fully motion-captured, and the movie’s 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray is here to prove it. </p>
<p id="4lgc7A">The<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24152022/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review"><em>Kingdom of the Planet</em> <em>of the Apes</em></a> 4K set includes a special version of the movie, dubbed <em>The Raw Cut</em>, that’s a split-screen version of the entire movie — one side is the finished film and the other is stripped of all the film’s visual effects. In other words, it’s just the actors in their mocap suits acting out the scenes as their ape characters. (<em>The Raw Cut</em> is not included in the Blu-ray or DVD releases of the movie — just the 4K Blu-ray.) </p>
<p id="t4Ys2E">On the one hand, this is probably a very awkward way to watch the movie in which you’re constantly confronted with the fact that the whole thing is just a bunch of people pretending to be monkeys. On the other hand, <em>The Raw Cut</em> is an excellent way to show off just how much work the actors are doing and how incredible their full-body performances are. </p>
<p id="xBPIzy">Showcasing the work of motion capture actors has never really been easy. First popularized with Andy Serkis’ performance as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9HWSuptvNc">Gollum in <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</em></a> in 2002, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NU9ikjqjC0">unfinished footage of actors performing in mocap suits</a> has provided insight into just how complicated the process is and how intricate the physical performance can be. But this <em>Kingdom </em>special feature shows one way filmmakers can show off just how incredible their films’ performers are, which is why it should become standard for every visual effects-heavy movie. </p>
<p id="SJsySE">The 4K UHD Blu-ray version of <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em> is set to be released on Aug. 27. <em>The Raw Cut</em> will also include an optional commentary track featuring director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24145926/zelda-movie-director-wes-ball-grounded-style">Wes Ball</a>, editor Dan Zimmerman, and VFX supervisor Erik Winquist. </p>
