<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NatetheHate">YouTube and podcaster 'Nate the Hate'</a>, "Starfield is planned for release on the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026".</p>

<p>See that planet? You can go there.</p>
<p>Aside from landing on PS5... Starfield is planned for release on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Bethesda and its developers are now under the control of Microsoft and Xbox, games from its teams are still expected to show up on other platforms.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Xbox's leadership have also reiterated on multiple occasions how they intend to bring more of games to more platforms going forward.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s Zombies mode will be getting its big reveal soon enough. After showcasing the game’s co-op campaign and a hint of Multiplayer, Zombies got a small section of the trailer. Still, for those who want to know more, you won’t have to wait long to find out.</p>



<p>Releasing on November 14th, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is returning to the cybernetic world of Black Ops 2. While the campaign picks up David Mason’s story, fans are no doubt excited for Multiplayer and Zombies. We previously reported that Multiplayer will be at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-next-announced-september-2025/">COD Next</a>, as well as Zombies. However, it looks like it may be sooner than that, thanks to confirmation from PlayStation.</p>



<h2 id="h-zombies-return-in-a-big-way-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Zombies Return (in a Big Way) in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>At around <a href="https://youtu.be/r9Z15Z-f2Ys?feature=shared&amp;t=132">the 2:12 mark</a> of the latest trailer of Black Ops 7, a peek at Zombies is shown. We get a few seconds of gameplay, as well as an interesting arcade mode called Dead Ops Arcade 4. It’s not much, though it was confirmed that, alongside Multiplayer, it will be present at COD Next. The event, which takes place on September 30th, 2025, plans to show off both modes in detail. However, it looks like we may see Zombies earlier than that, as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies-launching-november-14/">PlayStation Blog</a> mentions an early September reveal for the mode.</p>



<p>From the Call of Duty blog, Black Ops 7’s Zombies picks off where Black Ops 6 left off, with the crew now meeting the original Black Ops Zombies members. The mode will apparently be its biggest yet, with the launch map being quite vast. For fans of Black Ops 2, Survival Maps return, so players can enjoy multiple maps to play on and last against the hordes of zombies. </p>



<p>While there isn’t a firm date as to when Black Ops 7 Zombies will be shown, it’ll be before COD Next. Given the game launches on Game Pass, you’ll be able to dive into Zombies day one if you own the subscription.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2%E2%80%99s-legacy-of-the-forge-expansion-gets-release-date.1275165/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As part of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s post-launch content, the newest story expansion, Legacy of the Forge, got a brand new trailer at Gamescom Opening Night Live. Even more so, we now have a release date for it, and it’s quite soon.</p>



<p>Made by Warhorse Studios, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s immersive RPG gameplay improves over the original in many ways. Already being helmed as one of 2025’s best, the studio has been hard at work with post-launch content. It’s first, Brushes with Death, added new quests with an art-focused storyline, as well as shield customization. While one, Mysteria Ecclesiae, is still planned, the next one is Legacy of the Forge, which was shown off in a brand new trailer.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcvB6lH-LKI">shown above</a>, Henry acts upon his late father’s legacy and starts using his old forge to craft new weapons for the folks of Kuttenberg. Legacy of the Forge, which releases on September 9th, 2025, will let players create new weapons and armor to use. Plus, new story content following Henry uncovering his father’s past will be added. In it, you’ll meet allies that may reveal another side to Henry’s father that he never knew.</p>



<p>In addition, players can now customize their own houses. You can personalize many aspects of your domicile, like your armory and bedroom. With over 100 million variations, there are no limits to your medieval imagination. All of the new content in Legacy of the Forge will cost $13.99 on all platforms, though Expansion Pass holders will get the DLC for free. </p>



<p>The success of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, given the original’s reception. Still, the game has become a top contender for award season, especially for RPGs and Direction. Fortunately, Legacy of the Forge and subsequent DLC will ensure it isn’t going anywhere, which fans will be more than happy about. </p>



<p>Will you play Legacy of the Forge when it comes out on September 9th? Did you enjoy Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2? Let us know in the comments below and in the forums!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is getting a COD Next all about it in late September. After getting its gameplay reveal at Gamescom Opening Night Live, Activision has announced when we’ll see more. Fortunately, it won’t be long before we see more Multiplayer.</p>



<p>Releasing on November 14th, 2025, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/">brings the series back</a> to the Mason family, specifically David Mason. In 2035, he and his crew are taken into a warped reality thanks to Black Ops 2’s Raul Menendez. Going off of Black Ops 6 ‘s success last year, Raven and Treyarch aren’t pulling punches, as the new COD Next is weeks away.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-s-cod-next-streams-on-september-30th-2025">Black Ops 7’s COD Next Streams on September 30th, 2025</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>It’s been announced that the next COD Next will livestream on September 30th, 2025. No exact timing or platforms are available as of writing. In it, fans will get a look at Black Ops 7’s Multiplayer, which <a href="https://youtu.be/r9Z15Z-f2Ys?feature=shared&amp;t=126">was teased</a> in the trailer above. COD Next also plans to have famous content creators try out the new Multiplayer and Zombies modes live. Then, on October 2nd, a beta will occur for fans to finally get their hands on it at home. </p>



<p>Despite releasing a bit later than most Call of Duty’s do, Black Ops 7 looks to be another fun futuristic take on the series. While the co-op campaign might turn some solo players off, there’s no doubt that it’ll sell quite well. Even more so, it will launch Day One on Xbox Game Pass, meaning more people than ever can play. All that said, COD Next is an event many should keep tabs on, especially since Multiplayer is the series’ bread and butter. </p>



<p>Will you be watching COD Next on September 30th? Are you excited to play Black Ops 7? Let us know in the comments below or in the forums!</p>

<p>Microsoft is bringing Starfield to the Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>In a post on social media on Tuesday, known leaker Nate The Hate said that Starfield will be making its way to Nintendo’s latest console along with the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>“Indiana Jones &amp; the Great Circle won’t be the only Bethesda game coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026,” <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1957886310896796027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. “See that planet? You can go there. Aside from landing on PS5… Starfield is planned for release on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was confirmed</a> for Nintendo Switch 2 during Gamescom Opening Night Live on Tuesday. No set date was announced for the game on the system aside from it being next year.</p>



<p>Going back to Starfield, right now the only information is from Nate The Hate’s initial tweet. It’s unknown if the game will launce with the Shattered Space expansion or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-spring-2026-new-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even the anticipated second</a> expansion. A new expansion, if rumors are to be believed, is expected to come in Spring 2026. </p>



<p>A potential release on the Switch 2 isn’t the only Starfield news to be making the rounds. Recently, a data mine suggested that real-time <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-datamine-suggests-a-new-ship-feature-is-on-the-way" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interplanetary travel could be coming</a> in a future update.</p>



<p>What do you think of Starfield possibly coming to Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

In Gamescom 2025's case (thanks to Christopher Kassulke<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christopherkassulke_gamescom-onl-gamesindustry-activity-7363542070583521280-nvBy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> for first posting these</a>),<a href="https://forms.gamescom.global/en/booking-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> prices</a> ranged from a downright affordable (RELATIVE) €70,500 (USD$82,000) for a 30-second spot in the pre-show, and went all the way up to €465,000 (or USD$520,000 at time of publishing) for 180 seconds in the main event.</p><p>Here's the full breakdown:</p><blockquote><h3>ONL Pre Show</h3><p>30 Sec - 70,500.00 EUR</p><p>60 Sec - 102,500.00 EUR</p><p>90 Sec - 135,000.00 EUR</p><p>120 Sec - 167,500.00 EUR</p><p>150 Sec - 200,000.00 EUR</p><p>180 Sec - 232,500.00 EUR</p><h3>ONL Main Show</h3><p>30 Sec - 140,000.00 EUR</p><p>60 Sec - 205,000.00 EUR</p><p>90 Sec - 270,000.00 EUR</p><p>120 Sec - 335,000.00 EUR</p><p>150 Sec - 400,000.00 EUR</p><p>180 Sec - 465,000.00 EUR</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Note that not <em>every </em>trailer making up the show was paid for like this. Again, like Summer Game Fest, access to the showcase could come via one of two ways: a "sponsorship" slot, which is paying the prices above, or as an "editorial" slot, which were reserved for "brand new game announcements and breaking game news to drive awareness/audience during the livestream", and which came "without additional costs". </p><p>For those that did spend, that's a <em>lot </em>of money. Especially when you consider a lot of these bigger companies aren't just stumping up for a trailer or two, but for<a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/info/exhibitors/exhibit/pricing-and-packages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> booths</a> and other deals (<a href="https://media.koelnmesse.io/gamescom/redaktionell/gamescom/downloads/pdf/exhibitor/gamescom-sponsorships.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like €75,000 for an 'event module'</a>) across the multiple days.</p><p>Hope it was worth it! And by worth it I mean that for over half a million dollars you got your trailer near the <em>top</em> of a website's "ALL THE STUFF WE SAW AT GAMESCOM OPENING NIGHT LIVE" blog, and not buried somewhere near the bottom.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/la-divina-commedia-game-gamescom-dantes-inferno"><h3>OK History, That’s Enough Rhyming For One Day</h3></a><p>Another Dante's Inferno action game was not on my bingo card for this year, or... life</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bioshock-4-rod-fergusson-cloud-chamber-layoffs-2k-games"><h3>History Doesn’t Repeat, But It Often Rhymes</h3></a><p>There’s always a lighthouse, there’s always a man (Rod Fergusson), there’s always a city</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mafia-old-country-review-impressions"><h3>Curling Up With A Sandwich, A Warm Drink And Mafia: The Old Country</h3></a><p>'I'm genuinely wistful for a good 'ol 7/10, last-days-of -summer video game'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esports-world-cup-new-global-sport-conference-2025-hideo-kojima"><h3>Come On, Guys</h3></a><p>Nobody is forcing Hideo Kojima and a host of industry luminaries to attend a Saudi sportswashing conference.

If you're a fan of Naughty Dog's Last of Us series, either the games or the TV show, you can now preorder a replica of Ellie's guitar that Joel customized with the custom moth inlay fretboard. This guitar was first featured in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us Part II</a> and made an appearance in the second season of the HBO series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The guitar is a collaboration with Taylor Guitars and is a special edition of the Taylor 314ce. You can preorder it for $2,999.99 at the PlayStation Store and it will officially release on November 18, 2025. It's listed in the PlayStation store's hardware section among various consoles, controllers, and other accessories.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Taylor 314ce The Last of Us Part II Replica Guitar</h2><div catalogid="09a8041f-5e7d-4130-8508-ecf1bff3e86c" id="227110"><div id="227110" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Taylor 314ce The Last of Us Part II Replica Guitar</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>The PlayStaton Store bundle includes a strap and replica case.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The guitar has distinctive rich tobacco sunburst top in Sitka spruce pulled straight from the game and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-spoiler-free">latest season of the TV show</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you think that $3,000 is a ridiculous amount of money to pay for a guitar, it's actually not <em>that</em> terribly priced, especially for a nice acoustic guitar.

But what about new games and episodes of the show? Game-wise, The Last of Us Part 3 has yet to be officially confirmed and it seems unlikely that it ever will be.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enotria-the-last-song">Enotria: The Last Song</a> developers Jyamma Games are making a new action-RPG inspired by and named after Dante Alighieri’s 14th century epic poem La Divina Commedia, aka the Divine Comedy.</p>
<p>Like the poem, it sees you descending through the circles of Hell, each the geological manifestation of a particular Sin. Unlike the poem, it features a set of combat classes, a choice of protagonist genders, a narrative alignment system, procedurally generated extraction dungeons, and customisable weapons and armour. As the poet himself might say: in the middle of the journey of our life I came to myself within a dark wood where I had to grind for crafting materials. </p><!--more-->
<p>The games industry has not been mega gentle with poor old Dante, whose monumental work helped establish the Tuscan language and influenced a brace of English writers, from Blake to Beckett. The best-known video game adaptation is probably still Visceral’s cheeseball 2010 action-adventure Dante’s Inferno, which is often more interested in aping God Of War. A cynical man or snob (hello!) might look at the below, hacky-slashy trailer for Jyamma’s adaptation and consider it to be another act of wanton literary desecration. Terza rima isn’t supposed to be a three-hit combo, you blistering philistines!</p>

<p>Still, this isn't quite another exercise in crafting boobwalls for the circle of Lust or punching organs out of bodies. Enotria was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enotria-the-last-song-review%E2%80%9D">pretty metaphysical for a Soulslike</a>, building a universe and combat system around the practice of stagecraft, and Jyamma’s take on the La Divina Commedia is similarly dreamy - it turns Dante’s poem into a kind of overarching mythology.</p><p>“In this new adventure, the studio presents an epic journey set in a world where The Divine Comedy has supplanted the old faith, bringing about a golden age of righteousness among humanity,” explains <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/JYAMMA-GAMES-ANNOUNCES-LA-DIVINA-COMMEDIA-AN-EPIC-DARK-FANTASY-ACTION-">a press release</a>. “When dark forces subvert the promises of the poem, order collapses and the world is thrust into chaos. The player will take on the role of a warrior-poet trapped in the infernal depths, called to descend through the circles of Hell, face increasingly powerful demons, and redeem a sinful past.”</p>
<p>Sounds quite involved. Still, I’m not sure where the procgen extraction dungeons fit in, exactly. The idea of mining hell for loot and progression materials is the kind of videogame conceit I’d love to lay before an actual 14th century theologian. I'm sure the humour of the situation would be well worth the inconvenience of being burned at the stake. Anyway, there’s no release date yet for La Divina Commedia. The poem took about 12 years to write – hopefully, Jyamma will turn their version around a little sooner.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Raphaël “Jeanpormanove” Graven reportedly died in his sleep earlier this week following broadcasts <a href="https://kotaku.com/nickmercs-kick-twitch-faze-clan-gambling-1850973704">on Kick</a> where he was routinely assaulted by others in controversial “humiliation” livestreams. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1mpjplk4pxo">According to the BBC</a>, a judicial investigation in France is underway, with French government minister for digital technologies Clara Chappaz calling what Graven experienced “absolute horror.”</p> <p>The death of the 46-year-old, whose <a href="https://www.charentelibre.fr/france/qui-etait-jean-pormanove-l-influenceur-decede-en-live-25595669.php">streaming career began with TikTok videos about <em>GTA 5 </em>and <em>FIFA</em></a> and who had amassed over a million followers across all his channels, appears to have been captured live during his latest, and last, marathon Kick broadcast. Graven’s more recent content, which he created as part of the collective Le LokalTV, included being seemingly brutalized by two fellow streamers who go by the aliases <span dir="auto">“Naruto”</span><span dir="auto">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span dir="auto">“Safine,” with some clips appearing to show violent, prolonged strangulations. </span>An <a href="https://www.mediapart.fr/journal/france/080125/maltraitances-sur-kick-deux-influenceurs-nicois-places-en-garde-vue">investigation last year by<em> Mediapart</em></a> alleged that Graven had been subject to “months of online abuse.”</p> <p>It’s unclear what exactly the relationship was between all of the men, though reporting by <em>Mediapart</em> suggests the “humiliation” streams were lucrative and helped propel the popularity of Graven and the group’s channel on Kick.

              <p><em>Denshattack!</em> was probably the coolest game revealed during <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">today’s very long Gamescom Opening Night Live event</a>. But funnily enough, the wild-looking, trick-based anime train game wasn’t actually revealed during the trailer-packed event. Instead, it debuted during ONL’s shockingly good pre-show. And I can’t wait to play it when it launches next year.</p> <p><em>Denshattack!’s </em>vibrant colors and eye-popping art immediately caught the attention of everyone at <em>Kotaku</em> and reminded me of <em>Jet Set Radio</em> or even Insomniac’s <em>Sunset Overdrive</em>. And then, we all saw a train do some flips and grinds, and suddenly it became clear that <em>Denshattack!</em>&nbsp;is like a<em> Tony Hawk</em> game, but instead of controlling a person on a skateboard, you control a customizable subway car that can flip, jump, grind, hop, spin, and more across some truly gorgeous scenery. Just watch this trailer and try not to smile.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Denshattack! - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_Xmv9eAIZA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Here’s how the game’s developers, Undercoders, describe <em>Denshattack!:&nbsp;</em></p>

 <blockquote><p>Flip, trick, and grind your train in a fast-paced, off-the-rails ride through a colorful Japanese dystopia. Outmatch rival gangs, wreck a shady megacorp, and take back the tracks with nothing but skill, speed, and style. Hop aboard your custom gravity-defying train and embark on a hectic quest to defeat the sinister Miraido corporation, alongside a vibrant pack of outcasts.</p></blockquote> <p>According to the game’s trailer on YouTube, <em>Denshattack!</em> contains over 50 levels to complete, a full combo system, and “slick beats” from composer Tee Lopes, who helped create the music for games like <em>Sonic Mania </em>and <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge.&nbsp;</em>It also features “bizarre boss fights” and multiple regions of Japan to discover and explore while doing sick flips as a big train. This is definitely one of those video game concepts, <a href="https://kotaku.com/shark-dentist-horror-game-deadly-great-white-steam-pc-1851786072">like doing dental work on a shark</a>, that I never thought about, but now that I’ve seen it, I must play it as soon as possible.</p> <p><em>Denshattack!&nbsp;</em>doesn’t have a specific release date yet, but is set to launch in Spring 2026. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2524850/Denshattack/">You can wishlist the game now on Steam.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand/" data-ref-id="5000-681582">There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</a> is a first-person, narrative-driven mystery game developed by Friday Sundae. This is the studio's debut game, and a hands-on demo is available for those at Gamescom this week. I watched the demo ahead of its release at a preview event, and the game is an alluring combination of part-ghost story, part-musical, and part-renovation game. The heart of the game is the ghost story, though, and the developer works to make this spooky seaside tale approachable for everyone.</p><p dir="ltr">In There Are No Ghosts at the Grand, you play as Chris David, a character who has inherited The Grand, a dilapidated hotel located along the English coast. Chris is initially only tasked with restoration of the hotel, but he is ultimately drawn into rooting out a deeper mystery that surrounds the town and the people who live there.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552108-thegrandhotel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552108" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552108-thegrandhotel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552108"></a><figcaption>The Grand hotel</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552108-thegrandhotel.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The first part of the demo showcased the game's unique hotel renovation mechanics, which uses a quirky set of talking power tools built into one handheld device. Robert C. MacBrushy is a Scottish AI assistant integrated into this tool, and he gives a bit of humorous commentary to keep you company as you renovate the hotel. This sounds like it will come in handy to balance the tense elements of the game, as There Are No Ghosts at the Grand turns spooky at nighttime.</p><p dir="ltr">In the daytime, the game focuses on renovation work, with the handheld device hosting a selection of tools, including a sandblaster, power sprayer, turbo vacuum, and a furnisher. Anil Glendinning, Friday Sundae's creative director and co-founder who presented the demo, also confirmed each power-tool type has three different modes that are unlocked as you progress. We saw debris get sucked up in the device's turbo vacuum, and the demo also showed how intuitive the sprayer mechanic could be when painting walls. Glendinning said the game was designed to allow players to have fun renovating without requiring precision. With simple swipes of the sprayer, the game knew to paint only the wall surface and ignore the surrounding furniture and paintings that were still decorating the area.</p><p dir="ltr">At nighttime, the town gets a bit weird and spooky. A good example of this is when Chris's efforts to help the mayor leaves him stranded on an island. This seems to be the first moment of the game where he learns about the spooky dangers of the town, as he steps outside during a nighttime portion of the demo to find a bunch of red chairs scattered all around him. The chairs quickly evolved into some sort of spider-chair-monsters. This scare culminated in a chase scene and first-person-shooter moment, where the renovation multi-tool turned into a weapon that let Chris fire back at the creepy chair-monsters.</p><p dir="ltr">"We describe the game as being spooky. But there's no gore in the game or horror-distressing elements," Glendinning said. "It doesn't need it in order to tell the story we want to tell. And that story is about people and family, and it's about how some of that stuff can manifest itself in life."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552115-spidermonsters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552115" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552115-spidermonsters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552115"></a><figcaption>The spider-chair-monsters</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552115-spidermonsters.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552109-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_14-38-31.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552110-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_17-30-51%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552111-hotelinterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552112-moped.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552113-mrbones.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552114-wwiibunker.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552109,1300-4552110,1300-4552111,1300-4552112,1300-4552113,1300-4552114" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552109-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_14-38-31.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552110-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_17-30-51%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552111-hotelinterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552112-moped.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552113-mrbones.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394540/4552114-wwiibunker.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552109-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_14-38-31.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552110-grandgreyboxbasescene_4k_14.08.2025_17-30-51%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552111-hotelinterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552112-moped.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552113-mrbones.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552114-wwiibunker.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There Are No Ghosts at the Grand is also a musical of sorts. Our preview introduced us to the town's mayor, who shared her feelings toward Chris and his hotel renovation plans through a musical number. During these scenes, you're given the option to choose how you want to respond to the characters, and Chris will sing his reply. These musical moments will happen with other characters you meet in the story as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The game wasn't always planned to be a musical, Glendinning said, but the element was added fairly early on.</p><p dir="ltr">"From the very start, we wanted to create a ghost story," he said, explaining how the story was inspired by some of the dilapidated seaside towns and boarded-up shops found in the United Kingdom. "We were hearing this internal soundtrack in our heads as we were creating this ghost story, and as we were writing dialogue and setting it to music, the [musical] dialogue evolved from that."</p><p dir="ltr">These musical interactions are just some of the opportunities for branching narratives in the game. There are also multiple endings you can experience based on your non-musical interactions with the town folk, as well as how much information you learn about the town and your neighbors by exploring and uncovering clues.</p><p dir="ltr">There Are No Ghosts at the Grand extends beyond the hotel itself, as you get access to explore various parts of the seaside village. We saw part of a mission that began with a moped ride through town, and eventually, Chris was tasked with repairing a boat for a trip to a haunted island with a World War II bunker.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552116-683d9bc8c9bcb729503d79e0_secretdoor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552116" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552116-683d9bc8c9bcb729503d79e0_secretdoor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4552116"></a><figcaption>Mr. Bones and Robert C. MacBrushy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4552116-683d9bc8c9bcb729503d79e0_secretdoor.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">We weren't introduced to many characters, but we did meet Mr. Bones, a cat who lurks around the hotel and follows Chris on some adventures. Mr. Bones appears to be just a normal cat during the daylight hours, but at night he gains the ability to talk to Chris and speaks with an Australian accent. It's possible his story will be part of the mystery you'll need to uncover. Regardless, don't worry: The preview confirmed you can pet the cat.</p><p dir="ltr">Glendinning also confirmed various parts of the game can be skipped.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're believers in allowing players to move through the story," he said. "If a puzzle is too difficult, you can definitely skip it."</p><p dir="ltr">That also factors into the game's replayability, as you can skip scenes and puzzles you've already experienced to more quickly advance through additional playthroughs.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, the early preview piqued my interest, as someone who loves musicals and a good mystery. The town looks cozy yet mysterious, and characters like Mr. Bones and Robert C. MacBrushy lend a great deal of personality to the game, leaving me eager to play and uncover the secrets of There Are No Ghosts at the Grand.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can renovate and work through the mystery next year, as There Are No Ghosts at the Grand is headed to Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2026, and will be available on day one with Xbox Game Pass.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui">a Q&amp;A on the official site</a>, the developers call the game a "tentative first step - to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design". They want Wukong players to feel "right at home" while "catching them off guard in the best way". That said, for now the new game remains "little more than an empty folder", with no release date and little sense in the CG trailer of how Zhong Kui fights, compared to Wukong. I'm guessing that tiger is a useful ally, though.</p>
<p>We quite liked the original Black Myth, with bygone reviews editor Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-is-a-pleasantly-surprising-soulslike-even-if-its-given-me-an-enemy-for-life">calling it</a> "a refreshing adventure after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s knotty DLC". We were less keen on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukongs-record-setting-launch-popularity-soured-by-co-publisher-request-to-avoid-feminist-propaganda-in-streams">the mildly draconian PR messages</a> to certain streamers, cautioning them to avoid "feminist propaganda", "politics" and discussion of the Chinese games industry.</p><p>These gamergatory memos followed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">a lengthy report from IGN</a> about alleged workplace sexism at Game Science. The devs refused to say anything to Ed about this when he asked at a preview event. If we're invited to preview Zhong Kui, we'll give it another shot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live broadcast has given us a fresh look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> protagonist Grace Ashcroft, but no sign of fan-favorite Leon S. Kennedy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As expected, today's show brought with it a deeper dive into Capcom's hotly-anticipated upcoming survival horror (which is also playable here at Gamescom). Footage once again showed the game's new star Grace Ashcroft in action, though fans were left wondering about Leon's whereabouts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a phone call from unknown voice, Grace Ashcroft and her mom Alyssa attempt to escape from the hotel in which they had been staying, as the power is cut and the pair are attacked. We already know what happens next, as Grace is seen investigating the hotel years later, as an FBI analyst.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom previously promised that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-resident-evil-requiem-will-return-to-franchises-original-overarching-narrative-featuring-raccoon-city-and-umbrella">Requiem will feature a return to the series' "overarching narrative"</a> begun 30 years ago, after more recent games such as Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village focused on events set elsewhere, with fewer connections to past titles. Already, fans had noted the return of Raccoon City and references to the shadowy Umbrella Corporation, while hoping for more, including a first sighting of Leon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We always thought about making Leon the protagonist," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi previously said</a>, "but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn't jump at a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he's actually quite a bad match for horror."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many fans took this comment to mean that Leon was still in the game somewhere, likely in sequences that offered more action-orientated gameplay, as while stating the character wouldn't be suitable for horror sections, Nakanishi notably stopped short of ruling the character out altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty of time still until Resident Evil Requiem eventually launches, on February 27, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom and Square Enix took the stage at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74oh7zD_jxI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>gamescom Opening Night Live 2025</u></a> to show off a new collaboration that will see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> collide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and Final Fantasy 14 Online Producer and Director Naoki Yoshida (a.k.a. Yoshi-P) showed up to talk about how two of gaming’s biggest publishers are working to bring some of their biggest franchises together. Two new trailers (below) revealed only a taste of what to expect, including Monster Hunter-themed content for Final Fantasy 14 and Final Fantasy-themed content for Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Final Fantasy 14 content coming to Monster Hunter Wilds kicked off the announcement with a look at how Hunters will be able to use Chocobo to travel during hunts. It's a trailer that also teases appearances from familiar elements like Cactuar as the Capcom team tells players to prepare for "an Omega level threat."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/monsterhunterwilds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> the Monster Hunter Wilds content coming to Final Fantasy 14, on the other hand, will see players "face an unknown threat in this thrilling new hunt." Its trailer shows off some of the new content you'll be able to enjoy, but there is a catch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In order to participate in the Monster Hunter Wilds-themed update, you'll need to reach level 100 in Final Fantasy 14 and complete its Dawntrail main scenario quest. It's far from a simple feat to achieve and could take new players potentially hundreds of hours to pull off (according to <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/12654" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Howlongtobeat</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If a Monster Hunter fan were to jump into Final Fantasy 14 for the first time today, they could spend around 400 hours working their way through all of the required content. Alternatively, Square Enix's long-running live-service game offers paid options for those who want to skip their way past any entry barriers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using a Tales of Adventure item to skip to level 90 for any one character costs $25 alone, and a second Tales of Adventure item to then skip to Dawntrail also costs $25. That's $50 to go from level 1 to almost meeting the requirements to unlock the Monster Hunter Wilds content, with players then asked to complete the final 10 levels and see Dawntrailer to its conclusion. <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/132429" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Howlongtobeat</a> estimates that it should take players about 48 hours to beat this one Final Fantasy 14 chapter on its own.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds players can expect the new content to arrive in late September as part of Free Title Update 3. Final Fantasy 14 players, meanwhile, can expect to receive their content in early October.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for more updates, be sure to read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at gamescom Opening Night Live 2025</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-midnight-takes-players-back-to-a-refreshed-quelthalas-in-the-battle-against-the-void.1275030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">At Gamescom Opening Night Live, we just got a look at the opening cinematic for the next World of Warcraft expansion: Midnight. And with it, we got a taste of what to expect at the focal point of the expansion's start: Quel'Thalas, and the Blood Elf city of Silvermoon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a WoW veteran, you probably know Quel'Thalas. It was introduced to World of Warcraft in the first expansion, The Burning Crusade, alongside the introduction of the Blood Elves. Currently in the game, in consists of Silvermoon City and the surrounding Eversong Woods, as well as the northern Isle of Quel'Danas and The Ghostlands to the south. Though it's largely populated by Blood Elves, it's also home to Zul'Aman, the home of the Amani Trolls. As it stands now, Silvermoon and everything to the south serves as a starting zone for low-level Blood Elves (though it's also largely been made obsolete due to the addition of the ubiquitous new player experience, Exile's Reach), while Quel'Danas was an endgame zone in patch 2.4 that's largely useless now if you don't have a very specific reason to be there.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All that is about to change. As we saw in the cinematic, Midnight opens with void menace and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oh-no-everyone-in-world-of-warcraft-is-falling-for-the-hot-evil-lady-who-will-definitely-try-and-kill-us-later">total baddie Xal'atath</a> attacking the Sunwell, a magical power fountain in Quel'Danas that's sacred to the Blood Elves. We're headed there at the start of Midnight to defend it (alongside the thankfully-not-dead Blood Elf leader, Lor'themar Theron), which means that whole area is getting an overhaul. Midnight starts with four zones: a reworked Eversong Woods (which also seems like it will include at least some of Ghostlands), a reworked Zul'Aman (now upgraded from a raid to a full zone), and two new areas: the rootlands of Harandar, and Voidstorm, which seems to be located in a different world entirely. Players will start in Eversong Woods and end in Voidstorm, with Zul'Aman and Harandar able to be done interchangeably.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apologies to the Draenei, though. Burning Crusade's equivalent Alliance class starting zones, Azuremyst and Bloodmyst Isle, and the Draenei hub The Exodar, don't appear to be getting any special treatment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike recent expansions, Midnight will open with not one, but three raids: The Voidspire (six bosses), The Dreamrift (one boss), and March on Quel'Danas (two bosses). World of Warcraft hasn't had multiple raids running at once for several expansions now, so having three at once at launch is a big deal. The expansion also launches with eight new dungeons (including a reworked Magister's Terrace), seven new delves, and a new PvP battleground. There's also a brand new feature called "Prey" where players hunt powerful targets across different world zones, with the potential to be ambushed while on the hunt.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft: Midnight Cinematic Images and First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for characters, we're not getting any brand new classes. A new allied race, Haranir, will be available, alongside a new mid-range Demon Hunter specialization and Void Elves now also able to become Demon Hunters. There are also some overhauls to the new player experience including new story mode raids for Dragonflight and some other catch-up features. And they're simplifying skyriding, including (thank goodness) getting rid of the vigor bar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the biggest and most exciting feature of Midnight is one we already know about: player housing. We've already heard and seen a lot about what to expect from housing, but Blizzard has re-confirmed that we're getting fully customizable player homes, with 3D placement tools, dyes to recolor furniture, all sorts of decor items available to be earned through all different kinds of content, and private and public neighborhoods. No <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-takes-a-jab-at-final-fantasy-14-with-its-housing-plans">fighting over plots</a> like in Final Fantasy 14, either!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're expecting to hear more details about what we'll see in Midnight throughout Gamescom, so stay tuned to IGN for more on World of Warcraft's latest. Midnight launches in 2026. You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Pick up the pieces of your broken network, untangle a bloody web of intrigue at the End of History, and prove yourself on the big stage or blow it all up—again.</p><p><strong>A Spy Like No Other</strong></p><p>Brilliant, burnt-out, possibly cursed—you play as operant Hershel Wilk, alias CASCADE. Five years ago you led your team into the abyss and have been haunted by your failures ever since. Now you’ve been recalled for a mysterious assignment that may give you a chance to prove yourself again.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Welcome to the End of History</strong></p><p>Find yourself thrown into a three-way struggle for cultural and ideological power, played out across an unforgettable new city. In ZERO PARADES, the world itself is a character with its own secrets, traumas, and miracles for you to discover.</p><p><strong>Trust is a Volatile Plaything</strong></p><p>To get anywhere in this world, you’ll need friends. Unfortunately, you don’t have any. Instead, you’ll go up against international bankers, foreign techno-fascists, psychic doppelgängers, a paranoid TV presenter, a man with a box for a heart, and dozens more. Everyone you meet has their own agendas, beliefs, and secrets for you to uncover and turn to your own ends.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_985862"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Make It Up as You Go Along</strong></p><p>In this line of work you’re going to fail *way* more often than you succeed. That much is expected of you. What matters is how you pick yourself back up. As an operant, your dice are in the hand of fate.

This is espionage stripped of glamour—no parades, no happy endings – at least probably not for you.</li><li><strong>Failing Forward</strong> – In the life of an operant, failure is inevitable. Here, it’s another way forward – every misstep opens doors that success would run swiftly by.</li><li><strong>A Story-Rich Espionage RPG</strong> – From the studio which brought you <em>Disco Elysium</em>. Blending the psychological depth of a spy novel with surrealist undertones and richly drawn characters.</li><li><strong>A <a title="Companies > Question [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/question">Question</a> of Identity</strong> – Who are you when no one is watching? Or, at least, when you *think* no one is? In ZERO PARADES, the answer will define much more than just the assignment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Opening Night Live time, and that means <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>'s back and ready to dish out loads of gaming news and information. As part of the presentation, Keighley and the crew behind Opening Night Live took to the stage with brand-new trailers, announcements, reveals, and more, kicking off this year's Gamescom event in Germany. You'll find a complete list of everything announced during the showcase below.</p>
<p><strong>A new trailer for </strong><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7"><strong>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</strong></a></p>
<p>First up, there was a cinematic trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.de/video-game-franchises/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> Black Ops 7. The trailer, set in the year of 2035, showed a world under the grip of terrorism, where militarised police and soldiers take to the battlefield in both the real world and what appears to simulated, topsy-turvy versions of Los Angeles, Angola, Tokyo, Alaska, and somewhere called Avalon (a 'living, breathing space that evolves with the player', per the devs).</p>
<p>The trailer also seemed to tease some sort of Zombies mode called 'Arcade Zombies' which is a top-down, action-RPG style experience that'll be added to this year's CoD. You'll be playing as series veteran David Mason, who's deployed alongside the 'Guild', a tech-startup inspired group that apparently calls itself 'humanity's last stand'. Hm.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting thing about today's news is that Activision confirmed you'll be able to play the whole story either single-player or with up to three other people. There's an emphasis on freedom in this campaign, and that's when it comes to narrative, gameplay, movement, or whatever else. It certainly seems like a drastic move for the series, and I'm pretty intrigued.</p>
<p>More information will be revealed at Call of Duty Next, which takes place on 30th September. The game is set to launch for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-suggests-theres-still-no-nintendo-switch-2-version-at-launch">on 14th November 2025.</a></p>

<p><strong>Lords of the Fallen 2 gets a reveal trailer</strong></p>
<p>Next up, we got a cinematic trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen-2">Lords of the Fallen 2</a>, a sequel to 2023's title by Hexworks and CI Games. It's dark fantasy through and through, with your armoured knight character going toe-to-toe with an angelic foe against the backdrop of a crumbling Medieval world. The game is set 100 years after the last one, as the barrier between the living and the dead begins to tear.</p>
<p>It'll also be "bloodier, faster, and more brutal than ever", promise the devs. We'll get more gameplay later this year.</p>

<p><strong>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is getting an anime</strong></p>
<p>Next up, Geoff <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-is-getting-an-anime-adaptation">showed off a trailer for Sekiro: No Defeat</a>. The anime is heading exclusively to Crunchyroll and is directed by Kenichi Kutsuna, with character design by Takahiro Kishida.</p>
<p>"We are taking on the monumental task of animating the breathtakingly beautiful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-tips-and-tricks-6009">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>. In doing so, we are pouring every ounce of our artistic vision and passion for beauty into its production," said Kutsuna. "The final product is being crafted to be a truly memorable experience, one that will leave a lasting impression on both dedicated fans of the game and those who are discovering the world of Sekiro for the very first time. Please look forward to it."</p>

<p><strong>Lego Batman returns with Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</strong></p>
<p>Lego Batman - not voiced by Will Arnett any more, apparently - returned with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-batman-is-back-in-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-and-its-out-next-year">goofy new Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, packed to the cowl with little references to the series at large: the Penguin, Joker, Catwoman, the Batmobile, Bane and more were there (and it sounds like Matt Berry is voicing Bane?!)</p><p>Per the developer, Legacy of the Dark Knight covers Bats' whole career, from Origins to legend. There's decades of lore here, and it looks like the studio has taken the best moments from games, comics, TV shows, and more in order to make a proper love-letter to the IP as a whole. I wouldn't expect anything less from the Lego games, though. You can also drive about an open-world Gotham in "your choice of Batmobile". Cool.</p>
<p>Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is being developed by TT Games, and there's a demo on the show floor. A release date was not mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>Dawn of War 4 announced, gets a cinematic trailer</strong></p>
<p>Warhammer is on a roll right now. Whether it's Rogue Trader or Space Marine 2, the IP is having a real moment both in miniatures and video games. Today, that strength continues, with a big (and pretty good-looking) new trailer for Dawn of War 4. We've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-announced-and-its-coming-from-a-surprise-new-developer-next-year">way more information on our dedicated page</a>.</p>
<p>Following the story of the Blood Marines, the cinematic trailer showed the marines dispatching enemies (Orks and Nekron, mostly) against the backdrop of that grimdark sci-fi universe that should be recognisable even to those that don't engage with Warhammer.</p>
<p>Dawn of War 4 is coming to PC in 2026.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.de/games/monster-hunter-wilds"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a><strong> gets a Final Fantasy 14 crossover (and vice versa) </strong></p>
<p>It's no Seikret that everyone thought the ridable mount in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> felt a bit like a chocobo from the Final Fantasy franchise; a mountable bird that is intelligent and dangerous in its own right? It's basically IP theft! Well, go figure - both franchises are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-and-final-fantasy-14-are-collaborating">collaborating to bring a touch of Final Fantasy 14's Eorza to the world of Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p><p>After first collaborating with Monster Hunter World, this promises to be a large crossover. We're getting the chocobo skins for our Seikrets, sure, but we're also getting a new monster to fight in the form of Omega Planetes, a mechanised beast that shares the name of a series-long villain in the Final Fantasy series. We didn't see much about the fight during the show, but if the Behemoth in Monster Hunter World is anything to go by, it'll be pretty brutal.</p>
<p>This collaboration works both ways: FF14 will let you replace your mount with a Seikret, and it looks like the MMO will be introducing Arkveld (the 'end-game' baddy from MH Wilds) as an encounter. It'll most likely be a raid. I think you may also be able to turn your Palico into a Cactuar, too? That's the real highlight.</p>

<p><strong>More gameplay for </strong><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/onimusha-the-way-of-the-sowrd"><strong>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</strong></a></p>
<p>Next up, we had a trailer for Onimusha: Way of the Sword that showed off combat against your standard 'mob' enemies (including some lush swordplay and some bow-based combat) as well as a few boss encounters: if you're a fan of parries, you're going to love this. I have a full preview (hands-on!) coming for you tomorrow, so expect to hear more then.</p>

<p><strong>Daemon X Machina Titanic Scion gets a free Switch 2 demo</strong></p>
<p>Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion now has a free demo available for users on all platforms, but the one I'm most intrigued about is Switch 2. The demo is available to download now, allowing you to play through the first nine chapters of the story and roam the open world. That's pretty generous for a demo. Even better, all save data can be transferred to the full game when it launches on 5th September 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Fallout season two sets the world on fire, gets a proper release date </strong></p>
<p>So, we're going to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a>. After dealing with a lot of 'family struggles' in their own right, the showrunners noted they wanted to send Lucy and the Ghoul to 'one of the most family friendly places on earth'. Will Lucy transform the Ghoul, or will the Ghoul transform Lucy? That's the core tension this season. The assembled actors and producers on stage also pushed a bit into Maximus' lore, and teased a journey for him as he steps gently into his role of a knight in the Brotherhood of Steel.</p><p>Now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says">Season 2</a> is diving more into New Vegas - a place explored well in the video game - we're also going to see some more crossovers with the game. So, say hello to Mr. House, as he appears in his human form. We even get a VATS-style slow-mo shot of Lucy shooting a gun, and our first glimpse of a Deathclaw as it appears in the show.</p>
<p>Fallout season two comes to Amazon Prime Video on 17th December, 2025.</p>

<p><a href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> will release on Nintendo's Switch 2 console next year, following the previously Xbox exclusive game's arrival on PS5 back in April.</p>
<p>We also got an update on the DLC - The Order of Giants - which is coming to Xbox Series X/S, Steam, and PS5 in September.</p>

<p>After this, we had the standard mid-show rush where a lot of stuff was announced all in one go:</p>
<p><strong>Deadpool VR</strong> is coming to Meta Quest 3 (launching in December), <strong>World of Tanks</strong> gets its biggest update ever with World of Tanks 2.0 (coming in September), we got a new trailer for <strong>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</strong> ahead of its release date in 'early 2026' (which had some of the best music in the whole show), and then Ron Gilbert - creator of Monkey Island and Manic Mansion - took to the stage.</p>
<p><strong>Death by Scrolling brings back an industry legend</strong></p>
<p>It's a vertically-scrolling RPG-cum-roguelike that sees you struggling through purgatory to stay one step ahead of the Grim Reaper herself. There are five playable characters with their own unique perks, and the gameplay looks like a mix of Vampire Survivors, Enter the Gungeon, and classic Zelda. Yeah, I'm sold.</p>

<p><strong>Studio ZA/UM shows off its first game since Disco Elysium</strong></p>
<p>A cinematic trailer is never really going to be able to capture what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> is, or can be, but let's put that aside for now as we look at ZA/UM's new game, Zero Parades. A trailer shows off concept art, a very small bit of gameplay, and some voiceover that promises to be as moody and cerebral as the original game. Described as an 'espionage RPG', you play as Hershel Wilk - or CASCADE - who has been sent on a mysterious assignment. You'll need to make the acquaintance of various people at the end of history, each with their own agendas.</p><p>Of course, most of the original developers have left the studio at this point, so any tie to Disco Elysium is more down to developer name than shared DNA. It's too early to tell what this game will be like, but, from the trailer, it seems ZA/UM is at least keeping the <em>vibe</em> alive. It's all about "failing forward", apparently. But I won't make a comment about that.</p>
<p>You can wishlist the game now on Steam.</p>

<p>Next was another block of little trailers. There was <strong>Unbeatable</strong>, a stunning looking game where "music is illegal, and you do crimes". It's an anime-inspired rhythm game that is developed by D-CELL Games and published by PlayStack. It's coming to Steam and consoles in November. We also saw trailers for a new anime gacha game, <strong>Neverness to Everness</strong>, and a boss battle for <strong>Honor of Kings World</strong>. These were followed by a new trailer for Delta Force, which launches today on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<p><strong>Ninja Gaiden 4 gets a story trailer</strong></p>
<p>Platinum Games showed off a new trailer for Ninja Gaiden 4 that featured some bloody and intense gameplay, but also dipped a bit deeper into the story and lore of the new game. The most notable thing was probably the cybernetically enhanced skills that most of the ninja and enemies seemed to be rocking. But the real star of the show is the combat; fluid, bloody, and brutal. It looks good.</p>
<hr>
<p>Time for another sizzle reel. This time we got Cinder City and Time Takers. Both from NCsoft, this was our first-ever look at the gameplay for Time Takers, and it revealed a team-based third-person shooter which brings together a group of rogues from across time to fix their past. Standard. Think Overwatch x Apex Legends. Cinder City is your standard MMO fare, and lands on 21st October.</p>

<p><strong>Silent Hill f gets a brand-new trailer</strong></p>
<p>And just like that, we're in old Japan: alone, tiptoeing around some creepy wooden buildings. And then she's gone into some other dimension. Per the trailer, Suzie Yeung provides the English voice of the main character. And she wields a naginata to fend off the undead hordes that have come to drag her kicking and screaming into the underworld. It's all very Silent Hill, and we can learn more when we get our hands on the game on 25th September.</p>

<p>The teams at 11 Bit studios and Digital Sun have announced Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault - a follow-up to the wonderful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> - is heading into early access via Steam on 23rd October.</p>
<p>There'll be three biomes to explore on its initial debut, each including "unique enemies", so keep your wits about you. When players return from these biomes, there will be plenty of relics to then sell in Will's shop.</p>
<p>"Set prices, serve customers, customise your space, and experience most of the story - all built around an updated combat system featuring four main weapons, nearly 100 shop and dungeon perks, and a smoother, improved feel," the blurb reads.</p>

<p>Next up, we got confirmation that <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2'</strong>s Legacy of the Forge DLC will launch on 9th September. It's the second story DLC, and is included in the Expansion Pass, but will also be sold separately for base game owners. Also, Massive Monster and Devolver Digital's multi-million-selling cult simulator <strong>Cult of the Lamb</strong> got a massive update announcement in the form of Woolhaven: an ice-cold new paid expansion coming early 2026.</p>

<p><strong>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 finally shows signs of life</strong></p>
<p>The sequel to Troika Games' gothic cult classic RPG has been delayed and moved from studio to studio so often that you'd be forgiven for thinking it was long dead. But here, at Opening Night Live, it finally shows signs of life. Bertie knows far more about this than I do, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-action-than-rpg-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-struggles-to-convince-after-a-few-hours-play">so I will defer to him and his wonderful preview</a> to let you learn more.</p>

<p><strong>World of Warcraft: Midnight gets a classic Blizzard cinematic</strong></p>
<p>World of Warcraft got a new cinematic for its Midnight expansion, and it showed infamous shoe-disliker Xal'atath pulling up to the sunwell where the Blood Elves have been hanging around for over a decade. Lor'themar, married and happy, somehow didn't get his brains blown out live on the Gamescom stage.</p><p>Funnily enough Blizzard also announced <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-demon-hunter-specialization-revealed-embrace-the-void-with-devourer-378233">a new Demon Hunter specialisation</a>, and <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-allied-race-for-midnight-announced-haranir-can-be-druids-378237">an allied race</a>, but these weren't shown off during the show itself for some reason. Midnight is coming out at some point in 2026, so get excited to do awful DPS and not get invited to your friends' raids soon!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows"><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a><strong> delves into Grace Ashcroft's past</strong></p>
<p>Resident Evil: Requiem protagonist Grace Ashcroft got a bit of fleshing out in the latest trailer for Capcom's storied franchise, but there's still no sign of fan-favourite and series stalwart, Leon S. Kennedy. After receiving a phone call from a mysterious stranger, Grace Ashcroft and her mum panic and attempt to escape from the building they're staying in, only to witness a brutal murder as people chase the duo down.</p><p>It's all a bit of a teaser for the promise Capcom has made to return to the series' "overarching narrative", as we go a little closer to home and the origins of Raccoon City and the Umbrella Corp. There is more to come in my hands-on preview of the game, which drops tomorrow at noon.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on 27th February, 2026.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-game-announced-by-game-science-following-wukong-success"><strong>Black Myth: WuKong gets a sequel</strong></a><strong> in the form of Black Myth: Zhong Kui </strong></p>
<p>Black Myth: Zhong Kui will be an all-new follow-up, focused on the titular ghost-catching god who wanders between hell and earth. The developer clearly doesn't want to stray too far away from what has been successful in the past, as this newly-announced title will be another single-player action-RPG, rooted in Chinese folklore. If it ain't broke, as they say.</p>
<p>A brief teaser trailer was aired during Gamescom Opening Night Live, showing a couple of men hiding from a parade of mythical characters, including Zhong Kui himself, who was riding a giant tiger.</p>
<p>"Upon completing the journey with the Destined One, we now aspire to take a tentative first step - to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design," say the developers in a Q&amp;A.</p><p>"Zhong Kui came as a natural choice born of that aspiration and other contributing factors. We are confident that, in this new project, we can make refreshing changes, create new things, while taking a hard look at our past flaws and regrets. And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong: the westward journey won't end here."</p>
<p>Black Myth: Zhong Kui has no release date yet, but promises to launch on PC and consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Amazon have announced that Season 2 of Fallout will drop an episode a week, rather than all at once, which is how Season One arrived. The second season, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/20/fallout-season-2-confirmed-sony-paramount/">which was commissioned just a week after the first </a>had aired, finds Lucy (Ella Purnell), Ghoul (Walton Goggins), and Maximus (Aaron Moten) as they travel to New Vegas in an attempt to catch up with Lucy’s father, Hank (Kyle MacLachlan).</p>
<p>Moisés Arias returns as Lucy’s brother Norm and it will be interesting to see where his story goes, as at the end of Season 1, he discovered the real purpose of the Vaults.&nbsp; Barb, the Ghouls wife from his previous life, will also join the cast, and most excitingly, according to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32158505/?ref_=tt_eps_nx">IMDB, Dogmeat</a> will be in the show.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout – Season Two Teaser Trailer | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TsP09cZA7o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer reveals that fan favourite Mr. House will join the show, played by Justin Theroux, and he has a connection to Ghoul, or more specifically, Cooper Howard, the pre-war era actor who eventually became Ghoul. There is also a tease of a Deathclaw right at the end and lots of head popping gory action, just like the first series.</p>
<p>If you missed the first series, then we highly recommend it. You<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/11/fallout-season-1/">&nbsp;can check out my review here.</a> Season 3 has already been commissioned, so the story will continue.</p>

<p>The Fallout television series is canon within the franchise so Fallout 5, whenever that gets round to being made, may incorporate characters and locations from the show.</p>
<p>“Fallout is one of the greatest game series of all time,” said&nbsp; Jonathon Nolan during <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/02/fallout-tv-series-teased-by-amazon-studios-and-kilter-films/">the show’s 2020 announcement</a>. “Each chapter of this insanely imaginative story has cost us countless hours we could have spent with family and friends. So we’re incredibly excited to partner with Todd Howard and the rest of the brilliant lunatics at Bethesda to bring this massive, subversive, and darkly funny universe to life with Amazon Studios.”</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-launch-scheduled-for-exactly-one-year-after-pc-ps5/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> developer Game Science has announced Black Myth: Zhong Kui, the next game in its Black Myth series, coming to PC and "<em>mainstream console platforms"</em> sometime in the future, as a specific release date was not announced.</p>



<p>On the game's <a href="https://gamesci.cn/zhongkui">official website</a>, Game Science makes a few things clear to Black Myth: Wukong fans who potentially have a flurry of questions in their minds about Zhong Kui.</p>

<p>Firstly, Zhong Kui is the next game in Game Science's Black Myth series, but it is not a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong. As to why Game Science isn't just rushing to show off Black Myth: Wukong 2, in an FAQ for Zhong Kui, it wrote, "<em>Upon completing the journey with the Destined One, we now aspire to take a tentative first step - to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Zhong Kui came as a natural choice born of that aspiration and other contributing factors. We are confident that, in this new project, we can make refreshing changes, create new things, while taking a hard look at our past flaws and regrets.</em>"</p>



<p>The studio does also confirm that the choice to reveal Zhong Kui first doesn't mean it's the end for Wukong, as it closes by saying, "<em>And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong, the westward journey won't end here</em>."</p>



<p>But even though Game Science is debuting Zhong Kui before it shows off Wukong 2, it is also very clear in communicating that this game is very, very early in development. Regarding Zhong Kui's story, Game Science admits that it's "<em>not even done with the outline yet</em>," and also calls the project "<em>little more than an empty folder at this stage</em>." Which it explains is also why the debut trailer isn't gameplay, but instead just a CG short "<em>to let everyone know that a new project has kicked off</em>."</p>



<p>Even though by the sounds of that, we'll be waiting a long time to see any actual gameplay of Black Myth: Zhong Kui, it's exciting to get a look at what the studio is working on, and to know that there's more to come regarding Black Myth: Wukong. Hopefully, we'll have more concrete information soon on when Game Science is ready to release its next project.</p>
