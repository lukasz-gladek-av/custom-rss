		<p>As the walls of console exclusivity are torn down for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, and Square Enix prepares to release this sumptuous JRPG reimagining on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-will-launch-january-22nd-for-switch-2-and-xbox/">22nd January</a>, they’ve now given everyone the chance to preview the game on their non-PlayStation consoles with a demo.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE - One-Winged Angel Trailer | NSW2 &amp; XBOX" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AF1s32fc5NQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The content here will likely be quite familiar, as the demo features the first chapter of the game, the Mako Reactor 1 bombing mission. Playing the demo will create save data that can carry through to the main game, and will also reward you with&nbsp;bonus items “Revival Earrings” and “Survival Set”.</p>
<p>For Xbox gamers, head to the Xbox store on console, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-demo/9NFTWDJKGSBF">or here in a browser</a> to download the FF7 Remake Intergrade demo.</p>
<p>To check out the demo on Nintendo Switch, you can find it on the eShop on console and in browser – <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-2789733.html">see here for the UK store page.</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, Square Enix has created two regional blanket use codes that you can redeem at the Nintendo redemption page here: https://ec.nintendo.com/redeem/</p>
<ul>
<li><span dir="auto">EU/ANZ：D3GM3304HKPBB2VB</span></li>
<li><span dir="auto">NA/LATAM：D3GM3304HKQBB2VB</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure why they did that, but nice.</p>
<p>Either way, this gives players a great chance to see how the game holds up on Switch 2 – Series X will obviously be very similar to PS5 and Series S cut down from that, but Switch 2 being lower power and handheld asks for more compromises. As the Intergrade release, this includes both the 2020 original release, and the Intergrade side story that released and enhanced the game for PS5.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/06/final-fantasy-vii-remake-review/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Review</a>, Tuffcub said, <em>“An utter joy to play from start to finish, packed with memorable scenes, moustache-twirling baddies, and epic battles. The first part of Final Fantasy VII Remake isn’t just polished, it’s opulent.”</em></p>
<p>While in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/17/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-review-ps5/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Review,&nbsp;</a>Nic said, <em>“You should absolutely get Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. It’s easy to be critical and nitpick, but it’s worth remembering we’re looking at the DLC for one of the best and most-loved games of the PS4. The PS5 upgrade for Intergrade looks and feels incredible, and the chance to play as Yuffie is warmly received, especially when she completely changes the tone to something more light-hearted. However, the DLC isn’t quite perfect and, despite the filler, it feels very short for its price, especially if you’re not interested in the side missions.”</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/raiders-of-blackveil-out-now-early-access-pc-wombo-games/</link>
            <guid>1384786</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Raiders of Blackveil, a new co-op roguelite from Wombo Games, a studio founded by IO Interactive co-founder Janos Flösser, has launched into early access on PC. <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-co-founder-opens-new-studio-wombo-games-new-rogue-lite-raiders-of-blackveil-to-be-debut-project/">After announcing the studio</a> and Raiders of Blackveil back in April 2025, followed by the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/co-op-roguelite-raiders-of-blackveil-former-io-interactive-devs-early-access-release-date/">early access release date last month</a>, this new Copenhagen-based team has hit the ground running and already has its debut project in players' hands.</p>



<p>Wombo Games is composed of former IO Interactive and Square Enix developers who've worked on titles like Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Just Cause, and, of course, Hitman. It's clearly a very different kind of game compared to all of those titles, but it's always an exciting prospect to see seasoned developers go outside their comfort zone.</p>



<p>Raiders of Blackveil is a MOBA-inspired action RPG where you'll select your preferred champion and try to craft the best build possible across eight different classes, over 300 perks, and all of the best loot you can find. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Our journey to Early Access has been about one thing: refining the core experience and making sure the gameplay feels as it should,</em>" said Benjamin Flösser, executive producer at Wombo Games, in a press release. "<em>Now that this foundation is solid, we're excited to open Raiders of Blackveil to players once again. Early access is where Raiders of Blackveil truly starts to grow and we're looking forward to expanding Raiders of Blackveil in meaningful ways alongside players who have already shaped it so much</em>."</p>



<p>Wombo Games did not specify how long Blackveil is expected to remain in early access, but it did state that the game's 1.0 release will be out sometime in 2026.</p>

              <p>It’s pretty sad to see&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> already fading away just a couple of weeks on from its release. Slipping out of the charts already and failing to make much of an impact after an 18-year wait, it feels like something of a death knell for Samus’ 3D adventures. But if there’s any way to take my mind off the ennui this elicits, it’s to remember the NPCs talking at me while I was trying to play, and then perhaps be a bit glad. Although it could have been a lot worse: Astonishingly, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-want-me-to-build-rocket-skates-fans-uncover-30-mins-of-cut-metroid-prime-4-dialogue/">as <em>VGC</em> reports</a>, players have now discovered another 30 minutes of dialogue for its NPCs that was mercifully cut from the final game.</p> <p>Universally recognized as the game’s worst choice, the fourth installment in the splendid <em>Metroid Prime</em> franchise has incessant nattering from a range of NPCs, who seem to be there simply to irritate Samus as she tries to get on with her exploring, shooting, and scanning. Samus’ wordless responses start to feel like the most remarkable act of passive-aggression as her gabby companions refuse to take the hint. And it’s so incongruous! It’s incongruous to the entire <em>Metroid</em> franchise, given the usually solitary nature of the suited heroine, and it’s incongruous to&nbsp;<em>this game</em>, given its post-colony setting of ruins. Leave her be!</p>

 <p>So it really beggars belief that there was once an intention for there to be even more. YouTuber Bearborg, who will hopefully end up with more than 24 subscribers by the end of today, has uploaded all the conversations coming from the base camp during the game, which in the released version are mercifully limited to about seven-and-a-half minutes. There then follows a further 33 minutes of talking that was cut from the game, containing a whole lot of banality that’s supposed to be (scarequotes) “banter.”</p>  <p>The dialogue that’s been unearthed isn’t polished, with occasional moments of an old-school text-to-speech voice among the actors. All the performances are completely fine, and it was clearly intended to be background color when written and recorded, not plot-critical content. Thank goodness someone at some point realized this isn’t the right game for it. Were these comments optional extras in an RPG, or conversations from which you could walk away in an open-world, it would be harmless stuff. But the enforced nature of it all in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, amidst a series of games best enjoyed for their peace and quiet, remains such a weird choice.</p>

            <p>Larian is using generative AI as part of its game development process, but CEO Swen Vincke has confirmed the studio's new Divinity game won't include anything AI-generated.</p>
<p>Vincke discussed the topic of AI with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">announcement last week at The Game Awards of its new Divinity game</a>. It's the studio's next project following the hugely successful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which was a particularly expansive game.</p>
<p>As such, the studio is looking to AI with its follow-up, but Vincke confirmed it hasn't massively improved efficiency. Larian uses AI tools to explore ideas, expand on internal presentations, develop concept art, and write placeholder text, Bloomberg reported.</p>

<p>In Divinity, then, "everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves," said Vincke.</p>
<p>And while the use of AI has led to some pushback internally, Vincke believes "at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we're using it."</p>
<p>Larian is aiming to cut down on development time for Divinity, to complete production in less time than Baldur's Gate 3. AI is one potential tool, while another is developing Divinity's quest and storylines in parallel rather than linearly. The studio is also growing in size.</p><p>"I think a lot of founders have the same problem," said Vincke. "I have to be large, otherwise I can't make my video game. With growth suddenly comes a whole bunch of responsibilities that you didn't necessarily think you were ever gonna have, but you have them and then you make the best of them. Size exposes you to new problems that you couldn't imagine existed."</p>
<p>Back at GDC last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-larian-interview-swen-vincke-on-industry-woes-optimism-and-life-after-baldurs-gate-3">Vincke discussed the topic of AI with Eurogamer</a>. "So, we certainly don't see it as a replacement for developers," he said. "But we do see it as something that allows us to do more stuff."</p>
<p>He continued: "I do see it as an additional tool that you can put on top of the things that are in the game. And we're certainly doing experiments with that. But as I said, it's still far from being usable in that sense."</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-after-larians-big-the-game-awards-announcement-2017s-divinity-original-sin-2-receives-current-gen-upgrade-for-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">current gen upgrade was released for Larian's previous game Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, available now on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<p>Sound familiar?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has recently confirmed the worst kept secret of 2025 by finally showcasing Leon Kennedy in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>.</p>
<p>However, the new trailer also contains a few lines of dialogue from another off-screen character, and fans are convinced that they know who it is. Ahead of Leon's reveal, we hear from a supporting character over comms, who provides information while asking questions regarding the events of Requiem.</p>
<p>Although it might be tempting to say that this is Ingrid Hunnigan, the agent who supported Leon over comms during the events of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">6</a>, comparisons to voiceover work in the latter entry have fans convinced that it's actually Sherry Birkin.</p>
<p>Sherry last appeared in Resident Evil 6 and featured prominently in Jake Muller's campaign, crossing paths with Leon during a bio-terror incident in China. She was voiced by Eden Riegel, and comparisons between her scenes in Resident Evil 6 and the voiceover heard in the Requiem trailer reveal that the voices sound <em>incredibly</em> similar.</p>

<p>In addition to the voiceover work, a very brief shot during the Requiem trailer shows someone viewing information on a screen whilst wearing a microphone – someone with very distinctive blonde hair.</p>
<p>It would make a lot of sense if this were indeed the case. Sherry became close friends with Leon and Claire Redfield during the events of Resident Evil 2, and later became an agent under the Division of Security Operations (D.O.S.), an entity that also happens to employ Leon.</p>
<p>So it seems likely, then, that Sherry Birkin will feature in Requiem. Will it stop there, though, or can we also expect to see more classic characters make their grand return? Heck, if Leon's in the game, then it's reasonable to assume we'll also catch a glimpse of Ada Wong.</p>
<p>Either way, we'll find out for sure when Resident Evil Requiem launches on Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-goes-final-clearance-on-pixel-buds-pro-2-airpods-and-galaxy-buds-cant-compete-at-this-price-2000653813</link>
            <guid>1384729</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The second-generation Pixel Buds Pro were released last year in September. These minimal ANC buds retail for $229, but we just found a way to grab them for under $200.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/">Amazon just dropped the pair by 26%, bringing the overall price down to just $169.</a> You’re not just saving a nice $60 on your purchase, but also getting free delivery, as well as a two-month free trial of Audible with the order. This $169 price also matches what we saw during Black Friday, so if you missed grabbing the pair during the main event, now is a great time to pick them up. Additionally, all color options are discounted, so you’ve got quite a few options to choose from. However, note that only the earbuds change color; the charging case remains white.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solid ANC Capabilities</h2>
<p>Google calls these the most comfortable earbuds ever – and we don’t doubt that. These small, round buds fit nicely for all-day use, plus come with a twist-to-adjust stabilizer for an even more secure fit. The latter is great for workouts, especially when things get a bit intense, such as during cardio or boxing. You won’t have to worry about them slipping out every few minutes.</p>
<p>The Tensor A1 chip delivers premium sound for all your tracks, whether you’re listening to something bass-heavy or a theme song that’s a bit on the calmer side. Vocals, with every beat, come through clearly, like never before. Active Noise Cancellation is the highlight here, though. This mode uses Silent Seal 2.0 to block all unwanted background noise for a more immersive sound experience. ANC comes in handy when you really need to focus on a task in a chaotic setting, or just want to zone out with your favorite song for a bit. Of course, that doesn’t work for every situation. For when you do need to stay aware of what’s happening around you, there’s a Transparency Mode you can switch to. This mode lets some sound in, while still letting you enjoy quality audio. There’s a conversation detection feature, too. It pauses your music and automatically switches the earbuds to Transparency mode when you speak.</p>



<p>Calls get better, as well. That’s thanks to a combination of beamforming mics, wind-blocking mesh covers, and AI assistance. These come together to deliver your voice on the other end clearly, even when you’re travelling or sitting in a busy cafe. Speaking of on-the-go usage, the Buds Pro 2 are IPX4 water-resistant, so rain or a few water splashes by the pool won’t hurt.</p>
<p>Battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge gets you up to 30 hours of listening with ANC on. Transparency mode consumes less battery, so you can extend the overall listening time by mixing both.</p>
<p>All things considered, if you’ve been looking for a way to upgrade to the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2, now is a great time to make the move. These offer two listening modes, transparency and ANC. The sound quality is exceptional, and the built-in microphones make it easy to hop on calls, even in noisy settings. You’ll also appreciate the long battery life, which offers extra peace of mind during long commutes and off-road adventures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/">The current deal brings the price down to $169, making the upgrade much more affordable.</a> If you like the offer, consider grabbing these quickly, before the price goes back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Divinity Will Feature Turn-Based and Co-Op Gameplay, Developers Confirm]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-divinity-will-feature-turn-based-and-co-op-gameplay-developers-confirm/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Larian has confirmed that the upcoming Divinity game will be a turn-based title with co-op gameplay. </p>



<p>For those unaware, during The Game Awards 2025, Larian came with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-3-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprise announcement</a> for a new Divinity game, after saying that there were no current plans for Divinity: Original Sin 3. Days after the reveal, the developers have finally arrived with answers to the many questions players might have about the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-fans-of-baldur-s-gate-3-will-like-divinity">Fans of Baldur’s Gate 3 Will like Divinity </h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/divinity-turn-based-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Gamer</a>, Larian Studios founder Swen Vincke confirmed that Divinity will feature turn-based gameplay and multiplayer. Vincke first spoke about the criticism against Baldur’s Gate 3, stating that many players felt that it was Divinity Original Sin 3 as a lot of the DNA was brought to the title. However, if players liked Baldur’s Gate 3, they will enjoy this one as well, as “it’s a turn-based RPG”, and it’s got co-op multiplayer.</p>



<p>That clears the confusion about Divinity’s gameplay style, which many players were curious about after dropping the ‘Original Sin’ from the title. Now, players want to see how developers will innovate in the turn-based genre, without incorporating Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules. They have the Original Sin series’s gameplay structure to fall back on, but it will be exciting to see how they can improve on that. </p>







<p>In other news, Divinity Original Sin 2 has received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-original-sin-2-gets-free-current-gen-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free current-gen update</a> for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2.

            <p>Larian CEO Swen Vincke has confirmed the studio's next game, Divinity, will be a turn-based RPG, describing the game as "us unleashed".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">Divinity was revealed at last week's The Game Awards</a>, following an elaborate stunt with a demonic statue in the desert. It will be the next game from the studio after the huge success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which was similarly turn-based.</p>
<p>"This is going to be us unleashed, I think," Vincke told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>. "It's a turn-based RPG featuring everything you've seen from us in the past, but it's brought to the next level."</p>

<p>Divinity will also be an early-access release, Vincke confirmed, just like Baldur's Gate 3, though it's unknown when this could start.</p>
<p>Vincke explained the studio had originally planned to work with Wizards of the Coast once again on a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, but the developers weren't excited about it.</p>
<p>"Conceptually, all of the ingredients for a really cool game were there except the hearts of the developers," he said.</p>
<p>That's why the studio is now returning to Divinity, the franchise on which the studio is built. Previous games in the series had real-time combat, though the two Original Sin games were turn-based, leading to speculation among fans as to what this new Divinity game will feature.</p><p>"Baldur's Gate 3 was a good game and I'm proud of it, but I think this one is going to be way better," said Vincke. He noted the tabletop systems of Dungeons &amp; Dragons were difficult to translate into a video game. "Here, we're making a system that's made for a video game. It's much easier to understand."</p>
<p>What's more, the studio will be using a new game engine and is doubling down on cinematic storytelling. The developers also want to expand on the breadth of storytelling, too.</p>
<p>"The idea is that when you talk to fellow journalists about the game, you'll have completely different stories," Vincke said. "We're doing a couple of things that you haven't seen in RPGs before, I think."</p>
<p>Following the announcement of Divinity at The Game Awards, Larian has released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-after-larians-big-the-game-awards-announcement-2017s-divinity-original-sin-2-receives-current-gen-upgrade-for-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">current gen upgrade of Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>In what's become a tradition around the holidays, <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em>, the third whodunnit murder mystery film in Rian Johnson's <em>Knives Out </em>world, is on Netflix after a short theatrical run. This time around, Daniel Craig's utterly charming Foghorn Leghorn private detective Benoit Blanc is tasked with solving an impossible crime where a priest was killed inside his church. The suspects: his congregation. Dun dun dun! However, what brings us here isn't the whodunnit of it all, but the how done it. More specifically, how the film handles religion. And what better way to do that than have Aftermath's resident expert, Riley, chat with <em>Midnight Mass</em> defender Isaiah about how the film handles theology.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHM1K1JByBI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery | Official Teaser | Netflix"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Oh my gosh, we've never argued about <em>Midnight Mass</em>. For another blog!</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>We'll throw down in the free marketplace of ideas on that one! So, I threw down the gauntlet weeks ago after we had a bit of a side chat about <em>Midnight Mass</em> and how I think it holds up years later with my own curiosity for how you'd feel about <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em> after I came out of theaters to watch it. I guess to start off, with that as its premise, did you have any reservations about how the film would handle religion?</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I  did! I have a lot of very smart friends who were praising it ahead of it coming to Netflix, so I had high hopes. I think big picture I wasn't as "wow"ed by it as some of them, but I think a lot of that is that I like the <em>Knives Out</em> movies fine, but they never really blow me away. When Blanc first shows up at the church, I was worried the movie's big conflict was going to be "believer" versus "non-believer," which I personally find to be a bit of a tired topic in secular media about religion, even though I totally get that it's one that's surely on the minds of a lot of creators. </p><p>I think <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em> does use religion to provide an interesting twist on the standard whodunnit formula, where about halfway through it injects a bit of theology into things: is solving the murder "justice" from a theological perspective? How should we treat people who do harm? These are the sorts of questions that don't really come up when religion is just used as set dressing, so I really appreciated that.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>I feel you on that. When I first watched it, I was kind of bracing myself for Blanc, as a gay man with an unmistakable southern accent, to have a huge axe to grind about religion when he first hit the scene like <a href="https://youtu.be/yXNQrku6Sak?t=68&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kermit the Frog in The Muppets.</u></a> While sure, he definitely made his qualms about religion known, he didn't harp on them or let them guide the film's direction toward a tropey religion vs atheism diatribe. And because of that, I think the film stands out from the others as a more personable one where we're wrestling with themes of justice and grace, and where one might fall in a murder mystery like this one. In rewatching the movie yesterday, one scene that spoke out to me was when Josh Brolin's Monsignor Jefferson Wicks comes to blows (literally) with Josh O'Connor's Father Jud Duplenticy.</p><p>For context, Wicks is kind of an asshole pastor who weaponized religion as a means to bully new parishioners by calling out their insecurities in his sermons. He winds up dead in the movie, kicking everything off. Jud is a new pastor at his church charged with helping prevent its dwindling numbers. Anywho, they have a whole falling out when Jud calls out Wicks for his hateful hazing of everyone in his congregation and his galvanizing of himself as a warrior of Christ. Wicks, after punching Jud in the gut, says, "I'm the world. You're the church." When Jud instinctively recoils in a defensive boxer's stance (because he used to be one), Wicks applauds him. His overall point is that anger lets folks (i.e., the church) take back the ground they lost to protect themselves and that the world ultimately wants to destroy "us."</p><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Your version of love and forgiveness is a sop. It's going along to get along with modernity, not wanting to offend this garbage world. Meanwhile, they destroy us." Granted, he goes on to define those seeking to destroy them as "feminist Marxist whores," but his sentiment is that the kind of rage-baiting algorithmic outrage that we see in social media, reflected in his sermons, is the only way for the church to buck back. It's something the film spends the rest of its runtime wrestling with. But I wanted to ask, what did you think of that scene?</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I think the movie touches on, if never fully dives into, a real tension we're seeing in a lot of denominations these days, or maybe accurately a tension we're seeing politics inject into denominations. As faith gets co-opted into our current American version of the Right, we're seeing a growing presence of a kind of aggressive, hateful, "<a href="https://uscatholic.org/articles/202505/how-a-faulty-vision-of-christian-masculinity-harms-us-all/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noopener noreferrer">crisis of masculinity</a>" version of Catholicism through, say, JD Vance and co. And I'd argue we saw a similar thing in Protestantism with the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Calvinism?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noopener noreferrer">Young, Restless, Reformed</a>&nbsp;movement that gave us (and somehow keeps giving us)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/podcasts/the-rise-and-fall-of-mars-hill/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Driscoll</a>&nbsp;and his ilk. Wicks and his congregation touch on that: he feeds on insecurity and exclusion, and on this idea of Christian persecution that we're seeing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-eradicates-anti-christian-bias/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump play into</a>. </p><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a powerful message for people, especially men, who feel done wrong by, and we see it resonate with Wicks' congregation even as it drives other people away. And I think it's interesting how Father Jud isn't simply the alternate view--he also struggles with violence and domination and a desire for conflict, and he works through that in the movie in an arc I don't think we see in a lot of movies about faith. When these ideas first came up I thought maybe the movie would get into, say, Christian nationalism or something, and I appreciate that it stays focused on its own little corner of the world, even as I think it had a chance to go bigger.</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>We've lightly touched on it earlier, but I wanted to ask when it comes to movies tackling theology, what are your icks? Or at least what are pitfalls you've seen countless times that turn you off to them?</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I think way too often religion is just set dressing or a stand-in for "the bad guy," especially in video games. And here's where I have to throw my standard disclaimer: despite being a queer trans man, I have managed to live a life where religion has never had the power to hurt me; I've always been able to leave a faith space that felt unwelcoming or unsafe, and I always want to stay aware that that's a privilege a lot of people don't have, and I would never begrudge anyone having a hostile view of faith as a result. </p><p>But that kind of "outside looking in" view, I think, leaves a lot of really interesting stories about faith on the table, and simplifies into an institution something that is really complex and personal for people. I think stories about faith also often boil down to stories about blind adherence--this is one of the reasons I really didn't like&nbsp;<em>Midnight Mass</em>--and that too really misses space for complexity to me. By making&nbsp;<em>Wake Up Dead Man</em>'s antagonist and protagonist both people of faith, it lets the movie wrangle with loftier, more interesting topics than just "is God real?" or "are religious people bad?" that I think we see in a lot of media.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>I think too, the film's showcasing of perspectives with memory—something that's become a signature of Johnson—where we see similar events play out from different points of view, depending on who tells it, sings better here than the other <em>Knives Out</em> movies. Thinking back on Grace's desecration of the church and how at first it had her looking like a primordial evil made flesh. A belief Wicks' church perpetuates with remembering her solely as the "harlot whore." I felt that the film bringing back that visual motif of events from different emotional memories played against Benoit's more concrete video evidence of events and recounting did a good enough job of hewing to what faith means to different people and how at times that can warp depending on how one can personally justify it to themselves.</p><p>Another scene I wanted to bring up, which is my favorite for how it derails the whole game of the murder mystery, is Jud's call with Louise. It's pretty much when the momentum of the film at its halfway point gets really close to stringing along a path to finding a culprit, but, to Benoit's chagrin, it's railroaded by Louise asking Jud to pray for her. More specifically, to pray for her and her mother, who is in hospice, and they had a falling out that she doesn't want to be the last thing she remembers. It's a pretty arresting scene because it goes from being played up with laughs with how you can call a business for pertinent information, and the person on the other end wants to shoot the breeze. But I felt that whiplash, and Jud's attentiveness to hear her story was something special.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><p>It felt especially targeted to me with the passing of my aunt recently, who was more about religion than I was, but I couldn't find the heart to tell her that. Still, it's a scene that felt so sincere in the rest of the film's kind of quick-wittedness, and it really spoke to how it wasn't taking religion simply as set dressing. That the whole having grace to meet people where they are with Louise and with how the film's climax doesn't do the routine reveal of the culprit was a neat way to take the murder mystery premise and flip it on its head by letting religion take the reins on how to approach this otherwise cliched story.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Yeah, I've seen a lot of talk about that scene. It's really startling; it stops the momentum of the murder mystery cold, and while it could have been played for laughs, instead it's really sincere and, to me, lovely. I have a friend who's a Unitarian minister, and when he first got ordained I remember us having a conversation about what he should do when people stop him in his clerical collar and ask for a blessing or something, especially when they think he's Catholic. And we both decided that in most cases it was just a lovely thing to do, and a good he could do in the world and for folks if the situation was appropriate. And I think that scene gets at this, a kind of nudge to remind us we're all capable of offering grace to each other, no matter what else is going on. And that theme of course bookends the movie too.</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> I think, in the grand scheme of things, it's pretty messed up that <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em> is <a href="https://x.com/waystarroyhoe/status/1999925979364692027?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">yet another Netflix movie that was in theaters for a wink</a> before being carted onto streaming with the added bonus of its <a href="https://x.com/rianjohnson/status/1999948463249977824?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">subtitling not being entirely accurate</a>. Being one of the fortunate few who braced the Chicago winter to go to the only theater that had the film, the whole experience seeing it (on a Sunday, no less) gave off the vibe of going to a church that might not have that many members but still felt like it had its own quirkiness in that it was at a mall with laser tag on the bottom level. But from my first watch, it gave me the impression that it wasn't gonna be looked on as fondly as the others since they felt like bigger, more extravagant films where its cast wasn't used as much as an afterthought. It also doesn't help that it feels like Johnson has had to do all the film's promotion single-handedly, adding to its more indie feel compared to the others.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">lol the actual line he says is “telling the truth can be a bitter herb” but I love this so much I almost don’t want to tell Netflix (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/DrewMcWeeny?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">@DrewMcWeeny</a> for catching it) <a href="https://t.co/SIjUhwzKmh?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/SIjUhwzKmh</a></p>— Rian Johnson (@rianjohnson) <a href="https://twitter.com/rianjohnson/status/1999948463249977824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 13, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>However, upon rewatching it, I dig it more because it has that kind of spirit of grassroots, word-of-mouth praise that churches have had to bear in spreading the good word, regardless of the circumstances that limit them. As the godson of a pastor who got voluntold to help out with those sorts of things, its a kind of hustle that I can appreciate the film for more with it also handling religion in a more thoughtful way than it just being a blanket antagonist or something to feel you have to laugh at when folks like Jud act hard-headed and don't "play along" with the case the way we expect characters to. </p><p>While I don't see Netflix reversing course on how it handles its big movie releases in theaters, what with all its recent <a href="https://aftermath.site/netflix-games-wb-sale/" rel="noreferrer">goings on</a>, I hope that <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em> isn't going to be the last time cinema engages with religion in a way that's not tongue-in-cheek. We've seen with films like <a href="https://aftermath.site/conclave-ending/" rel="noreferrer"><em>Conclave</em></a><em> </em>that there is genuine interest in this kind of film. Because honestly, it's not cool to be like "religion bad" when it's community building and wrestling with the meaning we take from the stories we tell as a point of value. Case in point: my mom named me after her favorite book in the Bible, which she always turned to when she fell on hard times.

			<p>ARC Raiders developer Embark Studios has just <a href="https://arcraiders.com/it/news/whats-coming-in-the-december-update">put out the game's first winter update</a> with Cold Snap, an update that freezes over the Rust Belt and adds a new survival layer you need to be concerned about every time you step out into a new run. The new update also adds a new Raider Deck coming later this month, and a new event for players to dig into.</p>



<p>Winter in the Rust Belt means that now, beyond having to worry about other players and killer robots, you have to worry about other players, killer robots, and potentially freezing to death. You'll have to keep warm and move fast to ensure that you don't wind up out in the Belt, unable to see because of the cold, your feet freezing, and frostbite starting to set in.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>There's also a new event with this update, the Flickering Flames event. It's a particularly special time of year where Sperenzans are huddling together for warmth and being thankful for what little they do have, like a warm candle and some fresh berries. </p>



<p>While out on runs, you'll be tasked with gathering Candleberries for festive centrepieces and finding anything that can help make your underground shelter a little brighter and warmer. Plus, collecting as many candleberries and sources of light and warmth as you can will help you earn new cosmetics, weapons, raider tokens, new items, and more when you return with your bounty of berries.</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/">According to what we know of the roadmap</a> for ARC Raiders, this is the final big update of the year for ARC Raiders, and all in all, it seems like a more than fruitful update to cap off 2025 with. ARC Raiders may have only walked away from The Game Awards with one win for Best Multiplayer game, but it arguably won the back-half of the year overall, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-best-selling-game-on-steam-november-2025/">as it skyrocketed in sales and concurrent player counts</a> since it launched at the end of October.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is undeniably one of the biggest games of 2025. It was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/">the most-searched video game according to Google's wrap-up of the year</a>, and it didn't even release until 2025's final months. Amidst the <a href="https://wccftech.com/consumers-dont-care-about-ai/">controversy that has surrounded it</a>, it's simply impressive to see what Embark Studios has accomplished with its latest title.</p>



<p>Now, though, the big question is whether Embark can sustain this level of success, and even grow from it, going into 2026. ARC Raiders wouldn't be the first, nor the last, multiplayer game to make a big splash in its launch window and fail to find its legs a little further down the line. We'll see how it looks a year from now, but for now, you can cozy up with its new update.

            <title><![CDATA[Divinity Is a Turn-Based RPG, Will Be ‘Way Better’ Than Baldur’s Gate 3, Says Larian’s Swen Vincke]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/</link>
            <guid>1384693</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Larian Studios went big with the reveal of Divinity at The Game Awards 2025. With the help of host Geoff Keighley, they teased the news with a real-life statue placed in the Mojave Desert. A European trademark <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-divinity-game-is-likely-that-mystery-tga-demonic-statue-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the initially mysterious teaser was related to a new Divinity game, and then the trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped at the event</a>.</p>



<p>However, the developer remained silent on what it would be. They only mentioned that it wouldn't require playing Original Sin 2, which spurred speculation that Larian was making an action RPG this time around.</p>



<p>That's now been officially dispelled by Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke. <a href="http://bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview with Bloomberg</a>, Vincke confirmed that Divinity will be a turn-based roleplaying game, just like the studio's last three games including their most famous one, Baldur's Gate 3, which reportedly surpassed 20 million units sold to date. The head of the studio also reckons that it will surpass the award-winning game by far:</p>



<p><em>This is going to be us unleashed, I think. It's a turn-based RPG featuring everything you've seen from us in the past, but it's brought to the next level. Baldur's Gate 3 was a good game and I'm proud of it, but I think this one is going to be way better. Here, we are making a system that's made for a videogame. It's much easier to understand. [...] The idea is that when you talk to fellow journalists about the game, you'll have completely different stories. We're doing a couple of things that you haven't seen in RPGs before, I think.</em></p>



<p>Despite the incredible ambition, Larian is still hoping to get this game made quicker, with Vincke mentioning that a three or four year cycle is 'much healthier' than six years. That said, as we had suspected, early access is still in the plans for Divinity, but it's not likely to happen in 2026. This means a 2027 early access launch, with a possible 2028-2029 full release, which would align with the typical five to six years of development.</p>



<p>One way the team is trying to accelerate the development progress is by utilizing generative AI tools. Although the game itself won't include any directly AI-generated content, they are using AI to write placeholder text, quickly develop concept art, or make internal PowerPoint presentations. As of now, Larian employs 530 people across its seven offices, located in Asia, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-opens-new-office-in-warsaw-to-help-make-its-two-very-ambitious-new-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Europe</a>, and North America. Additionally, the developer is creating a new engine that aims to improve streaming performance, hoping to avoid troublesome situations such as the titular city of Baldur's Gate 3 having to be split in two (and still running very poorly).</p>



<p>In other Divinity news, Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-has-launched-ps5-switch-2-xbox-series-s-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now has native PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2 versions</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This will contain spoilers for Fallout Season 1. Read at your own discretion.</em></p><p><em>Fallout Season One</em> ended with Hank MacLean (Kyle MacLachlan) traveling to the city limits of the post-apocalyptic New Vegas, with Lucy (Ella Purnell) and Cooper Howard (Walton Goggins) in pursuit.</p><p>It was a cliffhanger engineered for fan service. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-new-vegas" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a> is one of the series' most acclaimed entries, so returning to the Mojave Wasteland in <em>Fallout Season Two</em> would be an easy avenue for gamer nostalgia. It also led to an excited fan base wondering if the next season would answer lingering questions or definitively state which of the game's different endings were canon.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-season-two-lucy-and-new-vegas-sign.jpg?itok=QZMIrIS0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="900" height="600">

  </picture><p>For me, however, I was worried. The secret sauce behind Jonathan Nolan and Kilter Films' adaptation is that it told its own stories, with all creative decisions being in conversation with the rich lore and history found in Bethesda's iconic series. So when I saw that distinct rusted city of sin, I was ready for the next season to be a lot of tedious walk-on cameos and unnecessary story cul-de-sacs.</p><p>Thankfully, that is not the case. <em>Fallout Season Two</em> continues to build on what came before, elevating the setting's dark satire, deepening character dynamics, and embodying one of <em>New Vegas</em>' most enduring messages about human nature.</p><h2><em>Fallout Season Two</em> – Odds Favor The House</h2><p>In <em>Fallout Season One</em>, it was revealed that the nuclear war that ended the world wasn't the decision of nations, but by the executives of the largest companies in the world. Punctuated by <em>Fallout's</em> most iconic line, “war never changes.”</p><p>It has always been one of <em>Fallout's</em> boldest central messages. Despite being in an alternate world full of laser guns, super science, and robot helpers, the reasons why people kill each other remain the same. National pride. Religious dogma. Or in this world's case: the machinations of capitalism.</p><p>This critical eye towards unchecked corporate reach continues in <em>Fallout Season Two</em> with Robert House. While House is an established character from <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, it is nearly impossible not to draw parallels between his portrayal in the show and more contemporary corporate giants. He is the head of a massive <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-us-sales-drop-nearly-3-year-low-november-despite-launch-cheaper-versions-2025-12-11/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">robotics company</a>, a self-styled genius that rejects emotion and sentiment, and is working on neural implants via <a href="https://medreview.odus.princeton.edu/2025/06/23/the-advancements-and-ethical-concerns-of-neuralink/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">unethical experimentation</a>.</p><p>At one point early in the season, House states that he gained the consent of the world to go forward with these projects, explaining that every dollar spent on his work was a “vote” for him. It is a blunt criticism of the neoliberal market and a look at the horrifying world being built on the ashes of the old world. It's a parallel that could easily come off as hackneyed, but it aligns with the source material effortlessly.</p><p>This parallel persists in <em>Fallout Season Two</em> with the ongoing Vault-Tec storyline. Time and again, the show exposes the false meritocracy of the world's capitalist system. The lives preserved by the Vaults were not the best and brightest, but the wealthy and their sycophantic followers. This leads to darkly humorous moments where white-collar suits face the cruel reality they have enabled.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>Fallout Season Two</em> – New Vegas, Characters, and Canon</h2><p>Fallout Season Two also deftly navigates the thematic trappings of <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> with grace. As mentioned before in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/fallout-season-one-review-welcome-to-apocalypse" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">my review</a>, Cooper Howard started as a dark subversion of the cowboy, a righteous Lone Ranger-type hero worn down into a sadistic murderer. However, this cruelty was all in service of Howard's one driving motivation: finding the cryo pods containing his wife and daughter.</p><p>With Howard now wandering the Mojave Wasteland, parallels can be drawn to <em>Fallout: New Vegas'</em> protagonist: the Courier. This player-controlled character goes on a Western-themed adventure, a vengeance quest against someone who left them for dead. But through their journey, the Courier brings some form of law or stability to the groups and places they encounter. While Howard has grown callous and cynical about the power of one person's choices, the Courier demonstrated just how much difference one person can make.</p><p>In a notable story development, it appears Howard is vindicated. Despite all of the fan theories, <em>Fallout Season Two</em> sidesteps addressing the “canon” ending of <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. A version of the game's events still happened, but were swiftly upended by the disruptive tactics of <em>Season One's</em> villains; a knock-on effect of the bombing of Shady Sands.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-season-two-hank-in-suit.jpg?itok=HYlRhV8g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="900" height="377">

  </picture><p>In the most cynical reading of the show, nothing the Courier did mattered. The Mojave is still a lawless wasteland. The various factions, like Caesar's Legion and the NCR, are still fighting and killing each other like they were before. War never changes.</p><p>Except that reading ignores one of <em>New Vegas'</em> most powerful final messages. At the end of the game's final expansion, <em>Lonesome Road</em>, a major character re-frames the haunting line in a new light. “If war doesn't change, men must change, and so must their symbols.”</p><p>It is a line that affirms the powerful sway of ideology and belief on human nature, and it resonates throughout <em>Fallout Season Two</em>. While the world is scarred by House and Vault-Tec, these actions are of the old guard. At key moments, idealism and conviction are what help the main cast question and even challenge these institutional ideas. It is seen everywhere with Howard's rekindled humanity and Lucy's optimism being refined.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-season-two-maximus-in-desert.jpg?itok=Pf2vRMfj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="900" height="600">

  </picture><p>This doesn't mean that <em>Fallout Season Two</em> doesn't indulge in some fan service. The show is peppered with familiar iconography and locations. There is pure visceral joy to see certain towns fully realized as actual sets. And it is a thrill to finally see Deathclaws on screen.</p><p>But, despite the temptation for hollow nostalgia, the focus of <em>Fallout Season Two</em> is where it needs to be: on its characters, and how they change through the roads they walk.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p>You don’t have to sacrifice your entire workspace just to fit a traditional tower PC on your desk. If space matters to you, switching to a compact yet capable mini PC can make a huge difference. The ACEMAGIC Mini PC is designed for students, professionals, and everyday users who want strong performance without clutter.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6421/"> It is currently available at a deep discount on Amazon in which you can save as much as $240 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6421/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Big Performance in a Small Footprint</h2>
<p>Despite its ultra-compact design, the ACEMAGIC Mini PC delivers impressive power. Inside this tiny chassis, there are a couple options for memory and storage. The cheapest option—housing 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage—normally runs for $459, but is right now down 28% to just $329. You can choose to upgrade to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. That one is normally $499, but has come down to just $429 (14% discount). Both these options come with an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor with integrated graphics, though you can bump up to the upgraded AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS processor for just $519 total. That’s down by 32% from $759 (also comes with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage).</p>
<p>If you find you don’t have enough space for your needs, storage is expandable up to 4TB with an additional compatible SSD.</p>
<p>This hardware combination is well suited for everyday computing tasks such as web browsing, office work, creative projects, and even light gaming. Multitasking feels smooth thanks to the included 32GB of memory, which helps applications run quickly and efficiently. The system comes preloaded with Windows 11 Pro, allowing you to get started immediately without dealing with complicated setup steps or extra software installations.</p>



<p>For display capabilities, the mini PC supports impressive visuals. Using its USB4 Type-C or DisplayPort 2.0 output, it can deliver up to 8K resolution at 60Hz. There is also an HDMI slot available which is capable of up to 4K at 60Hz. All together, these enable you to connect three monitors at the same time for increased productivity or multitasking.</p>
<p>The ACEMAGIC Mini PC includes built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2, ensuring stable internet access and easy pairing with accessories like keyboards, mice, and headphones. You’ll also find two USB 3.2 ports on the front with four more on the back for even more peripheral options.</p>
<p>Thermal management has not been overlooked either. Dual centrifual fans and a stacked fin array design help keep internal temperatures under control. The independent aluminum SSD heatsink can disperse heat quietly, allowing you to maintain stable read and write speeds during extended use.</p>
<p>If you need a full-featured computer that takes up minimal space, the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is a compelling option. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6421/">With its current discount of up to 32%, the price of the highest tier model drops to just $519 for a limited time.</a> For anyone upgrading, downsizing, or building a clean, efficient workstation at home or the office, this mini PC may be just what you’re looking for.</p>

<li><strong>Green letters</strong> are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li><strong>Yellow letters</strong> are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>



<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>Check out the steps below to learn how to download the Bully Online mod on your PC. </p>



<ul>
<li>Players need to have Bully v1.200&nbsp;installed without mods, and it shouldn’t be a pirated copy of the game. </li>



<li>Then, players should download the latest version of derpy’s script loader and drag the ASI file into the game’s folder. The player should also ensure they have an ASI loader installed (such as&nbsp;dinput8.dll&nbsp;from Ultimate ASI Loader).</li>



<li>The players should download the latest&nbsp;Bully Online Launcher Pack from this <a href="https://swegta.com/online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>. </li>

<li><span>Players can only use mods that change files in the&nbsp;World.</span>img&nbsp;/&nbsp;World.dir and TXD folder. Apart from that, SilentPatchBully, One Percent Better Project, and focus.asi are the only other accepted mods. If any other mods are found, the player risks being banned. </li>

            <title><![CDATA[Hollow Knight: Silksong Sea of Sorrow DLC Release Period, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow-dlc-release/</link>
            <guid>1384672</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong was excruciating, but everyone is hoping the Sea of Sorrow DLC release doesn’t take years. This guide has the latest on the expansion’s release period and more.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-shadow-drop-release-was-callous-says-hell-is-us-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> finally rewarded everyone in 2025. The breathtaking Metroidvania challenged the patience of many, but piqued the interest of millions. The indie title has won awards, recouped millions in sales, and Team Cherry has already revealed the game’s first expansion.</p>



<p>As long as things go to plan, the wait won’t be anywhere near as long, which would be the Team Cherry on top of the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow-dlc-releasing">When Is Hollow Knight: Silksong Sea of Sorrow DLC Releasing?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Please stick to this! Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Cherry has told everyone to expect the Hollow Knight: Silksong Sea of Sorrow DLC in 2026 and won’t disclose any further details until then.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming wishes it had more news—as the team is looking forward to more Silksong content just as much as you—but developer Team Cherry is likely aware of the pressure that comes with the release date for new Hollow Knight content.</p>



<p>Silksong descending into limbo for years was painful for everyone. It must have been just as torturous for Team Cherry, knowing the developer probably wanted to just release the content and end everyone’s wait. The wait ended up being worth it, and Silksong is one of 2025’s Game of the Year contenders.</p>



<p>This means there’s even more pressure on Sea of Sorrows (and any subsequent DLC) to be just as good. Don’t be alarmed at the sight of the word, but if the content ends up being bigger than Team Cherry plans (like Silksong), a <em>delay </em>to 2027 may not be out of the question. </p>



<p>So keep your hopes in check until further notice.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Save your Rosary Beads. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Sea of Sorrow DLC is a free expansion for Hollow Knight: Silksong owners and comes as part of the full package, and the content looks to be “nautically” themed.</strong></p>



<p>To be clear, Team Cherry could easily have charged money for whatever expansion or new content was coming the game’s way. Sea of Sorrow will do no such thing. It’s a free expansion and adds even greater value to Silksong’s already alluring and generous price tag.</p>



<p>Check out the dev’s official words on the content:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“New areas, bosses, tools, and more! Hornet’s adventures continue in our nautically themed expansion, coming free for all players next year.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the Sea of Sorrow DLC trailer.</p>

During a campaign or sandbox playthrough, you will establish multiple towns, each on a unique mountain with its own traits. All your towns co-exist in symbiosis, creating a trading network, which you can then adjust to your needs by revisiting already developed settlements. The Kingdom of Laysara has to be rebuilt!</p><p>Note: <em>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</em> is a pure city building experience solely focused on the economy, resource <a title="Genres > Management [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, and surviving despite the inhospitable environment. Therefore, the game doesn’t feature combat or any other military aspects.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Build on a Mountain</strong> – Each mountain comes with a new set of challenges. Mounts differ in shapes, vegetation zone layouts, resource availability, and weather conditions. Sometimes you will have plenty of room for farming in green lowlands, sometimes you will need to rely on breeding and extracting valuable minerals from regions dangerously close to peak glaciers. If you find yourself in dire need of a certain resource, you can always try to establish a trading route with another town.</li><li><strong>Deal With Avalanches</strong> – One of the ever-present dangers you will have to deal with are mighty avalanches. You can’t stop them, but you can take precautions and be prepared. Afforest the key areas to create natural barriers, build artificial ones to redirect rushing masses of snow, or trigger the avalanche early, while it’s still manageable. Create a deliberate and reliable strategy and you might even be able to use the power of snow to your advantage; fail to do so and find your city buried and devastated!</li><li><strong>Craft a Transport Network</strong> – So, transporting goods is easy, right? Well, not if your destination lies on the other side of the mountain, a few hundred meters higher, behind cliffs, ridges, canyons, and rivers. You will need to create a vast, complex transport network consisting of roads, bridges, and shafts to ensure reliable delivery chains. As demand for resources will grow alongside the town’s population, always look for opportunities to optimize your transportation network, be it by building paved roads, using more advanced lifting constructions, or aiding your carriers with glamorous yaks.</li><li><strong>Raise a Summit Temple</strong> – If you manage to endure all mountain dangers, build a network of efficient production chains, and satisfy all needs of your people, there is only one more thing to be done: conquering the mountain peak! To succeed in this great endeavor you’ll need to reach the summit and establish safe routes for your carriers to bring in enormous amounts of building resources, but beware! Weather at this height is as deadly as ever. The final effect is well worth the effort though, as raising the summit temple is an act of total triumph of human courage (and your logistics skills!) over the elements.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Laysara: Summit Kingdom | PC &amp; Console Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NRSQJTfE5Pw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/laysara-summit-kingdom-launches-february-27-2026]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 and Divinity developer Larian has confirmed that it uses generative AI in its development processes, but not necessarily in the way you might think.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to Bloomberg</a>, Larian boss Swen Vincke said its developers use generative AI tools for things like exploring new game ideas, developing concept art, creating placeholder text, and for PowerPoint presentations. Vincke said, "I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we're using it." That said, Bloomberg reported that there has been "some pushback at Larian."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Divinity Will Be Better Than Baldur’s Gate 3 “On All Fronts” Says Larian CEO</p>
      </div>
<p>He also confirmed that the new Divinity game will not have any AI-generated content in it. "Everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves," he said.</p><p>None of this is new or surprising, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">Vincke said many months ago that Larian was using machine learning systems for a variety of functions</a>, including "tasks that nobody wants to do."</p><p dir="ltr">"For an RPG developer, what you really want is something that helps with reactivity to agency," he said. "So, permutations that you did not foresee, reactions to things that the player has done, in the world, they will certainly augment the gameplay experience," Vincke said of using machine learning to help generate new gameplay elements.</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke, like many in the industry before him, also said he is aware of "red flags" pertaining to the use of generative AI in game development.</p><p>Some people have legitimate fears of machine learning and AI systems stealing their work or taking their jobs. However, Vincke said Larian is hiring more people, not fewer, thanks to new technologies. This is what others,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969"> like EA CEO Andrew Wilson and Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick</a>, have predicted.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's always going to be the people that are going to make a difference," Vincke said. "And so for us, it's super clear that we're investing heavily into the team and the human touch that's being added to that."</p><p dir="ltr">With more automation, human workers are freed up to create more, which in turn leads to the possibility of making "more complex things," Vincke said.</p><p dir="ltr">"When complexity goes up, things start getting really interesting. So it's fair to say that the games that are being made today are arguably more complex than they were in the past," he said. "The faster you can iterate, the faster you will get to a certain result. And then and the tightening of those pipelines should allow you, in theory, to make your games in a more efficient manner."</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke also said the general population might not be aware of how much time an animator may spend on "stuff they don't want to work on." As such, thanks to automation, "It adds a lot to the time that they have to work on the creative stuff," Vincke said.</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke said it's "the wrong attitude" to assume that automation will replace various people and departments. Because automation should, in theory, allow people to do "more of what really matters and less of the stuff that they don't want to do."</p><p dir="ltr">"That's not necessarily cost reduction," he added. "But it's going to be an increase of ability, which is a good thing."</p><p dir="ltr">The new Divinity game was announced at The Game Awards recently with a flashy--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-the-game-awards-trailers-got-really-gross-this-year/1100-6536908/" data-ref-id="1100-6536908">and super gross</a>--CGI trailer. The game has no release date as of yet.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, be sure to read GameSpot's own new interview with Vincke, in which he claims that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-larian-ceo-swen-vincke/1100-6536981/" data-ref-id="1100-6536981">the new Divinity game will be better than Baldur's Gate 3 "on all fronts."</a></p>

In the meantime, the developer said fans should be wary of what they read on the internet. Although there was no further context provided, this may be a reference to a recent report that claimed Infinity Ward is making 2026's Call of Duty game, rumored to be Modern Warfare 4, and that its multiplayer would be a "complete copy" of Modern Warfare 2's.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>Happy holidays everybody!</p><p>Wishing our community an awesome holiday season and looking forward to talking soon.</p><p>Don't believe everything you read on the Internet.

This has yet to be confirmed, but Infinity Ward's latest social media post ended with, "See you in 2026."</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is the newest entry in the series, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-were-significantly-down-from-black-ops-6-report/1100-6536893/" data-ref-id="1100-6536893">reportedly sold worse than 2024's Black Ops 6</a>.

                <p>Ubisoft has acquired the game March of Giants from Amazon Games, and this also means that creative director Xavier Marquis has returned to Ubisoft.

The game combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat.

Now, the dev team has revealed that this open-world Wuxia game has sailed past an impressive player milestone in only a month.</p><p>According to the official social media account for Where Winds Meet, the first month saw 15 million players. "You followed the winds, tested your blades and proved that the best stories are the ones we tell together," reads the statement from Everstone. </p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/2000213983790522645" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">15 Million Wanderers have joined the Jianghu! <br>You followed the winds, tested your blades, <br>and proved that the best stories are the ones we tell together. <br>Thank you for being here! <a href="https://t.co/xRpSYpVXgT" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/xRpSYpVXgT</a></p>  — Where Winds Meet (@WhereWindsMeet_) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/2000213983790522645?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>No specifics were shared regarding how much playtime each of those people put in or any other details.

                <p>Pedro "Flute Guy" Eustache has become one of The Game Awards most-beloved returning figures, known for playing his outlandish collection of flutes with incredible passion and panache. After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-keeps-the-legend-of-flute-guy-strong/1100-6536923/" data-ref-id="1100-6536923">another stellar performance</a> at The Game Awards 2025, Eustache has taken to social media to show off all the different instruments he played in this year's show.</p><p>While Eustache's stage presence is the main element that has made him so popular with viewers of The Game Awards, his unusual collection of instruments has also tickled the internet's fancy over the years he's been a part of The Game Awards Orchestra. This year, he has named all the different instruments he played in the famous Game of the Year medley, which include a handful of curiously custom-made or customized instruments.</p><p>Showing them off in the order they were played during the medley, Eustache's first two instruments are western concert flutes with swapped-out headpieces--the first from a traditional Armenian shvi, and the second a 3D-printed head based on the Armenian blul. Eustache also demonstrates the strange flute he played during the Clair Obscur section of the medley, simply calling it a "PVC-based flute." <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1999518701444337802" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Geoff Keighley revealed</a> after the show that Eustache built this instrument just for TGAs.</p><p>The next flute is another traditional folk instrument, this time a Chinese dizi. The medley is finished with two western flutes, the bass flute, and the huge contrabass flute--the former being the instrument Eustache first went viral with during his enthusiastic performance in the 2022 Game of the Year medley.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/EustachePedro/status/2000797921735008329" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I'm elated that you were unto our GOTY TGA 2025 performance.<br>YES you got it: the Thumb-size-Ocarina wasn't on my last video!<br>Thanks to @geoffkighley &amp; @lornebafle &amp; to God, for His awesome grace!<br>Stay tuned: many more great projects coming up soon!<br>God bless you all! <a href="https://t.co/CfF87T9IRR" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/CfF87T9IRR</a></p>  — Pedro Eustache (@EustachePedro) <a href="https://twitter.com/EustachePedro/status/2000797921735008329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In a follow-up video, Eustache revealed that he had omitted one instrument that made an appearance at the 2025 awards ceremony--the thumb-sized ocarina played for Donkey Kong Bananza. He finishes by thanking "gamers of the world" for their support, promising he will indeed be back for The Game Awards 2026.</p><p>Outside of Flute Guy and the TGA orchestra's incredible performances, this year's awards show was dominated by Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which took home a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">record-breaking 13 nominations and nine award wins</a>, including Game of the Year.
