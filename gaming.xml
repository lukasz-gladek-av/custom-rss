			<p>It's been a while since we heard anything about Marvel's Blade. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-blade-announced-arkane-lyon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> at the 2023 The Game Awards event, when we learned that Arkane Lyon, the studio behind Dishonored and Deathloop, would be behind it. </p>



<p>The only other thing we know about it is that Marvel's Blade <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkanes-blade-game-to-run-in-deathloops-and-dishonored-2s-void-engine-senior-lighting-artist-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be powered by Arkane's own Void Engine</a>, previously seen in the aforementioned games, thus making Arkane Lyon one of the few studios that still sticks to proprietary technology instead of switching to Epic's Unreal Engine 5, as so many big studios have done (CD Projekt RED and Crystal Dynamics, to name two).</p>



<p>But what is the development status of the game? Well, it seems like it just entered full production. The information was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/timur222.bsky.social/post/3ltlhwfmlac2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> by eagle-eyed videogame enthusiast and 'Internet explorer' Timur222, who discovered it in Arkane Lyon's 2024 financial document (written in French), where the studio wrote:</p>



<p><em>Game development activities exclusively for the ZeniMax/Microsoft group are continuing. The production phase of the AAA game project was able to begin at the end of 2024, following prototype validation.</em></p>



<p>Marvel's Blade is the only triple-A game in development at Arkane. There can be no confusion there, especially after Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed the Austin-based sister studio last year</a>. Given the average triple-A game development time and the fact that Deathloop launched in September 2021, the game's release window will likely occur between 2026 and 2027, probably in the latter year. </p>



<p>Needless to say, we'll report any other leaks or rumors ahead of the official unveiling. Stay tuned.</p>

As studios and publishers move away from physical media; libraries play a key role in helping to preserve and catalog aging software, but often struggle to compile digital video games because they lack "institutional licensing comparable to the platforms that libraries work with to collect ebooks and digital video," according to Post. Another institution, University of Washington's Game Research Group, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-256564-ols-24">lost funding when its National Leadership Grant from IMLS was cut</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

The Strong National Museum of Play's grants were just two of thousands suddenly rescinded by the government.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of those grants from the IMLS, which according to Strong Museum communications director Shane Rhinewald will be used in a preservation project for a "toy catalog collections initiative," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/06/nx-s1-5388902/library-funding-cuts-trump-injunction">was temporarily reinstated by a court order</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in May 2025. The funding will go directly to the salary of the person hired to archive toy catalogs, a crucial task for the museum. But the other, earmarked for a new exhibit called "Beyond the Buzzer: Game Shows in America," has been cut. The museum plans to proceed with both projects, but scope, timing, and size is in limbo.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jon-Paul Dyson, Strong Museum senior vice president and director of the International Center for the History of Electronic Games, told Game Developer that the museum receives around 700,000 guests a year and explained its funding comes from admissions and memberships, plus a trust that supports the museum. The grants aren't essential to the day-to-day functions of the museum, but enable it to take on special projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This work of preserving games, celebrating games and speaking about their importance, not just to people who love video games, but to people more broadly, even those who don't consider themselves gamers, is really vital work," Dyson said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rabindra Ratan, associate professor at Michigan State University's Department of Media and Information, told Game Developer that he and his team were awarded $1.6 million by the National Science Foundation's Future of Work program in 2021 to research and develop a program to "reduce issues of Zoom fatigue and other types of gender and race inequities in the games industry related to virtual meetings." Most of that money was spent on the research over the years, but when the grant was rescinded this year, they lost an unspent $200,000 they intended to use to finish the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We were in the home stretch," Ratan said. "The main goal of the home stretch was to get our work out into the games industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ratan and the team did all the research and built out a virtual world that was designed to be a more effective meeting space — taking into consideration gender and racial disparities in the industry. Now, they no longer have the funding needed to fully realize their vision. The platform is publicly available still, and Ratan intends to put the research materials up online, but there's no longer the budget to pay students and professors to tie up the loose ends of the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our mission was to help promote equity in the games industry, and like in many industries that are impacted, the cancellation is part of what we see as an ongoing culture war against people who are trying to reduce systematic inequalities in those fields."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Public development grants in the U.S. have become an endangered species">Public development grants in the U.S. have become an endangered species</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rebecca Bria, assistant anthropology professor at The University of Texas San Antonio's College of Liberal and Fine Arts, told Game Developer </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://apps.neh.gov/publicquery/AwardDetail.aspx?gn=MT-304037-25">her virtual reality game project</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Paccha</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was "severely impacted by the rescinding of the NEH grant shortly after the work began."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Paccha</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a virtual reality adventure and puzzle game in which players act as a student archaeologist investigating different areas of the Peruvian Andes. It's co-developed by Bria and game developer and artist Bruce Carlisle. They explained they spent two years conceptualizing the game "while conducting preliminary research, digitizing ancient objects and spaces, and doing outreach in Peru to ensure community buy-in and active collaborations with descendant populations." Planning and applying for grants took two years, but they were eventually awarded $100,000 for prototyping from NEH. The grant finally arrived in February 2025. They were able to complete just two months of work before the Trump administration pulled the plug.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Grant opportunities to develop a game like ours — through NEH or elsewhere — are rare and competitive," Bria and Carlisle said. "Our award comes from the NEH program called 'Digital Projects for the Public,' which is extremely competitive. They have an intense peer review process, require an advisory committee of humanities scholars as well as partnerships with museums/universities and communities, and they often require applicants to submit multiple submissions and revisions to win. Unfortunately, not only did DOGE rescind our award but the NEH website indicates that the agency was made to completely discontinue the Digital Projects for the Public competition moving forward."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They said the NEH award was "vital" for the project&nbsp; to be able to "accurately and ethically present the people and artifacts of the Indigenous Andean past." The prototyping grant was the first step in a long process in acquiring future funding to produce the game. "Losing the award is devastating," they said. "Now that this NEH funding pipeline from Prototyping to Implementation has vanished, our trajectory for completing the game is also halted."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bria said the cuts stalled research, put partnerships (like one with the San Antonio Museum of Art) on hold, removed "financial support for community collaborators in the Peruvian village and archaeological site of Hualcayan where our game is set," and ended payments to game developer Carlisle, who is no longer able to work full time on the title as a result.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, like other researchers and institutions impacted by the sudden axe to their already-awarded grants, they're looking for different ways to fund the game, be it through private funding or via the NEH program being reinstated. It's a baffling and devastating blow to projects, and a decision that will surely impact the study of video games—something that could have lasting impact.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The video game industry is at the forefront of experimentation and exploration in technological developments in many realms," Ratan said. "By limiting research in this industry, it is limiting science as a whole. There's a slightly more direct negative consequence here in hindering progress in the games industry, namely being that progress in the games industry leads to other industries."</span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/trump-funding-cuts-devastate-video-game-research-and-development]]></content:encoded>

<header><section>
<p>But more games will be made eligible</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Game Vouchers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e41d8659b2591/game-vouchers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that it will be ceasing sales of the Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers scheme from <strong>Friday, 30th January 2026 at 23:59 JST</strong>.</p>
<p>For those who might be unaware, Game Vouchers would come in pairs and would therefore allow you to purchase two first-party eShop titles at a discounted price. So in the UK, for example, a pair of Game Vouchers costs £84, granting access to two titles priced at £49.99 each, thus saving you approximately £16. Pretty sweet deal.</p>
<p>No more, though! Nintendo had already announced that Game Vouchers wouldn't be compatible with the Switch 2, but now it's gone one step further and is bringing an end to the scheme entirely.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rpnqhk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>It's not all bad news, though. Sort of... Game Vouchers are valid for one year after purchase, and Nintendo has stated that it will be introducing more games to the scheme following the cessation of sales at the start of January.</p>
<p>We can't say for definite which games might be added, but we reckon there's a good chance we'll see the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>, both of which are scheduled to launch in 2026. Then, of course, you've got the Switch 1 versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> launching later this year.</p>
<p>It's a shame this will no longer be a thing, though. Hopefully Nintendo will offer up some sort of alternative for the Switch 2, because if it wants to continue pushing folks toward digital purchases, then it'll need to introduce an enticing deal for those hesitant to leave physical media behind.</p>

<p>The highly anticipated underwater sequel was slated for an early access release this year, however Krafton has moved that window back to an unspecified date in 2026. According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjA4MzgyNCwiZXhwIjoxNzUyNjg4NjI0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWjU4SUFUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.R0p1u8-Bar_mXzXyKWDJxsN-yaSdlIWVs2GZ5WCbpAM">Bloomberg</a>, this change happened mere months before Krafton was expected to pay the development team a $250m bonus, which would have applied had the studio met certain revenue targets by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Due to the game's delayed release, Unknown Worlds is now unlikely to be able to meet these targets, sources told the publication, meaning that it will miss out on the payout. According to Bloomberg, this delay was not supported by the former leadership at Unknown Worlds, who had planned to share the bonus with all studio employees.</p>
<p>Krafton stated it had delayed the release of Subnautica 2 to improve the game's quality following feedback from playtests. "It was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations," Krafton claimed.</p>
<p>Last week, Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, as well as chief executive officer Ted Gill, were all "pushed out" from the studio by Krafton. Following his dismissal, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/">Cleveland shared a statement on reddit</a>, where he called the events of the week "quite a shock". In this same post, he said Subnautica 2 was ready for its early access debut.</p>
<p>"And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton's hands. And after all these years, to find that I'm no longer able to work at the company I started stings," Cleveland wrote.</p>
<p>"I want you to know that whatever happens to the founders, to the team and to the game, our priority is, and has always been, to make the best damned game we can for the best community in the world... And I also want you to know that this is not where the story ends."</p>

</span></p><p>Now that Cleveland, McGuire and Gill have been removed from the company, Striking Distance Studios CEO Steve Papoutsis has been put in charge of Unknown Worlds. Earlier this week, Papoutsis reportedly said Krafton did not believe that Subnautica 2 was ready to be released in early access in 2025, and more content was needed.</p>
<p>In audio listened to by Bloomberg, the new studio head was further questioned about the motives for the delay beyond this, including if the $250m bonus was a factor. "It's a good question, and I would appreciate patience on this particular topic," Papoutsis replied during the meeting, adding he was not familiar with the specifics of Krafton's acquisition of Unknown Worlds or the contract itself at the present time.</p>
<p>"The desire of Krafton is to have the very best version of Subnautica 2 available for its early access," he continued. "While yes, the software that everybody worked on is in a great spot and it felt like, 'Hey we should launch this,' that wasn't where both parties aligned around." Papoutsis added: "it's never been told to me that we're making this change specifically to impact any earnout or anything like that".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Krafton for comment on today's report.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Minecraft creator Markus Persson (also known simply as Notch) was never known to be of the diplomatic sort. Throughout the last thirteen years, he has made several controversial comments via social media, both on the games industry and various social issues. Sticking to the former, back in 2012, he famously gave his permission to a Minecraft fan to pirate the game if he could not afford it at the moment:</p>



<p><em>Just pirate it. If you still like it when you can afford it in the future, buy it then. Also, don’t forget to feel bad. 😉</em></p>



<p>At the 2011 Game Developers Conference, Persson was even more direct when telling his peers that piracy was not theft. He argued that if people stole a car, there would be one less in the world, whereas pirating a game simply means there is another copy in the world and possibly a new fan.</p>



<p>Now, the Minecraft creator has renewed his thoughts in light of the Stop Killing Games initiative. For context, the online petition is seeking to gather enough signatures to propose a bill to the UK and European parliaments to block game developers and publishers from making games that can eventually be 'killed' by permanently taking down servers. Last week, we covered one such example when Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/anthem-going-offline-2026-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that all services for BioWare's Anthem would cease on January 12, 2026. From that date onward, the game will be effectively unplayable.</p>



<p>The Stop Killing Games initiative has gained considerable momentum lately and is now nearing 1.3 million signatures, as you can see on the official website. Unsurprisingly, publishers have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/publishers-argue-stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-games-prohibitively-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that if this were ever to pass, it would be 'prohibitively expensive' for them, which sounds like a hidden threat of even further price increases.</p>



<p>It is in this context that Markus Persson said: </p>



<p><em>If buying a game is not a purchase, then pirating them is not theft.</em></p>



<p>When asked what game developers and publishers should do instead of shutting games down, the Minecraft creator pointed out that old games used to allow players to host their own servers, which effectively kept those games alive even after the actual developer turned off their official servers.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Persson <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-spiritual-sequel-teased-by-markus-notch-persson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gauged the interest of his followers</a> in him getting back to work on a spiritual successor to Minecraft. The response seemed positive, although it remains unclear whether this game will actually be made and, if so, when it could launch.</p>



<p>Besides that, do you agree with Persson's opinion on the subject?</p>

            <p>I did scan strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-scum">Space Scum</a>'s trailer a few times for the hint of a feature that didn't make me immediately think, ah yeah, that's just like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-brothers">Battle Brothers</a> innit. This is a bit unfair of me. After all, your dudes sit on chess piece-like plinths in this one. That's innovation, right? Anyway, I like the art and the bloke from the trailer looks like he'd nut me if I dwelled on the comparison too long. With someone else's face. So, here's a trailer. There's also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2601980/Space_Scum/">Steam demo</a> from next month, although you can sign up for a playtest now.</p>

<p>The gang's all here. Turn-based battles. Procedural planets. Origins and character traits. Mercenary permadeath. Gear looting. Skill trees. The sci-fi setting does offer a few twists, though. I'm a fan of the enemy variety I've seen so far, for one. Space rats. Space lizards. Space bugs. All the stuff you don't want to find in your sacks of space grain, basically. Range combat also naturally plays a bigger part here, and you can specialise your mercs in things like hacking and turret use.</p>
<p>Also, look how furious and/or very hungry these rats are. Very emotive. A cornucopia of different ways to be aggravated, possess these rats.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Space Scum is a tactical, turn-based RPG, set across multiple procedurally generated planets, ensuring no playthrough is the same - though they all exist in the same gritty, Sci-Fi universe. You’ll choose your own custom origin and encounter different environments, enemy types, factions and missions, all based on where you go and what you choose to do. Of course, when all the choices are yours, so are the consequences…"</p></blockquote>
<p>Had I a say in such matters, I would probably look at the available footage for my game, cross-reference it against the word 'gritty' in my marketing blurb, come to the conclusion that the audience could probably work that bit out for themselves, and then choose literally any other word, preferably one more specific to the universe I've created here, lest someone assume my worldbuilding process consisted of choosing the word 'gritty' then working backwards from there. I'll play the demo though, sure. Looks fun. Full release is TBC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-scum-is-a-sci-fi-strategy-rpg-take-on-battle-brothers]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda has <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1942948713220932042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new patch for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered to the Steam Beta ring. If you wish to download it, just switch to the beta tab in your Steam library.</p>



<p>Patch 1.2 introduces a series of fixes to performance, quests, and gameplay. Arguably, the most interesting could be the allegedly reduced frequency of stutters when traversing the open world, which were really dreadful <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at launch</a>. Here's the performance and visual related changelog:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed frame rate drop in Deepscorn Hollow</li>



<li>Fixed frame rate drops in Black Rock Caverns</li>



<li>Fixed frame rate drop between Skingrad and Skingrad Castle</li>



<li>Fixed frame rate drop south of Bravil Castle courtyard</li>



<li>Reduced the frequency of hitches in the open world.</li>



<li>General improvements to frame time in many locations.</li>



<li>Optimize the updating of character attachments.</li>



<li>Optimize rendering of water volumes in the open world.</li>



<li>Optimize light/shadow updates in several lairs.</li>



<li>Optimize waterfall particle FX and rendering.</li>



<li>Optimize the weather system.</li>



<li>Optimize the character animation system.</li>



<li>Fixed flickering shadows when using XeSS Upscaling</li>



<li>Fixed title properly restarting after purchasing the Deluxe Upgrade on PC</li>



<li>Fixed settings properly migrating between PC and XBOX</li>



<li>Fixed water disappearing after fast travel</li>



<li>Fixed cursor slowdown when enabling high frame rate V-Sync</li>



<li>Fixed shaders not preloading due to cloud save replication</li>



<li>Fixed long blackout during loading screens</li>



<li>Fixed weather VFX flashing while outside</li>



<li>Fixed motion blur artifacts while in the Oblivion Plane</li>



<li>Fixed NPCs not obeying the Wait action from the player</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, Bethesda Game Studios has introduced new difficulty options to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, specifically for Player Combat Damage and Enemy Combat Damage. Players can now select from “Novice”, “Apprentice”, “Adept”, “Journeyman”, “Expert”, and “Master” options in the Gameplay menu. The developers expressed the hope that the “Journeyman” setting would act as a better bridge between “Adept” and “Expert” for players.</p>



<p>Oblivion Remastered is currently still 20% off on Steam due <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2025-is-officially-here-with-deals-on-indiana-jones-monster-hunter-wilds-oblivion-remastered-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the Summer Sale</a>, but the discount is only available for less than ten hours, so hurry up if you are interested.</p>

We've rounded up some of our favorite deals on PC components into the lists below, plus a selection of discounted pre-built gaming PCs. Prime Day runs until July 11, unless they sell out before then, so make sure you grab the discounted components while you can.

The biggest discount is for the Ryzen 9 7900X 12-core 24-thread Unlocked CPU, which is down to $288 (was $550). This is a solid CPU that can work well for PC gaming, and since it's unlocked . However, if you're looking for something more powerful, the Ryzen 9 9950X is now available for $434 (down from $650), making it a great pick for anyone building an AMD-based gaming PC.

This model uses Intel's 14th Gen CPU technology and offers a max 6 GHz clock speed.

There's also a discount on an Asus-made RTX 5060 Ti with just 8GB GDDR7, which we'd only recommend to players sticking with 1080p resolution and max 60 fps frame rates, but is a bit cheaper at $400 (was $470).</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-3-125-slot-Military-Grade-Components-Protective/dp/B0DS6S98ZF?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5070 12GB GDDR7 OC Edition</a> -- $685 (<del>$740</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-DisplayPort-2-5-Slot-Axial-tech-Technology/dp/B0F7WB6LSH?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Dual GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB GDDR7 OC Edition</a> -- $430 (<del>$480</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-SFF-Ready-Graphics-2-5-Slot-Axial-tech/dp/B0F76KGH6B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB GDDR7 OC Edition</a> -- $400 (<del>$470</del>)</li></ul><hr><h2 dir="ltr">Desktop PC Prime Day Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4529383-pcs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529383" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4529383-pcs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529383"></a><figcaption>Alienware Aurora ACT1250 Gaming PC</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4529383-pcs.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you want to skip buying individual components, you can also grab one of several pre-made <a href="https://amzn.to/3Ij8sta" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC gaming desktops</a> that are discounted for Prime Day.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/now-you-can-finance-in-game-items-in-addition-to-burritos.1239897/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/12/buy-now-pay-later-fall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predatory morass</a> of “buy now, pay later” schemes – which <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/doordash-klarna-payments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">famously and meme-ably</a> made their way to the world of DoorDash food deliveries earlier this year – arises a slimy new option: financing in-game purchases. I’m sure nothing regrettable will come of this, considering how <a href="https://aftermath.site/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-game-currency-rule-roblox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-regulated</a> and famously <a href="https://kotaku.com/loot-boxes-are-designed-to-exploit-us-1819457592" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immune to exploitation</a> in-game transactions tend to be.&nbsp;</p><p>The new system is the result of a partnership between Affirm, a prominent BNPL provider, and Xsolla, a company that makes payment software used by thousands of companies like Epic and Sega, as well as numerous free-to-play and mobile games. In <a href="https://investors.affirm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/xsolla-and-affirm-partner-help-game-developers-offer-players" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an announcement</a> published late last month, Affirm said that its services are now “automatically available to [Xsolla partners’] players – enabling them to split purchases into interest-free biweekly payments or longer-term monthly installments for carts starting at $50.” </p><p>While the companies did not specify which games this has been applied to, it is not hard to imagine a scenario where a player piles up a heap of cosmetics in a free-to-play MMO or a bunch of currency in a battle royale and then pays off the real-world cost in installments.</p><p>The two companies went on to bloviate about how they prioritize “empowering” developers and players “by putting transparency and personalization at the center of every transaction.”</p><p>This news flew under the radar a little bit, which is why I’m dredging it up now. BNPL advocates, which tend to be the companies benefitting from this new, tech-facilitated form of debt, will tell you that they’re offering a service preferable to traditional credit, as payment plans involve fixed terms, can be interest free, and don’t require high credit scores.&nbsp;</p><p>But anybody with a functioning brain will counter that you cannot separate these things from one another as though you’re an old-timey prospector panning for gold. America is a nation built on debt, with a 2024 New York Fed report finding that American household debt sat at <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2024/20240806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$17.8 trillion</a>. Companies large and small worm their way into the cracks of this busted foundation and, of course, extract profit.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/12/buy-now-pay-later-fall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>, research has shown that some BNPL users exhibited symptoms of greater financial distress.&nbsp;</p><p>“What you need to think about is the rest of the consumer’s portfolio. If they’re making BNPL payments … maybe they’re not paying off their credit card, maybe they’re not paying their cellphone bill, and that’s actually more concerning,” said Ed deHaan, a researcher who <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4230633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a paper on the matter in 2023</a>. “They’re essentially substituting one payment for another.”</p><p>Additionally, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – which was trying to <a href="https://aftermath.site/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-game-currency-rule-roblox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subject games with robust in-game currency marketplaces to cursory regulation</a> before the Trump administration <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-doge-cfpb-elon-musk-456b747c367fccbcf3b74d2893cd1a35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gutted it earlier this year</a> – published <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-research-reveals-heavy-buy-now-pay-later-use-among-borrowers-with-high-credit-balances-and-multiple-pay-in-four-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report</a> in January showing that more than 60 percent of BNPL users had simultaneous loans and held higher balances on other credit lines, and that most BNPL loans went to consumers with subprime or lower credit scores.</p><p>If you want more granular examples, social media is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkN6I3gZfGI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rife with them</a>.</p><p>In other words, these systems disproportionately target people who are either on a slippery slope or have already hit rock bottom. They are parasitic, yet another byproduct of rising costs, economic instability, and wealth disparity. In a functioning society, there would be no need for such a thing, which is why the ludicrous notion of financing burritos became such a pervasive meme. But here we are.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, I doubt an increasingly desperate video game industry will have any qualms with leaning on Affirm. Young people are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/young-american-consumer-spending-cut-f2b482e5?st=HJkcW3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spending less on games</a> this year compared to last, but US spending on video game subscriptions, specifically, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ltjvylgirs2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached an all-time high</a> in May 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>"Looks to me that the pressures of higher prices in everyday spending categories like food and general economic uncertainty has folks looking for value," Circana video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ltjvylgirs2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Bluesky</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/buy-now-pay-later-in-game-items-xsolla-affirm]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/anthem-server-shutdown-trying-for-the-first-time-bioware-ea</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/with-anthem%E2%80%99s-impending-server-shutdown-i%E2%80%99m-trying-it-for-the-first-time.1239894/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare’s multiplayer shooter <em>Anthem</em> was released in 2019 and simply didn’t meet the expectations of players or Electronic Arts. There have been some tweaks over the years, but EA stopped supporting the game in 2021. Last week, EA <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the servers will be shut down on January 12, which came as a surprise to the numerous people who had assumed they’d been shut down already. You can’t buy the game or purchase its premium currency anymore, but you can still play it, so I did.</p><p>I flew around the lush planet of Coda, landing by beacons emitting strange power. I weaved through waterfalls and dodged wyverns, sought out new creatures to observe (like a meerkat-esque beast with colorful plumage), and practiced my barrel roll. Though I haven’t encountered any other people playing <em>Anthem</em> — a problem for the online-only multiplayer game that encourages four players per server — I’m not the only one giving <em>Anthem</em> a shot years too late.&nbsp;</p><p>“I personally started playing like a week ago because I saw that it was free with Game Pass Ultimate on Xbox and decided to give it a try to see if the game is as barebones as people say it is,” one player told me. Another player told me they started recently because they were curious why a friend liked the game so much. All three of us are enjoying it — the flying, especially. “The traversal is single handedly the most fun I've had with a game,” one player said. “People call it the best Iron Man game for a reason.”</p><p><em>Anthem</em> hinges on its movement; people like me, who are early on, are still enjoying the novelty of it all. The game’s exosuits give it a sense of movement that’s rare to find in video games, one that’s forgiving but requires precision, simple yet dynamic. Flight is central to <em>Anthem</em>, but BioWare found ways to constantly keep the mechanic interesting, even when you’re not in combat — balancing traveling long distances with using the environment to keep your suit from overheating, therefore staying in flight longer.</p><p>“You couldn't fly indefinitely, your suit would overheat and you'd have to land ‘til it recovered," a player told me. “But if you flew through a waterfall, or through the spray of water at the top of a waterfall, it would completely cool your suit down, and if you flew right over a river or body of water it would also cool your suit down.”</p><p>The best part of the game, that player said, was playing in the free roam mode: “Every so often I'd see another player flying around too, they or I may follow the other and fight alongside them for a while.”</p><p>But <em>Anthem</em> couldn’t live on its movement and flight mechanics alone. The game didn't live up to the ambitious promise of its marketing and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/anthem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched to abysmal scores</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/anthem-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviews</a>. A <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/anthem-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku report</a> published after <em>Anthem</em>'s launch told a story of mismanagement at BioWare: The game was in development for almost seven years, but "didn't enter production until the final 18 months, thanks to big narrative reboots, major design overhauls, and a leadership team said to be unable to provide a consistent vision and unwilling to listen to feedback." After the troubled launch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-bioware-plans-a-complete-overhaul-for-anthem-1839892415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BioWare and EA vowed to reboot the game as <em>Anthem NEXT</em></a> as a way to fix the game's many problems. In February 2021, <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2021/02/24/anthem-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BioWare announced it was canceling <em>Anthem NEXT</em></a> and would instead simply keep the servers online as they already were. <em>Anthem</em>'s existed in that state since.</p><p>Despite all this, <em>Anthem</em> continues to support a small, dedicated community of players. For years now, players in private Facebook groups and Discord servers have been gathering to look for groups on all platforms. Sure, you can’t just jump into a game and queue up with three other people, but one veteran player I spoke to, Jon, said he can usually find at least one or more people in the game’s free roam modes.</p><p>But the announcement of the game’s closure is one last breath of life for the game before it’s killed off. “The game feels almost alive again, as if support is [bringing in back],” he said. “Almost like a hope of breathing life back into the game. The community has come back alive from what it was.”</p><p>I’ll keep playing <em>Anthem</em> until it leaves Game Pass on August 15, when it will be tossed into the ether with the rest of the games that have been shut down — games like <em>Dauntless, The Crew</em>, <em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em>, and <em>XDefiant</em>. It’s a common practice for companies to stop supporting games with diminishing returns and low player counts, but one that’s especially painful for the small, dedicated fan bases of online-only games like <em>Anthem</em>. Once a server goes down, there’s nothing left to play.&nbsp;</p><p>Some players are organizing initiatives to stop publishers from taking down games that people have purchased, such as the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stop Killing Games</a> movement, which is currently petitioning people in the UK to bring the issue to Parliament. <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The petition has hit a signature threshold</a> (more than 100,000 signatures), and organizers hope the government will discuss this as a consumer rights issue.</p><p>For now, it’s seemingly too late for <em>Anthem</em>. Any minor boost of the playerbase is just a bump in nostalgia for what the game was or could have been, or simply curiosity.</p><p>“With a shutdown like this around the corner, there's this air of ‘now or never,’ and it's definitely brought me back to the playthrough I'd started,” a player named Leo told me. “So I have to imagine the same might be the case for a few others.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/anthem-server-shutdown-trying-for-the-first-time-bioware-ea]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A new raid boss has arrived in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/" data-ref-id="5000-449545">Pokemon Go</a>. Solgaleo, the mascot of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon/" data-ref-id="5000-465376">Pokemon Sun</a>, is appearing in five-star raids until July 14, giving you a few days to add it to your collection.</p><p>While the legendary Pokemon has been available in the mobile game since 2022, this is the first time it's appearing as a raid boss. Previously, Solgaleo could only be obtained by evolving Cosmoem, so if you missed your chance to get a Cosmog, you now have the opportunity to catch one if you're able to defeat it in battle.</p><p>Like other legendaries, Solgaleo is a formidable opponent, so we've put together some tips to help you beat and catch the legendary Pokemon before it leaves raids next week.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Solgaleo_Raid_Schedule">Solgaleo Raid Schedule</a></li><li><a href="#Solgaleo_Weaknesses">Solgaleo Weaknesses</a></li><li><a href="#Best_Solgaleo_Counters">Best Solgaleo Counters</a><ul><li><a href="#Fire">Fire</a></li><li><a href="#Ground">Ground</a></li><li><a href="#Ghost">Ghost</a></li><li><a href="#Dark">Dark</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Types_To_Avoid">Types To Avoid</a></li><li><a href="#Can_Solgaleo_Be_Shiny_">Can Solgaleo Be Shiny?</a></li><li><a href="#How_To_Fuse_With_Necrozma">How To Fuse With Necrozma</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Solgaleo_Raid_Schedule">Solgaleo Raid Schedule</h2><p>Solgaleo is appearing as a five-star raid boss <strong>from July 8 to 14</strong>, giving you less than a week to catch one before the next raid boss, Terrakion, replaces it.</p><p>Solgaleo raids will occur periodically throughout this time, but your best chance to join one will happen during the Solgaleo Raid Hour on <strong>July 9</strong>. The legendary Pokemon will take over most nearby gyms <strong>from 6 to 7 PM local time</strong>, giving you more opportunities than usual to battle and catch it.</p><hr><h2 id="Solgaleo_Weaknesses">Solgaleo Weaknesses</h2><p>Despite its fiery appearance, Solgaleo is a psychic- and steel-type Pokemon, which makes it weak to only a handful of types.</p><p>Since psychic and steel don't share any vulnerabilities, no Pokemon type will deal quadruple damage to Solgaleo, but the following types will still dish out super-effective damage against the legendary Pokemon:</p><ul><li>Fire</li><li>Ground</li><li>Ghost</li><li>Dark</li></ul><hr><h2 id="Best_Solgaleo_Counters">Best Solgaleo Counters</h2><p>Any Pokemon that has a type advantage over Solgaleo will be helpful when battling the legendary, but here are some recommended choices to use during a Solgaleo raid:</p><h3 id="Fire">Fire</h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Pokemon</th><th scope="col">Type</th><th scope="col">Recommended Fast Attack</th><th scope="col">Recommended Charged Attack</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mega Charizard Y</td><td>Fire/Flying</td><td>Fire Spin</td><td>Blast Burn</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Charizard X</td><td>Fire/Dragon</td><td>Fire Spin</td><td>Blast Burn</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Blaziken</td><td>Fire/Fighting</td><td>Fire Spin</td><td>Blast Burn</td></tr><tr><td>Reshiram</td><td>Fire/Dragon</td><td>Fire Fang</td><td>Fusion Flare</td></tr><tr><td>Heatran</td><td>Fire/Steel</td><td>Fire Spin</td><td>Magma Storm</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Ground">Ground</h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Pokemon</th><th scope="col">Type</th><th scope="col">Recommended Fast Attack</th><th scope="col">Recommended Charged Attack</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Primal Groundon</td><td>Ground</td><td>Mud Shot</td><td>Precipice Blades</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Garchomp</td><td>Dragon/Ground</td><td>Mud Shot</td><td>Earth Power</td></tr><tr><td>Therian Forme Landorus</td><td>Ground/Flying</td><td>Mud Shot</td><td>Sandsear Storm</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Swampert</td><td>Ground/Water</td><td>Mud Shot</td><td>Earthquake</td></tr><tr><td>Excadrill</td><td>Ground/Steel</td><td>Mud-Slap</td><td>Scorching Sands</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Ghost">Ghost</h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Pokemon</th><th scope="col">Type</th><th scope="col">Recommended Fast Attack</th><th scope="col">Recommended Charged Attack</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mega Banette</td><td>Ghost</td><td>Shadow Claw</td><td>Shadow Ball</td></tr><tr><td>Lunala</td><td>Psychic/Ghost</td><td>Shadow Claw</td><td>Shadow Ball</td></tr><tr><td>Origin Forme Giratina</td><td>Dragon/Ghost</td><td>Shadow Claw</td><td>Shadow Force</td></tr><tr><td>Dragapult</td><td>Dragon/Ghost</td><td>Astonish</td><td>Shadow Ball</td></tr><tr><td>Blacephalon</td><td>Fire/Ghost</td><td>Astonish</td><td>Shadow Ball</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Dark">Dark</h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Pokemon</th><th scope="col">Type</th><th scope="col">Recommended Fast Attack</th><th scope="col">Recommended Charged Attack</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mega Tyranitar</td><td>Rock/Dark</td><td>Bite</td><td>Brutal Swing</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Absol</td><td>Dark</td><td>Snarl</td><td>Brutal Swing</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Houndoom</td><td>Dark/Fire</td><td>Snarl</td><td>Foul Play</td></tr><tr><td>Hydreigon</td><td>Dragon/Dark</td><td>Bite</td><td>Brutal Swing</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Gyarados</td><td>Water/Dark</td><td>Bite</td><td>Crunch</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h2 id="Types_To_Avoid">Types To Avoid</h2><p>Thanks to its typing combination, Solgaleo resists a number of popular Pokemon types. <strong>Dragon, fairy, rock, grass, ice, </strong>and<strong> normal</strong> attacks will all deal half-damage, making them ineffective when battling the legendary Pokemon. <strong>Poison and other psychic types</strong> will deal even less damage, so you'll want to avoid using those Pokemon entirely when participating in a Solgaleo raid.</p><hr><h2 id="Can_Solgaleo_Be_Shiny_">Can Solgaleo Be Shiny?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1578/15787979/4529039-3111285131-shiny.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529039" data-ratio="0.56574394463668" data-width="578" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1578/15787979/4529039-3111285131-shiny.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529039"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1578/15787979/4529039-3111285131-shiny.jpg"></figure><p>Unfortunately, shiny Solgaleo is not yet available in Pokemon Go, so you'll only encounter the standard white variant when you challenge one in raids. You can get a shiny Solgaleo in other Pokemon games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-scarlet-pokemon-violet/" data-ref-id="5000-559213">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a> for Nintendo Switch, but you'll need to wait a little longer before you can add one to your collection in Pokemon Go.</p><hr><h2 id="How_To_Fuse_With_Necrozma">How To Fuse With Necrozma</h2><p>Solgaleo and its counterpart Lunala are unique among legendary Pokemon in that they're able to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-fest-adds-new-forms-to-a-legendary-pokemon/1100-6523408/" data-ref-id="1100-6523408">fuse with Necrozma, another legendary</a>.</p><p>Once you've amassed enough Solar Fusion Energy, you can fuse Solgaleo with Necrozma to form Dusk Mane Necrozma. The fusion process costs 1,000 Fusion Energy, 30 Necrozma Candy, and 30 Cosmog Candy, and the two legendary Pokemon will remain fused until you manually separate them.</p><p>Dusk Mane Necrozma is a formidable Pokemon, maintaining Solgaleo's psychic/steel typing but gaining access to some powerful moves like Sunsteel Strike, a steel-type Charged Attack. This makes it a particularly good counter against fairy and ice Pokemon.</p><p>Solgaleo may leave raids on July 14, but there's still plenty to do in Pokemon Go over the next few weeks.
