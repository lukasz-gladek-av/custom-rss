            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/ps5-pro-price-performance-and-what-it-means-for-next-generation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>So, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> has been revealed, and brought with it a lot of cutlery-based exclamations from gamers over the price tag. £700 for a beefed up PS5… and that’s without a disc drive? Needless to say, the overwhelming reaction has been pretty negative. But will it really matter to Sony’s bottom line? And what does it say about the next generation of consoles?</p>
<p>The main hurdle that the PS5 Pro has, compared to the PS4 Pro, is that it’s not selling a new technology. In 2016 Sony could tie in with the rise of 4K TVs and, making use of the early upscaling technique of checkerboarding, could make a compelling case that the PS4 Pro would give you 4K or close to it. The end results were a good bit below that, often topping out at 1440p, but this was also the advent of graphics modes to let you choose to run games at standard resolution and with higher frame rates –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/09/08/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-on-ps4-pro-has-three-graphics-options/">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> being an early example of this –&nbsp;and shore up performance in games that struggled on base PS4.</p>
<p>And it’s performance mode that has come to dominate gaming habits in the last few years, as Mark Cerny pointes out early in his presentation. Gamers just want 60FPS, coming up against developers who want and need to push graphical fidelity as far as possible, and also to hit a particular release date that’s been handed down to them. There’s plenty of games that launch with only 30FPS modes, before a 60FPS mode and other optimised options are patched in down the line.</p>



<p>That’s not even mentioning the slightly blurry elephant in the room: upscaling. The use of DLSS, FSR and XeSS has skyrocketed in the last few years, various techniques that try to fill in the blanks using previous frames as reference points, to varying degrees of quality. They allow games to run at lower actual resolutions while outputting 4K, being used as a necessary crutch alongside dynamic resolutions to keep frame rates steady, even at 30FPS. Without dedicated hardware support in PS5 or Xbox Series, both have had to rely on AMD’s FSR, when DLSS has much higher quality. Sony’s answer here is their own custom PSSR solution.</p>

<p>Per Digital Foundry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-ps5-series-x-s-tech-review">Alan Wake 2 at launch</a> ran at 1270p to upscale to 4K in quality mode, but drops that to 847p to upscale to 1440p in performance mode. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-alan-wake-2-on-playstation-5-remedy-raises-the-bar-for-visual-accomplishment-once-again">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora was a similar compromise</a>, ranging from 1296p to 1800p in quality, or 864p to 1260p in performance.</p>

<p>So here’s the thing: even if PS5 Pro is able to combine quality and performance modes, we’re still well short of native 4K in both these games. Clarity will be improved, but that’s difficult to show in a heavily compressed YouTube video, even if you actually zoom in on images and don’t just crop them funny.</p>
<p>Developers will still be free to use console resources as they see fit, as well. Sony might want to get rid of graphics options, but in reality this is simply shifting the goal posts. You can bet good money that there will still be 30FPS modes in new and updated games, but they might now be a native 4K instead of 1440p-ish. <em>Or</em> developers will get to use the enhanced ray tracing capabilities, which will add a burden to the CPU which hasn’t been meaningfully improved, keeping us back at 30FPS again.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects is how this can actually affect backward compatibility, with Sony saying that PS4 games could be enhanced using PSSR. Early generation games that were never made PS4 Pro compatible could suddenly get a free 4K upscale boost, getting a similar result to Microsoft’s code injection from Xbox backward compatibility, but in a very different way. The only caveat here is that this will be for “select” PS4 games.</p>
<p>But is that worth £700? That’s pricing that feels very much like a halo product, designed to appeal to the comparative few. It’s sure to sell out on day one, and I’d bet there’s at least 10 million people in the world who would consider and be able to afford this, but at the same time I can see it pushing many gamers to think about getting or upgrading a gaming PC instead. With more and more console exclusives coming to PC – whether at the same time for Xbox games, or a little down the road for PlayStation Studios games – that could be rather appealing.</p>
<p>Looking beyond the PS5 Pro and to the next generation, the $700 / £700 price tag is a pretty clear indication that we’re going to see another price hike for the PS6 and next Xbox. The PS5 and Xbox Series X both targeted $500 at launch in 2020, already a big $100 jump over the previous generation launch price, but where many would have expected that price to follow historical trends and gradually slide downward, it’s gone the opposite direction with the price actually increasing around the world in 2022. Even with release of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/11/the-ps5-slim-launch-hides-some-sneaky-price-increases/">PS5 Slim</a>, typically the point at which economies of scale and lowering component cost could enable a lower price, didn’t bring the price down. Heck, there were actually price increases for the digital edition in the US and Japan, and Japan has had yet another price hike since then.</p>
<p>Despite this, the PS5 has continued to sell at roughly the same pace as the PS4, and in a tougher economic climate.</p>
<p>Of course, this has also come at a time where general consumer electronics are going up and up in price. The iPhone 5S started at $650 in 2013, and the iPhone 7 was sticking to that price in 2016, but by 2020, the iPhone 12 started at $800 and iPhone 12 Pro at $1000, and that’s without talking about the plus size models and gouging storage options. There’s plenty of people willing to get the biggest and the best version of a phone.</p>

<p>Perhaps a better point of comparison is GPU costs. In 2013, the GeForce GTX 770 (the third tier GPU behind the GTX 780 and Titans of the day) was $399, now that third tier is the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super, which debuted at $799 –&nbsp;and that only after Nvidia stepped back from backlash to the 4070 Ti being branded as a 4080 and costing $100 more.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s very different pressures for a new console generation than for an optional mid-gen bump and glory project. For the next generation, both Microsoft and Sony will have to weigh up the actual cost of manufacture against the need to build their audience as quickly as possible to make the generation profitable quickly, meaning they will probably start off by selling at a loss. However, with the rate of progress on die shrinks slowing as we approach 1nm, and so the ability to reduce costs also slowing, brace yourselves for at least a $600 starting price. Without a disc drive.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-looks-incredible-at-4k-resolution-with-ray-tracing-in-new-video.978000/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-ray-tracing-4k/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Much like its predecessor, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom looks incredible with some choice mods, including those introducing ray tracing.</p>
<p>A new video put together by Digital Dreams shows the latest main entry in the series by Nintendo running on PC via emulation with some mods, including the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MaxLastBreath" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UltraCam mod</a>, which introduces a variety of visual improvements and the Beyond All Limits Raytracing ReShade preset. While in some scenarios, the game looks a little too bright, there's no denying the visual improvements these mods bring to the game, making it look and run much better than it does on native hardware.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K60] Zelda TotK - Ultra CAM Mod beyond all limits RAYTRACING  - Ultra graphic gameplay 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R6Z8Zuo-7N4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even in its vanilla state, however, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is an excellent game that no fan of the series should skip. While very similar to its predecessor, Tears of the Kingdom is a richer and more rewarding game, as highlighted by Nathan in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom sticks closely to the blueprint established by The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but it’s a richer, more rewarding game in most ways that count, offering a more intricate world, versatile suite of abilities, epic story, and satisfying dungeons. The familiarity of this Hyrule and a handful of frustrating sections keep Tears of the Kingdom from feeling quite as surprising and magical as its predecessor, but make no mistake, the wait has been worth it. While it probably behooves Nintendo to carve out an entirely new Legend next, Link’s latest should fill most fans’ heart meters nicely in the meantime.</em></p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now available on Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-game-director-steps-down<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Starbreeze has announced that&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>game director Miodrag Kovačević, otherwise known as Mio, will be stepping down from his role in order to work "as a designer elsewhere in the project".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/PAYDAYGame/status/1833868133691511218" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Starbreeze says that while it researches and plans&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s second year of content, lead producer&nbsp;Andreas Häll Penninger and community head&nbsp;Almir Listo will be taking over the game's update schedule.</p>
<p>No timeframe is given as to when&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>will get its next full-time creative director, so it looks like we'll just have to wait and see what Andreas and Almir bring to the project in the interim.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-game-director-stepping-down-running.jpg?itok=md4aziNp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-game-director-stepping-down-running.jpg?itok=tpmdcRq- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Payday 3</em>'s game director is stepping down.</figcaption></figure><p>In general, reactions to Mio's departure appear to be mostly positive. One user <a href="https://x.com/kizuati/status/1833868706394366069" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> that this decision "was likely with how things went down during Year 1", while <a href="https://x.com/ForeverKnifes/status/1833870588349153367" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another says</a> that Mio's departure is "unfortunate" but "a massive W" nonetheless.</p>
<p>Mio's exit from his role as director comes as&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>continues to flag in terms of player count and user reviews. A quick look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> shows that&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>currently has just under 600 players online with a 771-player 24-hour peak, while&nbsp;<em>Payday 2</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">24-hour peak</a> is much higher at just under 15,000.</p>
<p>All told, it's been a rough ride for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>. The game launched in September last year to middling reviews, and although it enjoyed tens of thousands of concurrent players at launch, those numbers quickly dwindled as players fled, seemingly in order to return to&nbsp;<em>Payday 2</em>.</p>
<p>In February this year, Starbreeze <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-payday-3-performance">admitted</a> that&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>had performed at "significantly lower levels" than it wanted, and former CEO&nbsp;Tobias Sjögren <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down">stepped down in March</a>, partly due, it seems, to the game's poor performance.</p>

<p>In response to&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s woes, Starbreeze announced an ambitious initiative called Medic Bag, which involves overhauling many of the game's key systems. Last month, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-roadmap">a roadmap was released</a> showing off some of what's coming in the next few months as part of that initiative.</p>
<p>If you feel like checking it out, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272080/PAYDAY_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/payday-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/payday-3/9NPZVDCH73SX/0010" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/satisfactory-release-player-record/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/satisfactory-release-player-record/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2019, Satisfactory was released as an early-access game by Coffee Stain Studios. It pulled in some pretty solid reviews on account of it being quite a unique title, but recently, it was teleported to another level entirely. On September 10, Satisfactory graduated to a fully released game, and shortly after, the player count <strong>skyrocketed</strong>.</p>



<p>Within a few hours of the 1.0 version of Satisfactory being released, more than 100,000 concurrent players were recorded enjoying the game on Steam. That put it in leagues with the likes of Rust and Deadlock, and it pushed it above games like Apex Legends and Baldur’s Gate 3.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-than-satisfactory">More Than Satisfactory</h2>



<p>Satisfactory offers players a unique premise. They’re charged with exploring diverse open-world environments, scavenging up resources and putting them to use in a construction capacity. They’ll need to mine and process materials to build fully automated factory systems, and along the way, they’ll have to manage power systems and deal with alien attacks.</p>



<p>Before hitting the 1.0 release window, Satisfactory had only peaked at around 34,000 concurrent players, which helps to represent the success of the full release. </p>



<p>To ‘qualify’ as a 1.0 version, Satisfactory underwent a staggering number of changes. From run-of-the-mill quality-of-life improvements to bringing the entire game up to spec on the latest version of Unreal, Satisfactory’s full list of changes for the 1.0 update is <strong>hefty</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/506456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Twitch</a>, the game is approaching a new all-time high. It peaked in January 2024 at 70,861 concurrent viewers, but at the time of publishing, it was sitting at around 66,000.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first game to see great success after hitting that 1.0 window. Most recently, 7 Days to Die and Sons of the Forest graduated, moving out of early access and becoming listed as a full game. </p>

<p>GameStop has published a financial update that highlights the company’s performance through the second quarter of the year. It’s not looking good for the retailer, with the key talking point being a 45% decrease in sales year-on-year. It has been a rough few months for the company, as earlier this year, layoffs were made and stores were closed down.</p>



<p>This financial update is an indicator that further cuts will need to be made.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-down">Going Down</h2>



<p>GameStop might have recorded a rise in net income, but sales were down 45% year-on-year, the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/10/2944123/0/en/GameStop-Discloses-Second-Quarter-2024-Results.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent financial report</a> confirmed. This follows a downturn in the Q1 financial report – and it’s a growing figure. Earlier this year, the company reported a 26% drop in sales.</p>



<p>This news comes weeks after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-informer-shut-down-gamestop/">GameStop laid off</a> the entire Game Informer team and shut the publication down after it had been operational for more than thirty years. It also arrives a few months after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamestop-layoffs-share-price/">plummeting stock prices</a> that haven’t yet recovered by the time of writing.</p>



<p>It didn’t help that the firm just offered up 20 million more shares to the market, causing the stock value to cascade by another 10%.</p>



<p>Per a report <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/videogame-retailer-gamestop-misses-quarterly-revenue-estimates-2024-09-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Reuters</a>, GameStop’s leadership team is preparing to shut down more stores across North America. It’s no big secret that the rise of online shopping and digital-based gaming has impacted the likes of GameStop quite hard, and we’re seeing it now in black and white.</p>



<p>In the United Kingdom, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-reportedly-ending-in-store-sales-for-physical-currency-cards/">GAME</a> recently revealed a horizon loaded with cuts, layoffs, and store closures.</p>

Space Marine 2's far future is a truly miserable place to be, a place in which countless humans die every day from all manner of horrors, be those alien, demon, or humans themselves. Humanity, bogged down by excruciating bureaucracy and religious fanaticism, has collapsed. There is no respite, no joy, only inevitable death.</p><p>With that in mind, Warhammer 40,000 fans are used to things like a “lobotomized church menial cyborg flying baby,” as X/Twitter user ChronoTheHarlequin pointed out. The thing is, with this one in particular, it gets even weirder.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Seeing tweets like these kinda make me realize how numb I’ve gotten to the weird shit in 40k.</p><p>“Lobotomized church menial cyborg flying baby” isn’t something I’d even flinch at now <a href="https://t.co/YcLQdGCQlC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/YcLQdGCQlC</a></p></div>— ChronoTheHarlequin (@ChronoHarlequin) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChronoHarlequin/status/1833620971833725268?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>As the unofficial Warhammer podcast Adeptus Ridiculous clarified, <em>most</em> of these things aren’t actually lobotomized babies. Most are built from the ground(?) up as flesh automatons with computers for brains (A.I is banned in the 40th millennium because of... reasons). Why do they look like babies? Apart from Warhammer 40,000 being all heavy metal and gothic, according to the lore, it’s for “ceremonial purposes.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Don't worry, most of them are not actually lobotomized babies, most are built from scratch as flesh automatons with computers for brains and just made to look like babies for ceremonial purposes.</p><p>Most of them. <a href="https://t.co/F0hTIhOvHz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/F0hTIhOvHz</a></p></div>— Adeptus Ridiculous (@AdRidiculous) <a href="https://twitter.com/AdRidiculous/status/1833809442116129267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>I’m loving Space Marine 2 and its attention to detail. The developers at Saber clearly love Warhammer 40,000 and made the effort to capture its oppressive, soul destroying atmosphere. I’ve particularly enjoyed the flavor dialogue you hear from the humans who are charged with keeping the Battle Barge afloat. Some bemoan a lack of sleep because of how hard they’re forced to work. Others express concern at the prospect of making even a single mistake. Given the truly miserable galaxy in which they live, these chaps are the lucky ones. And don’t get me started on the servitors.</p><p>We’ve got plenty more Space Marine 2 coverage, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-to-get-ultrawide-support-private-pve-lobbies-and-more-in-first-patch">details of its first patch</a>, its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-post-launch-roadmap-includes-new-maps-a-horde-mode-and-more">post-launch roadmap</a>, and the upcoming addition of class matching for co-op, after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-having-awkward-pre-mission-standoffs-because-two-of-the-same-class-cant-play-together"><u>players found themselves locked in a class standoff ahead of Operations mode missions</u></a>.</p><p><em>Image credit: Games Workshop.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>If the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">recently-announced PS5 Pro</a> is a little too pricey for you but you have been looking to get your hands on a PlayStation 5 at some point, there is a significantly cheaper option on the horizon.</p>
<p>Sony is primed to start selling refurbished PS5 consoles, which it promises will be "as good as new" (although the company does note its refurbished products "may have minor cosmetic imperfections").</p>
<p>While the PS5 Pro is retailing at £700 without the disk drive and vertical stand, these refurbished consoles will sell for £390, as per the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/certified-refurbished?clickref=1100lzz6eob4&amp;emcid=ot-ps-456951">PlayStation website</a>.</p>

<p>On their release, buyers will "receive a product that works like new with genuine PlayStation replacement parts (as needed) that has been thoroughly cleaned, inspected and tested", Sony said.</p>
<p>The refurbished PS5s will come with all of the console's "necessary" accessories, as well as cables and manuals. These will all be packed up in "their own branded Certified Refurbished packaging". In addition, these refurbished PS5s will come with a 12-month manufacturer’s warranty.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, a shipping date for these particular PS5s hasn't been revealed, but we will update you when we hear more.</p>

<p>Last night, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-upgrade-patches-for-around-40-or-50-games-at-launch-this-november">Sony reportedly confirmed "about 40 or 50 or games" will get PS5 Pro upgrade patches</a> when the console launches on 7th November.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/everything-about-space-marine-2-season-pass/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-already-has-over-130000-concurrent-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immense success</a> of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, it makes sense that so many people have their sights set on additional content. The campaign, at approximately 10 hours, doesn’t take long. The PvE and PvP modes prove most entertaining, but for how long? More is coming, though. Here’s everything you need to know about the Space Marine 2 Season Pass!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-space-marine-2-season-pass-offer">What Does the Space Marine 2 Season Pass Offer?</h2>



<p>We’ve discussed this previously, but the free updates coming to Space Marine 2 look more enticing than the paid content. There’s nothing wrong with cosmetics, as they help fund future development without splitting the community, but the Season Pass for Space Marine 2 looks somewhat lacking. Here’s what you’ll get:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ultramarines Cosmetic Pack</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dark Angels (Season 2)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Champion Pack</li>



<li>Cosmetic Pack</li>



<li>Weapon Skin Pack</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Chapter Pack (Season 3)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Champion Pack</li>



<li>Cosmetic Pack</li>



<li>Weapon Skin Pack</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Chapter Pack (Season 3)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Champion Pack</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Chapter Pack (Season 4)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Champion Pack</li>



<li>Cosmetic Pack</li>



<li>Weapon Skin Pack</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Chapter Pack (Season 4)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Champion Pack</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>There are currently no hints as to which Space Marine chapters we’ll receive during Seasons 3 and 4. I suspect Saber intends to gauge community interest before pulling the trigger on any specific chapters or units, though.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-space-marine-2-season-pass">How Much is the Space Marine 2 Season Pass?</h2>



<p>Previously, you couldn’t buy the Space Marine 2 Season Pass separately, as it was an additional bonus for purchasing the Gold or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-included-space-marine-2-ultra-edition-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultra Editions</a> of the game. However, now that the title is out in the world, developer Saber Interactive lists the Season Pass for <strong>$39.99</strong>.</p>



<p>You can buy it as an add-on for the game.</p>



<p>Is the Season Pass worth $39.99? Well, that’s entirely up to you. But know that it’s primarily cosmetic items, with most of the major content coming as part of the free year-one updates.</p>



<p>If you want to discuss Space Marine 2 with like-minded players, Insider Gaming recently launched its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a> where you can join the discussions daily!</p>

<p>How are you enjoying the game so far? There’s a brand-new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-patch-notes-hotfix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hotfix for Space Marine 2</a> out that solves many of the game’s crashes!</p>

<p>The PS5 Disc Drive is selling out at online retailers. </p>



<p>After the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal of the PS5 Pro</a> on Tuesday, it was made clear that in order to get a disc drive for the new console, you’d have to purchase the external drive. Since then, as spotted online by <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1833867035031269754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>, the peripheral has been selling out everywhere.</p>



<p>As of writing, the drive is #8 on Amazon’s best sellers for video games. On Best Buy’s website, you can’t even order the drive anymore as it’s currently sold out. It is still available on sites like Target, Walmart, and PS Direct.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The external PS5 Disc Drive was made available when the new PS5 Slim consoles were announced and released in 2023. Moving forward, it seems clear that it you want to play physical media on your consoles, you’ll have to by an add-on rather than having a default option.</p>



<p>Currently, it retails for $79.99. With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-ps5-pro-will-cost-200-more-than-base-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$700 price tag</a> of the PS5 Pro, you are looking at $800+ after taxes for the mid-gen upgrade from Sony.</p>



<p>What do you think of the disc drive currently selling out at retailers? Let us know in the comments or join the discussion in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new community forum</a>!</p>

                <p>GameStop has reported earnings for the quarter that ended on August 3, and, to the surprise of some, the retailer has turned a profit. Despite that, GameStop's stock price is sliding--it's down 15% today--due to a downturn in sales and ongoing uncertainty about how GameStop can stay relevant and healthy long term.</p><p>For the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638024000109/gme-20240803.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quarter</a>, GameStop sales slid from $1.164 billion to $798 million. Despite that, GameStop posted a net income of $14.8 million, which was a marked improvement over the company's $2.8 million loss for the same period a year ago.</p><p>GameStop's selling, general, and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs for the period amounted to $270.8 million, compared to $322.5 million during the same period last year.</p><p>GameStop said the decline in SG&amp;A costs were primarily attributable to the company's ongoing cost-reduction plan, which has included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-confirms-more-layoffs-share-price-tumbles-after-sales-slide/1100-6522189/" data-ref-id="1100-6522189">layoffs</a> and scale-downs in multiple areas of the business, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-informer-is-shutting-down-after-33-years/1100-6525508/" data-ref-id="1100-6525508">closure of Game Informer after 33 years</a>. GameStop also saved money in the past quarter by closing stores.</p><p>The bulk of GameStop's revenue came from hardware and accessories, which came in at $451.2 million (down from $597 million), with software ($207.7 million, down from $397 million), and collectibles ($139.4 million, down from $169.8 million) making up the rest.</p><p>At the end of the quarter, GameStop had $4.204 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.</p><p>Despite GameStop turning a profit, GameStop's stock price is down significantly following the announcement of the results, presumably due in part to the sliding sales numbers and a lack of faith from investors that the company can turn things around.</p><p>GameStop said part of its plan for the future is to make sure the company is a "fast and convenient" place for people to shop. GameStop said it will do this by increasing inventory, fulfilling orders more quickly, and improving customer service. GameStop also noted that achieving profitability is another one of its goals, following years of losses--and the company has now achieved that. Third, GameStop said said the GameStop name has "strong household brand recognition" and a large network of physical stores, and this could be a key driver for growth in the future.</p><p>"We believe these efforts are important aspects of our continued business to enable long-term value creation for our shareholder," the company said.</p><p>Finally, GameStop said it plans to close a large number of stores going forward as the company aims to "eliminate redundancies and underperforming assets."</p><p>"While this review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate that it may result in the closure of a larger number of stores than we have closed in the past few years," GameStop said.</p><p>For context, GameStop said in March this year that it closed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-confirms-more-layoffs-share-price-tumbles-after-sales-slide/1100-6522189/" data-ref-id="1100-6522189">287 stores worldwide in the past fiscal year and now has 4,169 stores.</a></p><p>Following the "short-squeeze" situation in 2021 that saw GameStop's stock price massively surge, GameStop's new management, including CEO Ryan Cohen, announced a plan to make GameStop profitable again, something that the company has now achieved. GameStop was also planning a push into the NFT and crypto markets, but those didn't pan out and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-gives-up-on-crypto-after-one-year/1100-6516582/" data-ref-id="1100-6516582">the company's investments in those spaces have come to an end.</a></p><p>Despite GameStop's share price sliding this week, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gme+nyse&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=gme+nyse&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCQgAEEUYOxiABDIJCAAQRRg7GIAEMgcIARAAGIAEMggIAhAAGBYYHjIICAMQABgWGB4yCAgEEAAYFhgeMggIBRAAGBYYHjIICAYQABgWGB4yCAgHEAAYFhgeMggICBAAGBYYHjIICAkQABgWGB6oAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameStop's stock price remains up more than 1,700% in the past five years.</a></p>

			<p>The latest update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-ark-player-numbers-dropped-due-to-massive-bot-ban-wave-community-is-largely-happy/">Lost Ark</a>, titled "Chase the Storm," with maintenance for the patch lasting a whopping 8 hours from 12 AM PT / 3 PM ET / 8 PM BST onwards, adding new events to the game that will help players progress towards Tier 4, as well as the latest threat that players will have to contend with. For those who prefer their <a href="https://www.playlostark.com/en-us/game/releases/chase-the-storm#ags-MediaPopup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a> in video form, the Lost Ark YouTube video channel has a 13-minute video that details all of the patch notes and how they will affect the players.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Ark: Patch Notes with Henry, Chase the Storm" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/liCrDS5vqew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Behemoth is the latest threat that players will have to worry about when participating in the new raid. Behemoth is the Chaos Guardian and a follower of Varkan who is seen as a symbol of fear after killing many in Kurzan. The 16-player raid will allow players to get their hands on honing materials and Weapon Transcendence. The raid will be far from easy, with only eight revives available, requiring an Item Level of 1620.</p>
<p>As stated above, Weapon Transcendence is a new feature that is added into the game, introduced specifically through the Behemoth raid. Weapon Transcendence is similar to Armor Transcendence, but utilizes materials that you can only get from the Behemoth Raid. This allows players to improve the basic effects of their weapons. To be able to transcend your weapons, you will go to the same vendor as the Armor Transcendence. You'll be able to access Weapon Transcendence after you have cleared Gate 1 of Behemoth, with higher levels of Transcendence being available after clearing Gate 2.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>September has plenty of events going on and new content for players to dive into, with a Prelude Quest to the Behemoth Raid being available, as well as an Afterstory Questline for players to complete. In addition, there are 14 new achievements and two new trophies to get your hands on as well.</p>
<p>To help players progress through Lost Ark's September update, a new mission-based Progression event has arrived in the update to help players boost their characters from Item Level 1600 to 1620, which is an important milestone if you want to join the Behemoth raid as well as Tier 4 in October. In total, there are three mission categories that you can participate in that will help you gear up. They are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honing Akkan gear</li>
<li>Clearing Ivory Tower</li>
<li>Clearing Thaemine Gates</li>
</ul>
<p>There is plenty more content for players to dive into, such as the returning events of Arktoberfest and Blooming Mokokos, which happens every year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-deadrop-layoffs-dr-disrespect<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Midnight Society, the studio co-founded by disgraced YouTuber Dr. Disrespect, has announced "significant" layoffs in response to what it calls "multiple unexpected challenges in recent months".</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/3-months-after-firing-dr-disrespect-deadrop-developer-midnight-society-confirms-significant-layoffs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to PC Gamer</a>, a Midnight Society rep said that in order to "adapt to these changes and secure the future of Midnight Society", as well as its debut title&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>, a "significant workforce reduction" was necessary. The rep doesn't confirm exactly how many people have been laid off.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>content creator and Midnight Society Founder (that's Founder with a capital F; it's a confusing bit of jargon on the studio's part) <a href="https://x.com/JOK5RR/status/1833294762054455379" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jok5rr</a>, "roughly 50%" of Midnight Society's dev team was hit by the cuts. That's a very significant reduction indeed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/midnight-society-deadrop-layoffs.jpg?itok=9-A0l6aA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/midnight-society-deadrop-layoffs.jpg?itok=VOFVDIqm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Midnight Society is currently working on&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>, but layoffs might impact the game's development.</figcaption></figure><p>The Midnight Society rep told PC Gamer that despite the layoffs and "challenges" the studio is facing, Midnight Society remains "dedicated to launching&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>in 2025".</p>
<p>While Midnight Society doesn't explicitly name the challenges it's talking about, it's pretty much certain that at least one of them relates to the downfall of Dr. Disrespect, who was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dr-disrespect-fired-midnight-society-sexting-minor">fired from the studio in June</a> following allegations of sexting a minor.</p>
<p>As PC Gamer points out,&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>is pretty closely linked to Dr. Disrespect, real name Guy Beahm; it adopts his 80s-inspired cyberpunk-style aesthetic, and some of the game's in-game text references Beahm's catchphrases.</p>
<p>Midnight Society co-founder Robert Bowling says that he and the studio will be sharing their "revised plans and milestones" soon, so we'll get to see how these layoffs have impacted the development of&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>before long.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dr.-disrespect-midnight-society-deadrop.jpg?itok=GW5EZiYA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dr.-disrespect-midnight-society-deadrop.jpg?itok=6Z3UmUIm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The now-disgraced Dr. Disrespect formed a key part of Midnight Society and&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>'s messaging.</figcaption></figure><p>Midnight Society's layoffs come against the backdrop of a wider wave that has seen major companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">Take-Two</a> swept up in it, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-developer-singularity-6-layoffs">many</a> smaller <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs">studios</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, the&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>&nbsp;developer's case is a somewhat special one given the controversy surrounding Beahm and the allegations against him, but nevertheless, these layoffs are part of a wider pattern. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/">was announced on Tuesday</a>, and it has gotten a wide range of feedback. From people being excited about what in can do to others frustrated over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the large price increase</a>, there’s no shortage of opinions. The big question, however, is how will the PS5 Pro sell on the market?</p>



<p>According to one analyst <a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/insight/ps5-pro-sony-pulls-its-pro-strategy-lever-to-engage-playstation-enthusiasts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Ampere Analysis</a>, the PS5 Pro should sell similarly to that of the PS4 Pro.</p>



<p>Piers Harding-Rolls, a games industry analyst at the company, believes that that PS5 Pro will sell around 13 million units by 2029. As far as its launch window, the company thinks that 1.3 million or so consoles will be sold. That prediction puts it just shy of the 1.7 million PS4 Pro consoles sold during its 2016 launch window.</p>



<p>“We expect the price point to soften demand with some consumers, but for PlayStation enthusiasts the pricing is less of a consideration,” he writes.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-the-ps5-pro-price-so-high">Why is the PS5 Pro Price So High?</h2>



<p>As far as that price point of the new system is concerned, Harding-Rolls acknowledges the discourse around the topic. With a 40%-50% increase, he says there are a few reasons for the $699.99 price point.</p>



<p>“PS5 Pro pricing reflects Sony’s adjusted strategy to protect its margin, generally supply chain inflation and a lack of direct competitor to its mid-cycle upgrade compared to last generation (where Microsoft was preparing the Xbox One X),” he said. “The lack of competition means it is an easier decision for Sony to run with a higher price point to protect its existing margins. </p>



<p>“For most prospective PS5 consumers, the standard edition will represent the value sweet spot.”</p>



<p>The PS5 Pro releases on November 7.</p>



<p>What do you think of Harding-Rolls’ predictions on how the PS5 Pro will sell? Let us know in the comments or join the discussion in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new community forum</a>!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-patch-notes-hotfix/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/check-out-the-space-marine-2-patch-notes-for-the-new-hotfix.977910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-patch-notes-hotfix/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s always welcome when a developer pays attention to the community and addresses problems within the game. Even one as exciting and excellent as Space Marine 2 isn’t immune to bugs and glitches. But the game’s most recent hotfix solves many issues, including some crashes. So, here are the Space Marine 2 patch notes!</p>



<h2 id="h-full-space-marine-2-patch-notes">Full Space Marine 2 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>The latest Space Marine 2 patch notes are straightforward, solving many of the community’s issues in one sweep!</p>



<p><strong>Crashes and Bug Fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed some rare possible crashes when starting the game</li>



<li>Fixed a rare possible crash that occurred during the first cutscene</li>



<li>Fixed several other rare crashes</li>



<li>Fixed several rare bugs that were causing soft locks in the story mode</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>PC Only</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Optimized CPU behavior on high end CPUs</li>
</ul>



<p>Developer Saber Interactive said, “On top of that first quick fix, we’re preparing a bigger patch for later in September.” The patch they’re talking about includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ultrawide support</li>



<li>Private PvE lobbies</li>



<li>Sparring Arena in the Battle Barge</li>
</ul>



<p>Overall, this hotfix and the one planned for late this month prove rather small but potent. The fixes for the crashes, which plague much of the community, are welcome!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-download-the-hotfix">How to Download the Hotfix</h2>



<p>While your system should automatically download the hotfix the next time you boot up the console or your PC, it doesn’t always work that way. You may need to select the game and manually check for an update.</p>



<p>On Steam, check your Downloads page for an awaiting update. Alternatively, you may need to close and reopen the launcher entirely to force the update through. If that doesn’t work, right-click the game and select Properties, Installed Files, and then verify the integrity of the game files. If there’s an update, it will automatically download for you.</p>



<p>On consoles, select the game and, depending on your system, choose the option to check for recent updates.</p>



<p>Did you know we now have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a> where you can discuss Space Marine 2 and other happenings in the gaming industry! Come check it out and join the conversation!</p>

            <p>Escaping from hell while bound to your nearest and dearest is always going to be somewhat chaotic, but a new Chained Together update is about to amplify that chaos even more.</p>
<p>If you have no idea what I am talking about, Chained Together is a co-op sim that tasks players with climbing up and out of hell itself. This is made more difficult by the fact that you are chained to your chums while making your ascent, so if one falls… Well, let's just say you all have to deal with the consequences.</p>

<p>Developer Anegar Games is now turning up the heat even more, with an update for Chained Together that allows you to create and share custom maps for others to negotiate.</p>
<p>Chained Together's Integrated Map Editor can be accessed from the main menu via the Workshop button. Here, players will be able to flex their hellish creative muscles with a variety of tools which will "facilitate the creation of challenges, interactions, and unique mechanics".</p>
<p>Here are some key bullet points, as laid out by Anegar Games on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2567870/view/4606707511976656411">Steam</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenges: Discover new challenges made possible by the map editor.</li>
<li>Logical Interactions: Add buttons, triggers, and object movement mechanisms.</li>
<li>Environmental Manipulation: You can play with object visibility, their collisions, and even create splines to control movements or craft new environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any newly created maps can then be published with the rest of the Chained Together community.</p>
<p>"To play a mode created by the community, first subscribe to it via the Workshop button in the startup menu," Anegar Games explained. "When creating the game, select Workshop as the game mode and choose from the modes you are subscribed to."</p>
<p>The Chained Together team has also revised the settings interface with this update. This, it said, will allow for "more intuitive" navigation.</p>
<p>So, are you ready to take on more <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chained-together-is-highly-entertaining-in-vr-thanks-to-praydogs-uevr-mod">hellish challenges in Chained Together</a>? </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-confirms-dragon%E2%80%99s-dogma-2-to-get-new-patch-for-all-platforms.977892/</guid>

			<p>Capcom has confirmed that Dragon's Dogma 2 will receive a patch on all platforms and a PlayStation 5 Pro Enhanced patch after the console was announced yesterday. Although Dragon's Dogma 2 is a beloved game, it isn't to say it's without issues. There are a couple of performance issues due to how realistic the graphics are, making it a little bit difficult to run on PC on any high settings, regardless of how powerful your rig is.</p>
<p>Capcom confirmed this patch after Sony announced that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-motivated-amds-development-of-advanced-ray-tracing-says-mark-cerny/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> will cost $700 and will have a list of first- and third-party games with PS5 Pro Enhanced updates when the console comes out in November. So far, up to 50 PS5 Pro Enhanced games, including Dragon's Dogma 2, are available at launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon's Dogma 2 - Main Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cT0rIgaiPWA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So far, there are minimal details about what the PS5 Pro Enhanced patch will consist of, with Capcom saying it will offer "a gaming experience that takes advantage of PS5 Pro's features." The bare minimum should be at least to run the game consistently at 60 frames per second, with a 4K resolution from utilizing the Enhanced features. Dragon's Dogma 2 was released in March on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S with a slew of performance problems, which have mostly been fixed in recent updates. However, in areas with many NPCs, the game can still be incredibly framey and challenging to get through.</p>
<p>"We will soon be releasing an update for all platforms that will further improve CPU load, reduce crashes and bring additional adjustments. Further details will be announced as soon as they are ready," said Capcom in a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/DragonsDogma/status/1833689207522607457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement on social media</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the issues that Dragon's Dogma 2 has had with performance and trying to get the game to run smoothly regardless of platform, it has been a huge success for Capcom, and sold just over <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-breaks-3-million-units-sold-milestone/">2.5 million units in 11 days</a>, despite the huge amount of controversy that the game had upon release. This wasn't just due to the performance issues, but also due to the microtransactions that were available for people to purchase. However, the anger calmed down quickly once people realized that these were supplies and items you could get in the game for free, and buying them just allowed you to fast-track through the game.</p>
<p>The patches are great news for fans of the game. However, what would be the cherry on top is&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news of DLC</a>, which has been speculated about for quite some time now, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-dlc-teased-by-capcom-survey/">previous surveys from Capcom</a> suggesting it may be in the works.</p>

Brrrrr, that first time you see the ghoulish CG soup that is supposed to be a reanimated Grand Moff Tarkin. It turns out that, some eight years later, a close friend of the late actor Peter Cushing is claiming his permission should have been sought, and is attempting to sue Disney.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193897" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="418" data-playlist="193897,194664,194499" data-current="193897"><div><p>10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19360.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As reported by the UK’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thetimes.com/article/peter-cushings-star-wars-resurrection-at-centre-of-legal-battle-vsp8ssjg2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/peter-cushings-star-wars-resurrection-at-centre-of-legal-battle-vsp8ssjg2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Times</em></a></span>, one Kevin Francis is taking Lucasfilm to court on the basis that Cushing had arranged with him that no one should be allowed to recreate the actor’s visage without Francis’ permission. Disney had previously attempted to have this thrown out on the basis that there was no evidence of “unjust enrichment,” but London’s High Court said nay, and are allowing the proceedings to continue.</p><p>Peter Cushing lived a long life until 1994, when he died aged 81, leaving behind a legacy of wonderful cinema and radio. To Brits, he and his long-time colleague Christopher Lee are the iconic actors fronting a million gloriously hammy horror films, the likes of <em>The Satanic Rites of Dracula</em>, <em>The House That Dripped Blood</em>, and my absolute favo(u)rite, <em>Island of Terror*</em>. To <em>Star Wars</em> fans, they’re Moff Tarkin and Count Dooku respectively.<br></p><p>Come <em>Rogue One</em>, a film apparently everyone but me really likes, it was decided therein to revive the character of Grand Ol’ Tarkin, via Modern Movie Magic. Which is to say, that wretched uncanny valley horror-mask deep-faking that is the CG faces that plagued the movies of the 2010s. (See also <em>Tron: Legacy.</em>) The gloopy plasticine rendition of Cushing’s face was clearly meant to be a crowd-pleasing moment, but instead drove children screaming into rivers.</p><p>While the use of dead actors’ faces in movies and commercials is a frequent topic of ethics, it seems in this case Kevin Francis is certain Disney and Lucasfilm didn’t have the correct permissions, because he claims Cushing had specifically asked him and his film production company, Tyburn Film Productions, to protect his image after his death. He’s also suing, according to <em>The Times</em>, the executors of Cushing’s estate (who are dead), and Cushing’s former agency, Associated International Management.</p><p>Francis, who made horror movies with Cushing in the 1970s, says Cushing signed a contract with him in 1993, that didn’t allow others to use his image without Francis’ permission. He’s seeking something under £500,000 from Lucasfilm.</p><p>Disney, meanwhile, are saying that they didn’t need anyone’s permission because of the contract Cushing signed back in 1977. Which...well, you can see why a judge might be interested in seeing this go to court. Can a contract written in the 1970s possibly contain clauses that allow a company to use state-of-the-art (albeit god-awful) computer technology to recreate an actor’s face and voice some 40 years later? When Cushing’s agent coughed loudly at Disney back at the time of <em>Rogue One</em>, they paid a rather paltry £28,000 ($36,600) to clear the use.</p><p>Disney first attempted to have the case thrown out in December, lost and appealed, and this week lost again. So it goes to trial! And it should be a fascinating one, given the power discrepancies involved, and the tenuous nature of everyone’s claims over the dead man’s face.</p><figure id="" data-id="48f968db74bd82cbbabebbce90ef88cb" data-recommend-id="image://48f968db74bd82cbbabebbce90ef88cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Peter Cushing studying the victim's blood under a microscope." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Peter Cushing studying the victim's blood under a microscope." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Planet Film Productions / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="48f968db74bd82cbbabebbce90ef88cb" data-recommend-id="image://48f968db74bd82cbbabebbce90ef88cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Peter Cushing studying the victim's blood under a microscope." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>*I can’t not bang on a bit more about <em>Island of Terror</em>. The 1966 film is set on a remote island off the coast of Ireland, where dead bodies are showing up <em>without any bones inside them</em>. It turns out the cause of this is some silicate monsters accidentally created by a Dr. Lawrence Phillips, after his attempt to cure cancer when horribly wrong.

That’s before you buy a disc drive and a vertical stand, which will run you another $110. The company is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-playstation-everything-announced-specs-price-1851644090&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-playstation-everything-announced-specs-price-1851644090">asking for nearly a grand</a></span> to get the full experience, all in the name of a technical leap forward. But how noticeable is the PS5 Pro’s increased power, really? Is it worth the extra $200? Is it worth buying a new system if you own the original?<br></p><p>Sony showed a few comparison shots during its presentation, and by and large, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-reactions-social-media-graphics-1851644651&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-reactions-social-media-graphics-1851644651">the internet wasn’t that impressed</a></span>. In fairness, Twitch and YouTube videos will only be able to show a compressed image that won’t truly capture what these games would look like on your TV. On paper, a system that doesn’t require you to give up frame rate for fidelity sounds exciting, and the PS5 Pro is still cheaper than the average high-end PC. But for a console, that price tag screams “prohibitively expensive premium device mostly meant for the biggest of graphics sickos.” Some of the comparisons Sony made in its presentation had only the most minute differences between versions, but they will likely look significantly better on the giant TV you’ve got in your living room.</p><p>Whether that’s enough to merit a new purchase is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-reaction-framerate-graphics-60fps-performance-1851644758&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-reaction-framerate-graphics-60fps-performance-1851644758">in the eye of the beholder</a></span>, but the console is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-pre-order-how-when-price-is-it-available-help-1851644774?rev=1725989555550&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-pre-order-how-when-price-is-it-available-help-1851644774?rev=1725989555550">going up for pre-order</a></span> on September 26 and will launch on November 7. That’s not a lot of time to save up a spare $700, but you’ll at least have a couple of months to decide if the PS5 Pro is worth your time and money.</p><p>Here are some of the confirmed games getting a PS5 Pro patch with comparisons between the games running on the original PS5 and the new hardware.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It takes the genre at an unusual angle and offers something unexpected at every turn.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You arrive at the Archipelago on a strange mission: to kill the Deity, a mystical creature that everyone talks about, but no one has seen. To find the Deity, you will have to delve deep into the many secrets these islands keep. You will discover a place marked by tragedy, and filled with eccentric characters and remarkable contrasts.</p><p>Upgrade your cane with new parts and unlock new abilities, to explore the hidden corners of the Archipelago and face incredible creatures.</p><p><strong>Hand Crafted to the Smallest Detail</strong></p><p><em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> is the result of years of work by people who love and appreciate the same cartoons, comics and games that you do. We wanted to make an uncompromising 2D game of amazing beauty, so we went back to the genre’s roots and took the most difficult path possible – meticulously drawn, colored and animated by hand using classic frame-by-frame techniques. We didn’t cut any corners, and the results are worth it. In <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em>, no two rooms or landscapes are alike. Every place, every object, every character, every visual effect — everything is carefully planned and executed to the finest detail.</p><p>Remember how, when you were a child, you first saw your first 16-bit platformer and couldn’t believe your eyes?

The game carefully includes everything we all love most about side-scrollers, across the various styles, trends and eras. And it leaves out all the frustrating stuff that doesn’t make sense and wastes time.</p><p>It’s a challenging platformer that demands precision, but it never devolves into a grueling exercise where you have to memorize and methodically execute an exact sequence of <a title="Genres > Action [2,142 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. The key to success is improvisation and ingenuity.</p><p>It’s a game that encourages exploration and will give you a sense of discovery—but it won’t have you backtracking in confusion after you gain each new ability or artifact. It’s impossible to spend much time wandering around in <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> without doing anything interesting.</p><p>Finally, it’s a game with complex scenes, robust characters and a multi-layered story—but it never gets bogged down in thoughtful poses and feigned pretension. All the elements work to create an adventure that takes your breath away and breaks your heart.</p></blockquote><p><em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,884 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,040 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,982 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,177 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2254950/The_Eternal_Life_of_Goldman/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

					<p>Open-world racing games have become fairly commonplace in recent years, but before the likes of Forza Horizon or The Crew rolled out, we had Test Drive Unlimited. Despite innovating many staples of the modern open-world racer, the franchise has laid dormant since 2011, so there was a fair amount of excitement when a third entry in the series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a>, was announced back in 2020.</p>
<p>Now that the game has finally arrived after several delays, does Test Crown Unlimited Solar Crown return the series to the top of the open-world racer leaderboard? Or should this franchise have stayed in the garage? Time to fuel up and find out.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Most attempts to deliver narrative in open-world racing games are pretty regrettable, but even given that low bar, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown’s world and story (if you can really call it a story) are exceptionally uninspired. Players can join one of two clans, the posh Sharps or the cool and edgy (“cool” being very much in quotation marks) Streets. None of the characters you meet on either side are interesting in the least, with the only benefit to joining a side being some unique cosmetics and challenges.</p>
<p>But again, you don’t play this type of game for the story. The racing is what’s most important, and on that basic level, Solar Crown largely delivers. The game is developed by KT Racing, which previously stewarded the long-running and generally well-liked WRC franchise, so they know what they’re doing when it comes to basic driving physics and handling. This is no hardcore sim, with cars that obediently drift around corners with a quick tap of the handbrake, but it’s a bit less arcade-like than a lot of other competitors in this space. Cars feel properly weighty and there are number of options to make the game more sim-ish if that’s your thing. The game makes good use of the PS5’s adaptive triggers for acceleration and breaking and the sense of speed when you put the hammer down is impressive, even in lower-level vehicles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Perhaps most refreshingly, Solar Crown avoids the issues many other open-world racers have with confusing and/or overly-cluttered course layouts. This game’s circuits are generally clean, easy to follow, and free of annoying excessive debris that unnecessarily slows down your momentum. Solar Crown’s courses often feel as well laid-out as ones you’d find in a more traditional closed circuit racer, which is a rather difficult thing to pull off.</p>
<p>So far, my impressions of Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown may sound fairly positive, but an open-world racer can’t slack on the open-world part. Unfortunately, that’s where this game wobbles. While generally quite drivable, Solar Crown’s version of Hong Kong feels lifeless, which is a bit of a feat when you’re drawing inspiration from one of the most bustling and stimulating places on earth. This game’s Hong Kong is made largely of empty roads, neat and orderly back alleys, and sterile wilderness.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Visuals that would have been considered middle-of-the-road a generation ago don’t infuse this tame version of Hong Kong with much extra excitement. This is particularly true on the PS5, which offers two visual modes: Quality and Performance. The former is almost unplayably chuggy with lots of extra visual glitches, while the latter drops the resolution to 1080p and still can’t maintain a solid 60fps, with busy nighttime races being a particular sore spot. As you’d expect, Solar Crown does look better on PC, but the game laughs in the face of optimization, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-gets-steam-demo-and-pc-requirements-rtx-4090-needed-for-4k60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an RTX 4070 and DLSS being required to run the game at High settings and 1440p</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond the general blandness, there’s just not a lot to&nbsp;<em>do</em> in Solar Crown’s open world, or at least not much that feels unique or leaves a strong impression. There are your standard race types like multi-lap circuits, sprints, and time attack challenges, as well as some more original offerings, like Domination Races, where you earn points based on your placing as you pass through gates, and Clan Races, where your results contribute to your overall team standing. In practice, though, neither Domination nor Clan Races feel all that unique when you’re in the midst of them. Beyond races, there are the baseline activities you’d expect to see in any open-world racer – speed traps, hidden car wrecks, etc. – and not much more. Don’t expect any new or novel ideas here.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Past entries in the Test Drive Unlimited series have offered then-innovative sim features, like the ability to trick out your own house and visit an in-game casino, but unfortunately, this aspect of Solar Crown is very underdeveloped. You’re given a largely featureless and purposeless apartment that grows in size somewhat as you level up, but don’t expect any real customization options. You can unlock cosmetics for your avatar, but your character is so seldom seen and so goofy-looking when it is that there is not much point.</p>
<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown’s online features don’t add much to the package. You can join other players’ races and even challenge other humans you encounter in the world to impromptu “Instant Challenges,” but both of these things are fleetingly rare as only around a dozen players will ever be exploring the map with you at once, and, usually, it feels like far less than that.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown9.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The short list of benefits offered by Solar Crown’s online features certainly don’t justify the <em>many</em> downsides they come shackled to. Solar Crown is an always-online game that requires you to sign up for both a MyNacon account and PS Plus or Game Pass Core on consoles to even get past the title screen. Even then, that’s not a guarantee, as I was frequently locked out of the game by server issues or the game’s inability to log me into my account.&nbsp;<span>Even when I got into the game, the lobby system would frequently be broken, which is a problem because the game forces you into lobbies&nbsp;<em>just in case</em> another human player might want to join you, even though you'll mostly play against AI opponents.</span> If the lobby system is down, you can only do free-roam activities or single-player challenges like time attacks.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown11.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>And the headaches don’t stop there! Your Solar Crown save is stored in the cloud (there’s nothing on your local drive) and anything related to saving is extremely wonky. A short list of issues I’ve had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Progress and XP earned from races not being properly recorded.</li>
<li>Landmarks I’ve discovered not being saved.</li>
<li>Time attack ghosts not being saved, or, alternatively, seemingly random ghosts showing up.</li>
<li>And the coup de grâce, I completely lost my progress at one point. Thankfully, I only lost about two hours, but I’ve heard tales of others losing much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s all a bit of a mess. Updates have been released, and further fixes have been promised, but I haven’t noticed much improvement and am not particularly optimistic about how Solar Crown will perform when it launches wide this week. The unreliability of the game’s servers and cloud saves make what might have been a passable, if unremarkable, open-world racer <em>very</em> hard to want to invest any time in.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/haF4IjS-_8k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And you’ll have to invest time to get anywhere. Solar Crown’s devs have touted an old-school progression system that forces you to really earn cars, and sure enough, the sweetest rides require you to grind to a high level and shell out a hefty amount of in-game cash, but it’s hard not to feel like this was done to disguise a fairly paltry car list. Solar Crown only offers around 100 rides at launch, well short of the 800-something in a competitor like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/forza-horizon-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>, and while Nacon has promised plenty of post-launch support, “you have to wait for seasonal updates for content” and “we’re keeping progression old-school” are two messages that can’t really share the road.</p>
<p><em>This review was based on a PS5 Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown code provided by publisher Nacon. </em></p>

<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown offers some solid fundamentals in terms of driving mechanics and course design, to the point the game might have been worth a qualified recommendation despite its surprisingly-bland recreation of Hong Kong, so-so visuals, and spotty performance, but ultimately, the game’s egregious always-online requirements make that impossible. Persistent server issues and a completely unreliable cloud save system send this racer careening off-track and it’s going to take some serious elbow grease to get this Solar Crown shining like it ought to.</p>

<p>Gameplay footage of Call of Duty: Future Warfare, internally called NX1 has leaked online.</p>



<p>NX1 was developed around 2010 by Neversoft following Infinity Ward’s major restructuring after Jason West and Vince Zempalla left the studio. Neversoft moved on from the development of Guitar Hero and started worked on NX1, which was going to be called ‘Call of Duty: Future Warfare’. </p>



<p>Now, nearly 15 years later from its development and eventual cancellation, gameplay footage of the game has started to appears online in mass. According to those who <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-warfare-beta-build-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been able to download and play the game</a>, it features an almost fully-complete campaign. Of course, the game was in early development, but the gameplay footage is fascinating to watch. You can see various clips and gameplay that we’ve found down below:</p>
