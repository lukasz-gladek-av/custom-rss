The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-playstation-5-slim-price-release-date-disc-sony-1850914699&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-playstation-5-slim-price-release-date-disc-sony-1850914699">PS5 Slim was revealed last October</a></span>, and came out in November 2023, offering a trimmer version of the four-year-old console. Almost a year later would be about the right time to announce a pre-Christmas launch of a souped-up version of the machine.</p><p>Rumors of the Pro have swirled for a while, beginning around the end of 2023 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RinoTheBouncer/status/1734139732810969273?s=20&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RinoTheBouncer/status/1734139732810969273?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with claims it was being developed as “Project Trinity,”</a></span> and followed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-leak-playstation-spectral-super-resolution-1851340782&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-leak-playstation-spectral-super-resolution-1851340782">in March this year with talk of proprietary upscaling</a></span>, under the amazing name of PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution. It was also claimed that it would almost three times as powerful as the current Xbox Series X’s 12 teraflops, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-pro-specs-leak-video-taken-down-by-sony-strike/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-pro-specs-leak-video-taken-down-by-sony-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony acting fast</a></span> to strike down videos containing such information.</p><p>According to billbil-kun, there are no big surprises for the name of the machine—the leaker claims it’ll just be known as the“PS5 Pro.” They also claim to have seen the packaging the console will come in, but in an attempt to avoid copywrite strikes, they’ve made the unusual move of drawing the design themselves! </p><figure id="" data-id="2d14b672f67cecbae0d290795fd8392e" data-recommend-id="image://2d14b672f67cecbae0d290795fd8392e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A claimed design of the PS5 Pro, sketched by billbil-kun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="2d14b672f67cecbae0d290795fd8392e" data-recommend-id="image://2d14b672f67cecbae0d290795fd8392e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A claimed design of the PS5 Pro, sketched by billbil-kun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It appears it’s very similar in design to the Slim, but for having the three black stripes down the side of its faceplates, rather than the previous one, and not surprisingly being slightly thicker.</p><p>The packaging allegedly seen by <em>Dealabs</em> showed a device without a disc drive, suggesting it might be a separate add-on again, letting people cut costs if they’d rather go digital-only.</p><p>The key information here is the claim that the announcement will be in the next few weeks. This, again, aligns with Sony’s habits. While this would be coming a year later than the announcement of the PS4 Pro, that also came in September with a November release date, but that extra time between original release and Pro launch is easily explained by the year of complete turmoil that followed the launch of the console in the wake of the global pandemic and chip shortages.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

My representative works include <em><a title="Series > Shin Megami Tensei [93 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/shin-megami-tensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a> III</em>, <em><a title="Games > Persona 3 [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/persona-3">Persona 3</a></em>, <em>4</em>, and <em>5</em>.</p><p>In previous showcases, we’ve revealed the general flow of the game, as well as the combat and story elements. In this ATLUS-exclusive showcase, World Tour Edition, we will be going over the “journey” aspects, a wonderful hallmark of fantasy <a title="Genres > RPG [16,572 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a>.</p><p>The journey gameplay is what uniquely sets this game apart from the <em><a title="Series > Persona [84 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a></em> and <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em> series. I’m extremely excited to share the details with you all. For today’s Exclusive Showcase, World Tour Edition, I’ll be sharing brand new, never-before-seen content. For RPG fans as well as those who are first learning about <em><a title="Platforms > Meta [120 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>phor</em> through this showcase, I hope you see the fun <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,723 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> you can experience through this game.</p><p>Without further ado, let us depart to the world of <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>. I hope you stick with us until the very end.</p><p><strong>■ The Start of the Journey</strong></p><p>First, let us start by reviewing the beginning of the game: the story is set in the United Kingdom of Euchronia. The protagonist is on a mission with his fairy companion, Galica, to save his friend, the prince, from a curse. During his journey, he awakens an Archetype, The Seeker. In order to save the prince, he has to defeat the person who cast it. And not only did they curse the prince, the culprit also assassinated the king. The protagonist travels to the Royal Capital to take him down.</p><p>However, upon the king’s death, the king evoked royal magic, which began the Royal Tournament, where the people’s faith is the key to select the next king. As a result, the entire kingdom is thrown into chaos. In all the turmoil, the protagonist makes the decision to participate in the Royal Tournament for the throne, to catch the culprit, Louis. This is how they begin their battle—a journey that takes them all across the kingdom, traveling on a mechanical carriage called the Gauntlet Runner.</p><p><strong>■ Old Castle Town Martira</strong></p><p>This is a town out in the countryside that the party visits in the beginning of the story. While we designed the game to incrementally increase freedoms for the player, obtaining a Gauntlet Runner after the story prologue increases the player’s ability to travel around.</p><p>Let’s explore the town. At each destination are activities unique to that area. In this town, there’s a test of courage where you bungee jump up a cliff. You can also do things like milk cows. Through these activities, you can increase your virtues as a traveler. Increasing these virtues enables you to take on new requests.</p><p>It’s up to you, the player, on how you want to spend every single day of your journey before encountering your main quest. Leading up to your main quests, you can strengthen your forces by completing side quests, increase your bonds with your followers, or do activities that increase the protagonist’s virtues. You have the freedom to choose what you want to do each day, much like real life.</p><p>If you want to improve your fighting abilities, you can visit the recruitment center to accept side requests called bounties to exterminate monsters. We took on a request to exterminate a monster called Valmo. You get information on its whereabouts, but there’s no need to head out immediately if you’re not prepared for the fight.</p><p>This person standing outside looks like he has a request for us. We’ve been asked to buy something from a nearby town. There’s a stop on the way to the labyrinth where the Valmo is, for the extermination request we took on. There’s a lot of people in town that have information. There’s some who will talk to you about the main quest, but in this town, you can also ask about the town’s specialties. Among these people, the informant is particularly valuable for getting intel. They’re useful resources, as you can learn more about rumors as well as the habits of monsters that you might come across. But the information costs money. If you’re confident in your fighting abilities, you could choose to tackle enemies without buying the information beforehand.</p><p>Here’s someone who can tell us about how the Royal Tournament is going. The protagonist’s goal is to get closer to Louis, who also has the ability to become king himself because of the royal magic. Let’s see what our current standing is. Looks like we’re quite a ways from being in the public eye. This ranking changes through story development, but it also increases through completing quests.</p><p>As you can see, the player has a lot of options on how they want to spend each day of their journey. You can use the online feature, Traveler’s Voices, to see how other players spent that day. You can also use it to reference the party formations of other players who beat the quest you’re tackling. Each player will have their own day-to-day way of progressing through their journey as they move through the story, which is one of the true charms <em>Metaphor</em> offers.</p><p>Let’s move on and see how it’s like to travel on a Gauntlet Runner.</p><p><strong>■ Traveling on the Gauntlet Runner</strong></p><p><strong>Expeditions on the Gauntlet Runner</strong></p><p>When you open the map, your allies will give advice on destinations and tell you what the schedule will be. We have two requests to do in Komero, so let’s head there.</p><p>It’s dangerous outside of town, so traveling is done by Gauntlet Runner. While on the road, you can do things you might do in real life when on a camper van, such as reading or <a title="Genres > Cooking [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>. How you perform in battle can vary greatly depending on how you decide to prepare yourself while en route somewhere.</p><p><strong>Passing Time in the Gauntlet Runner</strong></p><p>Your allies have their own things they do while on the Gauntlet Runner. Let’s try talking to Strohl to see what he’s up to. He invited us to do weapon maintenance with him. It looks like maintaining your weapon hones your Courage. By improving your virtues like this, others’ perception of the protagonist changes. It’s particularly indispensable for gaining cooperation from your Followers, so we should do what we can to raise these virtues. </p><p>Players are free to choose how they spend their time while on the gauntlet runner. You can make special items in the kitchen, or even do laundry with your allies. Looks like we found an item from the laundry; someone must have been hiding it.</p><p>Like how you spend time in town, players can choose what to do and enjoy their journey at a smooth pace. You can also stop by a nearby village if there is one. We got something; let’s go hand it to our ally right away.</p><p>We’ve finished our request from Neuras, the gauntlet runner engineer. Thanks to that, we awakened the Gunner Archetype. Completing quests like this is an important factor for deepening your bonds with your followers.</p><p>Let’s go buy the eggs that someone requested we get for them. They’re also selling bath salts that you can’t find in town. You can buy valuable items like this on your travels, so you should try visiting as many places as you can.</p><p><strong>■ <a title="Platforms > Quest [120 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a> Dungeons</strong></p><p>Looks like the gauntlet runner arrived at the labyrinth called “Man-Eater’s <a title="Games > Grotto [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/grotto">Grotto</a>.” Let’s try channeling that Gunner Archetype we just got. The Gunner can attack quickly from afar in Fast Battle, so it’s relatively easy to get an advantage and move to a Squad Battle, even for those who aren’t that good with real-time <a title="Genres > Action [2,129 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>.</p><p>In Squad Battle, the Gunner shoots ranged physical attacks and also maintains its attack power from the back row. One of the benefits of improving your bonds with your followers is that you can obtain new Archetypes, which gives you more strategies to use in battle in addition to unlocking all kinds of useful abilities you can use in battle.</p><p>By the way, you can always return to your base town from the dungeon in an instant, so if you feel underleveled, you can always retreat. If you can’t complete a dungeon within a day, you can set up camp in front of the dungeon and go back to tackling it the next day. However, don’t get too distracted on tackling dungeons that you forget the time limit for your main mission.</p><p><strong>In the Belly of the Worm</strong></p><p>What we just looked at were dungeons for the mini side quests we have in store for you, but let’s take a look at another kind of dungeon as well. Here’s a first look at a main quest dungeon: it’s the belly of a giant worm, believe it or not! It’s a dungeon with a special time limit since you have to escape before you get digested and dissolve.</p><p>There are a lot of creative fantasy dungeons that await you on your journey in <em>Metaphor</em>. We’ve prepared a lot of dungeons, big and small, and we hope you look forward to them. Now then, let’s continue on with the main quest.</p><p>Now then, let’s continue on with our journey!</p><p><strong>■ Port Brilehaven</strong></p><p>Here’s a first look at the town, Port Brilehaven. It’s a lively port town where sailors come and go. First, let’s head towards the port itself. You can see a lot of street stalls lined up.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the armor shop. Thanks to one of my followers’ abilities, I can get a discount here. And after talking to the owner, it seems like there’ll be a sale soon.</p><p>Here’s the port area. There’s some strange balls of water. There are a lot of strange sights throughout the area of Brilehaven. There’s also a coliseum further inside the city. Can you tell how many things are in store for you to do?</p><p>Let’s keep walking. Now we’re in the area where the tavern is. There are a lot of inns, too. Business is booming from people coming in for the Royal Tournament for the throne.</p><p>Here is a seafood restaurant, which you might expect from an ocean town.</p><p>The more you progress through the story, the more there is for you to do. If you’re unsure about what to do, you can always press teh Ask Gallica button to ask your fairy companion for advice. She’ll always help show you around, like a concierge for your travels.</p><p><strong>■ Travel Routines</strong></p><p><strong>Planning Your Travel Route</strong></p><p>Your travel map will slowly get more and more complex. As you can see on this screen, there are multiple routes you can take to get to the same location. If you visit multiple places in one stretch, the number of days you use will decrease proportionally, but you may end up needing to tackle battle after battle, so you’ll need the power to match. Planning your travel route is another area of the game where you’ll have to strategize carefully.</p><p><strong>Campsites</strong></p><p>Despite how tough gauntlet runners are, it’s still dangerous to go around at night because of the monsters running free. So at night, the party pause their travels and rest up at a campsite. Here, you can take your pick of nighttime activities,  such as having a relaxed conversation with your allies, or taking a bath.</p><p>Let’s try taking a soak in the cask tub at the back of the deck. While we’re at it, let’s use the bath salt that we bought at one of the villages before. It has a relaxing effect, which increased the protagonist’s stats. By the way, there are different kinds of bath salts available, which you can find as you travel throughout the land.</p><p><strong>Encountering the Scenic Sights</strong></p><p>Looks like we came across something. Another pleasure of traveling is coming across scenic sights you’d only see in another world. An ally will draw you a commemoration sketch. If you give it to one of your Followers, a young girl who’s awaiting your return in Grand Trad, will be happy.</p><p><strong>■ The Uncharted Isle: Virga Island</strong></p><p>Here’s another location reveal: a place called Virga Island. On this island, you can enjoy unique tracks themed after religious music composed by <a title="People > Shoji Meguro [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/people/shoji-meguro">Shoji Meguro</a>, who is well known for his work on the <em>Persona</em> series.</p><p>Here, the protagonist makes yet another new encounter. Her name is Eupha, a new ally that’s only now being revealed in this showcase. I wonder what role she plays in the protagonist’s journey. I hope you look forward to learning more about her in the future.</p><p><strong>■ Review</strong></p><p>So, what do you think? If you had to actually go on a long journey in real life, it wouldn’t be a simple endeavor. Taking that into account, we hope that you enjoy the journey of <em>Metaphor</em>, where you can travel as you please in the comfort of your own home.</p><p>Though we’ve largely focused on the profound fantasy elements <em>Metaphor</em>, simply, it is also a game filled with the joys of traveling from town to town, an element we hope for in fantasy RPGs.</p><p>Though this title is a rare attempt from us at the fantasy genre, we aim to make this a culmination of the efforts in our previous RPGs.</p><p>We hope everyone, including fans familiar with <em>Persona</em> and <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>, as well as those who love fantasy RPGs, enjoys playing <em>Metaphor</em>.</p><p>We’ve shared information on <em>Metaphor</em>‘s world setting and story, battle system, and other aspects of the game in other Showcases. Please feel free to take a look at those if you haven’t already.</p><p>The next Exclusive Showcase coming out this fall will reveal exciting new information. Please look forward to it.

            <p>
Doom has been ported to dozens of devices, but it's never been playable quite like this. 
</p>
<p>
Google researchers have now generated an AI version of the retro first-person shooter classic entirely via neural network, based on ingested video clips of gameplay.
</p>
<p>
It's a milestone, if a grim one, recorded in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14837">paper</a> published this week entitled "Diffusion models are real-time game engines" (thanks, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-gamengen-ai-breaks-new-ground-by-simulating-doom-without-a-game-engine/">VentureBeat</a>). This documents how a small team from Google were able to "interactively simulate" a version of Doom, with only a "slightly better than random chance" of humans being able to tell the difference.
</p>
<p>
Humans are still (currently) required to play Doom first, to provide the video clips of gameplay that are then fed into GameNGen, the research team's game engine which is "powered entirely by a neural model". It's the same principle as the now-commonplace ability for AI to learn from and then generate static images, based on ingesting huge amouts of dubiously-sourced data online.
</p>
<p>
GameNGen then produces sequential frames based on its learnings of 'watching' that gameplay, which are then output at 20fps with a visual quality "comparable to the original". Here's how it looks:

<p>
"Can a neural model running in real-time simulate a complex game at high quality?" the paper asks. "In this work we demonstrate that the answer is yes. While not an exact simulation, the neural model is able to perform complex game state updates, such as tallying health and ammo, attacking enemies, damaging objects, opening doors, and persist the game state over long trajectories. 
</p>
<p>
"GameNGen answers one of the important questions on the road towards a new paradigm for game engines, one where games are automatically generated, similarly to how images and videos are generated by neural models in recent years. Key questions remain, such as how these neural game engines would be trained and how games would be effectively created in the first place, including how to best leverage human inputs. We are nevertheless extremely excited for the possibilities of this new paradigm."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, a major Eurogamer investigation looked at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">how AI was already changing video game development forever</a> - with positive and negative results. A report from Unity in March claimed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">more than 60 percent of game developers were already using AI</a> at some stage in the development process.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/hands-on-civilization-vii-preview-one-for-the-ages/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If there’s one thing that never really made sense in Civilization games, it’s that the US of A could rival Ancient Egypt in a quest for supremacy, or that the British and Roman empires could run as contemporaries. That a single culture could persist through from prehistoric times, progress through countless technological leaps across the ages, and blast off into outer space to colonise the stars. The fact of the matter is that, for almost every meteoric rise of a nation throughout history, there has been a similarly meteoric collapse or massive internal change.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sid Meier’s Civilization VII - Official Gameplay Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tc3_EO6Bj2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s something that I guess a lot of developers started to think about all at once in the wake of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/21/civilization-vi-review/">Civilization 6</a>‘s 2016 release. Firaxis themselves took a stab at it with the Rise and Fall expansion, and the last couple years has seen <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/16/humankind-review-a-different-breed/">Humankind</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/26/millennia-review/">Millennia</a> and the soon-to-be-released Ara: History Untold. Now Firaxis is having another go with Civilization 7, incorporating the concept of ages and the rise and fall of empires into the very fabric of the game.</p>


<p>Underneath it all, Civ 7 will feel like Civ 6 a lot of the time. There’s common ground with the visual direction, the way that cities will sprawl across many map tiles, there’s still separated technology and civic trees, and the military doom stacks of earlier games won’t be making a return… though there is a fresh approach to marshaling your military forces. The biggest changes will come to the overarching structure of a game and the progression of your nation.</p>


<p>Each game of Civ 7 will feature three distinct ages –&nbsp;Antiquity, Exploration, Modern –&nbsp;that will last up to 200 turns per age, but can be spurred along by player action and progress. As each age draws to a close, your civilisation will have to deal with change that sweeps across the world, and crises beset all the global powers, forcing you to shift priorities. Barbarians appearing at the gates will always focus the mind, and could see you seeking peace with a rival nation as you prepare for the next transition –&nbsp;you actually get to choose which crises you face by picking crisis cards at the end of the age.</p>
<p>These are, to a certain extent, the end times for your nation, but really it’s just about choosing what comes next. You’ll have a choice of what civilisation you want to become, with the game giving you a few options that will look at the historically accurate succession, as well as how you’re actually playing. If, for example, your Egyptians are roving the world on horseback, you’ll be given the option of becoming Mongolia in the Age of Exploration.</p>
<p>Within each age you’ll have a handful of Legacy Paths you can choose to follow, mapping to the Science, Economic, Cultural and Military victory conditions, and giving you campaign-long bonuses as you pursue these directions. Early on you can select which path you wish to follow and then they’ll push quests to you that match more of what you want, and in turn will inform the successive civs you can pick.</p>
<p>It all adds up to a fascinating new perspective on the way that history is retold and remixed within the 4X genre. Still, alongside this high-level change there’s also plenty of smaller tweaks and changes to refine the fundamental gameplay.</p>

<p>Cities will still spread across the map one tile at a time, but Civ 7 is a bit more restrictive in making each tile you place link back to the main city, instead of having free reign within a broader area. As you build improvements, construct wonders and iconic landmarks, those will persist with you through the ages, even as the general buildings in a city change and modernise. I can’t wait to see how this actually comes together, blending together the ages.</p>
<p>Leaders and civilisations are now separated, so a leader can stay with your nation through the ages, but also allowing Firaxis to broaden the historical figures that they include, so there will be more scientists and philosophers alongside the staple historical heads of state.</p>

<p>On the diplomatic side of things, you now accrue Influence, which is what you need to perform actions against other players, using it to pass treaties, combine resources through endeavours like cultural exchanges and markets, and apply sanctions. It’s also needed to interact with independent states that gradually grow out of the little villages you can find across the globe, and which you can potentially establish good relations with a integrate with your empire down the line.</p>
<p>Finding those little towns and scoping out natural wonders, you’ll naturally do the early-game thing of flinging scouts out into the wider world, and they can now hop into a little boat and paddle up navigable rivers. Of course, as you bump into other nations, you’ll quickly find the need to defend yourself, and Civ 7 brings with it a new way to stack units together.</p>
<p>Essentially, you now have a way of creating an actual army, thanks to the introduction of Commanders. Where Civ 6 had a very restrictive form of unit stacking, a Commander lets you gather together up to six units and send them into battle together. It’s the Commander that will now accrue experience, level up and work through a skill tree in a fashion that’s emblematic of how historical armies can build a rich tradition and reputation, even as they are reinforced with new troops and military doctrines change. One thing you’ll be able to research is the ability to directly reinforce a Commander from your city, pathing them through the world automatically to keep your frontline army at full strength.</p>

<p>With a short 30 minutes hands on with the game, starting from the very beginning, we could barely scratch the surface of these refreshed gameplay mechanics and ideas –&nbsp;with only one city, I couldn’t see how city and civ-wide resources are handled, or really dig into how trade routes have been overhauled through diplomacy, for example –&nbsp;but just this first glimpse, and what Firaxis has presented, gives a thoroughly intriguing evolution of the series.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/civilization-vii-gameplay-revealed-with-february-release-date/">Civilization VII is heading to release on 11th February 2025</a>, and for the first time, it will be launching across both PC and consoles at the same time, available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-script-has-over-2-million-words.967068/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>director and lead writer Daniel Vávra has taken to social media to reveal just how many words you can expect from the upcoming RPG's script, and it's going to be a veritable behemoth.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1829121370845773942" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;Vávra says that he, along with lead designer Prokop Jirsa, have been "counting" how much the team has written for the hotly-anticipated game, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay">due out next year</a>.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;Vávra,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s script consists of around 2,200,000 words. Yes, you read that right: it's got more than two million words in it. By way of comparison, Tolstoy's&nbsp;<em>War and Peace</em>, one of the longest novels ever written, has around 580,000 words.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-soldiers.jpg?itok=cSqCea-o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-soldiers.jpg?itok=O05H8aVT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>sure has a lot of words in it.</figcaption></figure><p>As&nbsp;Vávra points out, <i>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</i>'s word count puts it in line with around "11,000 typical screenwriting pages", which constitutes about 100 scripts for two-hour movies (assuming they're not Aaron Sorkin movies, obviously) or 25 "average novels".</p>
<p>It's fair to say that judging by the number of words in its script alone,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is going to be a pretty mighty epic. Of course, having a lot of words doesn't necessarily mean they're all good words, so we'll have to wait and see if the quality can match the quantity.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-leak">the upcoming followup</a> to 2017's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance">realistic medieval RPG</a>&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>.</p>
<p>The game will once again pick up the story of Henry of Skalitz, who sets out on a journey to avenge his murdered parents. You'll explore a massive realistic world based on 15th-century Europe, discovering all kinds of characters and building your character as you go.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on February 11th. Stay tuned for more on this one, and while you wait, you can read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-review-thy-will-be-done">review of the original game right here</a>.</p>

This nifty little handheld lets you play your fave PS5 games on any screen in the house, streaming games directly from your console over Wi-Fi. That means you can keep the gaming going while someone else hogs the big screen. No more tussling with roommates for screen time. No more elbowing out annoying siblings. With a crisp 1080p display and all the haptic wizardry of the DualSense controller built-in, the Portal delivers that authentic PS5 experience in a pint-sized package. So you can do you, wherever you’d like.</p><h2 id="h89603"><a id=""></a><strong>Frigidaire Light Up Mini-Fridge</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="913eff7b0e1b9bb59e0af11e878e0c51" data-recommend-id="image://913eff7b0e1b9bb59e0af11e878e0c51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Graphic<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="913eff7b0e1b9bb59e0af11e878e0c51" data-recommend-id="image://913eff7b0e1b9bb59e0af11e878e0c51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nothing says <em>in it to win it</em> like the mini fridge, reliably stationed within arm’s reach so you can quench that thirst without actually prying your eyes from the screen. But if you did, you’d be positively tickled by the Jetsons vibe of the Frigidaire Light Up Mini-Fridge, a compact 3 pounds and available in four spacey colors—white, blue, stealth (black), and purplehaze (our favorite, obvi). The fridge is as functional as it is cool—it holds up to 6 cans and keeps them frosty. Not cold. Not cool. But legitimately frosty. Yes, the LED lights are over-the-top, but in the dead of night when it’s pitch dark and you’re jonesing for some cold water, you’ll be thankful for the DJ Frigidaire glow.</p><h2 id="h89604"><a id=""></a><strong>X-Wing Cosplay Mini Backpack</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="690c7984fafa382260410d36fbb61452" data-recommend-id="image://690c7984fafa382260410d36fbb61452" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Graphic<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="690c7984fafa382260410d36fbb61452" data-recommend-id="image://690c7984fafa382260410d36fbb61452" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> Pro-tip: indoctrinate your kids in the ways of the Force when they’re young and impressionable.

Avoid the gaming hangover with the Fallout Vault 33 Prescription Glasses from Gunnar, inspired by the iconic Fallout video game series. The amber-tinted lenses filter out harsh blue light, reducing digital eye strain and fatigue during long gaming sessions. They’re lightweight and flexible, so they won’t pinch your temples if you’re wearing a headset. Best of all, the frames, which can be outfitted with prescription lenses, boast a cool, retro-futuristic design that rival anything you’ll get from any luxury maker.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-victim-long-development-time-playstation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Concord, PlayStation’s online hero shooter from first-party studio Firewalk, launched this week to a Steam <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-shooter-concord-debuts-to-a-tragic-697-concurrent-players-on-steam"><u>concurrent player count high of 697</u></a>, according to SteamDB. To describe the launch as dismal is an understatement.</p><p>But while this three-figure player count has captured headlines and provoked ridicule across the internet, the detail that caught my eye was that Concord reportedly<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonys-live-service-hero-shooter-concord-has-been-in-development-for-around-8-years"><u> spent </u><u><em>eight years</em></u><u> in development</u></a>. That means Concord began its journey sometime around 2016 –  the same year Blizzard released Overwatch.</p><p>Firewalk Studios is made up of veterans from Bungie and Activision, two of the foremost makers of online PvP shooters, so it’s no surprise it attempted to go toe-to-toe with Overwatch to win over fans in the genre given its staff pedigree. But as the saying goes, if you aim for the king, you better not show up eight years late. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/23/concordlaunchtrailer-ign-blogroll-1724433858377.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Firewalk Studios. PlayStation Studios</figcaption></figure></output><p>With so many games now taking close to a decade from the beginning of development to release, we’re starting to see the financial and creative consequences of an overlong development cycle. Spend too much time in development and ideas that were once novel are no longer in vogue. Furthermore, the time and money spent over those years has to be recouped somehow, which leads to decisions like the $40 cost of entry for Concord when many of its peers are free to play.</p><p>The cost of coming late to the party means you must bring something new to the table. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-review"><u>Concord</u></a> is neither particularly innovative nor content-heavy. That said, it does have a level of polish at launch that was often absent from its hero shooter peers when they were first released. Indeed, Concord’s weekly animation story drops are fully motion-capture, and Firewalk’s time spent on crafting its lore has helped secure Concord an episode of this winter’s video game animation anthology series, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-every-video-game-gamescom-trailer-amazon"><u>Secret Level</u></a>. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>But as the saying goes, if you aim for the king, you better not show up eight years late.&nbsp;</p></div><p>But well-established hero shooters like EA’s Apex Legends launched almost bare bones and still managed to make a splash thanks to its intriguing central concept which combined hero loadouts with a battle royale match format. Valve’s Deadlock doesn’t even have finalized assets or art but has still caused a huge burst of excitement among the PC community, thanks to the way itchanges up the classic 6v6 hero formula with its heavy lane-and-minions MOBA mechanics. By contrast Concord appeared with an all-too-familiar offering and, frankly, the time spent on finessing its presentation – the graphics, motion capture, performance, and so on – likely lead to a later release date which in turn meant it lost valuable time establishing itself among its peers. If it had been released four or five years ago, when the PS5 first came out, maybe its launch would have been an entirely different story.</p><p>So that begs the question: was the lengthy time spent in development worth it?</p><p>We know it now takes longer than ever to make a AAA game. And while technological improvements have brought about previously unimaginable levels of detail, customers have now spent decades expecting bigger open-worlds, better graphics, and more hair follicles on a character than ever before. This has created a vicious cycle where, if studios want to meet those particular player expectations, games must take longer to make so that they can meet the bar set by the technological advancements achieved by prior games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This creates a very risky dilemma, particularly for those aiming to dominate the live-service space. Knowing the cost and development time required for a AAA online game, studios have to assess, predict and/or simply guess  as to what will be the  next big hit. What game will succeed in four, five, six years time if we begin developing it right now? Will the audience still care for that kind of game when we’re finally ready to release it? It practically requires the services of a fortune-teller to get the answer right.</p><p>Some get it right. Blizzard correctly judged the appetite for a Team Fortress 2-like shooter that adopted the hero kits of MOBAs. Others get it wrong – Epic’s original tower-defense version of Fortnite, in development for around six years, completely misread the market. Luckily Epic had the resources to pivot Fortnite to an online battle royale after witnessing the skyrocketing success of PUBG. It soon learned that the rewards for quickly jumping onto a trend can be limitless. But quick is the optimal word here.</p><p>Concord isn’t the only game that this year that’s the product of a  poorly judged, time-consuming gamble in the ever-changing landscape of live-service games.</p><p>Like Concord, Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad Kills the Justice League was released with a level of polish and detail unseen by other online multiplayer shooters. And, also like Concord, it suffered from a lack of content and innovation. These flaws meant Suicide Squad was unable to attract players from rival PvE games, while also alienating Rocksteady’s fans who adored the studio’s single-player Batman games. Suicide Squad Kills the Justice League spent <em>nine years</em> in development. Soon after release, publisher Warner Bros. called the game a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms"><u>disappointment that cost the company $200 million.</u></a></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All I know for sure is releasing an Overwatch competitor two years after Overwatch 2 was released feels like a mighty disadvantage.</p></div><p>Live-service games, by their nature, are at the mercy of time more than any other format, but even single-player games can be victims of the overlong development cycle . Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, Ubisoft’s long-awaited samurai ninja game set in feudal Japan, is finally coming out this fall. The only problem is Sucker Punch released a very good, open-world, samurai assassin game almost four years ago in 2020, beating Ubisoft to the punch. It remains to be seen if this will affect Shadows’ sales, but there’s certainly a vocal section of the Assassin’s Creed community that feels like Ghosts of Tsushima has already provided the experience they wanted. </p><p>So what’s the solution? It’s certainly not developers crunching themselves to death to make games faster. But, unfortunately there are just no easy answers to this situation that is, as far as I can tell, unique to the medium.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>One solution that’s been bandied about is to make shorter games. I’ve personally advocated for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-sequels-like-uncharted-lost-legacy-are-the-future"><u>need of more half-sequels</u></a> like Uncharted: Lost Legacy that offers fans a chance at enjoying a new game in a beloved franchise, both at a lower price and sooner than a full sequel game. But while I’m personally a fan of shorter games, I know I’m in the minority. When games are $70 each, it’s understandable that many players want something that offers significant bang for their buck. Plus, shorter lengths is only a potential solution for big AAA franchises where it’s now become accepted that if we want a new Fallout, GTA, or The Last of Us, we’re going to be waiting a decade for it.</p><p>For online games like Concord and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, though, it might just be that the longer you spend losing ground to rival games, the worse the outlook is at launch. You either need a completely novel gameplay mechanic a la Apex Legends or Deadlock, or hope your game has <em>the juice</em>, as the kids say. All I know for sure is releasing an Overwatch competitor two years after Overwatch 2 was released feels like a mighty disadvantage.</p><p><em>Matt T.M. Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

The solution: start a new save.</p><p>Here’s Ubisoft’s initial message:</p><blockquote>To best experience the Outer Rim, we rolled out a maintenance to make sure everyone is playing the latest version of the game. As one of the players affected who had access to an older version of the game, we are aware you might be encountering some issues after this recent patch. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused...Once you’ve confirmed you have the latest version, please start a new save to fully enjoy Star Wars Outlaws as our team intended. If you continue on a prior save you will unfortunately face issues and progression blockers.</blockquote><p>Players complained that they were forced into losing hours of progress through no fault of their own, a loss made all the worse by the fact that it occurred during Star Wars Outlaws’ early access period, which was reserved for those who paid more than $100 for the Gold Edition.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Now, Ubisoft has offered a make-good to affected players: an in-game Trailblazer trinket and 100 Ubisoft Connect Units. These units are Ubisoft Connect loyalty points, which can be used on in-game rewards and Ubisoft Store discounts.</p><p>Here’s Ubisoft’s latest message, sent to affected players via email:</p><blockquote>We are following up on the previous email we sent you regarding "Issues with an outdated version on PlayStation 5".<p>We fully acknowledge that asking you to start a new game is not the best experience, especially during the early access period, and for that we apologize.<br>To make your return to the Outer Rim a little more special, we are granting you an in-game Trailblazer trinket as well as 100 Ubisoft Connect Units (to redeem for in-game rewards, for example). We are actively working on adding the Ubisoft Connect Units to your account so you can use these as soon as possible, and you can collect the Trinket from the delivery crate in the back of the Trailblazer once you reach Toshara.<br>We appreciate your patience, and we hope you enjoy the game.</p></blockquote><p>These units are already being called “worthless” by some disgruntled players. “I lost 15 hours of progress,” said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1f3k86w/comment/lkevjks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor 00schneider</a>. “Well, I explored a lot so I took my time. Today I was forced to start all over and I rushed in ~6 hours to nearly the state I was before. Yes, it sucks that they couldn't just release a hotfix. Yes, the compensation for it is laughable. At least they could've given us some materials to upgrade our vehicles and the blaster a little faster. But the game is still fun and I hope no other game breaking bugs appear.”</p><p>Others who have yet to run into any issues are now worried about losing their progress if they update the game. “I’ve just seen the email tonight,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1f3k86w/comment/lkfcy20/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor Flash__PuP said</a>. “I’m 20hrs in with three maxed out experts and max affinity with Pyles and all others at good standing. This makes me just want to pack it in.”</p><p>The good news is that Patch 1.000.002 sounds like a big upgrade for Star Wars Outlaws, enhancing the visual fidelity on PS5 while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review"><u>addressing some of the issues we alluded to in our review</u></a>. The 40fps support is an especially big deal, as it enhances Star Wars Outlaw's visual fidelity without sacrificing too much of the fluidity from a higher frame-rate.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws launches proper across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S on August 30. In the meantime, if you're planning on picking up Star Wars Outlaws, we have plenty of guides to help you explore Ubisoft's version of a galaxy far, far away, including our <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/star-wars-outlaws/Walkthrough"><u>walkthrough</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/star-wars-outlaws/Side_Quests"><u>sidequests</u></a>, and more.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Activision's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is just under two months away from release, but the biggest weapon in players' arsenals has has already been unleashed. During Call of Duty Next, streamer JustHazzardous dropped the first nuke even before the game's official beta period had begun. The results were understandably explosive, and even fatal for his character.</p><p>JustHazzardous claims to have pulled off a similar feat last year by setting off a nuke in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-campaign-review-return-of-the-makarov/1900-6418152/" data-ref-id="1900-6418152">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a>. In the new video, the effects of the nuke are seen almost immediately as the playable character drops his weapon before his arms burst into flames. Moments later, the screen cuts to a mushroom cloud--the signature imagery of a nuclear explosion.</p><p>Previous Call of Duty games have awarded nukes to players who can kill 25 enemies in a row without dying. Presumably Black Ops 6 has a similar threshold before giving gamers access to the ultimate equalizer. Treyarch, the lead developer of Black Ops 6, subsequently sent out a congratulatory message to JustHazzardous for his achievement.</p><p>Call of Duty Next is just the prelude event to the early access for the Black Ops 6 beta, which will run from August 30 to September 4 across all consoles and PC. The open beta period will follow from September 6-9. During those extended previews, players should be able to see more of Black Ops 6's throwback to the '90s, as well as more maps, weapons, and other features of the game.</p><p>Activision will release Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on October 25 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

We simply landed on a workflow that incorporates these tools and want to share how they help us create our game on a low budget.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The Problem:">The Problem:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game narratives change all the time during the production of a video game. They have to deliver an engaging story with lovable characters, respond to player choices &amp; input in believable ways, and leave enough room for the gameplay of the game. This means that the tools we use to create the narrative of a video game need to allow for fast iterations and a flexible approach.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In film, a clear process has been established which begins with a screenplay, which once locked, is relatively static and tells the filmmakers all they need to know to create the film.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ve tried using a “Screenplay” approach several times in the past for “Ruth’s Journey” and it never worked for us for multiple reasons:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can never predict everything a player is going to expect to do using your game's mechanics. Adding new content was a slow process as we usually did content implementation in larger batches in between playtests. Because of this, play tests were done infrequently.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A linear script does not easily translate into an interactive experience that responds to player input. The screenplay format does not lend itself well to creating a branching video game narrative.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We aimed to deliver a vertical slice including the final narrative &amp; VO lines, but larger set-ups and pay-offs did not work in a short 30-minute experience. Players were missing the larger context of the playable scenes</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Often, a scene that worked on paper did not immediately work in the game and required a ton of tweaking to get right, because we did not consider every variable when writing the screenplay.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Defining a new approach:">Defining a new approach:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We knew we needed a new approach. We wanted an approach that allowed us to work iteratively on the story, in the same way we worked on the game mechanics and level design. We wanted to focus our efforts on creating a Horizontal Slice, rather than a vertical slice, as experiencing each scene in the context of the others is a big aspect of what makes the final experience satisfying to play. This seems to be relatively unique to the narrative game genre, where the “fun” of playing the game comes from experiencing a complete story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We wanted to reduce the amount of guesswork that happened in the phase between going from the scene idea on paper to the implemented level.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Describing the tools:">Describing the tools:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We knew this had to start with the right tooling. We needed to shorten our iteration times and get to playtesting earlier.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the tools we decided to adopt was Articy Draft 3, which comes with a very helpful Unreal Engine integration. This quickly became the foundation for our new development approach. Its flexible editor allowed us to easily write branching dialogue, keep track of variables and character profiles and generate temp VO using text-to-speech.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On top of this, our programmer made a tool to generate more sophisticated VO assets using “Unreal Speech’s API”. This has been a great addition to our workflow, as it helps us identify problems with our VO pacing and flow without needing to hire, record and re-record Voice actors for lines that might get cut or rewritten a couple of times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using this approach allowed us to worry less about writing perfect dialogue out of the gate. Instead, we focused on writing &amp; implementing as many scenes as possible within a short amount of time, to create a first playable version of the whole game.</span></p><p>Overview of a single dialogue with branching in Articy Draft.</p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Level Scripting through Custom Functions:">Level Scripting through Custom Functions:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We implemented a few common level-scripting features through “custom functions” within Articy Draft. This allows our narrative designer to “script” important level functionality directly in Articy Draft, without needing to set up code in Unreal Engine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, it allows us to make characters walk to specific locations and interact with objects in the world. It could be extended to play custom animations as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Setting these functions up in Unreal Engine requires a bit of effort and we recommend a good understanding of Unreal Blueprint &amp; C++ to make the integration successful.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using these tools we managed to build a 40-minute-long playable demo within a month.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Everything in the 12 scenes of this demo is rough around the edges, a first draft, but it gives us a great idea of how a scene might play out and lets us start playtesting immediately.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Challenges:">Challenges:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Integrating Articy Draft into your Unreal Engine project is no easy task. While there are some good tutorials available from the Articy team, we also found help in the “Unofficial Articy Draft Discord Community”. Together with our programmer, it took about 1 month to get this workflow up and running and to iron out bugs.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Playtesting early:">Playtesting early:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We would then begin testing, first by ourselves, then with friends and players from our audience, to better understand which scene ideas were working and which needed to be changed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We started doing weekly “narrative hours” during which we would play a few scenes and analyze the character’s motivations, goals, backstory and believability of each moment. It allowed our team to quickly identify plot holes and helped us flesh out our game world and characters in a fun and interactive way. These “narrative hours” also had the side effect of being very inspiring, as they helped us see the potential of what each scene could eventually become.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Pre-Production Goals:">Pre-Production Goals:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To complete the pre-production of “In Our Nature”, we aim to build a complete Vertical Slice using the current approach. Our game's plot has been completely outlined and lots of scenes have been written in a first draft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Implementation of a scene in Unreal takes one developer around 1 day. With the amount of content needed to tell the game’s story, there is still work to be done on our game mechanics, such as dialogue triggers and narrative items, to streamline the implementation process even further.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the past, it has often been our tendency to try to polish an individual scene as much as possible or try to fix a major story problem immediately. Focusing on delivering a Horizontal Slice first, has helped us to reduce this tendency. It helped us stay committed to building the first playable version of “In Our Nature” first.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’re still in the middle of this process, but after 3 years of development, it’s never felt more fun and collaborative to work on the game.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion:">Conclusion:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Getting an interactive story playable should be the biggest priority during the Pre-Production phase of a project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As with all aspects of game development, approaching the writing process iteratively allows for great stories to emerge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Development tools should be considered that reduce iteration time and help developers playfully build their stories</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our goal as Nifty Llama is to create immersive stories with believable characters and high emotional stakes. Our new approach helps us reach these goals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Understanding whether a story works in game form as quickly as possible allows us to save time and money and helps us tell better stories.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We hope that we were able to inspire you by sharing our approach to developing our game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you have alternative approaches that worked well for you, we’d love to hear them.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marathon-director-reportedly-fired-in-spring-over-misconduct-allegations.967023/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Chris Barrett, the former director for Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, was fired from the company in spring following a misconduct investigation.</p>
<p>According to a (paywalled) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, who cites "people familiar with the matter", Barrett was let go from Bungie in late March following "an internal investigation in which at least eight female employees raised complaints" regarding inappropriate behavior.</p>
<p>These complaints include Barrett allegedly calling lower-level female staff "attractive", asking them to "play truth-or-dare", and making "references to his wealth and power" within Bungie, as well as making suggestions he could help these employees "advance their careers". I'm quoting Bloomberg here, not Barrett, by the way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marathon-director-chris-barrett-fired-rumor.jpg?itok=SaK6IKVx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marathon-director-chris-barrett-fired-rumor.jpg?itok=s4YnbfUc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ex-<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>director Chris Barrett was reportedly fired from Bungie in spring.</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement given to Bloomberg, Barrett said that he feels he has "always conducted [himself] with integrity and been respective and supportive of [his] colleagues".</p>
<p>He goes on to say that he "never understood [his] communications to be unwanted", and that he didn't think they "could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable". Finally, he apologizes "if anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with [him]".</p>
<p>As Bloomberg points out, Barrett's career with Bungie began in 1999, and he then went on to serve as a staffer on major franchises like&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>. His replacement on&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>has not yet been announced; indeed, his firing from Bungie hasn't been officially confirmed by the company.</p>
<p>Barrett's apparent ousting is part of a wider trend within the gaming industry, one that has seen companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/french-union-launches-lawsuit-against-ubisoft-over-harassment">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-employee-speaks-out-about-sexual-harassment">Activision Blizzard</a>, and, indeed, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-ceo-apologizes-in-wake-of-toxic-culture-report">Bungie itself</a> accused of perpetuating toxic workplace environments for female staff (and staff in general, in some cases).</p>

<p>This also isn't the first of Bungie's woes to be made public this year.</p>
<p>In late July, Bungie announced it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">lay off over 200 staff</a> as part of a "new path" for the company, a move that then became the <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-layoffs-classic-cars-sony-buyout-de-1851610196" rel="noopener" target="_blank">center of its own controversy</a> after CEO Pete Parsons purchased millions of dollars' worth of classic cars following the sale.</p>
<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, we haven't heard a great deal about the game since it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-resurrects-marathon-playstation-showcase">revealed in May last year</a>.</p>
<p>Bungie did <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/learn-what-marathon-is-all-about-in-new-video-from-bungie">say that it intended to stay quiet for "an extended period"</a> to focus on developing the game, but in the wake of these layoffs and allegations, it's difficult to imagine that&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is in a great place right now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Originally launched in 2021, Hitman 3 brought the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> World of Assassination games to a close. We called it a "satisfying end to a beautiful stealth trilogy" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-review-a-satisfying-end-to-a-beautiful-stealth-trilogy">Eurogamer's Hitman 3 review</a>.</p>
<p>"Behind Agent 47's myriad disguises I sense a faith in the self-defeating logic of the universe, a conviction that if he is patient and watchful, if he only allows himself to move with the flow, the planets will align, the walls will disappear, and for a second or so, the heart of the machine will be exposed for all to see," wrote Edwin.</p>
<p>IOI is now working on two new projects - including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-confirms-development-of-bold-new-online-fantasy-rpg">secretive fantasy game</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-io-opens-up-a-little-about-its-james-bond-007-game">a new 007 James Bond blockbuster</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Baldur's Gate 3 publishing director Michael Douse has reopened the topic of video game pricing, commenting that prices have not kept pace with inflation (the general increase of prices and goods) in certain markets, and thereby, with the cost of making blockbuster games such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. </p><!--more-->
<p>I mention Outlaws because it's this game that has sparked Douse's thoughts. Writing on <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1828077545100542195">the artist formerly known as Twitter</a>, he shared an image of the new Ubiworld game's Ultimate Edition, which encompasses the "base" offering and a sack of season pass content and collector's goodies such as a digital artbook, together with the nowadays-routine promise of pre-release access. Douse suggests that special editions such as these are a way of "artificially" hiking prices without, strictly speaking, saying that you're doing so. </p>
<p>"I don't love the artificiality of pricing structures post retail," Douse wrote. "Use the inflated base price to upsell a subscription, and use vague content promises to inflate ultimate editions to make the base price look better. It all seems a bit dangerous &amp; disconnected from the community."</p>
<p>Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1828079029162791043">added</a> that "I think a game should be priced accordingly with its quality, breadth &amp; depth", and that publishers should be more upfront and honest about wanting to charge more for games, rather than putting out special editions that muddy the picture. "Almost all games should cost more at a base level because the cost of making them (inflation, for one) is outpacing pricing trends," he wrote. "But I don't think we'll get there with DLC promises so much as quality &amp; communication. Everyone's just waiting for GTA6 to do it lol."</p>
<p>It seems important to remember here that Larian's own Baldur's Gate 3 <em>also</em> had more expensive special editions <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/baldurs-gate-3-pre-order-edition-differences/">encompassing a mix of digital and physical bonuses</a>. Presumably, Douse regards those editions as above-board - I'll let you be the judge. That aside, he's far from the only senior industry figure to argue that the cost of making games like Outlaws is out of whack with pricing.</p>
<p>The mention of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>, out in 2025, reminds me of Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publisher-ceo-thinks-videogame-prices-are-very-very-low-for-what-they-offer">comments from an earnings call last year</a> that industry prices are "very, very low" versus the number of hours of playtime games offer and player perception of their value.</p>
<p>Zelnick added, however, that this conviction of giving you a lot for a little "doesn't necessarily mean that the industry has pricing power or wants to have pricing power". In other words, Take-Two and other publishers aren't about to impose a broad price jump on their audience, though I imagine GTA 6 could get away with it. A Take-Two spokesperson also reached out to me later to clarify that Zelnick wasn't suggesting that the industry should adopt any broader new pricing models, either.</p>
<p>Capcom's president Harushiro Tsujimoto has gone further than Zelnick, noting via <a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-president-game-prices-too-low-resident-evil-4-1850874279">Kotaku</a> that development budgets have shot up "100 times" since the heyday of the Famicom in the 90s. Speaking at last year's Tokyo Game Show with regard to the Japanese games industry in particular, Tsujimoto argued that "considering the fact that wages are rising in the industry as a whole, I think raising unit prices is a healthy option for business."</p>
<p>Here's a piece about the pricing/budget question from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/839654c9-f8a2-4e73-a9dd-76a5584f7d1d">the Financial Times</a>, published in January this year, which includes a JPMorgan analysis of pricing trends in the USA specifically. "The cost of developing an AAA game has risen approximately tenfold over 15 years, and the customer has probably not noticed much," it reads. "Poor pricing power means the standard storefront price has risen only 17 per cent since 2007, from $60 to $70."</p>
<p>I do not want to pay more for games like Outlaws, and am mistrustful of pronouncements from people higher up the ladder about what their flagship games should cost. Amongst other things, it seems unlikely that the actual developers of those games would automatically benefit from any rise in revenues - if the past few years have taught us anything, it's that rank-and-file devs are considered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">disposable</a> where leadership are not.</p>
<p>It's also worth reiterating that there's a difference between a video game making its money back, and a video game making enough money for its investors. As one developer told me during an interview about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio">Embracer's gutting of Chorus devs Fishlabs</a>, "we make a shitload of money, but it doesn't go back into the games". </p>
<p>I do agree that the cost/price ratio for blockbuster games such as Star Wars Outlaws looks very unhealthy on paper. Attempts to fill that gap have led, amongst other things, to the present glut of live service seasonal content games, which basically rely on players devoting time and money to them at the expense of trying anything else. The cost/price discrepancy has also contributed to the current heavy promotion of generative AI technologies, which publishers often tout as a way of magically shrinking budgets while talking around the implications for their workforces.</p>
<p>But I think there are larger, trickier questions at stake involving the culture and perception of "AAA" games as, basically, exercises in being deliberately unsustainable. Sometimes, I think games such as Outlaws are sold and bought <em>purely</em> on the strength of the idea that they represent an unholy expenditure of resources - capitalism at its most decadent, doomed and spectacular, where you can all but feel the game burning a hole in the universe while you play.</p>
<p>I wrote a piece for Edge before joining RPS which traced the "AAA" concept to its apparent origins in the 90s, based on interviews with various industry executives. The nearest that piece came to a working original definition was that "AAA" games are games with budgets so huge they cannot possibly fail, which is not a formulation that has aged well.</p>
<p>While the biggest of the big-leaguers toy with the prospect of price increases, some publishers continue to experiment with various incarnations of "mid-tier" blockbuster, which offer the impression of "triple-A" largesse on a saner budget. Here's Techland, for example, on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/techland-shorter-standalones-like-dying-light-the-beast-are-the-future-of-games">why shorter expandalones like the recently announced Dying Light: The Beast are "the future of games"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I would not be at all surprised to learn that the voice actors in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealthy</a> Mimimi-style cone’em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sumerian-six">Sumerian Six</a> are Americans doing impressions of British accents. The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.</p>
<p>“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun">Shadow Tactics</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/desperados-iii">Desperados III</a> goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-gambit-studio-mimimi-are-closing-down-to-prioritize-our-well-being">Mimimi’s closing</a> was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.</p>

<p>That’s not to say Sumerian Six doesn’t quickly introduce some new tricks. Sid packs a tiny robot spider he can use to ‘hitchhike’ on guards, letting him pass unseen along their patrol routes. I’m also a fan of the option to speed up time, saving you having to wait around for a guard to get into spider range.</p>
<p>A scientist named Isabella soon joins the squad. She’s got a cloaking device, which is possibly the single most uninteresting gadget you can give a stealth character, although it does run out of juice rapidly when she moves. She also has an utterly brutal takedown with a regular hammer that simply cannot help getting jammed in the back of every Nazi skull she swings it at. Very satisfying.</p>
<p>I am currently far too embroiled in the spacefaring demands of long-distant haulage with a different game to spend quite as much time with Sumerian Six as I’d like to right now, but here’s some details from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1429850/Sumerian_Six/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Inspired by real places and events, Sumerian Six takes you on a journey through an alternate history where folk stories and conspiracy theories are as real as the Nazi threat.</p>
<p>Led by Hans Kammler, a former member of your Squad, the Nazis tap into the occult to create the ultimate Wunderwaffe. Face off against heavily armed, mutated, and supernaturally charged forces, and put your strategic abilities and dexterity to the ultimate test.</p>
<p>As you delve deeper into the Nazi plot, you’ll encounter occult-scientific weapons and ancient Sumerian artefacts linked to Kammler's machinations. A grim future awaits you should the Nazis be victorious, so do your best to prevent that dark timeline from coming true in this real-time tactical stealth adventure.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s out in a couple of days, at it happens - September 2. There's a demo on Steam at the time of writing. Also, looks like one of the six is a bear.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Verdansk's last appearance in Warzone was at the end of 2021, when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-last-hours-of-verdansk-event-start-time-and-more/1100-6498399/" data-ref-id="1100-6498399">Last Hours of Verdansk event</a> saw players scrambling to survive the city's bombing.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-team-will-use-gamescom-feedback-to-bring-the-game-to-the-desired-quality-level/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was arguably the biggest game at Gamescom 2024, at least judging by the hours of queueing to play the game in the public area and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-2024-award-winners-announced-capcoms-monster-hunter-wilds-takes-all-the-spotlight/">wins</a> from the official awards.</p>
<p>This was the first time the game was playable, and Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/video/701173/Forging+a+Bold+New+Future+Gamescom+24+-+Monster+Hunter+Wilds+Interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> to Gamereactor that the feedback gathered from both press and players will be used by CAPCOM to bring the large game to the desired quality level.</p>
<p><em>I've heard great feedback so far. We've had so many great reactions from everyone who's tried out our showfloor demo. I'm going to go back to Japan and bring all that feedback and that passion that I've experienced here from the fans. When I let the wider development team know about that, I think it's really going to motivate them to keep going on this final stretch of development.</em></p>
<p><em>There are still some things left to finish up before we release Monster Hunter Wilds. But this was the first ever time that anyone outside the company has played the game. So, I think we've got a lot of feedback to take on board. We'll be able to check out reactions from both press and players at this event. And as I said before, I'm not just going to bring that back to motivate the team and make them feel happy and excited. But it's a lot for us to do and to see what we can do to polish up the game in the last phase of development and make sure we can bring the best possible experience to you. Because the scale of the game is so much bigger now, and the volume of content is so much larger, that just brings a larger amount of development work for us to finalize the game to the level of quality that we're happy with.</em></p>
<p>Reading between the lines, it does sound like Monster Hunter Wilds may not launch as soon as 2025 drops, unlike Monster Hunter World, which debuted in late January 2018. However, that's just speculation on our part for now. CAPCOM will surely finalize the release details before the end of the year, possibly announcing the news at The Game Awards. Meanwhile, stay tuned on Wccftech for our own hands from Gamescom.</p>

"The awesomeness of dinosaurs and the stuff you can do with dinosaurs, that's been kind of really nailed down by Monster Hunter in recent years.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/29/dino-1724928501402.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>"Even if I were to decide to make a remake or a new version of Dino Crisis, I don't really feel like there's a whole lot of space for that kind of game right now, just since Monster Hunter has become such a big game. But yeah, it is surprising."</p><p>Dino Crisis first arrived in 1999 and saw three sequels but, while the first two were beloved among fans, Dino Stalker and the final Dino Crisis 3 weren't so well received. The latter was released in 2003, meaning it's been 21 years since a Dino Crisis game was last released.</p><p>Monster Hunter ironically arrived one year later and has since grown into Capcom's biggest franchise. Monster Hunter Wilds, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-xbox-the-game-awards-2023">the next entry announced in December 2023</a>, is expected in 2025.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for">In our latest preview of the game</a>, IGN said it's "shaping up to be pretty much what [we] hoped for: A Monster Hunter that embraces the parts of Rise that made it so much more inviting, but also doesn’t shy away from the larger scale and spectacle that helped make World the more enduring entry."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Capcom did have a go at making a brand new dinosaur video game with last year's Exoprimal, but the live service co-op shooter lasted just a year before <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-a-dino-crisis-for-capcom-as-it-abandons-new-exoprimal-content-just-a-year-after-launch">Capcom said it would no longer receive new content</a>.</p><p>Exoprimal’s announcement back in 2022 was seen as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dino-crisis-exoprimal-producer">death knell for a potential Dino Crisis revival</a>, but Capcom teased fans recently when it tweeted out a solitary image <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-celebrates-dino-crisis-25th-birthday-with-a-picture-of-a-bloody-dinosaur-foot">to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the much-loved dinosaur survival horror game</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
