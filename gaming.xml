            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> and Mafia publisher 2K has killed off its PC  launcher, and uncoupled its top titles from the software.
</p>
<p>
Steam and Epic Games Store versions of BioShock Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-2">BioShock 2</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization-v">Civilization 5</a> and 6, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-quarry">The Quarry</a>, XCOM 2, XCOM: Chimera Squad and Marvel's Midnight Suns will now run without the 2K Launcher opening first.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset#h_01JB9Z24V9Q3426C558WRC173K">blog post</a> on the changes, 2K said its launcher had now been removed from every game that used it on Epic and Steam. Last night, an update was sent out to 2K games on Steam to ensure its removal - in case you wondered why BioShock was patched again.
</p>
<p>
From 2K's notes on the subject, the whole thing sounds like it should be pretty seamless. If you're still seeing the 2K Launcher now, be sure you've updated your games and rebooted Steam. 
</p>
<p>
Access to your games, as well as your save files, should continue uninterrupted, 2K says in a Q&amp;A on the subject. 
</p>
<p>
"Can I still use the 2K Launcher if I want to?" a final question asks. "We currently have no plans to allow an optional 2K Launcher setting, but we appreciate your interest," is the response.
</p>
<p>
2K's next games include Civilization 7 and BioShock creator Ken Levine's mysterious Judas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creators-next-game-judas-to-be-released-by-march-2025">whenever that finally materialises</a>. When it does do so, however, it will be without the 2K Launcher.

            <p>Nintendo has added <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> to the official series timeline.</p>
<p>The adorable top-down game is part of the 'Hero is defeated' timeline, slotting in behind Tri-Force Heroes and the original The Legend of Zelda.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/character/zelda/en/history/index.html">timeline</a> links (pun intended) all the games together, famously splitting after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a> depending on whether the hero is successful or not at saving the world.</p>

<p>So what does this mean for Echoes of Wisdom? I'm yet to finish it myself, though in all honesty we all know the timeline is incredibly loose and somewhat meaningless.</p>
<p>Worryingly, though, after Echoes of Wisdom Nintendo specifies a "Decline of Hyrule Kingdom". What happened? What did you do Zelda?</p>

<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-officially-places-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-tears-of-the-kingdom-outside-series-established-timeline">Nintendo officially listed both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom outside of the established timeline</a>, with no relation to previous games.</p>
<p>Further, in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/11/12/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-eiji-aonuma/">The Washington Post</a>, series producer Eiji Aonuma stated Zelda games are developed from a gameplay perspective first, with story formed later. So how much does the timeline really matter?</p>
<p>Echoes of Wisdom was released on Switch back in September, and is the first game in the series to feature the titular princess as the playable protagonist.</p>
<p>Zelda voice actor Patricia Summersett told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/after-echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-actor-says-having-the-princess-as-the-playable-character-in-a-breath-of-the-wild-style-open-world-game-would-be-amazing/">GamesRadar</a> it would be "amazing" to see the princess as protagonist in an open world Zelda too. "I'm so happy for the fandom that they got Echoes of Wisdom, of course, but I mean, yeah, there can always be more playable Zelda as far as I'm concerned," she said.</p>
<p>"Thanks to playful puzzles and an imaginative reinvention of Hyrule's historic iconography, Echoes of Wisdom emerges as a bold and creative new chapter in Zelda's legend," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-rebellious-remix-of-past-and-present">Echoes of Wisdom review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In philosophy there are several thought experiments to test how you might respond to complex moral conundrums. Perhaps the most famous of these is the trolley problem – if forced to choose, would you choose to sacrifice one life to save many? This initial question seems simple at first glance, but once more information is layered in (the single person is a doctor who might find the cure for cancer, the many are convicted criminals etc.) we find that our decision can change. Threshold feels like a gaming equivalent of this kind of thought experiment, and its atmosphere and moral ambiguity has stayed with me since I finished it the first of several times.</p>
<p><iframe title="THRESHOLD – Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jAqq9qqq5XQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Threshold is the brainchild of solo developer, Julien Eveillé, and is the latest in a series of fantastic indie games published by Critical Reflex, hot on the heels of the viral <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQMCO84f03Y">Mouthwashing</a>. Threshold more than holds its own in such lauded company and is one of the most thought provoking and troubling games I’ve played this year.</p>


<p>The game starts with you seeming to be buried and put in the position of choosing a new name – the catch being that you only have two letters to fill. This small detail immediately prevents you from fully identifying with the character you will play as (unless you happen to have a particularly short name or nickname, I guess). To further the sense of defamiliarisation &nbsp;there is not just a simple difficulty select option available here either. You can choose between focused and distracted modes which make environmental clues harder or easier to spot, but the actual difficulty is set by choosing a country’s flag. There is no indication as to the effect of this choice and I look forward to the inevitable long form video essays delving into the various effects.</p>


<p>Once you start the game proper you are given a very basic overview of your duties in your new job. There is a mysterious train forever moving forward across the threshold station you control, entering a tunnel through an intimidating concrete wall. To ensure the train’s safe passage, you must blow a whistle through a foghorn style amplifier to speed it up when it slows down. You’re not told what the train is carrying or why it must maintain a certain speed, just that it is your job to control it. The moral quandary starts to unravel as you discover clues and notes that suggest that all is not quite what it seems.</p>
<p>Graphically, Threshold makes effective use of the lo-fi PS1 style that is increasingly popular at the moment. The sharp edges and blocky polygons help to give everything an uncanny feel, and the drab palette perfectly suits the mood of daily drudgery. The piercing alarm that sounds when the train is not at its optimal speed is the most pressing reminder of your duties, an alarm that is made even more effective by the relative silence of the game. The background rumble of the train is your main companion, as even your co-worker relays information purely through written notes.</p>

<p>The in-game reasoning for the lack of voice acting is an ingenious part of the world building. The station you are manning is high up and therefore the oxygen levels are very low. This lack of oxygen becomes a key mechanic as simply moving around the map leaves you breathless, and blowing the all important whistle takes a lot of oxygen each time. To combat your breathlessness you must collect and use oxygen canisters, but even this aspect only serves to deepen the feeling of dread and despair.</p>
<p>Rather than conventional gas canisters, the oxygen you collect comes in the form of gas tubes that you must bite into in order to release the air within. The effects of this mechanic are reflected in the constant graphic of your mouth on screen, a mouth that becomes increasingly bloodied and disfigured as you use more air. This perpetual reminder of the ill effects of your job is open to all sorts of interpretation about the alienating process of capitalist systems, and/or just a cool bit of body horror.</p>
<p>Saying much more about the way the game develops is especially difficult as it is an experience that really needs you to go in as uninformed as possible.&nbsp;Any further discussion of mechanics or plot developments risks spoiling the game, an issue perhaps exacerbated by the relatively short time it takes to play it through. If you explore thoroughly and look for as many clues as you can then it’ll take you about 90 minutes for a playthrough, and there are several different endings to unlock. A short run time is always a risky choice given the way the refund system on Steam works, but I would urge you to try out different approaches to get the full effect of the game’s complex meditation on choice and consequences.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Threshold is a game that deserves to find an audience that will truly appreciate its provocative and philosophical approach and represents another excellent title in Critical Reflex’s library. The opening credits claim that it is a true story and this detail in particular has lead me to speculate on possible metaphorical interpretations ranging from the highly personal to the global political. It is rare for a game to make you think quite this much and that is meant as high praise.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-biggest-ever-says-activision/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Activision and developer Treyarch have proudly <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1861092582257807478" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is the biggest entry in the already massive franchise one month after its release. That's counting figures like total players, hours played, and total matches. Interestingly, the actual numbers were not shared, but they must be massive, given the IP.</p>
<p>The news is not surprising, given the great <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start</a> in the game's first week. Black Ops 6 also registered new records for <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet traffic in the UK</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-witnesses-52-of-total-us-xbox-players-checking-it-out-a-new-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Xbox players</a> checking out the game, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/us-games-consumer-spending-up-by-10-after-black-ops-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drove US spending on games up by 10%</a>. Certainly, the fact that this is the first time a new Call of Duty game has launched on Game Pass helped a lot with setting new total player, hour played, and total match records.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 received Wccftech's seal of approval from Kai Tatsumoto's review, too. Here's what he had to say about the latest entry in the shooter series:</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 represents a proper return to form, with Treyarch taking the helm in development once more. This is probably as definitive a Call of Duty title has been in years, with a package that executes well across all three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. While the narrative doesn’t hold up to the spy thriller premise in the lead-up to launch, the online package rounds out the experience well.</em></p>
<p><em>Treyarch has arrived guns blazing with this year's Call of Duty entry. All three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies are among the best they've been in years. While some players might lament the addition of Omnimovement to the gunfights, there's a dynamic feel to the new mechanics that make Call of Duty feel more like a personal action movie.</em></p>
<p>What do you think about the new Call of Duty? Are you enjoying it? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>When and where did the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2711290/New_Life/">Steam demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-life">New Life</a> first find its way to me? When did its non-descript, black hooded protagonist first wriggle, with the transgressive delight of an unbidden slug between naked toes embarking on a 2am fridge odyssey, into the as yet uncolonised crevices of my ‘demos’ library? The specifics, I fear, are but the fumes of memories, lingering like armies of mice in trenchcoats at supermarket cheese sample platters, at once painfully obvious and immune to detection in their uncanny shroud of stifling human decorum. "For who is madder?!" I shout, in a normal and cool manner. "The mice - so very mad for cheese - or the madmen who screams ‘Mice! Mice!’ in the middle of the cheese aisle?!"</p>
<p>And if I can’t remember how it got here, how can I make it go away?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I no longer wish to play the demo for New Life, if indeed I ever did. I find its presence ugly in ways that transcend how naturally ugly it is, which is the very thing I think made me want to play it in the first place. I find its description deeply unnerving in its unadorned simplicity. "A creepy story about a guy," it begins. Immediately, I am beset by visions of Poe. Of Shelley. Of Lovecraft. Of Chambers. Of scholarly ink spilled in wasteful abandon, of frenzied efforts to elucidate and quantify the terror the dwells in every human heart. "What folly!" I spit between mouthfuls of Tesco brand choco hoops, helplessly watching the murky impostor milk dribble down my juddering chin, coagulating with my tears of enraged bafflement. "What utter madness!".</p>
<p>For what is all horror if not, in some small way, a creepy story about a guy?</p>
<p>"Immerse yourself in the dark adventure of a guy who suffers from depression and feels guilty. He never takes off his hood and always keeps his hands in his pockets," it continues. "Michael became disillusioned with life and decided to try to start his life over. To do this, he left the metropolis and a successful career, sold the house he inherited, and moved to the other side of the country to forget the mistakes made in the past. But is it possible to escape from your past?"</p><p>Is it possible indeed? Day after day, I set myself the task of clearing the clutter from my library. A demo I’ve played and do not wish to play again. A demo that has tempted me to buy the full game. A demo I have poured my heart into writing about to extol its virtues, burning with ecstatic fire as words tumble unbidden to the page, only for the sole piece of evidence that I did not imagine the entire affair to be a single RPS comment that says “looks shit M8”. And then, there is the demo for New Life. Haunting me like all unfulfilled aspirations must eventually: relentlessly. Viciously. Eternally.</p>
<p>I move the cursor. I right click and hover over the ‘uninstall’ button. I have no wish to return here, to this place between play and un-play, as long as I live. But still, I cannot leave. "What if?" I ask. "What then?". The demo is too small to concern myself with the space it takes, and yet, too monumental in its shrieking insistence to ignore. And in this place between oblivion and absolution, I scrape out a wretched existence, with no end in sight.</p>
<p>(I will probs just leave it there tbf it’s a very small demo)</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

XCOM 2 on Epic will now open the Original XCOM 2 Mod Launcher. <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34884258027411--XCOM-Chimera-Squad-2K-Launcher-Sunset-and-Removal" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XCOM: Chimera Squad also has the Mod launcher as optional</a>, with a secondary option available to directly launch the game. Mods are also available on Steam Deck for Chimera Squad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset#h_01JB9YZ0QXK5J6CQVJXJ8P73H9" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, 2K said it had replaced the 2KLauncher folder with a text file called 2kLauncherRemoved.txt, which can be safely deleted. But there may be more for you to do — 2K said to be sure the launcher is gone for good, close and reopen Steam then reboot your PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've done the heavy lifting, but to take it all the way home there might be one step left for you,” 2K explained. “First thing is to try closing and reopening Steam - that means completely closing and not just using the X to minimize the platform. Rebooting your PC is a good way to be sure it happened. For Epic, just make sure you've downloaded the most recent update for the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Saved games shouldn’t be impacted, and you won’t lose access to any of your games, as long as you bought them on Steam or Epic. And, for those (probably very few!) PC gamers who miss the 2K Launcher for some reason and want to continue using it, unfortunately it’s not coming back. “We currently have no plans to allow an optional 2K Launcher setting, but we appreciate your interest,” 2K said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end of the 2K Launcher comes ahead of the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> in February 2025. Civilization is usually one of the most popular PC games around, so fans can rest assured they’ll be able to launch it directly in Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PC gamers have long criticized publisher launchers, including Ubisoft and EA’s, that force themselves upon players before they can get into the game. It seems unlikely the end of the 2K Launcher will spark a mass removal of PC launchers, however, given they’re often used for cloud saves or storefronts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Is the next big video game company acquisition on the cards?</p>
<p>Last week, news broke that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">Sony was in talks to buy FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>. A day later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">Kadokawa acknowledged that takeover interest</a>. Should it be accepted, this would likely be the biggest video game acquisition since Microsoft bought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> and Sony itself bought Destiny-maker Bungie.</p>
<p>FromSoftware is of course known for its Souls games and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, and already has an established relationship with Sony due to exclusives like Bloodborne and Demon's Souls. Yet Kadokawa not only owns other developers, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> developer Acquire, it's a major name in anime and manga too - an area Sony already has considerable claim to with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-set-to-buy-crunchyroll-for-nearly-usd1bn">acquisition of Crunchyroll</a>.</p>
<p>So what's the likelihood of this acquisition being accepted? What does Kadokawa - and by extension FromSoftware - stand to gain from Sony ownership? And does this mean Bloodborne fans will finally get the re-release they so desperately crave?</p>
<p>Joining me to discuss the possible consequences of this acquisition on this week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a> are news reporters Victoria Kennedy and Vikki Blake.</p>

            <p>A studio led by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> director Casey Hudson have shut down before being able to show the sci-fi narrative adventure they were working on. Humanoid Origin posted the announcement of the studio's closure <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE">on LinkedIn yesterday</a>, saying that a "shortfall of funding" was responsible for the decision. They had been making a "multi-platform AAA game, focusing on character-driven narrative in an all-new science-fiction universe", according to the studio's website.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Earlier today, we informed our staff that Humanoid Origin will be shutting down," said the post. "Despite efforts to shield the studio from broader challenges in the industry, an unexpected shortfall of funding left us unable to sustain operations.</p>
<p>"We’re heartbroken that we will not be able to bring our new science-fiction universe to completion. Our main concern at this time however is for our team, and we are committed to supporting them in their transition to new employment."</p>
<p>All they had shown of the game thus far were a few pieces of concept art, which you can still see in the background if you scroll down <a href="https://humanoidorigin.com/">the studio's website</a>. The game was being made in Unreal Engine 5, and they were <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7193696886300512257/">hiring for roles</a> as recently as six months ago. </p><p>For background, Casey Hudson set up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-bioware-manager-casey-hudson-has-founded-a-new-studio">his own studio in 2021</a>, after leaving BioWare <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-veterans-casey-hudson-and-mark-darrah-have-left-the-studio">alongside fellow veteran Mark Darrah</a>. Those with a good memory (not me) will recall that this was the second time Hudson had departed from BioWare - he previously had a stint away from the company in 2014-2017 before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-lead-casey-hudson-returns-to-bioware-as-general-manager">returning as general manager</a>. What he and others will do now that Humanoid Origin are closing down, we don't know yet.  </p>
<p>This is not the first studio closure we've seen in recent months. Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">shut down Firewalk Studios</a>, the makers of ill-fated shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, in October. And Tequila Works, the developers of Rime, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tequila-works-the-studio-behind-rime-and-the-sexy-brutale-has-filed-for-insolvency">filed for insolvency</a> earlier this month. Alongside other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a>, most recently at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-makers-announce-100-layoffs-cancel-projects-and-say-theyll-publish-more-games-by-other-studios-but-fewer-of-their-own">Thunderful Games</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layoffs-hit-workers-at-reflector-entertainment-makers-of-unknown-9-awakening">Reflector Entertainment</a>, these closures mark the autumn of a year that has proven even more harsh on developers than 2023. A site that tracks job losses estimates that <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">there have been 14,000 layoffs</a> so far this year, compared with a total of 10,500 last year, as our sister site Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-director-casey-hudsons-aaa-sci-fi-game-cancelled-studio-closing">point out</a>. It's likely the real number for both years is higher, as some layoffs may go unreported, and freelance folks working on contract may also not be counted.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an exclusive report published by Arizton, it was predicted that the global esports market will be worth more than $5 billion within the next five years. This growth is represented by a huge CAGR of 17.48%, making esports one of the fastest-growing and most lucrative industries in the world.</p>



<p>To put that into perspective, the American Football industry boasts a CAGR of around 6.9%, and the global music market has an estimated CAGR of 7.8%, running to 2029.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-time-to-invest">Time to Invest</h2>



<p>The world of esports is a tumultuous one, and from day to day, things remain fairly volatile. However, it’s one of the fastest-developing markets in the world, and historically, some huge investments have been made into the wider industry.</p>



<p>In the recent report published by Arizton, it was revealed that the esports market, which was worth $1.96 billion in 2023, could be worth as much as $5.17 billion by 2029. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.arizton.com/market-reports/global-esports-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">This report</a> spoke about the success of various tournaments, like the League of Legends World Championship, and the ‘adoption of digitisation’, which is a global cultural shift that’s seeing the people of our world become one that’s always connected to an online device in some way.</p>



<p>Arizton revealed that MOBA is king in the esports space and that North America is the place to be for esports businesses. It was documented that 44% of the global esports market share is confined to NA, with APAC coming in a close second.</p>



<p>Do you follow the esports industry in any way? Are you of the opinion that it’s dying, or do you agree that it’s growing at a powerful pace? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Dr Disrespect, one of the most controversial content creators of all time, has revealed a move to Rumble, breaking away from YouTube in a bid to seek better monetisation. The disgraced streamer found himself at the centre of a dire ‘minor messaging’ scandal mere months ago, and it cost him his friends, sponsorships, and income on YouTube.</p>



<p>Now, the team at Rumble, a developing streaming platform, has revealed that Dr Disrespect will be coming on board. However, he’s not coming as a mere streamer – he’s going to help run the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-interesting-choice">Interesting Choice</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://corp.rumble.com/blog/dr-disrespect-will-lead-rumble-gaming-join-rumble-premium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a>, the Rumble team revealed that Dr Disrespect will broadcast his gameplay on the platform and provide exclusive content via the Rumble Premium ecosystem to his ‘Champions Club’.</p>



<p>It gets deeper, though.</p>



<p>The 42-year-old streamer, who admitted earlier this year to using Twitch to message a minor in 2017, will serve as an advisor and ‘help build the Rumble Gaming community’. His new role lands him in the position of ‘Head of Rumble Gaming’, with the team at the growing platform seeking to lean on Dr Disrespect’s veteran status in the industry to appeal more to gamers.</p>



<p>Historically, Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm has worked at Sledgehammer Games as a community manager and map designer, and he served a pivotal role at Midnight Society before he was cut from the company following the allegations earlier this year.</p>



<p>It was confirmed that Dr Disrespect’s first stream on Rumble will take place on December 2, and the platform has gone so far as to provide a special promotion that users can lean on to secure discounted subscriptions during his first appearance on the site.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to seeing Dr Disrespect on Rumble? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sony-new-playstation-handheld-ps5-umd<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bloomberg is<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reporting</a> that Sony, fresh off the failure of the PlayStation Portal and having had eight years to survey the success of the Nintendo Switch, is <em>maybe </em>planning on launching a more serious handheld device. One that, instead of letting you beam your PS5 games to a portable screen, would just let you play PS5 games on the handheld directly.</p><p>The report, which is pretty thin, says that the Portal itself was once planned to be a standalone gaming handheld, like its predecessors the PSP and Vita. The fact it wasn't is probably what has most doomed it, something Sony is maybe taking onboard with these plans for a new handheld, plans that Bloomberg couch by saying are years away, and may not ever come to fruition at all.</p><p>Maybe they will, maybe they won't! I for one want them to though, and not just because both of Sony's previous dedicated handhelds were great portable gaming devices. It's because a new device--which I'm going to call the PlayStation Portalble until I'm ordered to stop--might be arriving at a moment in history when I can ask for the return of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Media_Disc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universal Media Disc</a> and have it not be a complete joke.</p><p>A device like this would be years away, for reasons like the fact the battery capacity for handheld PS5 games just isn't there yet; even the Steam Deck can only last a few hours, and its games can be fully scaled via their PC settings. A PS5 game just trying to <em>run </em>would be like going back in time to the Game Gear, chewing through entire packs of batteries by the minute. So there's time for this thing to arrive, for internal hardware to get smaller, for batteries to get more economical. Time for things to change, for trends to take shape.</p><p>If years away, it could be arriving at a time when the market, having long drifted towards the convenience of digital purchases--as evidenced by Sony's own PS5 re-release--would be having not just second thoughts about forever renting content, but third and fourth as well.<a href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/media/why-physical-media-is-having-a-moment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Physical media is coming back</a>, baby, and there wouldn't be many companies better poised to capitalise on a desire for proprietary physical media than Sony, the company that brought us everything from Betamax to the Blu-Ray to the...UMD.</p><p>With internal space at a premium in a handheld gaming device, storage expensive and money to be made selling weird discs that you also happen to be the only one making, the UMD's return would be <em>triumphant</em>. Watching a full-sized PS5 disc get awkwardly sucked into a PS5 is an unfulfilling experience. Slamming a UMD that contains a miniaturised PS5 game into the back of a new Sony handheld would <em>rule</em>. Especially if, like the original UMD, a successor format didn't just contain games, but movies as well!</p><p>Will any of this actually happen? Probably not! The device itself might not even get made, and even if it did, there's a greater chance it would be digital-only, because we live in hell. But a man can still dream. Of simpler times, and discs that came in cartridges, and the chance for Sony to re-release <em>The Last Of Us</em> for the 17th time...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-rumble-conor-mcgregor-hitman<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What a time it is to be an irredeemably awful rich dude. Aside from, you know, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/24/trump-picks-sexual-misconduct-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the obvious stuff</a>, dudes who should be mocked, derided, and generally excluded from polite society are getting up to all sorts of activities right now. Why, just today, streamer Guy “Dr Disrespect” Beahm and UFC fighter Conor McGregor, both known for being all bluster and no bite, faced the consequences of their respective sexual misconduct allegations – one more so than the other.</p><p>Today Beahm, demonetized on YouTube and booted from his own company after he was <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of (and partially confessed to)</a> exchanging inappropriate DMs with a minor, <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1861071895484879274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that he’s struck a deal with Rumble, the very bottom of the internet’s conspiracy-spackled slop barrel. This follows unsuccessful attempts at bargaining with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/15/a-dr-disrespect-kick-deal-would-be-a-waste-of-money-say-co-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kick</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DrDisrespectLive/comments/1gd1y71/youtube_suspends_dr_disrespects_requests_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>.</p><p>“Rumble is in a new era, and I’m laser-focused on expanding into two categories: gaming and crypto,” Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski said in a statement received by Aftermath. “Dr Disrespect will give a much-needed injection into our gaming category.”</p><p>The statement goes on to note that Beahm has entered into an agreement that “includes equity with milestones as a majority of its compensation,” so presumably, Rumble is hoping Beahm will help grow the platform, possibly by using his other channels as a funnel the way many Kick streamers do. Beahm will also “lead Rumble Gaming, acting as an advisor and helping to build the Rumble Gaming community,” which is a funny thing to say, because I can’t think of many instances where advisors were also de facto leaders, but whatever.</p><p>This was a predictable outcome, so much so that I predicted it <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right after Beahm began looking cooked</a> in June. At the time, I wrote:</p><blockquote><p>On Kick, Rumble, and in certain corners of YouTube, there’s something akin to an alternate universe of streamers, one that grew out of Twitch’s earlier, edgier tendencies but which that company has since sought to squelch. The core appeal of these creators is their ability to get away with shit. To harass and bother, to say the most out-of-pocket things they can think of, to push limits until all lines in the sand have eroded.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s obvious trainwreck appeal here, but some fans also look to these creators aspirationally, as a sort of avatar. If a big content creator can embrace an unhinged lifestyle and get whatever they want, maybe viewers can too. These sorts of viewers will always support somebody like Beahm, a 42-year-old man who behaves like a 16-year-old boy, because they see themselves in him. And though Beahm will probably lose viewership over this in aggregate regardless of whether he stays on YouTube or ends up somewhere else, the viewers who stick around will likely become bigger fans than ever. Because ultimately, this is not about morals or principles; it’s about people forming such a strong attachment to a creator that they feel like attacks against him are attacks against them as well and platforms that recognize they’ll make more money than they’ll lose by harnessing that ugly energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So Dr Disrespect is cooked in that he’s losing deals, sponsors, and an entire company, as well as his reputation as somebody who has not engaged in inappropriate conversation with a minor, a stunningly low bar to clear. He’s cooked in the mainstream sense. But he’s made a calculation that he can step away, take a breather, and return to an online audience large enough to continue supporting him. And he’s probably right.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Since returning to the significantly-dimmed limelight, Beahm has only leaned in to the idea that he’s the victim of a grand conspiracy to undermine his success, so he’ll fit right in on Rumble, a <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/11/20/twitch-kick-streaming-hours-watch-time-stats-streamlabs-stream-hatchet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vastly smaller platform</a> than Twitch, YouTube, or even Kick, one where mainstream castoffs like Russell Brand <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2024-04-29/russell-brand-baptized-christianity-rape-sexual-assault-allegations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flirt with fascism <em>and </em>The Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/laura-loomer-pawsitive-pet-food-b2615820.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a nonzero number of Trump associates eat dog food</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This will briefly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/rumble-rum-soars-after-inking-streaming-deal-with-dr-disrespect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">serve as good marketing</a> for Rumble before everyone stops caring in a week, at which point the internet’s far-right sinkhole will be out who-knows-how-many millions of dollars, because a single streamer, no matter how large, <a href="https://x.com/HUN2R/status/1861077598773584140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cannot generate the kind of revenue needed</a> to make up for these big money deals. <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2024/09/05/some-big-streamers-are-leaving-youtube-for-twitch-does-data-say-thats-the-right-move/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If trends hold</a>, Beahm will likely stream on Rumble until the conclusion of his contract and then go elsewhere, to whichever platform boasts the largest livestreaming audience – assuming he’s no longer radioactive in everybody’s eyes by that point. And who knows: Given how <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/influencers-coming-out-trump-supporters.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companies, brands, and influencers are already acting</a> in the wake of Trump’s reelection, he might be welcomed with open arms in a couple years.</p><p>On the other end of the shitty rich dude spectrum, Conor McGregor is at least having a sort-of bad time. The target of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/conor-mcgregor-ufc-champion-timeline-arrests-abuse-1234772835/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous assault allegations</a>, one finally stuck last week, with a Dublin High Court jury <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2024/11/22/24303310/report-conor-mcgregor-found-liable-of-sexual-assault-in-civil-case-ordered-to-pay-250k-in-damages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding him liable for a sexual assault</a> that took place in 2018. He’s now on the hook for around $250,000 in damages, which is chump change to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettknight/2021/05/12/the-worlds-10-highest-paid-athletes-conor-mcgregor-leads-a-group-of-sports-stars-unfazed-by-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the highest-paid athletes in the world</a>, but at least we get to see him <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2024/11/22/24303376/conor-mcgregor-issues-statement-after-being-found-liable-of-sexual-assault-in-civil-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">throw a big ol’ baby fit about it</a>. Also, he’s been removed from <em>Hitman</em>, which contained a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_bhqjDDgus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mission</a> that saw Agent 47 stalk and assassinate the UFC’s gibbering-has-been-weight champion.</p><p>“In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately,” <em>Hitman </em>studio IO Interactive <a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Twitter</a>. “We take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr. McGregor from our storefronts starting today.”</p><p>On a long enough timescale, I imagine McGregor’s career prospects will look a lot like Beahm’s, except with many, many more zeroes on his checks. Historically, the UFC has not only turned a blind eye to assault perpetrators but <a href="https://defector.com/dana-white-hits-his-wife-at-a-club" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embraced them</a>, offering <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2018/06/no-the-greg-hardy-situation-isnt-about-second-chances-or-redemption-its-about-money" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposed second chances</a> after athletes paid no meaningful penance. Even assuming McGregor never fights again – an outcome that looks more and more likely with every passing month after his previously-scheduled summer 2024 return was <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/40401460/conor-mcgregor-says-broken-toe-forced-ufc-303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled due to a broken toe</a> – he’s still got grubby fingers in <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/mma/conor-mcgregor-businesses-owned" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous other pies</a>. He is <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/ufc/2024/10/13/670b9d6f46163fc9328b45c5.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yacht-owningly wealthy</a>; he could retire from the public eye and shut the fuck up forever tomorrow, and he’d still be able to support his descendants for the next 1,000 years.</p><p>At least we can take solace in the fact that the gaping hole where his soul should be won’t allow him to, and he’ll never find lasting happiness. I just wish that the particular brand of misery embodied by the McGregors and Beahms of the world didn’t love the company of everybody else on planet Earth. That’d be nice. &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What’s going on? I want to play this game already!!!”</p><p>To that, I say, “same.” But let me give you a little insight into what we’ve been doing this last year, and why we need just a couple more months.</p><ol><li><strong>“<a title="Companies > Impossible [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/impossible">Impossible</a>” Difficulty</strong> – The game was originally going to just have “Easy,” “Medium,” and “Hard,” but we decided to add a fourth difficulty level: “Impossible” (previously known as “Expert”). “Impossible” is uh… really hard. We want a little extra time to tune this so it’s not actually impossible, right? But it’s still going to be really hard.</li><li><strong>More Rhythm <a title="Platforms > Rift" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/rift">Rift</a>s</strong> – We added even more Rhythm Rift beatmaps to songs like the boss battle tracks.</li><li><strong>Off-Beat Readability</strong> – The readability of off-beat monsters is probably our number one most received piece of feedback. We’ve been doing a lot of experimenting and playtesting to get this to a state we’re happy with.</li><li><strong>Custom Music Tools</strong> – Thanks to the help of the dev behind <em><a title="Games > Crypt of the NecroDancer [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/crypt-of-the-necrodancer">Crypt of the NecroDancer</a></em> downloadable content “SYNCHRONY,” we did a full revamp of <em>Rift</em>‘s internal level editing tool. Not only that, but we’re preparing it to be released publicly at launch so you can all use this tool to create custom charts to custom songs.</li><li><strong>Remix Mode and Daily Challenges</strong> – Remix Mode started off as one of those “wouldn’t it be cool if…” ideas that ended up actually being really cool. The TL;DR of Remix Mode is that it throws a fresh chart your way every playthrough while retaining the original level’s rhythmic design. That makes Daily Challenges possible, by changing up the circumstances for each song. And we love Daily Challenges. We’d love to do a more in-depth blog about Remix Mode soon to talk about the nuances of developing Remix Mode!</li><li><strong>Tutorial and Practice Mode Improvements</strong> – We’ve made a lot of improvements to our tutorials and practice mode based on feedback we received from the demo. The tutorials are more comprehensive, and we also added in a highly request slowdown functionality (up to 50 percent) into practice mode to help you better parse difficult patterns in high beats per minute songs.</li><li><strong>Animation Clarity and Feel</strong> – We’ve gone through a bunch of iterations on character / monster animations throughout development. If you take a look at our very first trailer and compare it to the demo, you’ll see what a massive difference it is!</li><li><strong>Background Visualizers</strong> – Technically no one asked for this, but this is something that we really wanted to do, and we discovered it adds a lot more visual variety to each Rhythm Rift, which helps us and content creators make better videos.</li><li><strong>Boss Battle and Story Revamp</strong> – We felt there was room for improvement with the state of boss battles and story mode, so we decided to give these aspects a total facelift.</li><li><strong>Shine Factor</strong> – We’ve addressed the majority of our high-impact bugs, but we want to make sure this game is polished to a mirror sheen!</li></ol><!-- AD: content -->

			<p>Humanoid Origin, previously known as Humanoid Studios, a Canadian game developer founded years ago by Casey Hudson (former director of the Mass Effect trilogy), has been shut down due to lack of funding. The news was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> today on the game's LinkedIn page:</p>
<p><em>Earlier today, we informed our staff that Humanoid Origin will be shutting down. Despite efforts to shield the studio from broader challenges in the industry, an unexpected shortfall of funding left us unable to sustain operations. We’re heartbroken that we will not be able to bring our new science-fiction universe to completion. Our main concern at this time however is for our team, and we are committed to supporting them in their transition to new employment. </em></p>
<p><em>In our time together, the team achieved incredible progress, and demonstrated that it's possible to do amazing work while fostering a culture of fun and creativity. We thank them for their talent, courage, and friendship. Thank you to everyone who supported us throughout our journey.</em></p>
<p>The team, which had offices in Edmonton, Alberta, and Kelowna, British Columbia, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/find/?q=humanoid+studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making</a> a multiplatform triple-A sci-fi game, which made perfect sense since Hudson had such experience in the setting. He was also the Game Director of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (which is supposedly getting a remake at some point).</p>
<p><em>At Humanoid Origin, our mission is to deliver magical interactive storytelling, by connecting talented creatives to powerful tools, in a safe &amp; supportive environment.</em></p>
<p>While Hudson's project fell through, there's another big triple-A sci-fi game from former BioWare developers on the way: <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-sci-fi-rpg-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-narrated-by-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exodus</a>, in development at Archetype Entertainment, founded by James Ohlen and Drew Karpyshyn. The game has big Mass Effect vibes, although it has its own twist with the time dilation mechanics that promise great consequences for each choice made by players during their missions.</p>

<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 6 leaks have started pouring out, and it seems we might be getting Godzilla and Baymax in the next battle pass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SamLeakss</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ResetzFtw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetzFTW</a> via reliable Fortnite insider <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, the Godzilla and Baymax collaboration has been “100%” confirmed for the upcoming battle pass. Shiina also shared an <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1861108459699118349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">image</a> along with the leak, which clearly features Godzilla, Baymax, and several other Japanese-themed characters, cosmetic items, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite has various options to play around with when introducing characters like Godzilla and Baymax. In addition to cosmetics through the battle pass, the developers can work towards introducing live events and battle royale integration. However, the extent of these collaborations is unknown, as neither Epic Games nor Fortnite’s official accounts have confirmed this.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-awards-epic-metahuman-fortnite<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic announced the latest round of in-game <em>Fortnite</em> voting for The Game Awards today, where players can check out the <em>Fortnite</em> islands up for an award and play a multiplayer mode in the voting area. Last year, the voting area featured a hologram of Game Awards host Geoff Keighley, as well as a model of him perched high above the proceedings. This year… um.</p><p>In a <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/2024-best-fortnite-island-the-game-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a>, Epic contributor Brian Crecente (who I think used to be Luke’s boss, but whom I have only met once at the Gawker funeral/party) explained that “This year’s digital Keighley is clearly much improved over 2023’s version. Where last year’s hologram look was created using greenscreen video capture, this year’s makes use of <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/metahuman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MetaHuman</a> to deliver a more realistic depiction.” MetaHuman is a feature in Epic’s Unreal Engine that allows users to create “high fidelity digital humans.”</p><p>Crecente writes that Keighley went to Manchester to be scanned for the model, and Keighley himself says in the blog that “The results speak for themselves, I truly feel like I have a digital double!”</p><p>This is that double in-game:</p><figure></figure><p>As far as I can tell, you only see digital Keighley once the first time you enter the mode, so I doublechecked against streamers that this wasn’t just something weird my graphics card was doing. Maybe I’m getting tripped up by how un-<em>Fortnite</em> the model looks in its reach for realism; something about seeing skin textures in <em>Fortnite</em> is hugely weird, and the proportions of the face don’t feel quite right, looking neither like Keighley nor a real face.&nbsp;</p><p>Curiously, I feel like he looks better in the trailer <em>Fortnite</em> released about the mode, which seems to maintain some of the flatness and lack of detail that I expect from <em>Fortnite</em> characters:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite Island 2024" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u3JnlvOR5Xc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While MetaHuman touts that it is creation “made easy,” I’m sure this was not easy to do, so I am not going to play armchair technician and claim I could have made something that looks less uncanny. But I also didn’t think last year’s hologram needed much improving–it looked like Keighley as a hologram, fitting with the mode and with the look of <em>Fortnite</em> in general:</p><figure></figure><p>In last year’s mode, there was also a digital version of Keighley in the gameplay area, which stood at the top of a pile of rocks that, try as I might, I couldn’t scale. I could never get close enough to take a picture, but here’s what he looked like in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChKvof3DP5U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trailer</a> from 2023:</p><figure><figcaption>Epic</figcaption></figure><p>In 2023, he looks like a version of himself in <em>Fortnite</em>! In 2024, he does not; he looks like an uncomfortably semi-realistic character squeezed in front of an unrealistic game mode where you shoot at floating crystals. I’m glad that, unlike last year, he’s not perched threateningly above me, where I would be unable to escape the mental image of his creepy eyes.</p><p>Maybe MetaHuman is a good tool for creators making realistic games in Unreal; I have no idea! But perhaps we didn’t need to see it used here.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>IO Interactive has ended a collaboration with MMA fighter Conor McGregor, after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyrxl00151o">a court ruling in the Irish High Court</a> found that he assaulted and raped a women in 2018.</p>
<p>Releasing a statement on <a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921">social media</a>, IO said that they will remove content featuring McGregor from Hitman: World of Assassination from today:</p>


<p>“In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately. We take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr. McGregor from our storefronts starting today.”</p>
<p>McGregor’s voice and likeness was used for a character named The Disruptor, one of the Elusive Targets in the recent Hitman games. These time limited missions and scenarios rotate in and out of the game to provide shifting challenges to players, giving you just one attempt at a target during its availability. The Disruptor mssion debuted in July of this year, &nbsp;had recently been brought back as the current Elusive Target and was meant to be available until 8th December, but is being pulled early.</p>
<p>In addition to this mission, a Disruptor DLC pack was sold giving permanent access to The Ostentatious, an arcade contract featuring the character, as well as offering outfits, items, and cosmetics for the Freelancer mode HQ.</p>

<p>McGregor was found guilty by the jury in the civil case last week, who found that he had sexually assaulted a woman, Ms Hand, in a Dublin hotel six years ago. As a civil case, McGregor won’t face a jail sentence, but has been ordered to pay €248,000 in damages.</p>
<p>McGregor has stated that he will appeal the verdict.</p>
