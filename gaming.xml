<p>Attack Vector and Sleeper Case get a facelift</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Genki Sleeper Case / Attack Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/907ba70c1f128/genki-sleeper-case-attack-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The relationship between Genki and Switch 2 might forever be defined by that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/accessory-maker-genki-to-discuss-switch-2-info-and-products-at-ces-2025">pre-reveal CES showcase</a>, but the accessory manufacturer has produced a lot of gear for the new hybrid in the months since. While we have liked most of the Switch 2 accessories we've seen so far from the company, select items have not been without their issues, with early teething problems like tricky zippers and too-snug designs. Fortunately, the problematic products have now received an upgrade.</p>
<p>Genki has informed us that both the Attack Vector modular case and the Sleeper Case are now available without any of the issues that both came with at launch. Previously, several users reported that the Attack Vector was too tight in the Switch 2 Dock, making it difficult to play the console up on the big screen, while many found the Sleeper Case's zip to be too tough.</p>
<p>We similarly took issue with the Sleeper Case's zipper in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-sleeper-case-a-virtually-indestructible-switch-2-carry-case-that-looks-as-good-as-it-protects">our review</a>, and while we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/genki-attack-vector-a-modular-switch-2-case-which-opts-for-comfort-over-protection">didn't have any docking issues with the Attack Vector</a>, it's still nice to hear that the accessory manufacturer is listening to its customers.</p>
<p>Both items are now available on the Genki website in their new and improved forms — the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/attack-vector">Attack Vector</a> will set you back <strong>£42/$49.99</strong>, while the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/sleeper-case">Sleeper Case</a> is listed for <strong>£36/$42.99</strong>. These two items accompany the rest of Genki's Switch 2 lineup, including screen protectors, a charging base and more.</p>

<p>Although these teething problems appear to be on the mend, Genki isn't out of the woods yet. Following the company's much-discussed CES presentation back in January (where Switch 2 prototypes were freely shown off, despite Nintendo not yet officially lifting the lid on the system), Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/the-company-that-leaked-switch-2-is-being-sued-by-nintendo">opened a lawsuit</a> against the company, claiming that Genki "demoed and promoted unauthorized purported mockups and renderings of the Nintendo Switch 2 and its accessories".</p>
<p>Genki has since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/accessory-manufacturer-genki-responds-to-nintendos-switch-2-lawsuit">released a statement</a>, claiming that it is "taking [Nintendo's case] seriously and working with legal counsel to respond thoughtfully," and promised that it will "share more when we can".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 580.97) today, optimized for Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced and Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced.</p>



<p>While Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released a while ago</a>, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced is coming out today, simultaneously with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-unreal-engine-5-updated-playstation-5-pro-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5 launch</a>. On PC, when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in May 2024</a>, it already supported NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. With the Enhanced version, though, GeForce RTX 50 GPU owners can enable DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to boost performance even further. That is quite welcome, since this new version adds a 'Very High' graphics preset that was not available at launch:</p>



<p><em>Rather than dialling everything up, our team carefully considered where we could make the most impactful improvements for a visual quality bump at a reasonable performance cost. The result sees more detailed and accurate shadows, improved AntiAliasing, better post-processing such as depth of field, motion blur and bloom.</em></p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>As to GTA V Enhanced, Rockstar's game is also getting NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation. Even with all the ray-traced effects activated (ambient occlusion, global illumination lighting, shadows, and reflections), the RTX 5090 averages 485 frames per second at 4K resolution and max settings, with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode and the latest transformer model enabled. On average, GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards can expect an uplift of 3.9X.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This Friday, the first-person-puzzle-Metroidvania game Supraworld <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1869290/Supraworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will debut on Steam Early Access</a> with day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, and DLAA.</p>



<p>Taking a step back, Titan Quest II launched last week on Steam Early Access and <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-sold-over-300k-less-3-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quickly sold over 300K units</a>. The game already supports NVIDIA DLSS 4 with all its technologies (Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Multi Frame Generation, and DLAA).</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake.1267815/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake is still moving along nicely, according to Remedy in its 2025 half-year financial report. It’s also been revealed that Rockstar Games and Remedy Entertainment are teaming up for the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake.</p>



<p>Remedy’s work on the original Max Payne games was exceptional. Both games sold well and became iconic for their revolutionary bullet-time feature (popularized by The Matrix) and their unique presentation and style. Remedy handed over the franchise to Take-Two, leading to Rockstar Games handling Max Payne 3—another success.</p>



<p>We learned early details about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/remedy-gives-update-on-control-2-and-max-payne/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake in 2023</a>, and the game went into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-2-is-now-playable-as-max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full production in 2024</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-max-payne-1-amp-2-remake-remains-in-full-production">Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake “Remains in Full Production”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Could it lead to a Max Payne 4? Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Remedy’s “Half year financial report January–June 2025” covered many aspects of Remedy, including upcoming projects. There was a new update on the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake, revealing a cool detail.</p>



<p>“The&nbsp;Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake&nbsp;project continues its progress and remains in full production. In the second quarter, the team built on steady momentum from earlier in the year. Collaboration with Rockstar Games remains close and productive, ensuring alignment as the project advances toward its next major phase,” the statement <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>



<p>This means both of Max Payne’s key developers are working together on the project. It’s unclear if this is a 50/50 split of the workload or how much input either team is contributing.</p>



<p>Regardless, long-term Max Payne fans should rest easy knowing Remedy and Rockstar Games are on the case. Can the two companies synergize perfectly to recapture the Max Payne magic? Or do you think there could be some crossed wires? Share your thoughts through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Stellar Blade's PC launch has been a smashing success, as the game has been confirmed to be the fastest- selling Korean game on the platform.</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://t.co/CkPC5KqbI6">financial report </a>for the second quarter of the current fiscal year, Shift Up reported an all-time best performance since the founding of the company, with an operating revenue of 112bn KRW and an operating profit of 68bn KRW. Much of this record-breaking performance is thanks to Stellar Blade, as 58% of the quarterly revenue was from the action RPG. By all metrics, the game continues to be successful even one year after its debut on PlayStation 5, as the game is the fastest-selling Korean game on Steam with <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">1 million units sold in three days</a>, and a total of 3 million sales across PC and console. The nearly 200,000 concurrent users peak on Steam also confirms the game's commercial success, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-more-than-doubles-sonys-previous-steam-ccu-record-for-single-player-games/">beating every other flasgship AAA games published by Sony</a>, including Ghost of Tsushima (77K peak Steam CCU), God of War (73K), Spider-Man (66K), Horizon: Zero Dawn (57K), and The Last of Us Part 1 (37K).</p>



<p>Seeing how Stellar Blade continues to be successful, it's not surprising to see Shift Up continuing to support it on both PC and PlayStation 5. Earlier this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-1-3-0-pc-patch-amd-fsr/">a new patch</a> went live on all formats, introducing improvements and bug fixes for a more enjoyable experience.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5, and may hit Nintendo Switch 2 at some point in the future. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review of the PlayStation 5 release.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Doesn’t Use Controversial EOMM System, Says NetEase Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-does-not-use-eomm-says-netease-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-doesn%E2%80%99t-use-controversial-eomm-system-says-netease-games.1267788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Marvel Rivals player base has dwindled in recent times, and many in the community believe EOMM is a big reason. NetEase has publicly acknowledged the belief and says it’s not the case. The developer is preparing a video set to break down how the game’s matchmaking works.</p>



<p>When you think of matchmaking in major FPS games, you probably default to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM</a>. This is known as Skill-Based Matchmaking, and is a contentious (and constant) frustration across multiplayer games. It favors an algorithm that keeps players in matches with similarly skilled players. EOMM doesn’t get the headlines SBMM does, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-marvel-rivals-planning-collaborations-with-other-marvel-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> has been linked with the controversial system for a while.</p>



<h2 id="h-netease-working-on-video-to-explain-marvel-rivals-matchmaking">NetEase Working on Video to Explain Marvel Rivals Matchmaking</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Swiping away the accusations. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>Presumably tired of the speculation, the Marvel Rivals <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account posted an update on August 12.</p>



<p>“Hi Rivals! As our game continues to thrive, we want to reiterate that Marvel Rivals does not use EOMM. We are currently working on a video to demonstrate our developer insights on the matchmaking and ranking system, which is expected to be released next week,” it said.”</p>



<p>EOMM stands for ‘Engagement Optimized Matchmaking.’ Whereas SBMM targets competitive matches and lobbies, EOMM focuses on player retention and engagement. The long-standing belief is that EOMM is designed to give you regular doses of the highs and lows of online gaming.</p>



<p>One second you’re wrecking lobbies multiple games running—racking up a nasty K/D and W/L ratio—the next, you’re on an unexplainable losing streak. The idea is that the wins keep you playing because you feel powerful, and the losses encourage you to keep playing to secure the next win.</p>



<p>It sounds similar to SBMM. However, the underlying motive is to keep you playing and coming back for more, increasing the likelihood of you spending money on microtransactions.</p>

<p>The video should be a fascinating peek behind the curtain. Will NetEase be completely transparent, or do you think the developer will retain some of the finer details?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/viral-vtuber-%E2%80%98rileycs%E2%80%99-has-been-banned-on-twitch-following-battlefield-6-cheating-allegations.1267785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A VTuber has been banned on Twitch after her Battlefield 6 gameplay clip amassed tens of millions of views.</p>



<p>The Vtuber, named RileyCS posted her Battlefield 6 clips on X on August 8, which prompted many users to accuse her of cheating. The discourse around the clip has resulted in the video accumulating 47.8 million views at the time of writing. </p>



<p>Presumably, the viral tweet has resulted in her being reported to Twitch by those who think she’s been cheating, which has resulted in her ban.</p>



<p>You can watch the clip below to decide for yourself if you think she’s cheating:</p>



<div><article><p><span>the most locked in catgirl you’ll ever see in battlefield 6</span></p></article></div>



<h2 id="h-the-battlefield-6-cheating-allegations">The Battlefield 6 Cheating Allegations</h2>



<p>At first glance, it isn’t difficult to jump to the conclusion that Riley is indeed cheating after watching the footage. Her unique playstyle, which requires her to ‘flick’ onto enemies to get gameplay clips for content, does have all the traits of cheating. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end/"><strong>RELATED – When Does The Battlefield 6 Beta End? Open Beta End Times Explained</strong></a></p>



<p>However, some have argued in favour of Riley, stating that she’s known within the community for this type of content. Battlefield YouTuber Enders has also analysed the clips, which makes for an interesting watch if you have the time. But then again, the counterargument is that you can turn aimbot on and off very easily (with a foot pedal for instance). </p>

<p>Whether Riely is cheating or not is something that will probably be hotly debated for the foreseeable future until either EA comes out to debunk the claims, or Riely plays at some kind of LAN event.</p>



<p>Regardless, the viral clip has prompted dozens more players to capture similar clips and post them to X. So, the cheating accusations within the community against players, regardless if they are legit or not, will likely continue. </p>



<p><strong>UPDATE – Rileycs has now been unbanned from Twitch.</strong></p>



<p>What do you think of Riley’s clips? Do you think she was cheating in Battlefield 6? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/palworld-ripoff-palland-on-nintendo-switch/">The Gamer</a>, a new title by the name of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/palland">Palland</a> is now available via the Switch eShop, and everything from its basic description to its screenshots indicate that it's a blatant rip-off of Palworld. Does that also make it a rip-off of <strong>Pokémon</strong>..? Well, Nintendo would probably say so, yes. We're not so sure about Pocketpair.</p>
<p>Developed by BoggySoft (lovely), Palland was released on <strong>31st July 2025</strong> yet has already been heavily discounted by 60% to a paltry <strong>£3.99 / $5.99</strong>. Just goes to show how much faith BoggySoft has in its product, huh?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mypuqx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>We should also point out that the screenshots included on the eShop page (which you can view below) don't appear to be indicative of the actual experience. If you check out gameplay videos on YouTube from channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UebFsxkHwM">Nintendo Hall</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW4CCT5C7hQ">Game Buoy Games</a>, you can see that the visuals aren't even remotely comparable. Where's all the grass?! It's almost on par with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet and Violet</a>, for goodness' sake (<em>joking</em> - gosh).</p>
<p>Anyway, it's interesting (and funny) that the game responsible for Nintendo's recent lawsuit against Pocketpair now has its own rip-off – on the Switch, no less! Guffaw.</p>

<p>We're fascinated to see whether Pocketpair takes any action against BoggySoft and Palland while it's still knee-deep in its own legal battle against Nintendo. Chances are it probably won't, but who knows.</p>

            <p>Right, stop eating your mate for a minute. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>'s had a big update from developers Aggro Crab and Landfall Games, and it adds a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monument-valley">Monument Valley</a>-esque location for you to scale the cliffs of.</p>
<p>Before you can go mountaineering among the sandy cacti and roaring tornadoes, though, you'll want to put on some suncream. Yes, I know you now do the cannibalism thanks to co-op climber's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-cannibalism-is-delivered-by-the-co-op-climbers-latest-patch">most recent patch</a>, but you've still got to take your skincare seriously. Come on, at least take a parasol.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Mesa biome is Peak's first alternative to its standard Alpine island, with the two set to settle into a rotation once Mesa's had an initial week in the sun. "Explore the sandy terrain under the blistering sun... alongside plenty of mysteries that lie within the shade," the devs write of what to expect. It appears one of these hidden surprises is waiting for you inside a kiln (nobody tell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2onuBxhafg">the Aunty Donna boys</a>).</p>
<p>You'll be trying not to succumb to the heat, while dodging the likes of whirling tornadoes and tumbleweeds, which the update's trailer seems to suggest are more lethal than you might expect of your average meandering plantlife. That's in addition to the age-old Peak threat of just falling to your death from a great height, something I'd imagine won't be helped by the fact the update adds in sticks of dynamite that you and your fellow climbers can run across and make go boom. Hey, at least you can now point at a fuse whenever someone starts licking their chops at the idea of chewing your fingers.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>🌵 THE MESA UPDATE IS OUT NOW 🌵</p><p>a new PEAK biome has dropped on an island near you ‼️ </p><p>explore the sandy terrain under the blistering sun... alongside plenty of mysteries that lie within the shade. <a href="https://t.co/Ni6YGCpQLd">pic.twitter.com/Ni6YGCpQLd</a></p></div>— AGGRO CRAB 💥 (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1954936000045805590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Among the other new items added in are balloons, scout cannons, parasols, sunscreen, and aloe vera. So, it seems the devs have popped into their local health and beauty shop after raiding Wile E. Coyote's ACME surplus. Armed with this stuff, you're tasked with earning a bunch of new badges that dish out fresh gear.</p>
<p>The Mesa update also adds an optional no-insects mode for creepy crawlyphobes, makes some performance improvements, and dishes out some bug fixes. Among the latter are tweaks that prevent legs getting stuck in luggage, as well as one that stops you fiddling with your backpack after you've passed out.</p>
<p>"A lot of you are asking about future updates and to be as honest as possible - we aren't quite sure yet," Aggro Crab and Landfall wrote to close out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498328557405079710?l=english">the update's notes</a>. "We don't want to promise a bunch of stuff and not deliver. BUT we will continue to update the community on what we're cooking as soon as we can. At this stage, keep expecting bug + stability patches for now!"</p>
<p>Right, off you go to climb those buttes. You'd better not come back glowing pink or your mum'll be furious.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peaks-mesa-update-lets-you-shimmy-your-sandy-butt-up-some-sandy-buttes-adds-tornados-and-dynamite]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While admitting that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>'s launch on Steam "underperformed", developers Remedy have re-iterated their commitment to the co-op shooter in their <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5">latest financial report</a>, saying that it remains "a solid game to build on" and confirming that a previously announced major update will arrive in late September.</p>
<p>The report also gives quick mini-updates on the development of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> and the combined <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/max-payne">Max Payne 1</a> &amp; 2 remake, both of which remain on course.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to Remedy CEO Tero Virtala, Control spinoff Firebreak enjoyed a launch that "succeeded technically" and attracted plenty of players on console. However, it "underperformed" on Steam, which had been pegged as the storefront through which it would attract most of its PC players. The overall result was launch sales that left the studio "unsatisfied", and have seen the game rely on Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus to prop it up out of the gate.</p>
<p>However, Remedy's commitment to updating and and improving Firebreak isn't faltering, and the studio are reportedly pleased with feedback to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-a-bit-of-a-rough-launch-remedy-promise-that-fbc-firebreak-improvements-are-on-the-way">the changes they've already made</a>, citing a turnaround in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fbc-firebreak-review">review sentiment</a> as updates have arrived. "FBC: Firebreak was designed as a game that evolves over time," Virtala said, "Despite the rocky launch, we believe we have a solid game to build on." Firebreak's first major update, which Remedy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540?emclan=103582791474781150&amp;emgid=536607976683733002">first teased last month</a>, is set to arrive in late September and bring a new job (aka mission) with it.</p>
<p>Remedy have consistently maintained their public-facing support for the shooter, and it's encouraging to see that hasn't changed now that they've had to explain its rough launch to the money types. After all, the need to make spreadsheets look and presentations sound as dollar-sign-heavy as possible is leaving an awful lot of games that won't provide immediate runaway successes (or need a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">long-term push to get them where they want to be</a>) facing the chopping block. That's been doubly true for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">multiplayer games which suffer difficult releases</a>.</p>
<p>As for Control 2 and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-are-remaking-max-payne-1-2">Max Payne 1 and 2 remake</a>, the former is "on track towards meeting its next milestones", with "the gameplay, environments, and missions" being the big focus of its development right now. Meanwhile, the Payne remake is still in the full production phase, with Remedy making sure they keep working closely with collaborators Rockstar as the game approaches a "next major phase". Sales-wise, the studio say both Control and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> are still ticking away nicely, with the rights to the former having now transferred fully into Remedy's hands.</p>
<p>So, all eyes towards that big September update for Firebreak, and the job Remedy do in continuing to revamp their game that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/controls-office-junior-firebreak-cant-decide-if-its-a-job">designed not to be a second job</a>, despite containing jobs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-are-still-backing-fbc-firebreak-despite-a-slow-steam-launch-confirming-its-next-major-update-for-september]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-vr3000-wireless-earbuds-review.1267740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Final have a long and storied history in the audio sector. Established in 1974, the Japanese company soon became well-known for their detailed audio, with products from record player cartridges through to speakers and amps. In the present day, Final have retained that penchant for detail, turning their focus to consumer headsets and earbuds. The Final VR3000 Wireless is the latest of those products, a true wireless</p>
<p>The Final VR3000 Wireless is a pair of gaming-focused Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz wireless-equipped earbuds, with our review unit arriving in an understated black. In the pack you get the earbuds, a dinky USB-C low-latency wireless dongle, a curved charging case, a charging cable, and a selection of eartips so you can find the best fit.</p>
<p>The case is relatively small – about the same width as an Airpod Pro case, but thicker thanks to the wider earbuds inside. It’s pleasantly smooth, but it’s definitely lighter and more plasticky feeling than some of those you’ll experience with more premium earbuds. In terms of controls, there’s a single pairing button on the front, and four LEDs to show charging state and connection to the earbuds, while charging comes via the USB-C port at the bottom.</p>



<p>The earbuds boast a very good 11 hours of charge, with the case extending that by 38 hours, and they can both go&nbsp;from empty to full in two hours. The VR3000 Wireless have been great for a few recent trips, lasting through all of my Switch 2 gaming while on the go, and the few times I’ve had to charge they’ve topped up super-fast. They’re definitely easy to live with.</p>

<p>The low-latency USB-C transmitter is nice and small, so whether you’re using the top or bottom USB-C sockets on Switch 2 – or any other device, including mobile – it’s small enough to stay out of the way, and doesn’t look too odd or out of place. My one fear is that there’s no place for this in the charging case, and it feels as though it’s something that I’m going to lose sooner or later, or a feature that’s best kept at home.</p>
<p>The earbuds themselves take some design cues from Apple’s Airpods, with a short arm extending down from the body of the earbud, though the touch controls are on the main surface of the earbud instead of the stem. They have a larger central body though, and that undoubtedly helps the VR3000’s bass response. It doesn’t make them the slimmest or sleekest buds though, and I found they stick out just that little more than some earbuds out there. They’re made from relatively light black plastic though, and the low weight means that they don’t start to wear on you through longer listening or gaming sessions.</p>

<p>The Final VR3000 wireless sound excellent, especially for gaming. The use of the USB-C 2.4Ghz transmitter certainly improves the audio quality, but there isn’t a gulf of difference between wireless and Bluetooth that you might find elsewhere. The bass response is powerful and enveloping, making it ideal for high-action titles like Cyberpunk 2077, while it dispenses more thoughtful soundtracks like those found in Tales of Shire or Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar with careful nuance.</p>
<p>There is a little more mid in the mix than I’d often look for, particularly when listening to music, but it helps to lift vocals and dialogue from the other instrumentation or audio details. I did find that music listening benefited from some EQ tweaking, but Bad Omen’s Concrete Jungle sounded excellent, with powerful guitars grinding away while the soaring vocals showcase the separation that the VR3000 are capable of.</p>
<p>The VR3000 Wireless have clearly been tuned for gaming and content though. I’ve been consistently surprised by just how good they sound, and their form factor has made them an ideal choice for handheld and mobile gaming. I’ve been playing a lot of Wild Hearts S, and the monster-hunting action sounded brilliant with the VR3000, especially the Eastern-influenced orchestral soundtrack.</p>

<p>That’s helped by the hybrid ANC. The noise cancellation is clearly a step below what you’ll find in Apple’s AirPods Pro or Sony’s XM5 earbuds, but it does a decent job of erasing sounds like fan noise from your PC, Steam Deck or Switch 2, or cutting down on &nbsp;low-level train and plane background sound. The lighter effect does mean that no discernible pressure or audio alteration is happening, and if you’re playing competitively, that’s going to help you stay focused and on point. At this price point, it’s a welcome inclusion, even if it isn’t the strongest version I’ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>Final have their own Android and iOS app as well, though it is distinctly bare bones. It does, however, let you adjust the EQ settings, with a batch of presets, and there’s the option to customise the sound setup as well, which is essential. Besides that, you can turn the ANC on and off, or set it to Ambient, and update the earbuds’ firmware. It is all very clear and easy to operate, but it would have been nice to delve into the earbuds’ setup a little further.</p>
<p>At £129.99, the Final VR3000 sit in the mid-range price point for earbuds. If you’re gaming, the USB-C dongle offers a clear advantage over Bluetooth-only options, both in terms of latency and reliable connection. If you have a Switch 2 or a Steam Deck, that recommendation is even higher as the dongle pops into the top USB-C port. If you’re planning on listening to a lot of music though, the Hecate GX05 are the better option, offering Hi-Res audio, and a place to store the USB-C dongle, though the huge, heavy, screen-scratching metal case will be a distinctly bigger statement than the VR3000’s understated option. If you find you have more money in your pocket, there’s also the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds which have a lot of the same features, but improve on some of the VR3000’s core features such as ANC, while including having a space in the case for the dongle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1955159081259258112">has announced</a> that it’s bringing <em>Fortnite</em> back to iOS in Australia, after the country’s federal court ruled that Apple and Google’s app marketplaces are anticompetitive. Epic CEO <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1955163422502408272">Tim Sweeney said on X</a> that <em>Fortnite</em> will be made available on iPhones via the Epic Games Store “at a date to be determined,” while the company navigates the complexities of Australia’s antitrust ruling.</p><p>Epic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323100/epic-google-australia-legal-claim-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit">sued Google in Australia</a> in March 2021, after suing Apple in November 2020. A single court is handling both cases in parallel, even though they weren’t filed at the same time.</p><p>On Tuesday, federal judge Jonathan Beach found that Apple and Google misused their app marketplace dominance and in-app purchase commission fees of up to 30 percent to reduce competition, the <a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/federal-court-finds-apple-google-anticompetitive-in-fortnite-app-fight-20250811-p5mm2f"><em>Australian Financial Review</em></a> reports. However, Beach rejected Epic’s claims that the tech giants had broken consumer law or engaged in “unconscionable conduct” — meaning particularly harsh, unfair, or oppressive behavior that goes against societal norms. We are still awaiting further details from Beach’s final judgment, which is more than 2,000 pages long and won’t be released publicly.</p><p>“We welcome the court’s rejection of Epic’s demands that we distribute app stores from within the Google Play store, and Epic’s attacks on other critical security protections that users rely on,” Google spokesperson Dan Jackson said in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>“However, we disagree with the court’s characterization of our billing policies and practices, as well as its findings regarding some of our historical partnerships, which were all shaped in a fiercely competitive mobile landscape on behalf of users and developers,” Jackson said. “We will review the full decision when we receive it and assess our next steps.”</p><p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-12/epic-games-fortnite-v-apple-google-federal-court-case/105641794">Australia’s <em>ABC News</em></a>, an unnamed Apple spokesperson said that the company welcomes the court’s rejection of some of Epic’s claims, but that it disagrees with other aspects of the ruling. “Apple faces fierce competition in every market where we operate,” the spokesperson said. “We continuously invest and innovate to make the App Store the safest place for users to get apps and a great business opportunity for developers in Australia and around the world.”</p><p>Epic originally sued Apple and Google in the United States on August 13th, 2020, in two separate cases which went before two separate judges, with dramatically different results in each case. Epic largely <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling">lost its fight against Apple</a> after attempting to take the fight all the way to the US Supreme Court, but Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">may lose a large degree of control over its App Store anyhow</a> because it failed to comply with the district court’s order.</p><div><p>After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments">removing <em>Fortnite</em> from the App Store</a> in 2020 amid its feud with Epic, Apple later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661290/fortnite-ios-iphone-epic-games-back-apple-app-store">brought the game back</a> to its iPhone app marketplace in May. <em>Fortnite</em> also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">returned to iPhones in the EU last year</a>, but only via the Epic Games Store for iOS.</p></div><p>Meanwhile in the US version of the Google trial, Epic has continually won: in late 2023, a jury unanimously decided that Google turned its Play Store and Play Billing system into an illegal monopoly, and a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716856/epic-v-google-win-in-appeals-court">just affirmed that decision at the end of July</a>.</p><p>That decision could blow up Google’s control over its app store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717440/google-epic-open-play-store-emergency-stay">within weeks or months</a>, unless Google gets the Ninth Circuit to grant a stay while it appeals to the US Supreme Court or grants a full en banc review of the three-judge panel’s decision. Google is arguing that the Apple decision should be relevant to the Google decision, but so far US courts disagree.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/757885/epic-apple-google-australia-judgment]]></content:encoded>

Humanity might be on the ropes, but in the towering stronghold of The Belfry they have created a beacon of salvation that casts rays of hope across a ruined land.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That sense of optimism in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds is seared into the gameplay itself, with Stoic asking players to lean on their companions and fight for a brighter future by working together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grammy-nominated </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> composer Austin Wintory, who previously worked with Stoic to piece together the score for The Banner Saga, sought to mirror that sense of optimism and joyousness in the game's soundscape.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking about his process to Game Developer earlier this year, Wintory explained he strove to craft a score that refused to veer into nihilism or cynicism. Yes, there is darkness—but never without light. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> creative director Ernie Jorgensen told Wintory he wanted the title to reflect the sort of emotional qualities you often find in Pixar or Disney movies. The veteran composer did his best to oblige.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That [request] felt really novel because lots of games are all too excited to lean into the gritty side of things, not least of which our previous collaboration, The Banner Saga trilogy! Those games were super heavy, and so I think part of it was also just a reaction to that," explained Wintory.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/digging-into-sag-aftra-s-stellar-win-with-sarah-elmaleh-game-developer-podcast-ep-51" target="_self" data-discover="true">Digging into SAG-AFTRA’s Stellar Win With Sarah Elmaleh - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 51</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"How that manifested musically was a few different things but above all, the music is very very melodic. Big, old fashioned, almost 19th century-style Romantic melodies in a great big orchestral palette. In a world where so many games (including many of my own!) put tons of emphasis on mood and texture, leaning so hard into a bygone tradition gave it that optimistic quality. I think part of why that works, and maybe I'm simply being sentimental here, is that those traditions are really powerful and special, and it felt like we were doing our part to ensure their preservation."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Wintory, preservation is itself an act of hope. "To say 'these things that were plentiful before actually mattered, and are worth saving,' that feels like an intrinsically optimistic thing to do," he added. "That's my own projection at least."&nbsp;</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uBPHKPDIscw?si=b3bWIWbnXkcxwExm" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even so, Wintory admitted he initially felt as if he was "betraying" his own creative process by leaning on old fashioned techniques instead of taking wild swings. He said he strives to be as "radical as possible" within the parameters of each project, but this time around had to coax out his nostalgic side.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/sag-aftra-members-ratify-new-interactive-media-contract-conclude-year-long-strike" target="_self" data-discover="true">SAG-AFTRA members ratify new interactive media contract</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As part of that process, he sought to ensure individual musicians received their time in the limelight. Highlighting musicianship has always been a fundamental part of his approach, but it became even more central with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For example, the cello performances of Tina Guo in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Journey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were extremely significant to me. I wanted to make sure players don't just hear a 'cello' in some abstract way, but that they feel and hear her. Her choices, her subjective touches. Every project I've worked on except for the very, very tiny number of ones that were truly 100 percent electronic (like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>flOw</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, my first ever game), this has been important. But with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, there aren't really any tricks beyond that. It's the entire focus," he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"On top of that, our interactive combat system is built around an idea of really feeling the orchestra up-shift and down-shift in energy. Without feeling those changes in the actual performances themselves, and the way they made the air vibrate, the whole thing wouldn't come off. I wanted to make sure you could feel this amazing 70-piece orchestra pivot from playing very loud to very soft. The actual decibels on the recording are nearly the same, but the emotional impacts are so distinct from each other."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/sag-aftra-urges-more-non-struck-game-studios-to-sign-interim-agreement" target="_self" data-discover="true">SAG-AFTRA urges more non-struck game studios to sign interim agreement</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those performances were captured in Wintory's backyard of Los Angeles at the legendary Warner Bros scoring stage.

It has been 12 years since Wintory himself recorded there and it was a homecoming that felt long overdue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When I was about 14 years old I saw a documentary about the composer Jerry Goldsmith, my all-time favorite, and in it we see a lot of footage of him conducting the recordings from the 1994 thriller </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The River Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. And something I always loved was that he wouldn't say "French Horns, at bar 20 can you be louder?" He would say "Jim, a bit louder at bar 20." Or "Mike, let's try something else at the end here," talking to pianist Mike Lang," he explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The orchestra were his peers, even his friends. Almost like being in a band. And that was a huge motivation for me wanting to pursue music and composing, and also to live specifically in LA. A town where seemingly everyone is creative and you constantly go into a studio together to make art. What a dream!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Sadly, it's proven to not be the case in terms of recording games. I've been lucky to do a handful of movies and other things here over the years, but 99 percent of my game recording has been in cities like London, Nashville, Vienna and Skopje (Macedonia). And don't get me wrong, I've traveled to all those cities and built some amazing friendships and wonderful memories. But being the sentimental type that I am, it's never quite the same as recording in your home, with sort of 'chosen family.' These musicians here are so much a part of my social life, but so rarely my professional one. So it was a massively cathartic and wonderful experience to finally rectify that."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>The head of Riot Games' anti-cheat team Phillip Koskinas has confirmed why you can't have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/valorant">Valorant</a> running at the same time. Yes, it involves a clash between EA's Javalin anti-cheat and Riot's Vanguard anti-cheat.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/deteccphilippe/status/1954976139530866904">Posting on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Koskinas wrote: "Vanguard is compatible with Javelin, and you don't need to uninstall one anti-cheat to use the other. However, BF6 does not currently allow the Valorant client to be running simultaneously, because both drivers race to protect regions of game memory with the same technique."</p> <div>

<p>In layman's terms, both Valorant and Battlefield 6 need to run in a particular way while they are running on your computer. When it comes to interacting with game memory, they do the same thing. Detecting another program is messing around at the kernel level and touching things they are monitoring, the anti-cheats identify each other as potential problems and thus issues arise.</p>

<p>The conversation around Javalin and Vanguard causing problems together stems from several posts during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-almost-250000-people-waiting-in-an-open-beta-queue">last weekend's Battlefield 6 open beta</a>, in which some users were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mlwcbl/battlefield_6_just_told_me_to_uninstall_valorant/">reporting error messages</a> stopping them from playing the absurdly popular shooter while Valorant was running. So while you don't need to uninstall Valorant to play Battlefield 6 this weekend for its second open beta, you should probably make sure the game is totally closed before you do so.</p>
<p>Still it's easy to see why deep-access kernel level anti-cheats are used in games like Battlefield 6. According to EA, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-system-has-already-prevented-330000-attempts-to-cheat-or-tamper-with-anti-cheat-controls">Javelin caught over 330,000 attempted cheaters over its first weekend</a>. All this during what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">EA has dubbed Battlefield's biggest open beta ever</a>.</p>
<p>So for now it seems like an easy fix for those looking to get some Battlefield 6 games in. It does seem unlikely the way either Javelin or Vanguard work will be changing, due to the low number of players looking to run two shooters simultaneously. Still, as kernel-level anti-cheats become the norm these conflicts between opposing systems is something to keep an eye on.</p></div>

            <p>Remedy is "unsatisfied" with the sales of its live-service shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, as the game underperformed on Steam.</p>
<p>As part of the company's half year financial <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5">report</a>, CEO Tero Virtala stated Remedy's revenue increased by 63.5 percent, with game sales increasing due to the release of FBC: Firebreak.</p>
<p>The launch succeeded technically and had over a million players in its first 10 days. However, the majority of players were on Xbox Series X/S and PS5, where the game was available day one on subscription services. On Steam - intended as the primary sales channel on PC - the launch "underperformed".</p>

<p>"The game's initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews," admitted Virtala. "As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive."</p>
<p>Virtala continued: "Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of FBC: Firebreak. Thus far, FBC: Firebreak's commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognised throughout the contract period."</p>
<p>The performance of FBC: Firebreak is important to Remedy as its first self-published game, a spin-off of its popular single-player game Control.</p>
<p>Shortly after the game's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-hears-your-criticism-loudly-and-clearly-and-is-fixing-things-starting-now">Remedy stated it heard fan feedback "loud and clearly"</a> and was committed to improving the game. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-team-acknowledges-onboarding-frustrations-assuring-things-will-change">Remedy acknowledged onboarding frustrations </a>and noted patches released for a better experience.</p>
<p>"FBC: Firebreak was designed as a game that evolves over time," said Virtala in the report. "Despite the rocky launch, we believe we have a solid game to build on. Players who spent over an hour with the game reviewed the game mostly positive - showing us that the core experience of the game is entertaining."</p>
<p>A major update is planned for September, which Remedy expects will drive further interest in the game. "We are committed to continuing to work on FBC: Firebreak, engaging with the community, and expanding the game," said Virtala.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the report, Remedy confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> development is "on track towards meeting its next milestones", focusing now on gameplay, environments, and missions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 &amp; 2 remake project is also in full production.</p>
<p>Lifetime sales of Control have now surpassed 5m copies. Earlier this year, the publishing, distribution and marketing rights for the game transferred to Remedy, resulting in positive sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, meanwhile, has "continued to sell steadily and accrue royalties", though no sales figure has been provided. The horror game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-fastest-selling-remedy-game-but-yet-to-turn-a-profit">Remedy's fastest-selling game</a>, but only became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-is-finally-profitable-over-a-year-after-release-says-remedy">profitable a year after release once sales passed 2m</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Finnish developer Remedy Games <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> the half-year financial report, admitting that FBC: Firebreak did not perform well. We already knew that, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-has-surpassed-1-million-players-though-remedy-knows-theres-a-lot-of-work-to-do/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">milestone of one million players</a> was highly misleading since the game was available on both Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus to the respective subscribers.</p>



<p>Indeed, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala said that the majority of the players were on those two platforms, whereas the Steam launch 'underperformed' compared to the studio's hopes:</p>



<p><em>The game's initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews. As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive.</em></p>



<p><em>Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of FBC: Firebreak. Thus far, FBC: Firebreak's commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognized throughout the contract period.</em></p>



<p>With that being said, it was not all doom-and-gloom from the Remedy executive, who noted that FBC: Firebreak was always meant to be a live, evolving game. The studio now thinks it has a solid foundation to expand on, with the next major update scheduled to go live in late September.</p>



<p>On the bright side, Control's lifetime sales have now surpassed five million units. Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-ip-acquired-by-remedy-for-e17-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regained full control of its publishing, distribution, and marketing rights in February 2024</a>, so the sales now go only to the Finnish developer. Alan Wake 2 continues to sell 'steadily' and accrue royalties, according to Virtala, who then switched to an update on the studio's upcoming projects.</p>



<p>Control 2 (which is being made <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a smaller budget than Alan Wake 2</a>) is on track to meet its next milestones, which will be focused on gameplay, environments, and missions. The studio wants the game to have a strong commercial offering when it launches. The Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake also made steady progress; during the last quarter, Remedy built on the momentum established earlier in 2025 while collaborating closely with IP owner Rockstar Games. </p>

<p>Sarah Bond, the President of Xbox since 2023, has revealed a new appointment on the Board of Directors at Tyson Foods. The curveball placement was uncovered in a press release from Tyson Foods, a company with Arkansas origins dating back to 1931. Under the Tyson banner sit the likes of Bosco’s, State Fair, Jimmy Dean, and Reuben.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean that Sarah Bond is relocating from under a tech titan to work at a food-focused conglomerate. She has joined the board as an independent director, which is a similar position she already holds at other corporations and companies.</p>

<p>Sarah is dynamic and passionate, with proven management strength, and her energy and personality are a wonderful fit for our culture. As our management team, members of the board and the Tyson family got to know Sarah, we immediately felt that she would be a tremendous addition to Tyson Foods.</p>



<p>We are confident that her unique expertise will help us continue to grow and serve our customers, our team members, and our shareholders.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a short response, Bond said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Tyson Foods is a world-class food company with iconic brands, and I am delighted to join the board and support the company as it continues to execute its long-term growth strategy with customers and consumers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Taking a glance at Bond’s LinkedIn profile, you can see that she’s also on the board of the USC School of Cinematic Arts and the Entertainment Software Association. In a report from <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/08/xbox-president-delighted-to-join-board-of-directors-at-tyson-foods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PureXbox</a>, it was also noted that Bond is on the board of Zuora, a subscription management platform.</p>



<p>When I looked up Tyson Foods, I found that the company provides extensive volumes of meat and ingredients to fast food chains like KFC, Taco Bell, McDonald’s, and Burger King, and that the titan boasts more than 120 food processing plants. That’s one hell of a global reach.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>MrBeast has officially joined Kick.com to further promote his TeamWater campaign, just weeks after receiving a one-of-a-kind trophy from YouTube for landing 400 million subscribers. The TeamWater campaign has just ticked over $15 million raised after a trio comprised of MrBeast, Adin Ross, and xQc fronted the mission.</p>



<p>The goal is to raise $40 million by the end of the month to support the provision of clean water to countries around the world. It’s a classic MrBeast move, and it has attracted the support of more than 3,000 influencers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-welcome-to-kick-mrbeast">Welcome to Kick, MrBeast</h2>



<p>MrBeast’s arrival on Kick was celebrated by the platform in <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/1955021765878616107" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a social media post</a> akin to the ones published to welcome <strong>partnered creators</strong>. In the hours that followed, MrBeast racked up thousands of followers on the third most-popular streaming platform in the business, further extending his reach and leaning on Adin Ross and xQc’s audiences.</p>



<p>It has been reported that ‘the deal’ to secure MrBeast’s affiliation included a $5 million donation towards the TeamWater campaign.</p>



<p>If there’s one negative sentiment to take away from this reveal, it’s that MrBeast has aligned himself with some less-than-favored creators who have worked hard drumming up awful auras for themselves in recent years.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If successful, the TeamWater campaign will provide clean water to a range of countries around the world, including those located in Africa and South America. After just a few days, almost 50% of the target has been hit, and efforts are expected to accelerate in the coming weeks as the deadline approaches.</p>



<p>MrBeast’s team is also supporting TeamWater by sending 100% of all merchandise purchases to the total money raised.</p>



<p>Are you <a href="https://teamwater.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">going to donate</a> to TeamWater’s campaign? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-black-ops-7-teasers-promote-the-guild/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-black-ops-7-teasers-are-appearing-to-promote-%E2%80%98the-guild%E2%80%99.1267671/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent hours, eagle-eyed Call of Duty fans have been finding and sharing teasers promoting ‘The Guild’, a fictional tech titan operating (assumedly) at the heart of Black Ops 7. The global reveal of Black Ops 7 is set to take place next week at the Opening Night Live ceremony at Gamescom.</p>



<p>The teasers, which include a trailer, a new Activision-backed website, and billboards in San Francisco, have fans theorizing about Black Ops 7.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-won-t-fear-tomorrow">‘We Won’t Fear Tomorrow’</h2>



<p>In social circles, a new website built by Activision is being shared. It promotes a fictional company called The Guild, an organization charged with shaping the future and using technology as the mold:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At The Guild, our mission is to harness the power of technology to protect and uplift lives around the world. We unite exceptional minds to build a future where security and peace of mind are a universal right.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://theguild.io/?ref=gamingtrend.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The website</a> is packed with robotic iconography, showcasing ‘Guild robots’ in a series of situations, such as saving children from fires, providing aid to refugees, and rebuilding shattered settlements.</p>



<p>CharlieIntel captured and shared the teaser video hosted on the site:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans were quick to comment on the video and the teaser, suggesting it’s not at all what they were hoping for from Black Ops 7. One wrote that it’s ‘Black Ops Advanced Warfare with SBMM and futuristic garbage’, while another said, ‘Why even try with this BS?’</p>



<p>Plenty of netizens were keen to point out that Battlefield 6 is dominating this year. It’s accurate, given that the Battlefield 6 beta decimated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/">Call of Duty’s player records</a> on Steam and hit almost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beaten-almost-every-cod-game-twitch/">one million concurrent viewers</a> on Twitch. This could be the first year that Battlefield ‘beats’ Call of Duty, even if EA’s developers don’t feel they need to.</p>



<p>What do you think about the imminent reveal of Black Ops 7? Are you hopeful that it’ll be a banger year for Call of Duty? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-legal-notice-banned-predator-hunter-freeschlep/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-issues-legal-notice-to-banned-%E2%80%98predator-hunter%E2%80%99-in-freeschlep-drama.1267665/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Roblox Corporation has banned a prolific ‘predator hunter’ from the platform and issued to them a cease and desist order penned by the company’s lawyers, it has been revealed. In recent days, ‘Schlep’, a YouTuber with over 640,000 followers, has revealed a battle with Roblox that stems from his predator-hunting activities on the platform.</p>



<p>Schlep claims he has directly influenced the arrest of six predators using the Roblox ecosystem for nefarious activities, and historically, he has joined forces with other creators to trap and catch wrongdoers.</p>



<p>He’s now being pursued by the Roblox Corporation, which is eager to clamp down on his work, but the ‘FreeSchlep’ campaign is fighting back.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-sleep-well-at-night">‘I Sleep Well at Night’</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Schlep expressed his sentiments towards the ban issued to him by Roblox, before following up with a copy of the cease and desist order sent by the company:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>No matter how it gets painted, me and my team got 6 predators arrested within the Roblox community in under a year. </p>



<p><strong>I sleep well at night</strong> knowing these people will not be able to abuse anymore children on Roblox. My work will always have amounted to something.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The cease and desist order from Roblox accused Schlep of:</p>



<ul>
<li>Engaging in simulated child endangerment conversations</li>



<li>Sharing or soliciting personally identifiable information (PII)</li>



<li>Directing users to move conversations off-platform</li>
</ul>



<p>The claim is that Schlep and ‘his team’ are directly undermining Roblox’s safety efforts and exposing users to <strong>more risks</strong>. </p>



<div><article><p><span>Full legal cease and desist notice from Roblox to me.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Schlep uploaded a video talking about the FreeSchlep situation that garnered more than 1.3 million views in less than 48 hours:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Roblox Is Threatening to Sue Me For Protecting Kids" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMqAw_NjHK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The ban and legal action have prompted a social media campaign fronted by the hashtag #FreeSchlep. The creator and predator hunter has been supported by other YouTubers like JiDion, who created a 15-minute video explaining the situation and revealed that he too is being pursued by Roblox.</p>



<p>Roblox has had a clear and well-documented issue with predators and child safety for years. It’s a critical concern that has been addressed publicly by many activists and protestors fighting against the inherently unsafe platform. It’s not easy to keep children safe on Roblox, despite the lengths the company has gone to in a bid to protect them.</p>



<p>Recently, in a bizarre twist, it was suggested that Roblox might soon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-dating-someday-for-those-afraid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">host a <strong>dating platform</strong></a> that users can lean on to find love in Roblox rather than meeting people in real life.</p>



<p>Do you think Roblox has a huge issue with predators, and this kind of legal action isn’t a good look for the corporation? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It has rubberized grips with a leather-like texture, which makes the controller feel slightly different than other Xbox Wireless Controllers with textured grips. On each side of the Xbox Guide button, you'll find two 3D "spikes" to mimic Doomguy's helmet. Since Doomguy is always slaying demons, the controller has streaks of blood and "chips" in the paint.</p><p>The Doom Slayer armor theme extends to the controls as well. The left stick is gray, while the right is red to align with Doomguy's chest port. Instead of ABXY labels, each face button is marked by a letter from the Sentinel alphabet. The triggers and bumpers are green on the left and silver on the right.</p><p>Inside the box, you'll find a voucher to redeem the Doom Slayer Executioner Skin in The Dark Ages. When you get the controller, remove the battery cover for a neat Easter Egg.</p><p>Like all Xbox Wireless Controllers from Microsoft, the Doom-themed model works wirelessly on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Mac, Steam Deck, and mobile.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4548522-doomthedarkagescontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4548522" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4548522-doomthedarkagescontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4548522"></a><figcaption>Doom: The Dark Ages Xbox Wireless Controller (Limited Edition)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4548522-doomthedarkagescontroller.png"></figure><p>Along with Doom: The Dark Ages, fans can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DOOM-Anthology-Steam-PC-Other-System/dp/B0DCHS3FJB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">save on Doom Anthology</a>, which compiles six Doom games in one package with a steelbook case and a miniature BFG for display.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-nintendo-switch-games-hit-all-time-low-prices-at-walmart/1100-6533821/">Mario Nintendo Switch Games Hit All-Time Low Prices At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-dark-ages-limited-edition-xbox-wireless-controller-gets-massive-discount/1100-6533850/">Doom Limited Edition Xbox Controller Gets Massive Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yakuza-0-directors-cut-for-switch-2-is-discounted-for-the-first-time/1100-6531083/">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut For Switch 2 Is Discounted For The First Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crkd-gibson-les-paul-wireless-guitar-controllers-consoles-and-pc-buying-guide/1100-6529788/">CRKD's Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controllers Are Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rebuild-of-evangelion-blu-ray-editions-neon-genesis-evangelion-complete-series/1100-6533665/">Two Rebuild Of Evangelion Movies Are Finally Returning To Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-star-wars-3-in-1-clone-wars-mandalorian-adventure-gift-set-walmart-2025/1100-6533571/">New Lego Star Wars Gift Bundle In Stock At Walmart - 3 Sets For $45</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-minecraft-5-in-1-world-explorer-walmart-gift-set-2025/1100-6533572/">Lego Minecraft 5-In-1 Gift Set Up For Grabs For $45 Exclusively At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-deals-limited-edition-restock-guide/1100-6526172/">Rune Factory: Guardians Of Azuma For Switch 2 Gets First Discount</a></li>   </ul> </div>
