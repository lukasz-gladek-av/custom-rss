BioWare boss Gary McKay has shared fresh details of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, including word on its romance and combat, just a day after the game was announced to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-confusion-over-whats-happening-with-dragon-age-dreadwolf-this-week">changed its name from Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Ahead of a full 15 minutes of gameplay footage set to debut next week, McKay answered questions from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">IGN</a> on some of its core mechanics and characters.
</p>
<p>
"I won't spoil next week's reveal but I can say we've created a story where you can impact the world and the companions that surround you," McKay said, emphasising the game's name change as being a reflection of the importance of your allies - the Dawnguard themselves.

<p>
"Player agency is important to the Dragon Age: The Veilguard experience and allows each player to form unique personal connections with their companions of choice. And, yes, you can romance the companions you want!"
</p>
<p>
This certainly sounds as if romance won't be locked to only specific characters, as it was in Inquisition, and will be more akin to Dragon Age 2, or Baldur's Gate 3.
</p>
<p>
Seven companions is the "right number for the story we're telling," McKay continued. "As you accompany your companions to unravel their backstory and earn their loyalty and friendship, you'll visit more regions of Thedas across a deeper variety of biomes than any Dragon Age before."
</p>
<p>
As for combat, BioWare veterans may also be pleased to hear of an ability wheel that lets you freeze time and plan future actions.
</p>
<p>
"As an RPG, strategy in combat is important as you bring two companions to every fight. Each companion brings unique powers and abilities that have a direct impact on how you choose to take down the enemies at hand. To add another layer to that strategic element, we're introducing a new ability wheel where you can pause the action and set up your next move – whether it's your companions' abilities or your own.
</p>
<p>
"The ability wheel opens up a huge amount of strategic possibilities, giving players the ability to control the flow of combat and link powerful combinations of abilities between players and their companions."
</p>
<p>
BioWare has said we'll get our first look at 15 minutes of gameplay for Dragon Age: The Veilguard next week, on Tuesday 11th June at 4pm UK time, as the ever-busy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">not-E3 / Summer Game Fest week</a> continues.

            <p>
The release date for Sonic x Shadow Generations has leaked ahead of a possible announcement this weekend during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">Summer Game Fest</a>.
</p>
<p>
The leak comes courtesy of <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/sonic-x-shadow-generations-on-pense-connaitre-la-date-de-sortie-du-nouveau-titre-de-sega-52416">Dealabs</a>, which confirms the release date as 25th October 2024. Additionally, the game will cost $49.99 and will be released across PS5, Xbox One/Series X/S, Switch, and PC.
</p>
<p>
The box art for the game has also leaked, thanks to X account Arsène Lupin. Unsurprisingly, it features Shadow alongside both classic and modern Sonic.

And lastly, there are screenshots of the game, showing both Sonics as well as Shadow sprouting some nasty looking wings.

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-officially-announced">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> was announced at the PlayStation State of Play in February.

</p>
<p>
It's a remastered version of the 2011 game, but also with the inclusion of brand new levels based on Shadow the Hedgehog. 
</p>
<p>
From what's leaked so far, it doesn't look like Shadow will be seen in classic chibi form, nor will he wield guns. But perhaps a full announcement is due imminently to show more?
</p>
<p>
The game's release is part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-declares-2024-the-year-of-shadow-the-hedgehog">Sega's Year of Shadow</a>, with a number of events and releases leading up to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jim-carrey-returns-as-dr-robotnik-in-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film</a> in December that's loosely based on the events of Sonic Adventure 2.

The AI-based Auto SR feature will automatically upscale game resolutions and improve frame rates, and Microsoft is now detailing exactly how it’s different to DLSS, XeSS, and FSR.</p><p>Auto SR will be integrated into Windows 11, and available on Copilot Plus devices that have a dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU). It’s designed to work with existing games with no manual configurations required and no need for game developers to change how their games are rendered. </p><p>“Auto SR is different from super resolution technologies like AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution, Intel XeSS, and NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution built into games,” says the DirectX team <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/autosr/">in a blog post</a>. “These approaches require games to alter their rendering, for example, by using jitter and MIP bias to add finer details. In contrast, Auto SR tackles the task of enhancing games without the extra information to improve games as they exist today.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Microsoft’s example of Auto SR upscaling a game at 720p (right) and improving the frame rate.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><p>Auto SR uses larger on-device AI models combined with the NPU on Copilot Plus devices to apply AI enhancements to game visuals, all while rendering a game at a lower resolution to improve frame rates. Microsoft is offloading the work directly to the NPU here so it’s not even hitting the GPU to get upscaling working. “This strategic shift not only improves framerates but also enhances the energy efficiency of each frame rendered, significantly boosting the overall gaming experience,” says the DirectX team.</p><p>There is a slight latency tradeoff, though. “While running our large model, Auto SR introduces a single frame of latency on average as it uses AI to significantly boost your game’s visuals,” admits Microsoft. We’ll have to test this fully to see if that single frame is noticeable, and which games it impacts more than others.</p><div><figcaption><em>Microsoft’s Copilot Plus PCs are launching later this month.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>At launch on June 18th, Microsoft is only automatically enhancing 11 games that have been tested to improve visual quality, framerates, or a combination of both. <em>Borderlands 3</em>, <em>Control</em> (DX11), <em>Dark Souls III</em>, <em>God of War</em>, <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, <em>Resident Evil 2</em>, <em>Resident Evil 3</em>, <em>Sekiro Shadows Die Twice</em>, <em>Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2</em> and <em>The Witcher 3</em>, are all on the launch list that have been verified by Microsoft.</p><p>That list will grow over time, and it’s easy to toggle the Auto SR feature on or off and adjust settings for individual games. Microsoft says you can also “explore this feature on additional untested games,” and force the setting on. “There may be some quirks and we can’t guarantee it will apply or improve your experience,” warns Microsoft.</p><p>The first set of Copilot Plus PCs are set to launch on June 18th with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chips, so it won’t be long until we see how well Microsoft’s Auto SR works in reality. The feature will also eventually be available on new AMD- and Intel-powered Copilot Plus PCs, although it sounds like these machines <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24173080/intel-amd-nvidia-copilot-plus-pc-ai-exclusivity-qualcomm-2024">won’t have Copilot Plus AI features</a> until a post-launch update ships.</p><p>Microsoft is now working on Auto SR improvements, including support for HDR and multiple-monitor configurations. “As we continue to explore Auto SR capabilities, we look forward to exploring bringing Auto SR to more devices and a broader selection of x64 emulated games,” says the DirectX team.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The upcoming Astro Bot for PS5 from Team Asobi will receive three different editions, and pre-orders kick off today.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-announcement-soon-may-2024-playstation-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several rumors</a>, Sony and Team Asobi officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new Astro game for PS5 last week. Alongside the announcement, we also received an action-packed trailer for the title featuring PlayStation cameos and references aplenty. On the official PlayStation Blog, developer Team Asobi has now <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/astro-bot-pre-order-begins-june-7-features-parappa-lovestruck-lyricist-outfit-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed</a> the three different editions of the game, including the physical standard edition, the digital standard edition, and the digital deluxe edition - all of which will come with the following content for those who pre-order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Astro Lovestruck Lyricist outfit</li>
<li>The Glorious Graffiti Dual Speeder paint color</li>
<li>2 Astro Avatars</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from the content mentioned above, the standard physical edition of the game will come with a physical insert poster. Those who purchase the digital standard edition will have to do with this poster. We've included a sneak peek of the poster below:</p>

<li>The Champion’s Gold Dual Speeder paint color</li>
<li>The official Soundtrack and Digital Art Gallery</li>
<li>10 Astro Avatars</li>
</ul>
<p>The developer mentions that the outfits and the Dual Speeder paint colors will become available while playing as players unlock their respective buildings on the crash site.</p>
<p>Astro Bot is launching on September 6 for PlayStation 5. We've included some additional details alongside last week's announcement trailer below:</p>
<p><iframe title="Astro Bot - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHMNQzLG_Jg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>"In this brand-new game, you will explore 6 galaxies and over 80 levels in search of Astro’s scattered crew. Hold on tight to your Dual Speeder and dive down to each unique planet, from lush forests, sandy beaches, hot volcanoes to more surprising locations such as a gigantic hourglass or the canopy of a singing tree!</em></p>
<p><em>To get help on his mission, Astro can use over 15 new abilities offering unique play styles. As you would expect from an Astro game, these take full advantage of the DualSense controller, its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers so you can feel every little step along the journey."</em></p>

What they have instead is, well… it’s not quite what they expected.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced">Sony’s State of Play showcase in May</a> the company revealed a brand new <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> for PS5, and the announcement sparked excitement from PlayStation gamers across the internet. Now, Sony has announced pre-order details for Team Asobi’s game as well as the various outfits set to hit the eye-catching platformer — and, you guessed it, one of the outfits is Bloodborne.</p><p>As detailed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/astro-bot-pre-order-begins-june-7-features-parappa-lovestruck-lyricist-outfit-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the Astro Bot Digital Deluxe Edition includes an early unlock for Astro’s Yharnam Tourist outfit, which is the one that’s caused a bit of a fuss across social media and forums today.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Botborne <a href="https://t.co/xNu7EO4nTS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xNu7EO4nTS</a></p>— PlayStation AU (@PlayStationAU) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStationAU/status/1798973843618623549?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Most of the reaction is light-hearted, with plenty of jokes about Astro Bot now being the Bloodborne remake fans have been waiting for, a few perhaps wishful thinkers suggesting the skin is a sign of better things to come, and more than a few accusations that Sony is trolling Bloodborne fans hard. You have to imagine Sony knew what sort of reaction this outfit would spark, and it’s sure to drive plenty of Deluxe Edition sales as a result. Either way, we have a confirmed Sony acknowledgement that still Bloodborne exists, so there is that.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sony's messed up for this 😆<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AstroBot?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#AstroBot</a> <a href="https://t.co/6sZ5v1k7Ji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6sZ5v1k7Ji</a></p>— Shinobi602 (@shinobi602) <a href="https://twitter.com/shinobi602/status/1798843237358281095?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here’s your crumb you sad freaks <a href="https://t.co/Mrs0vs3GRh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Mrs0vs3GRh</a> <a href="https://t.co/VrEiQSqRI3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VrEiQSqRI3</a></p>— Barrett Courtney (@SadBoyBarrett) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadBoyBarrett/status/1798848308687028516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light">— GermanStrands (@GermanStrands) <a href="https://twitter.com/GermanStrands/status/1798839730651763107?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">IT'S OFFICAL!

But it is early access to something new for Bloodborne, so…</p><p>Meanwhile, the wait for an actual new Bloodborne game continues. In February, Bloodborne director Hidetaka Miyazaki, while promoting upcoming Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">told IGN</a> it wasn’t his place to talk about the possibility of a Bloodborne remake.</p><p>"We simply don't own the IP at FromSoftware,” Miyazaki explained. “For me personally, it was a great project, and I have a lot of great memories for that game, but we're not at liberty to speak to it." No promises, no hints of anything in the works, and to hear Miyazaki tell it, the decision isn't even really up to FromSoftware — it's entirely on Sony, which owns Bloodborne.</p><p>Bloodborne fans have been <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/a-bloodborne-remake-is-sorely-needed-and-heres-why"><u>desperate for a remake</u></a> for years now. We <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review"><u>gave the game a 9.1/10 when it first launched</u></a>, but despite critical acclaim and incredible sales success, Bloodborne has remained relegated to PlayStation 4 exclusivity. There's no dedicated PS5 version, nor is it available on PS5 or other consoles. With other FromSoftware games such as Demon's Souls and the original Dark Souls getting a remake and numerous ports, respectively, hope has been kept alive. For now, FromSoftware fans will have to be content with… an Astro Bot skin.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p data-characters="233" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Every season, Sledgehammer adds a new event to <em>MW3</em>, with the Critical Countdown event tasking players with collecting DNA Samples. Unfortunately, these in-game additions are making it impossible to see, and players are sick of them. </p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Every time you get a kill, a DNA string appears, floating in the air where their body is, just like a dog tag in Kill Confirmed. Unlike Kill Confirmed, however, this isn’t confined to one mode and happens in every multiplayer match type, meaning there’s no escape from them. </p> <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, these floating <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-dna-samples-for-mw3-and-warzone-critical-countdown-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DNA Samples</a> are causing issues, making it impossible for players to aim and block sightlines, and fans are not happy about it.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>You need DNA samples to unlock rewards. Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">“For the love of God, never put objects like DNA strands in the game ever again,” wrote ermor666 on Reddit. “The DNA strands are some of the most annoying and obstructive items I have ever seen in <em>CoD. </em>Not only do they hover in the middle of a downed enemy, they give off an annoying bloom effect. It can completely block your line of sight.”</p>
 <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">This was echoed by other players too, with EL-SIN-NOMBRE-666 stating that “the obstruction of your line of sight is the thing that bothers me. The devs wouldn’t even have to finish a match to see it’s a disadvantage. I’ll never understand why they thought it was a good idea.”</p> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">TheEpicRedCape said they just wished that when you “collected all you need for one color, that color would stop spawning,” as even if you complete the challenge and collect them all, they still drop regardless. </p>
 <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">I can definitely see where these <em>MW3</em> players are coming from, as I found them annoying to play around this week too. I didn’t mind them so much on bigger maps, but when I jumped into Small Map Moshpit, the narrow lanes and congested areas meant you would see them everywhere, and on a map like Shipment it made seeing opponents almost impossible. </p> <p data-characters="112" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="false">With the event set to run until June 26, lets hope that Sledgehammer listen to the community and make a change. </p>

            <p>
Something titled New World: Aeternum has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/1da1tgx/what_the_hell_it_on_my_ps_store_page/?share_id=chcOPXupFj2x9wY_zKenR">spotted</a> on the PlayStation Store, setting tongues wagging ahead of an expected announcement tonight. 
</p>
<p>
Developed by Amazon Games, New World originally launched for PC in 2021, and is still yet to arrive on consoles. The advert for New World: Aeternum on PlayStation consoles certainly suggests this may soon change.
</p>
<p>
An MMORPG set in a fictional version of 1600s America, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-real-buzz-about-amazons-new-world-mmo">New World initially arrived with something of a buzz</a>, and had nearly a million concurrent players soon after launch. Things have calmed down since, with more modest players in the double digit thousands over the past couple of years - something a console launch now could revive.

<p>
The addition of a subtitle, Aeternum, suggests this isn't the same version of New World that exists on PC currently. Whether this is merely a subtitle for a console version (and whether it also arrives on Xbox) remains to be seen.

It may be we see Aeternum announced as an update for the base game on PC too - as well as a fresh jumping off point for new players on consoles.

<p>In my eternal quest to describe games concisely enough that you don’t feel robbed of time you could have just watched a trailer with, I am compelled to use many of the same words and word combinations ad nauseam. So, when a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> tower defence <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bella-wants-blood">Bella Wants Blood</a> comes along and uses some odd nouns, I get all excited. Here, that’s because I get to recklessly spaff out terms like ‘Blood Gutters’, ‘The Rattler’, and your friend and mine, ‘The Stabber’. Barely an atom quivers in Bella Wants Blood that hasn’t been stylised or made odd and alluring in some way.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In yet another win for the language economy, Bella Wants Blood is both a title and a broad overview of just what the hell is going on here, anyway. Bella is an ever-hungry monstrosity, and I imagine my nose would start bleeding more profusely for every additional fact I knew about her. You’ll carve her out a network of Blood Gutters, down which interlope a gribbly menagerie of skittering buglets. Bella does not like chewing, only supping, and so grows impatient for every creature she’s forced to masticate. To prevent her eventually turning those insidious incisors in your direction, you’ll want to set up your Stabbers and Rattlers, your Slingers and Lookers, to slow, debuff, shoot, and shank the bugs before they reach her gaping maw. You pick upgrade paths and encounters from a map between stages, and try to get as far as possible in a single run.</p>

<p>So, yes, it’s a tower defence game, but with every element lent such rich fictive snippets and art that it feels horrifically alive in a way many others don’t. The result is that Bella is terrifying. I genuinely do not want to displease her. She feels like a survival horror monster banging on the door outside, only she’s here in the room with me. I try to keep her happy. I unwrap each gift gratefully and treasure the nasty trinket within. It’s like Christmas morning but the Rubik's Cube your got in your stocking was accidentally the scary square from Hellraiser. Now there are spikes where no spikes were previously, and quivering flesh arranged like cheese and pineapple skewers along the mantlepiece. I hate it here and I’m not yet ready to leave.

			<p>It looks like Starfield will be receiving its own version of the Creation Club this Sunday after an announcement during the yearly Xbox Games Showcase (slated to be broadcast starting at 10 AM Pacific Time).</p>
<p>Leaker Odahfield, who has been leaking Starfield info even before the game's launch, <a href="https://x.com/Odah_SFA/status/1798660907314409649" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> as much on Twitter/X. He also confirmed that the first trailer for the story-driven Shattered Space DLC will be dropped during the Xbox Games Showcase alongside other Starfield news on the next updates, including a teaser for the addition of the space station building feature.</p>
<p>While Odahfield didn't get into specifics about Starfield Creations, it will likely be similar to Skyrim Creations. Bethesda Game Studios released it in late 2023 as an 'updated way for players to discover, download, and play community-made content'. Creations combines existing Mods, Creation Club items, and all-new Creations under a single Creations menu. If it's the same, then Starfield Creations should allow both free and paid mods and it will be up to the player to choose which ones to install.</p>
<p>It also stands to reason to share the official mod kit alongside the launch of Creations. This is, after all, what appears to be the new tease by Spanish leaker eXtas, who <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1798889878261993494" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> two images: one is from the movie Creation, and the other is a kit (ten).</p>
<p>The Starfield Creation Kit is most likely the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-might-feature-a-shadow-dropped-1st-party-game-xbox-portable-likely-to-be-teased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> first-party shadow drop that will take place at some point during the Xbox Games Showcase, then. That might be disappointing if you were hoping to get an actual new game to downlaod.</p>
<p>In other Starfield coverage, we recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-would-have-benefited-from-daggerfall-like-proc-gen-for-dungeons-instead-of-reusing-premade-ones-says-oncelost-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> The Wayward Realms studio OnceLost Games, who provided their perspective on what did not work as well as it could have in the procedural generation of Bethesda's latest game.</p>

        <p>The new space opened in Guildford to boost the industry in Surrey</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The University of Surrey in the UK has just opened a Games Innovation Zone in Guildford, as part of a £2.3 million programme aimed at boosting the industry in the region.</p>
<p>The new Games Innovation Zone is split across a collaboration space and an area dedicated to testing and playing, and aims at gathering academics, local developers, and esports pros, among others.</p>
<p>The zone was funded via a programme called Games And Innovation Nexus (GAIN), which was <a href="https://surrey-research-park.com/news/gain-launched-to-tackle-gaming-industry-challenges/">launched in February</a> as part of the Guildford Games festival. The initiative committed to £2.3 million in funding to further develop the games industry outside of London.</p>
<p>The funding was pledged towards three goals in particular, to bolster the industry in Surrey: connect university researchers and game firms that have "challenges to solve," further link the local industries in Guildford and Leamington, and invest in a new ecosystem, the new Games Innovation Zone being part of it.</p>
<p>An incubation centre in the University for the Creative Arts in Farnham is also planned.</p>
<p>The GAIN programme was funded by Research England, Surrey County Council, the University of Surrey, UCA Farnham, Warwick University, and Warwickshire County Council.</p>
<p>Caroline Fleming, director of the Surrey Innovation District commented: "It's so exciting to see the Games Innovation Zone come to life. As well as being the hub for academic collaboration, creativity and gameplay, [yesterday's] opening is a leap forward towards the next generation of gaming. The innovative solutions generated inside the new Zone will help to tackle the industry's biggest challenges, showcasing to the world Guildford's credentials as the UK's 'Hollywood for video games'."</p>

		<p>Yooka-Laylee is getting the definitive edition treatment with an updated version called Yooka-Replaylee, Playtonic Games has revealed. This updated version of the open world 3D platformer will have improved graphics, new challenges, a brand new in game currencny, a world map and challenge trackers, and new tonics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yooka-Replaylee! | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrXXbkP5HAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Yooka-Replaylee has been borne from the feedback the development team have received over the years from players, with Playtonic stating that this release is more than just a remaster. With all of the additional content, new and old players will have more to discover. In a statement, Playtonic Games has said why it is working on this now.</p>
<p><em>“Well, we’re approaching our 10th Birthday as a studio and as we’ve grown and learned, we’ve always wanted to revisit the game that started it all and what better way to celebrate reaching 10 years?! That’s no easy feat in the current games landscape! We’re incredibly proud of Yooka-Laylee and how it defines Playtonic but we’d be lying if we said we haven’t always wanted to go back and do things a little differently.”</em></p>

<p>Yooka-Replaylee does not have a release date yet, and so far just the PC version has been announced. However, Playtonic Games has said it will outline its plans for console releases at a later date.</p>

			<p>Just a month after the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-universal-frame-generation-2-0-out-now-improves-efficiency-noticeably-reduces-artifacts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lossless Scaling Frame Generation 2.0</a>, the software has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/993090/view/4145080305033108761?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> with a new mode that can triple your frame rate.</p>
<p>Version 2.1 can now generate two intermediate frames, effectively tripling the frame rate with an X3 frame generation mode. This mode increases GPU load by around 1.7x compared to the X2 mode. However, the performance of LSFG 2.1 and LSFG 1.1 has been optimized to be 20% faster in X2 mode compared to the previous version.</p>
<p>The developer of Lossless Scaling claims that the X3 mode has no additional latency compared to the X2 mode since the latency is affected by the base frame rate and when the GPU is fully utilized. For the best experience in terms of both fluidity and latency, it is recommended that you set the game frame rate to one-third of the monitor's refresh rate in X3 mode. The minimum recommended base frame rate remains the same as in X2 mode: 30 fps for 1080p and 40 fps for 1440p.</p>
<p>The new version of Lossless Scaling also introduced a new behavior when the final frame rate exceeds the monitor's refresh rate. Previously, the software rendered all necessary frames, some of which were later discarded when displayed. Lossless Scaling will now skip the rendering of extra frames while maintaining the correct frame rate, so the result should be very similar to the old behavior but much more resource-efficient. That said, the developer notes that while a higher base frame rate is better for latency purposes, forcing LS to skip frames may not result in the best smoothness.</p>
<p>As a footnote, since the Lossless Scaling framerate will now never exceed the refresh rate, the 'Draw FPS' option will also output captured frames when using DXGI capture for convenience and to identify issues.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this frame generation is universal and theoretically works on all PC games.</p>

            <p>Back in 2020, fresh out of high school and feeling unstoppable, Charles Maddock and a few friends “decided to code a game about Fish Wizards.” The result was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fishards">Fishards</a>,  Magicka-inspired PVP arena <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> that has you out-squirt, out-splash, and out-spellcast your mates. It’s a charmer, but after two years of dev, release saw it suffer the same sad fate as many multiplayer-only indies. People would play for half hour, says Maddock, then refund the game because they couldn’t find others to play with.</p>

<p>Maddock was 22 at the time - “10% of my life on the project!’ - and while the “devastating” failure of Fishards had set the devs on the different paths, they decided to give it another shot. They made the game free-to-play, and spent all the money they’d earned from sales on marketing. “It brought a few new players into the game but not as many as we'd hoped. Man, marketing is hard.”</p>
<p>Now, following a “long and difficult indie game dev journey,” the team behind Fishards are making one last ditch effort to show their game off to the world:</p>
<p>“Defeat us developers in a team deathmatch tournament 29th June 19:00 CET and we'll make Fishards open source, meaning that the community can fix bugs, implement features and balancing patches...or say good bye to Fishards forever if you lose!!”</p> <figure>

<p>“But Nic, this is clearly just a marketing stunt!” Well, obviously. But it’s a cool one, and it deserves just as much coverage as anything else, lest we forget that this is what most of commercial game making is: talented people with cool ideas working hard and failing spectacularly behind the scenes.</p>
<p>If you fancy getting involved, you can <a href="https://discord.gg/e2RTjPUGnz">find all the details you need on the game's Discord</a> and the game itself <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637140/Fishards/">on Steam</a>. The game features a nifty elemental-gobbling system where you can create your own spells on the fly, and there’s something incredibly charming about the dead-eyed fish you’ll be playing as. Also, I just wrote the sentence “A fish peruses a selection of magical spells” for an image caption, so the game has already made my day significantly better.</p>

			<p>I hadn’t heard of the <em>Cotton</em> series at all before this wave of ports, remasters, and surprise sequels kicked off in the last few years. My frame of reference for a lot of shoot-em-up history is through remasters and fan games, so getting an insight into how big <em>Cotton </em>was in the world of cute-em-ups has been really eye-opening. I thought all of the games in this series were varying takes on the same 2D bullet-hell style, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. It turns out that a fully 3D entry in the series came out on Dreamcast all the way back in 2000, and at the time it wasn’t received all too well. Now, <em>Rainbow Cotton </em>is accessible and playable on modern hardware, but I’m not entirely sure if that accessibility translates to fun.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Cotton: A Mini-Guide to Re-Releases!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bExfpAE0Lcg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>Rainbow Cotton, </em>like the other games in this silly series, kicks off with what you could technically call “a story” – but ultimately it’s just an excuse to animate some quirky fairy girls and bring our protagonist Cotton back for another afternoon of spell-casting and candy-collecting. I really love all of the animated scenes in this game in particular, though. Both the anime-style opening cutscene and the pre-level animations of character portraits talking against a backdrop of the stage you’re about to visit are full of charm, and drop some of the cutesy chibi style of prior games for a more detailed, 90s anime OVA feel. It’s just a bummer that these cutscenes weren’t remastered in any meaningful way – they look like blurry YouTube rips and have a noticeable filter on them that sours the experience a bit.</p>


<p>Visuals in the actual game, though, are massively remastered and updated – in fact, they’re practically the only thing this re-release of <em>Rainbow Cotton </em>goes so hard to update. Unlike other games in the franchise, this entry goes for a <em>Panzer Dragoon </em>approach and has you piloting Cotton from behind as she flies through fully-3D stages. It feels massively ambitious for a 2000 Dreamcast game, and the visual upgrades remain faithful to that – resolution is high and colors are vivid, but enemy models and environments retain the low-detail chunkiness you’d expect from an early 3D game. It’s an interesting contrast, flying through a silky-smooth widescreen world while the sights and sounds you encounter scream old-school at you as they whizz by.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, a fresh coat of paint isn’t enough to make the ambitions of this Dreamcast rail shooter shine any brighter. <em>Rainbow Cotton </em>is not nearly as fun, fast, or responsive as it’s 2D shoot-em-up contemporaries in the series. It adapts the same core concepts from those games, with you firing standard bullets at enemies, grabbing the crystals they drop to charge your magic power or shooting said crystals first to change their color and swap into different elemental magic powers. My biggest problem with this 3D rendition is that there’s a complete lack of impact from projectiles fired by you <em>and </em>at you.</p>
<p>Cotton’s magic is slow, and quiet, and obscured by her large character model. Plus, you need to fire her small bullets manually in a carpal-tunnel-inducing fit. When I first started the game, I genuinely couldn’t tell if I was firing any bullets for a solid few minutes. Most enemies either float slowly toward you or fire bullets so fast they don’t register as projectiles, muddying the tension even further. Boss battles are at least impressive from a sense of scale and creativity, but the gameplay challenge presented there isn’t any more enjoyable.</p>
<p><em>Rainbow Cotton </em>is far more enjoyable as a window into the past and a preservation of a piece of gaming history, but even on that front it stumbles. There are virtually no options, toggles, or extras to speak of in this game. The two major optional features are underwhelming – co-op mode only lets your 2nd player control a non-combative fairy on-screen to collect gems, and Retro Mode just slaps a warped CRT filter onto the current game instead of letting you play an actual emulation of the Dreamcast original. Plus, there’s the oversight of fairy chatter – your companion characters talk constantly in each level, and none of this dialogue is translated at all.</p>

<p>Overall, this new release of <em>Rainbow Cotton </em>is an incredibly mixed bag. I can’t say I had all that much fun playing it, but I can’t hate a game from this adorable historic franchise just for being a bit crusty. At the same time, though, trying to enjoy this as a piece of history is hard when it’s contained in such a bare-bones presentation and package. A die-hard fan of <em>Cotton </em>will love this release with no hesitations, but said fan will also want so much more from it, just like I do.</p>

			<p>The Fallout TV show on Amazon Prime Video was a massive success, providing <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-popularity-got-bethesda-at-least-80-million-says-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a significant boost to game sales</a> and easily <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">securing a second season</a>. That said, the popularity was 'immensely surprising' to showrunner Graham Wagner, as he <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/fallout-showrunners-interview-1235914667/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained to The Hollywood Reporter</a>. Wagner also said the creators had talked about doing five seasons of the series, which looks more feasible now after all the positive reactions.</p>
<p><em>The popularity of the show is an immense surprise. We didn’t make this show for everyone. We made it for ourselves, and that was, an important part of approach. But you never know how that’s going to go.</em></p>
<p><em>We’ve talked about a billion seasons as a jokey way to evade the question because we don’t control that. So our hope is to end every season with a semi-satisfying, semi-open-ended kind of shape. Look, we’ve talked about three seasons and we’ve talked about five seasons. Given the success of the show, five is suddenly feeling a little more appealing. But the industry is a temperamental thing and we kind of have to go into each season being like, “This is our last.”</em></p>
<p>When will the second season of the Fallout TV show be released, though? Graham Wagner said everything is going as fast as possible, and many things like sets, assets, and visual effects are ready from the first season.</p>
<p><em>The internet has an interesting habit of making non-binding statements binding, so I’m hesitant to give a date that will be taken out of context and live on Reddit for a year or so. But we are going as fast as we possibly can, and we’ve got a lot of heavy lifting from Season 1 already done. We have sets, assets, visual effects, that are already done. We are hitting the ground running this season. We’re going to be pedal to the metal to get season two out as fast as humanly possible.</em></p>
<p>With that said, we'll likely have to wait at least late 2025 to see the second season, which will be set in New Vegas.</p>

<p>Knights of the Old Republic II remains one of the most sought-after games in the modern-day remake stakes. In 2004, ‘KOTOR II’ was released to an eager audience, becoming one of the most universally renowned Star Wars games ever made. Fast forward more than two decades and it’s still at the top of the list when it comes to the most desirable remakes.</p>



<p>There’s a remake in production of the first KOTOR game, which was released in 2003, but there’s no talk at present of the second game being rebuilt.</p>



<p>Recently, The Acolyte’s showrunner, Leslye Headland, sat down in an interview and spoke about the success of the show, touching on future projects and tapping into her desire to create a live-action adaptation based on Knights of the Old Republic II – specifically focusing on Kreia, one of the game’s most pivotal characters.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-use-the-force-or-don-t-it-s-your-life">Use The Force – Or Don’t, It’s Your Life</h2>



<p>In KOTOR II, Kreia represents an enigmatic, ominous character who bonds with the player character from the opening sequences of the game. Historically, Kreia has only appeared in KOTOR II and hasn’t surfaced anywhere else in the Star Wars universe outside of reference materials, which many see as being a huge shame given her status as an extremely important and powerful character in the game.</p>



<p> That was a notion touched upon by Headland in <a href="https://www.omelete.com.br/star-wars/the-acolyte-knights-of-the-republic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent interview with Omelete</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve always wanted to explore a live-action version of the Knights of the Old Republic game and Kreia’s character. I think it would be a really interesting story to bring to life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In KOTOR II, Kreia is voiced by Sara Kestelman, and the 80-year-old is still actively performing today, so it could be an easy win for Headland to bring the OG VA on board more than twenty years after she performed the role for Obsidian’s 2004 game. </p>



<p>Kreia’s story is a unique one – as the game unravels, players learn that she’s an unconventional wielder of the Force, turned blind by her insistence to see using the Force rather than relying on ‘normal vision’. She’s a guide or ‘historian’ of sorts, famed for training key characters who ultimately became Sith personalities – which is a nod to how things ultimately end up for this character and her twisting path of revelations through the game. </p>



<p>It wouldn’t be the worst live-action adaptation idea, and now is the best time to make it – more games than ever are making their way onto the small (and big) screen.</p>

<p>From today, PlayStation users can pre-order Astro Bot, securing one of three editions and locking in some bonus content that serves as a tasty throwback to the days gone by of the PlayStation universe. In the Digital Deluxe Edition, players can secure the Yharnam Tourist outfit, which is probably the only reference they’ll ever see of Bloodborne being pulled onto the PlayStation 5. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-astro-bot-bonanza">Astro Bot Bonanza</h2>



<p>Three editions of Astro Bot can be pre-ordered starting today, June 7:</p>



<ul>
<li>Physical Standard Edition</li>



<li>Digital Standard Edition</li>



<li>Digital Deluxe Edition</li>
</ul>



<p>Every pre-order earns players a PaRappa-themed outfit, a special in-game speeder skin, and two exclusive avatars. The physical edition also comes with a unique two-sided poster that features a short comic strip based on Astro Bot’s adventures.</p>



<p>For those investing in the Digital Deluxe Edition, there are three outfits to secure: Yharnam Tourist, Golden, and Lovestruck Lyricist. This edition also includes three speeder skins, the game’s official soundtrack and digital art gallery, plus twelve PSN avatars. </p>



<p>Prospective fans are already going wild over the Bloodborne-themed content in Astro Bot:</p>

		<p>Following the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> PS5 and PC reveal <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/concord-gets-flashy-cinematic-trailer-gameplay-reveal-beta-test-confirmed-with-august-launch/">during last week’s State of Play broadcast</a>, Sony and developer Firewalk Studios have shared more information about their upcoming team-based shooter.</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jqQJhjf_3o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First, let’s talk about the price. Concord is not a free-to-play title and will be launching on August 23rd – both physically and digitally for £34.99 here in the UK and $39.99 / €39.99 / ¥4,480 in other regions. This base version of the game includes 16 playable characters (known as “Freegunners”) with access to 12 maps, and game modes. The team at Firewalk stress that a roadmap of free post-launch updates are planned after launch. As a non F2P game, it’s likely that additional core content such as new maps and modes will be made available for everyone, though additional characters (or at least fancy cosmetics) could be stuck behind a paywall.</p>
<p>Speaking of fancy cosmetics, the Concord Digital Deluxe Edition will include a bonus outfit for each Freegunner. Priced at £49.99, or $59.99 / €59.99 / ¥6,480 MSRP, it also includes early access to the multiplayer shooter, allowing you to drop into the action three days before the great unwashed.</p>


<p>Preorders for both versions are now live, and will net you a bonus cosmetic pack for Freegunner Vale. More importantly, preordering will grant you access to the upcoming Concord beta, which will feature online cross-play between PS5 and PC. Firewalk are still waiting to share exact details on the closed beta, though it has confirmed that pre-orders will unlock not just one beta code, but five, allowing you and your gun-toting galactic companions to get in on the action.</p>
<p>After being shrouded in obscurity for many months, Concord was Sony’s main featured title during its latest State of Play broadcast. Dubbed by onlookers as a flashy mix of Overwatch and Guardians of the Galaxy, it’s a 5-vs-5 multiplayer shooter that has you battling across a diverse array of planets in tense, team-based modes, utilising the unique loadouts and powers of its Freegunner heroes.</p>
<p>As a live service title, Concord was bound to catch some flack even with its impressive debut trailer and gameplay footage. Let’s hope if follows in the recent footsteps of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> in showing how live service games can still thrive in 2024 if handled properly. We’ll be sure to report back with our initial thoughts on Concord when get some early hands-on playtime.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">One of the biggest announcements during last week's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/state-of-play-may-2024-all-the-biggest-ps5-announcements-and-games/2900-5435/" data-ref-id="2900-5435">PlayStation State of Play livestream</a> was Astro Bot, the full-fledged sequel to the excellent Astro's Playroom that comes preinstalled on PS5. Just like Astro's Playroom, Astro Bot is a 3D puzzle-platformer that pays homage to PlayStation history and makes heavy use of the PS5 DualSense controller's many unique features like haptic feedback and dynamic triggers. However, this time, we're getting a full-length game (with no microtransactions) that's much bigger than Astro's previous adventures.</p><p dir="ltr">Astro Bot is set to launch on <strong>September 6</strong> and will be available in standard, digital, and deluxe versions. Preorders are live now for the physical standard edition, and digital preorders will be available on June 7. The physical edition comes with a cool poster, and all editions include early unlocks for in-game content.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Astro Bot Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4314264-astropreorderbonus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314264" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4314264-astropreorderbonus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314264"></a><figcaption>Astro Bot Preorder Bonuses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4314264-astropreorderbonus.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you preorder the physical edition of Astro Bot ahead of its September 6 release date, you'll get an exclusive double-sided poster. You can see a preview of the very cute poster below.</p><p dir="ltr">Preorders also let you immediately unlock the Lovestruck Lyricist in-game outfit for Astro, which is based on Parappa The Rapper, immediately at launch. You'll receive two PSN avatars--one of Astro in his normal outfit and another of him wearing the Parappa getup--and the Glorious Graffiti skin for Astro's Dual Speeder vehicle. These items can be unlocked in the game without preordering, but buying one of the physical or digital editions early lets you access them from the jump.</p><div title="6523846 - Astro Bot preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2416" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6523846 - Astro Bot preorders" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAstro-Bot-PlayStation-5%2F6261168812%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fastro-bot-ps5-preorder-guide%2F1100-6523846%2Flinear-gradient%28rgb%2851%2C%252051%2C%252051%29%2C%2520rgb%2834%2C%252034%2C%252034%29%29%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/clicks.trx-hub.com\/xid\/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAstro-Bot-PlayStation-5%2F6261168812%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fastro-bot-ps5-preorder-guide%2F1100-6523846%2Flinear-gradient%28rgb%2851%2C%252051%2C%252051%29%2C%2520rgb%2834%2C%252034%2C%252034%29%29%2F&amp;event_type=click&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAstro-Bot-PlayStation-5%2F6261168812%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fastro-bot-ps5-preorder-guide%2F1100-6523846%2Flinear-gradient%28rgb%2851%2C%252051%2C%252051%29%2C%2520rgb%2834%2C%252034%2C%252034%29%29%2F&amp;event_type=click">Preorder Astro Bot Physical Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAstro-Bot-PlayStation-5%2F6261168812%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fastro-bot-ps5-preorder-guide%2F1100-6523846%2Flinear-gradient%28rgb%2851%2C%252051%2C%252051%29%2C%2520rgb%2834%2C%252034%2C%252034%29%29%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/clicks.trx-hub.com\/xid\/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAstro-Bot-PlayStation-5%2F6261168812%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fastro-bot-ps5-preorder-guide%2F1100-6523846%2Flinear-gradient%28rgb%2851%2C%252051%2C%252051%29%2C%2520rgb%2834%2C%252034%2C%252034%29%29%2F&amp;event_type=click&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAstro-Bot-PlayStation-5%2F6261168812%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fastro-bot-ps5-preorder-guide%2F1100-6523846%2Flinear-gradient%28rgb%2851%2C%252051%2C%252051%29%2C%2520rgb%2834%2C%252034%2C%252034%29%29%2F&amp;event_type=click">$60</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>You can preorder Astro Bot's physical edition at Walmart.

Each planet has its own biome--such as volcanoes, forests, and beaches--and will feature a variety of puzzles, platforming challenges, and enemies that players will overcome using the 15 new special items and abilities Astro unlocks throughout the game. That makes Astro Bot a <em>significantly </em>bigger adventure than Astro's Playroom and PSVR's Astro Bot Rescue Mission.

<p data-characters="342" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Traveling around in <em>Soulmask</em> can be a bit tedious with how big the world is. Thankfully, you have the option of getting around quicker by taming and mounting an Alpaca. This <em>Soulmask</em> Alpaca guide has everything you need to know about the cute creatures including where to find them, how to tame and breed them, and how to mount and ride them.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-alpacas" data-injectable="false">Where to find Alpacas</h2> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true">While you can technically find wild Alpacas roaming around throughout most of the game world, there are also a few specific locations where you can find them. The usually guaranteed spawn locations are on the premises of various NPC tribes that have built up around the world. Here are a few locations where you are guaranteed to find an Alpaca in <em>Soulmask</em>:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li>Claw Tribe Barbarian Barrack (center of map)</li> <li>Just north of Flint Tribe Barbarian Barrack (south of Mysterious Portal)</li> <li>Wild Alpacas roaming all over the southeastern continent</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-how-to-tame-an-alpaca" data-injectable="false">How to tame an Alpaca</h2> <p data-characters="578" data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true">If you are at one of the Barbarian Barracks, you will find a grown Alpaca and its babies inside a wooden fenced area with straw on the ground. I recommend clearing out the area from enemies, so they don’t end up attacking you when trying to leave with their Alpaca. Melee down one of the sides of the fences and head into the Alpaca Pen and approach one of the babies. Hold the ‘E’ key to pick up the Alpaca, and then quickly escape the area! I know it may seem a bit cruel to separate the baby from its mother, but this is the only way you can tame an Alpaca!</p>
 <p data-characters="96" data-current-count="96" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve picked it up, head back to your camp to begin breeding and growing the Alpaca.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-breed-alpaca" data-injectable="false">How to breed Alpaca</h2> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">Now that you have an Alpaca, safely secure it at your base and you can begin the process of growing the baby up to full size. Alpaca’s in particular have a slow growth time, but it’s worth it for their mount capabilities.</p> <p data-characters="96" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">You will need to feed the Alpaca one of the following foods in order to get it to start growing:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false"> <li>Alpaca Feed</li> <li>Banana</li> <li>Corn</li> <li>Peanut</li> <li>Pineapple</li> <li>Potato</li> <li>Quinoa</li> <li>Refined Alpaca Feed</li> <li>Thatch</li> </ul> <p data-characters="119" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">As long as the Alpaca is fed, it will slowly continue to grow until it is an Adault and capable of becoming your mount!</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-mount-and-ride-an-alpaca" data-injectable="false">How to mount and ride an Alpaca</h2> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">With a fully grown Alpaca, it’s finally time to make it your mount. In order to mount the Alpaca you will need to craft an Alpaca Saddle. The Alpaca Saddle can be crafted at an Armor Forging Table and requires the following materials to craft:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false"> <li>10x Coarse Cotton</li> <li>15x Leather</li> <li>10x Leather Rope</li> </ul> <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="false">Once you begin the craft it will only take 8 seconds to complete. After it crafts, equip it on your adult Alpaca and you’ll now be able to mount it by approaching it and holding the ‘E’ key!</p>

</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>The life of a modern working artist can be rough. The splintering of social media platforms has made it increasingly hard to gain exposure and find work, and as more greedy companies make use of the tech, AI is coming directly for their jobs.</p><p>Having taken body blow after body blow for the last two years, though, artists are not going to just sit there and take it.<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2024/05/23/artist-and-activist-karla-ortiz-on-the-battle-to-preserve-humanity-in-art/?sh=65d896e74389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> While some of them fight a major lawsuit against the biggest AI platforms and tech companies on the planet</a>, the last week has seen an unprecedented exodus of artists from platforms like Facebook, Instagram and ArtStation--all of which are accepting of, if not actively pushing, machine-generated imagery--as they flock to join Cara, a new site that is promising to do things (slightly) differently.</p><p>When I say the move is unprecedented, I don't just mean in terms of volume (its iOS app outperformed Twitter, Discord and Reddit last week). I also mean in terms of <em>speed</em>:<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> As tech's rot economy sets in</a>, it's taken upstart rivals like BlueSky months to make a dent in Twitter's userbase. In Cara's case, it took less than a week, as the site went from 100,000 users on June 1 to 700,000 on <em>June 6</em>.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone, sorry for the absence—we hit 300k users on Cara!!!!!! 🥹🤯🥳</p><p>We made it to top 5 in App Store for social networks in the US—passing Twitter, Discord, Reddit, LinkedIn, and Messenger! Unfortunately this traffic spike has caused the site to crash like crazy &amp;— 1/ <a href="https://t.co/xsgB9pewwf">pic.twitter.com/xsgB9pewwf</a></p></div>— Jingna Zhang @ cara.app/zemotion (@zemotion) <a href="https://twitter.com/zemotion/status/1797464152690315460?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>While Cara has actually been open for over a year now, and has had some high-profile artists residing there the whole time, things reached a collective boiling point last week when news of a recent change to Meta's privacy policy started circulating among artists. I can't pin down who exactly was the first pebble to start the avalanche, but from Thursday, May 30, through the weekend, nearly every artist I follow on social media--and that's a <em>lot</em>--started posting links to their Cara portfolio, and in many cases following up by saying they were deleting their presence on many of their other sites (especially Facebook and Instagram) as they went.</p><p>Those privacy policy changes implemented by Meta--the parent company of both Facebook and Instagram, sites where most artists maintain some kind of portfolio presence--included refreshed guidelines on how the platforms would be making use of machine-learning. As<a href="https://www.dacs.org.uk/news-events/what-artists-and-their-beneficiaries-need-to-know-about-metas-new-privacy-policy#:~:text=The%20reason%20this%20new%20policy,successfully%20object%20to%20the%20use." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> DACS summarised last week</a>:</p><blockquote><p>For many visual artists and creators Instagram is a key social media channel to help people engage with their works. The reason this new policy change is particularly concerning is that any images and creative works shared on Meta's platforms (Instagram or Facebook) can be used by Meta to develop AI models unless you can successfully object to the use. Given the apparent effort involved in doing this, many users may find the content they post to Instagram and Facebook used by Meta to develop AI models without their explicit consent.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>No thanks! It's little wonder that so many have moved so quickly to Cara, a platform that has been established specifically to cater to artists wanting to get away from AI-friendly megacorps.</p><p>"I first opened an account on Friday May 31st, which is around the time most everyone in my art community seemed to catch on to Cara's existence",<a href="https://www.isaacorloff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> artist Isaac Orloff</a> tells me. "I was motivated to create an account because I, like many others, have become increasingly dismayed with the experience of social media when it pertains to being an artist or a creative. The rise of art theft masquerading as artificial intelligence has become unavoidable on all of our social media platforms."</p><p>Even longtime Cara members like Kim Hu (<a href="https://aftermath.site/taskmaster-fan-art-marvel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who we featured a little while back</a>) are blown away by the flood of new users. "I joined up as one of the first members, as at the time I was tired of Artstation’s pivot to allowing AI to flood in with no guardrails", she says. "It was a quiet and cozy community from then on, until it suddenly began to blow up seemingly out of nowhere! It’s still a little wild to have witnessed last week’s growth spurt, but I welcome how active and buzzing it is now."</p><p>Founded by Jingna Zhang--an artist who<a href="https://petapixel.com/2024/05/13/court-rules-in-favor-of-photographer-who-accused-painter-of-ripping-off-her-work/#:~:text=A%20court%20in%20Luxembourg%20has,in%202022%20that%20favored%20Dieschburg." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> not only recently won a very high profile copyright case</a>, but is<a href="https://www.zhangjingna.com/blog/class-action-lawsuit-artists-v-stability-deviantart-midjourney-runway-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> also involved in the big AI lawsuit against Stability AI, Midjourney and Deviantart</a>--Cara bills itself as "a social media and portfolio platform for artists",<a href="https://blog.cara.app/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> saying on its website</a>:</p><blockquote><p>When AI art’s popularity exploded in late 2022, many art platforms turned away from the pleas of their users when it came to moderating AI-generated images, and while generative AI can be a powerful tool, we cannot ignore that AI companies are using datasets trained on copyrighted work and private personal data without our consent.</p><p>We understand that platforms may not have the power to solve the unethical and legal issues surrounding such datasets alone, but we believe that at the very least, they should to show solidarity and respect for artists and their communities in such times.</p><p>We felt that if no platform is interested in doing that, then we should build a platform for ourselves, one where the human factor is respected and prioritized.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>It's important to note a few things here. Firstly, Cara isn't explicitly anti-AI as a <em>concept</em>; while the site says "We do not agree with generative AI tools in their current unethical form, and we won’t host AI-generated portfolios unless the rampant ethical and data privacy issues around datasets are resolved via regulation", there is acknowledgement that in some capacity AI tools are likely here to stay, and so the site will allow filtering of such content "In the event that legislation is passed to clearly protect artists".</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Curious about <a href="https://t.co/bIBAmGiZdX">https://t.co/bIBAmGiZdX</a>? We're a platform with portfolio AND social feed. We have an AI detector that filters out AI images, custom home feed you can control, and custom crop tool for image thumbnails! ✨ Here's a thread on how it works:👇🧵 <a href="https://t.co/sTDYTuym5Z">pic.twitter.com/sTDYTuym5Z</a></p>— Cara: Art &amp; Social (@Cara_HQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cara_HQ/status/1646225873585205248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2023</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>And secondly, it's not <em>really </em>a social media site. While it's Meta's policy changes that appear to have broken most people, Cara is much closer in design to a platform like ArtStation--a portfolio space where artists can post images, gifs and videos of their work--than a social media network, where algorithms and communication are given higher priority (though it does have a "social feed" system built into it).</p><p>Artbook publisher Spiridon Giannakis says, "I understand the fatigue about investing time into yet another platform that is maybe not going anywhere, but there is an important thing to keep in mind, and take it from someone who has given his everything multiple times to make people come together in one way or another: You don't get to complain about something if you don't try to make a difference in what bothers you, no matter how big of a deal you probably are. I think Cara has real potential and even if I am wrong, at least I will not just write it off because it has become somehow inconvenient to communicate [on yet another platform]."</p><p>While closest in design to a site like ArtStation, it's not quite identical, either; a key feature of Cara is that every image uploaded to it is first run through Glaze (<strong>UPDATE</strong>: This is incorrect, there's the <em>option </em>to run it through Glaze),<a href="https://kotaku.com/ai-art-images-theft-midjourney-stable-diffusion-glaze-1850235184" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> software first released last year</a> that (as I wrote at the time) helps protect an image from being scraped by AI platforms by:</p><blockquote><p>...adding a second, almost invisible layer on top of a piece of art. What makes the whole thing so interesting is that this isn’t a layer made of noise, or random shapes. It also contains a piece of art, one that’s roughly of the same composition, but in a&nbsp;<em>totally&nbsp;</em>different style. You won’t even notice it’s there, but any machine learning platform trying to lift it will, and when it tries to study the art it’ll get&nbsp;<em>very&nbsp;</em>confused.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Social media site or not, a lot of folks are deleting their Facebook and Instagram accounts regardless (or have at least pledges to stop uploading art there), and having jumped by 600,000 users in five days (<a href="https://cara.app/explore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I should point out that in addition to being an app, Cara is also usable as a regular website</a>, one that is <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/cara.app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently calling for reader support in the wake of rapidly escalating running costs</a>) it's clear a lot of fans are already using it just to keep tabs on their favourite artists.</p><p>"My plan if all goes well, is that I’ll be using Cara and my own personal website as the only places I’ll upload my artwork",<a href="https://www.karlaortizart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Karla Ortiz</a>, another participant in the big anti-AI lawsuit, tells me. "For every other site I’ll either share links or screenshots, properly Glazed of course. I’m not saying goodbye to other social media sites just yet, and will still share my thoughts in those sites too. I’m just becoming more protective of my artwork, and no longer comfortable sharing it on websites that ridiculously claim they 'own' my work and use that claim to train their own AI models.”</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh okay I get it now, Cara is actually the art platform I've been wanting for years. You can treat it like here but it also has a portfolio component(which you can reorder whenever!) This feels kinda huge for our fractured community of artists. <a href="https://t.co/K0i99ny9RE">pic.twitter.com/K0i99ny9RE</a></p>— RJ Palmer (@arvalis) <a href="https://twitter.com/arvalis/status/1798003603636130192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>"If you asked me 10 years ago if I thought I'd ever not use Facebook I wouldn't have believed it, but now I don't use Facebook at all", Orloff says. "It was never a conscious choice to step away but eventually I realized all of the content I was consuming was from people I hardly knew, and it became not worth the time. The rise of political discourse also completely ruined the experience. The goal is to hopefully end up with less websites to have to manage, and have the ones we do frequent provide us with the experience we are looking for, and not what we are forced to endure."</p><p>I don't want to make this all sound like an advertisement for Cara; for me, the story here is how, by showing even a modicum of respect for artist, a platform can explode in a matter of <em>days</em>, as clear an indicator as any of just how bad things are right now on the existing social media behemoths. And it's always foolish, maybe even dangerous, to paint a platform as some kind of "saviour"; remember, ArtStation was once a plucky upstart rising from the ashes of CGHub's demise, and now finds itself living long enough to become a villain.</p><p>But, low bar or not, a website saying that it has "solidarity and respect for artists and their communities" means a lot in 2024, when so many others, from social media juggernauts like Meta to portfolio sites like ArtStation and<a href="https://aftermath.site/deviantart-ai-scam-bots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> DeviantArt</a>--can't hide their disdain for the average user, their work and their experience.</p><p>"For me the MOST important thing is that this is a platform that won’t scrape my artwork to train generative AI models against my wishes", Ortiz says. "That security and philosophy is huge for me. But I do hope Cara remains a human-centered platform even in a very far off hypothetical future where AI is ethical and non-exploitative. There is something truly wonderful about knowing what you’re overall looking at isn’t AI, it’s human made. Personally, I think we all desperately need that awe and wonder of actual human creativity back in our lives."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Disney has hinted that the KOTOR era, which takes place thousands of years before the original movie, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-old-republic-james-mangold-movies">could be a major movie setting in the future</a>, but it has otherwise remainly mostly untouched by the broader franchise.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/06/kotor-ii-03-1717710904368.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kreia is a fan-favorite KOTOR character who represents its more nuanced take on the Force.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Count The Acolyte showrunner Leslye Headland among those intrigued by the possibilities of KOTOR, which was centered around the conflicts between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Speaking with the <a href="https://www.omelete.com.br/star-wars/the-acolyte-knights-of-the-republic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Omelete</a> in an interview translated by IGN, Headland said she was particularly interested in Kreia, one of the major characters from KOTOR 2.</p><p>"I've always wanted to explore a live-action version of the Knights of the Old Republic game and Kreia's character," Headland said. "I think it would be a really interesting story to bring to life."</p><p>In KOTOR 2, Kreia is a blind Force-sensitive who forms a bond with the main character through the Force. In the story, Kreia is the protagonist's mentor, but rejects the divide between the light side and dark side. While Headland doesn't elaborate on how exactly she would realize Kreia's story, she is one of the most popular characters in the KOTOR series. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/14/why-knights-of-the-old-republic-2-tells-my-favourite-star-wars-story">In a 2018 KOTOR 2 retrospective</a> we called Kreia one of the best Star Wars characters, period — a high bar for an adaptation.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-the-acolyte">Headland is focused on The Acolyte</a>, a show set at the end of the High Republic and a little more than 130 years before A New Hope. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-acolyte-review-disney-plus">We wrote in our review</a>, "The Acolyte takes us to an earlier era of Star Wars than we’ve seen on screen, with mixed results. Awkward dialogue and a small scope rob it of some of the series’ signature space magic, but these old-school Jedi are a thrill to watch in action."</p><p>While KOTOR has yet to feature in one of Disney's works, the setting remains active thanks to an MMO and other works. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-says-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well">Saber Interactive's remake also continues to be "alive and well."</a></p><p>As for The Acolyte, its next episode is set to release on Tuesday.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

                <p dir="ltr">Warhammer 40K and Warhammer: Age of Sigmar are some of the coolest fictional settings out there. While both franchises started as tabletop wargames, they've expanded into video games, pen-and-paper RPGs, and more, giving fans of any medium plenty of ways to enjoy these grimdark universes. However, it's the many Warhammer: Age of Sigmar and Warhammer 40K novels where you get the deepest exploration of both settings--but with literal hundreds of official novels out there (of varying degrees of quality and canonicity) finding a way in can be daunting. Luckily, there's a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbooks%2Fstories-from-worlds-warhammer-2024-black-library-books&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-27-warhammer-novels-for-only-18-for-a-limited-time%2F1100-6524007%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Humble Bundle book</a> deal that includes up to 27 Warhammer: Age of Sigmar and Warhammer 40K novels for just $18.</p><p dir="ltr">The Stories From The World of Warhammer 2024 Book Bundle includes new and classic novels from Black Library, the official Warhammer book publisher, and is available in three pricing tiers. The deal starts at $1 for eight books--four set in the 40K universe and four set in the Age of Sigmar fantasy world. The inclusion of notable novels like the fan-favorite Ice Guard by Steve Lyons and Black Legion Book 1: The Talon of Horus by Aaron Dembski-Bowden makes this a great tier for those who want to ease into these universes.</p><p dir="ltr">Pay at least $10 and you unlock the second tier of the bundle, which adds eight more books for a total of 16. But if that's not enough eternal warfare for you, you can get the full 27-book bundle for just $18. That's $277 worth of some of the best Warhammer novels out there. While the $18 option might seem like a lot, one of the included books is Lupercal's War: A Horus Heresy Anthology, which includes over 20 short stories set during one of the most important eras of Warhammer 40K and serves as the perfect introductory point for the millennia-spanning history.

            <p>
Killing Time - the cult classic haunted house FPS originally released for the short-lived 3DO console back in 1995  - is being resurrected and remastered by retro specialists Nightdive Studios, and the developer is teasing that 2002's The Thing is up next.
</p>
<p>
Set in 1930s Maine, Killing Time's spookily comedic action unfolds on the expansive, island-bound estate of a wealthy heiress who disappeared after attempting to use an Ancient Egyptian water clock said to grant eternal life. It's up to players, in the role of an Egyptology student, to fend off the estate's many horrors (ranging from killer clowns to demonic maids and cleaver-wielding chefs), locate the water clock, and end its evil influence.
</p>
<p>
It's a shoot-y, puzzle-y type of journey set across more than 45 seamlessly connected areas incorporating hundreds of rooms - the mansion's ghastly inhabitants often created by turning FMV actors into sprites - and Nightdive's remaster, titled Killing Time: Resurrected, aims to provide a thorough upgrade for the whole ridiculous thing.

<p>
It promises toggleable high-resolution character artwork and sprites, upscaled environmental texturing, smoother gameplay, more responsive controls, plus expanded control and key-bind settings. And, on PC at least, there's support for 4K resolutions and 144 FPS, plus anti-aliasing options, and upgraded 2D screens and menu art.
</p>
<p>
Killing Time: Resurrected doesn't have a release date yet, but it'll be available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch when it eventually shows up. And as for Nightdive's other projects, the studio is currently teasing a remaster of 2002 squad-based survival horror shooter The Thing - based on the classic John Carpenter movie of the same name. That tease <a href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1798503205028139146">came via social media</a>, along with the promise of a reveal during this Friday's IGN Live.

			<p>Microsoft has revealed the titles they’ll be adding to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a> on PC and consoles in early June and it’s a good lineup for fans of retro RPGs and horror games. The Octopath Traveler games, originally only available on PC, PlayStation, and Switch, both arrive on Xbox and Game Pass. Meanwhile, subscribers can also look forward to new-release horror game Still Wakes the Deep and The Callisto Protocol.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFxboxgamepass95.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Here are your <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/06/xbox-game-pass-june-2024-wave-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">headliner Game Pass titles for the next couple of weeks</a>:</p>
<p><strong><em>Octopath Traveler II</em></strong><em> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Available today</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftech’s review – “Octopath Traveler II plays it safe when it comes to its core gameplay, offering a handful of small positive tweaks that don’t entirely make up for returning problems like clumsy party management and battles that take too long to wrap up. Thankfully, the game also takes a big, confident step forward in terms of writing, offering a cast of well-wrought, interesting characters and a vividly-detailed world you won’t soon forget. Octopath Traveler II may have the same old engine under the hood, but the road trip it takes you on is well worth experiencing.”</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></strong><em> (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – June 18</em></p>
<p><em>“From the award-winning developers at The Chinese Room comes a terrifying tale of isolation. You are trapped on an oil rig in the North Sea, running from an unknowable horror that has come aboard. With no escape and no way to fight back, all you can do is survive.”</em></p>
<p>These games will also be available in early June:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Octopath Traveler</em></strong><em> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Available today</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Depersonalization</em></strong><em> (PC) – June 12</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Isonzo</em></strong><em> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – June 13</em></li>
<li><strong><em>The Callisto Protocol</em></strong><em> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – June 13</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Xbox Game Pass grants players access to more than 100 games for 10 bucks a month, while Xbox Game Pass Ultimate also gets you Xbox Live Gold and EA Play access — you can&nbsp;<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=14.1.5-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fxbox-game-pass-late-march-2020-bleeding-edge%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-CA%2Fxbox-game-pass%2Fgames&amp;xguid=01E0WZYEHCXH446AREYQB7E5YF&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=300&amp;xuuid=0fb83aebb5aecf1559f4c6291e20a492&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out a full list of available console and PC games here</a>.&nbsp; You can<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass?xr=shellnav#join" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;sign up here</a>.</p>
<p>What are you Game Pass subscribers going to be playing over the next couple of weeks?</p>

<p data-characters="340" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Enshrouded</em> has grown even further this week. Melodies of the Mire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvQNjoc0FkM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is the next update</a> for the open-world multiplayer survival game. And don’t worry: “Melodies” isn’t some meaningless alliteration. The new <em>Enshrouded </em>– Melodies of the Mire update lets you skip through a new biome as a musical bard, if you wish.</p> <p data-characters="519" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true">Obviously, you want to skip through the biome as a musical bard. Who wouldn’t? Thankfully, you won’t even have to do it alone. You can craft instruments, ranging from a lute to a flute, and even a harp. There are multiple instruments, allowing you and a few buddies to traipse through the world as your very own band of bards. Frankly, allowing players to stop and bust out a jingle is something every game should try to implement. You can’t let the pirates of <em>Sea of Thieves</em> have all the fun, right? </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Enshrouded - Melodies of The Mire | Official Update Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CvQNjoc0FkM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-enshrouded-melodies-of-the-mire-update-brings-more-to-explore" data-injectable="false"><em>Enshrouded </em>– Melodies of the Mire update brings more to explore</h2> <p data-characters="576" data-current-count="876" data-injectable="true">Moving away from the melodies, we should cover the “Mire” part of “Melodies of the Mire.” The Blackmire is an expansion of the Revelwoods. This vertical-focused biome lets you bounce high into the trees using jump pads. A new enemy type called the Vukah is already waiting in the branches, however, waiting for a fight. The update comes with new tree and terrain types, along with props and furniture to craft. If you don’t mind having the Vukah as neighbors, the update also lets you <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-is-the-best-place-to-build-your-first-base-in-enshrouded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">build a treehouse</a> in the mire. Doesn’t that sound cozy?</p>
 <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="162" data-injectable="false">That’s not all the update brings. You can also check out a new weapon, the Dual-Wielded Daggers, and a vanity system that lets you hide some equipped gear. </p> <figure data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Enshrouded - Melodies of the Mire | Update 2 Highlights" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vhLz6WvusZI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
  <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">The <em>Enshrouded </em>community has been clamoring for player-based quest progression, and they finally have it. Melodies of the Mire includes player and world progression, allowing you to complete quests even if someone on the server already did. The change has <a href="https://enshrouded.featureupvote.com/suggestions/525247/allow-for-playerbased-quest-progression-see-dev-comments-in-thread" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 19,000 votes</a> on the <em>Enshrouded </em>feedback page. I’m guessing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/enshrouded-has-sold-a-million-copies-is-just-behind-palworld-on-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of people</a> are going to be happy with the update. </p> <p data-characters="105" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="false">There are more changes to peruse, so <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4176604868930473019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out the update notes</a> before hopping in to start your own band.</p>

<p data-characters="308" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Hey, kids, remember <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-yooka-laylee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yooka-Laylee</a></em>? I can ask that in earnest because Playtonic Games’ 3D collect ’em up platformer is seven years old now, practically a dinosaur in Internet Years. This particular reptile is coming back, bat in tow, with a remastered and enhanced version called <em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">The updated version of <em>Yooka-Laylee </em>was revealed during the Guerilla Collective showcase along with a bunch of indie announcements and trailers. The <em>Yooka-Replaylee </em>footage shows some side-by-side looks at the new visual flourishes, which appear to be pretty substantial.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Yooka-Replaylee! | Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrXXbkP5HAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="570" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true">Beyond the new look, the team improved some of the games challenges while adding new ones for players to discover. There’s also a new collectible currency thanks to Capital B’s minions dropping their coins all over the place. You can spend this hard-found loot at the sentient vending machine known as Vendi, who hooks Yooka and Laylee up with Tonics in exchange for completing objectives. Other enhancements include a new world map, which helps you track challenges and plan your next moves, and some new tonic flavors for further playstyle customization.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="false">Finally, <em>Yooka-Replaylee </em>sports updates to the controls and camera — making it easier to both position the camera and pull off move combos — as well as a new orchestral arrangement of Grant Kirkhope and David Wise’s original soundtrack. Right now it’s just listed for consoles and PC with no release date in place, but the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2448020/YookaReplaylee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> is live with more screens, info, and a brief FAQ.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="300" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s been nearly five years since the launch of <em>Shenmue III</em>. Even though the game’s release after nearly two decades was akin to a miracle, the story isn’t finished. Fans haven’t given up yet, as proven by a <a href="https://x.com/Shenmue_Dojo/status/1798107797244027133" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Shenmue 4</em> ad</a> that decorated New York’s Times Square this week.</p> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">Die-hard fans from the site <a href="https://shenmuedojo.com/letsgetshenmue4-trending-at-new-yorks-times-square/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shenmue Dojo</a> were behind the short ad, which appeared in Times Square on June 4. The campaign consisted of a 15-second advertisement and getting fans on board with the hashtag #letsgetshenmue4 on X. </p> <figure data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">Do you think Sega noticed? This is admittedly a incredible way to flag the publisher’s attention. Getting one 15-second ad at Times Square starts as low as $40, so it’s not like they had to break the bank. Still, it’s a bold strategy; let’s see if it pays off.</p> <h2 id="h-shenmue-fans-are-still-on-lan-di-s-trail" data-injectable="false"><em>Shenmue </em>fans are still on Lan Di’s trail</h2> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true">The <em>Shenmue </em>saga has been a fascinating one to live through and cover over the years. First released on the Dreamcast in 1999, <em>Shenmue </em>was developer Yu Suzuki’s magnum opus. The <em>Virtua Fighter</em> creator dreamed of an open-world adventure game so personal and unique that he felt it would conceptualize a new genre: FREE, or Full Reactive Eyes Entertainment. </p>
 <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">These days, we’d likely drop <em>Shenmue </em>into the open-world RPG subgenre and call it a day. The game did bring about innovations, though, such as time-based story progression and NPC scheduling — the latter of which some games eventually adopted. </p> <figure data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, <em>Shenmue </em>mostly heralded a headache for Sega. Despite the positive reception, the game was <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/game/2031/shenmue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expensive to make and too niche</a> to meet sales expectations. The series lurched on with <em>Shenmue II</em> in 2001 (2002 on Xbox) but fell off the radar soon after. Suzuki, of course, never gave up. <em>Shenmue III</em> was revealed at the E3 2015 Sony Press Conference, getting a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gDHPIF3N0A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standing ovation</a> and, understandably, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY1p8ZgvqYM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some tears</a>. I was right there with you, Michael.</p>
 <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="false">Five years later, Suzuki and <em>Shenmue </em>fans clearly aren’t giving up on a <em>Shenmue 4</em>. The third game sadly couldn’t shake the ol’ <em>Shenmue </em>curse of being <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/shenmue-3-performed-fine-but-isnt-a-mass-market-game-says-publisher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too niche for strong sales</a>, but fan action is what got protagonist Ryo Hazuki moving further in his journey to find those damn sailors. And it probably won’t stop even with a <em>Shenmue 4</em>. Suzuki has said the third game <a href="https://www.vg247.com/yu-suzuki-says-shenmue-3-will-get-us-40-percent-through-ryos-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">represented 40% of the story</a>, so there may be more campaigns ahead. Are we thinking #letsgetshenmue5 someday? </p>
