		<p>There is a new action RPG coming to town with ChillyRoom announcing Loulan: The Cursed Sand, which is set to come to PC and PS5, though a release date is yet to be set. Players take on the role of a skeletal warrior that has a sand form, which in turn provides some sand based combat powers to take on the various enemies that will be attacking him.</p>

<p>Loulan: The Cursed Sand is set in China along the ancient Silk Road where the lost kingdom of Loulan is located with its ruins piercing the sand. The story focuses on the skeletal warrior, a fallen Royal Guard, who has returned to the fallen kingdom to find his love who is also the princess. The description from the development team about Loulan: The Cursed Sand says:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Cursed Warrior of Dual Forms:&nbsp;</strong>Control the skeletal warrior “The&nbsp;Cursed Sand”, freely switching between bone and sand forms to experience entirely different combat styles and story interactions.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Realistic Melee Combat Against Many:&nbsp;</strong>Engage in grounded, one-against-many melee battles from a dynamic top-down perspective, where terrain design, enemy composition, and combat mechanics intertwine to test your skill and strategy.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Diverse and Creative Sand Abilities:&nbsp;</strong>Learn and wield unique sand abilities to solve puzzles, explore intricate levels, and experiment with multiple combat styles and tactical approaches.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Formidable Elites and Bosses:&nbsp;</strong>Face thrilling one-on-one encounters with powerful elite enemies and colossal bosses that challenge your mastery and reflexes.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Ancient Western Fantasy World:&nbsp;</strong>Explore a mysterious world inspired by the lost Kingdom of Loulan along the Silk Road, featuring diverse regions and atmospheric, handcrafted levels.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>ChillyRoom has stated that it is working on planning the localisation of Loulan: The Cursed Sand into different languages, and will have more details when those plans are finalised.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Pathea Games, the studio known for games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/my-time-at-portia-review-dont-make-me-leave/">My Time at Portia</a>, My Time at Sandrock, and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/my-time-at-evershine-is-first-confirmed-game-for-nintendo-switch-2/">My Time at Evershine</a> has just shadow-dropped something you'd be more likely to expect from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/knockout-city-dodgeball-is-life/">Velan Studios after its game Knockout City</a>, or even <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-bans-bots/">Psyonix</a> as a spin-off from Rocket League with Superball, a new free-to-play 3v3 arcade hero football game that's out now on PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Announced during the ID@Xbox and IGN Showcase, Superball is described as a mash between Rocket League, something that's made extremely obvious with its giant ball and arena style, and Overwatch with its hero character elements.</p>



<p>You play as one of 17 characters that each slot into one of three categories: goalkeepers, midfielders, and forwards. Goalkeepers are your slower, bulky characters that can protect their net with shield abilities while also sporting a massive long-distance shot.</p>



<p>Midfielders are your agile two-way players who can help out on offense and defense, and finally forwards are your offensive-focused powerhouses built to score goals and not much else.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>After years of iteration, sleepless nights and many Chongqing hot summers, our team at Pathea is thrilled to finally bring Superball to players</em>," said lead producer Guo Yuheng in a press release. "<em>We're incredibly grateful to our community for their patience and for sticking with us on this journey. What started as a PvP mech combat game evolved into something much bigger and polished, when a football-inspired side mode captured the team's imagination. We can't wait to see everyone jump into the arenas, unleash their favorite heroes, and help shape the future of Superball together with us</em>."</p>



<p>Superball began its life as 'Super Buckyball Tournament,' and has been in the works since 2019 under that name before becoming 'Superball' in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1059110/view/4264427597941058609">July 2024</a>. After multiple delays along the way and player beta and alpha tests in the meantime, it's finally here for players on PC and Xbox Series to dive into. There's no word yet as to whether it'll come to PlayStation and Nintendo consoles, but that's likely always a possibility at some point in the future.</p>



<p>Alongside its standard 3v3 mode, players will also be able to check out four extra modes called Slam Dunk, Dodgeball, Icebreaker, and Divine Path. As it's a free-to-play live service game, it's also launching with a Season 1 battle pass, but a bit of a wrinkle in the game's F2P structure is that you'll only get 72 hours from when you sign up with the majority of the game's heroes.</p>



<p>After that, you have to unlock the rest of the characters by grinding for them, after using your single voucher to unlock whichever character you preferred in your 72-hour window to try them all out.</p>



<p>Superball is also available on Xbox Game Pass, though considering it's a free-to-play game, that's a fairly moot point. </p>

During a campaign or sandbox playthrough, you will establish multiple towns, each on a unique mountain with its own traits. All your towns co-exist in symbiosis, creating a trading network, which you can then adjust to your needs by revisiting already developed settlements. The Kingdom of Laysara has to be rebuilt!</p><p>Note: <em>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</em> is a pure city building experience solely focused on the economy, resource <a title="Genres > Management [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, and surviving despite the inhospitable environment. Therefore, the game doesn’t feature combat or any other military aspects.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Build on a Mountain</strong> – Each mountain comes with a new set of challenges. Mounts differ in shapes, vegetation zone layouts, resource availability, and weather conditions. Sometimes you will have plenty of room for farming in green lowlands, sometimes you will need to rely on breeding and extracting valuable minerals from regions dangerously close to peak glaciers. If you find yourself in dire need of a certain resource, you can always try to establish a trading route with another town.</li><li><strong>Deal With Avalanches</strong> – One of the ever-present dangers you will have to deal with are mighty avalanches. You can’t stop them, but you can take precautions and be prepared. Afforest the key areas to create natural barriers, build artificial ones to redirect rushing masses of snow, or trigger the avalanche early, while it’s still manageable. Create a deliberate and reliable strategy and you might even be able to use the power of snow to your advantage; fail to do so and find your city buried and devastated!</li><li><strong>Craft a Transport Network</strong> – So, transporting goods is easy, right? Well, not if your destination lies on the other side of the mountain, a few hundred meters higher, behind cliffs, ridges, canyons, and rivers. You will need to create a vast, complex transport network consisting of roads, bridges, and shafts to ensure reliable delivery chains. As demand for resources will grow alongside the town’s population, always look for opportunities to optimize your transportation network, be it by building paved roads, using more advanced lifting constructions, or aiding your carriers with glamorous yaks.</li><li><strong>Raise a Summit Temple</strong> – If you manage to endure all mountain dangers, build a network of efficient production chains, and satisfy all needs of your people, there is only one more thing to be done: conquering the mountain peak! To succeed in this great endeavor you’ll need to reach the summit and establish safe routes for your carriers to bring in enormous amounts of building resources, but beware! Weather at this height is as deadly as ever. The final effect is well worth the effort though, as raising the summit temple is an act of total triumph of human courage (and your logistics skills!) over the elements.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Laysara: Summit Kingdom - Console Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDfEOCRXx_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/laysara-summit-kingdom-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-and-switch]]></content:encoded>

With a suit armed to the nines, Robot can keep enemies at a distance with his missiles and wrist cannons, while swiftly maneuvering throughout the game using his Beam Blasts and Disruptor to lay on damage. His shoulder cannons unleash deadly homing missiles that force opponents to block in place, granting extra time for Robot to call in assists, set up tech or prepare a mighty assault.

Versatile, intelligent and a formidable weapon, Robot is an advanced fighter to have on your team.</p><p><strong>Monster Girl</strong></p><p>Afflicted by a curse, Amanda acquired the extraordinary ability to shift between human form and that of a monster. But this power came at a cost, as each transformation causes her human form to age backward. Undeterred, she proves to be an absolute brute on the battlefield as Monster Girl. Her immense size and strength allow her to tear down opponents, utilizing a combination of grapple attacks, head-spinning hits, in-air blows, body slams and more. And just when her enemies think they’re reaching victory, Monster Girl’s relentless nature allows her to come back even stronger. Boasting dominating power yet technical, combo-driven gameplay, Monster Girl is a brawler you’ll want by your side.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

<p>Difficulty levels and better checkpoints in the works</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a> is a pretty good game; we should know, we gave it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">7/10 in our review</a>. But many folks have, understandably, criticised it for its often punishing difficulty and stingy checkpoint system.</p>
<p>So, to address this, Bandai Namco has announced update 1.1.0, an upcoming patch that looks to "redesign the play experience and evolve Shadow Labyrinth into a game that more people can enjoy". It will focus primarily on three key areas: difficulty, movement when controlling PUCK, and the checkpoint system.</p>
<p>Here's what the full announcement entails:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First and foremost, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who played this game. Each and every one of your opinions is our greatest_asset and the driving force propelling us forward.<br>
<strong><br>
Reflections</strong></p>
<p>We developed Shadow Labyrinth aiming for a unique experience: “Wandering the labyrinth, devouring, and evolving.”</p>
<p>We sincerely acknowledge the many evaluations of the game we’ve received, along with the numerous opinions shared by our players.</p>
<p>Particularly:</p>
<p>- Inconvenience of saving / traveling<br>
- Mini-PUCK play control in MAZE sections<br>
- High difficulty</p>
<p>These were challenges felt by many players, and we strongly feel they are points the development team must sincerely address.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of the Version Update</strong></p>
<p>The upcoming version update is not merely a bug fix or adjustment. Its purpose is to redesign the play experience and evolve Shadow Labyrinth into a game that more people can enjoy.</p>
<p>A flexible system allowing players to choose difficulty levels, and improved immersion through comfortable controls and appropriately placed checkpoints.</p>
<p>We will build the next update around those core elements. We hope you look forward to the updated version of Shadow Labyrinth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while we can't exactly say what "improved immersion through comfortable controls" means, the prospect of difficulty settings and more generous checkpoints will no doubt come as good news to fans.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to keep you up to date on when this new update is scheduled to drop on Switch and Switch 2.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review">My review</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> begins with a retelling of the first unexpected curveball the RPG threw my way. Barely out of the intro and having made exactly two vending machine purchases, I was offered the consumerism flaw. This puzzled me. As it turns out, this event had good reason to puzzle me.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You see, since the game emerged into early access late last week - a time frame during which only those who spunked around £30 extra for the game's preorder premium edition can play it - other folks have run into this flaw, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-outer-worlds-2-dunks-on-you-with-a-consumerism-flaw-that-secretly-makes-you-stupid-if-you-bought-its-usd100-version-for-early-access-promotions-and-sales-have-riddled-your-brain/">assumed that it must be dunking on them</a> for having bought that more expensive edition.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense, and honestly I'm a bit narked with myself for not making the connection immediately. In my defense, the flaw isn't listed among the extra bits offered by the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/the-outer-worlds-2-preorder-premium-edition/9P65228JL613/0010/B1G720SRQH3P">premium edition</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449110/The_Outer_Worlds_2/">storefronts</a> as far as I can tell. Nor is it explicity labelled with the words 'premium' or 'deluxe', as the corporate appreciation premium pack moon man gear which has been hanging out in my inventory all 40 or so hours is. So, since my character was given dialogue which suggested them to simply be very dumb due to my accepting of this flaw designed to make fun of my superfluous spending, I guess you got me, Outer Worlds 2. Touché, Obsidian. Well played.</p>
<p>But, wait just one second. If the flaw's designed as a fun little Borderlandsy meta dunk on premium edition purchasers, it's taken on rather a different meaning in this case. You see, as is usually the case with reviews outside of instances in which companies decide not to send out codes for whatever reason, I was given an early copy of The Outer Worlds 2's all-singing, all-dancing premium edition for free by publishers Microsoft. We certainly didn't specify an edition we wanted, so as often happens it was the publishers' understandable decision to send me, a person who'd be critiquing the game and publishing thoughts, the swankiest version of it.</p><p>In 99% of cases, that boring behind-the-scenes admin wouldn't be something worth telling you about, but in this one, it's created a set of circumstances which have turned Obsidian's joke totally on its head and into something I honestly find a fair bit funnier. I promise that isn't just because quirks of fate mean it's not ended up a gag at my expense, either. I love a joke, be they good, bad, or indifferent. As long as the circumstances/company are appropriate, I'm generally in favour of firing away the funnies, even if they're tortured punchlines doomed to fall flat.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Obsidian / Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's something uniquely hilarious about this one. A studio who, whether at their own behest or under duress from their corporate overlords, are doing a swanky premium edition offering the chance to play early and having a little laugh about people, er, buying that thing they're selling. Then it inadvertently pings right back around. Cue <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKDo6g4CCeU">this Faith No More cover</a> I'm fond of. After all, even if my position as a journo who hadn't bought the thing wasn't anticipated, what about folks who might get the premium edition free through the likes of competitions or just wait until sales eventually render it cheaper than the standard edition of the game is at launch?</p>
<p>I know, I'm giving far too much thought to the ramificiations of this harmless and fun little gag, but having realised what's happened, I can't help but feel it rather sums up the Outer Worlds 2 experience in a way I hadn't intended. Instead of a scenario with promise of something that could be New Vegas-level great, but to me ends up feeling closer to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>-level good, you get something skewered by reality into a version of itself that doesn't quite match what was anticipated or hoped. It's a lot like many of the lines uttered in jest and parody by the conniving corporatists of Auntie's Choice sounding akin to something you might find in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">very real layoff memo</a> or <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">marketing pitch</a> from Obsidian's parent company Microsoft.</p><p>Folks might well still laugh if your jokes are funny or self-aware enough, but it's a lot more difficult to satirise or mock something if you're part of it, without risking those efforts ringing a bit hollow. Especially if you're deliberately working a lot of your wink wink, nudge nudge corporate spoofing into the more expensive edition of a product you're trying to sell.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bully-online-mod-play-free-gta-online-release-pc-rockstar-2000639618</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bully-doesnt-sound-like-your-typical-rockstar-game-1845413977"><em>Bully</em> didn’t support online multiplayer when it launched in 2006,</a> but that didn’t stop a team of dedicated fans and modders from seeking to turn the game into a full-featured online experience. And now, they are close to releasing <em>Bully Online</em>, a free mod that essentially turns the school-themed open-world game into something like <em>Grand Theft Auto Online.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>On October 28, Rockstar Games superfan, YouTuber, and modder SWEGTA announced<em> Bully Online</em> and showed off the upcoming free mod via a trailer on his YouTube channel. The mod will include a large roster of playable characters, new drivable vehicles, mini-games, player housing, roleplay support, online racing, and more.&nbsp;<em>Bully Online</em> is built using DSL script loader, a plugin for <em>Bully</em> that allows SWEGTA and his team to extensively mod the original game. Using this plugin, the YouTuber says a lot of “things we thought were impossible just a few years ago can now be done,” including adding full online multiplayer support.</p>

  <p>As explained in the video above, SWEGTA and his team are adding a lot to<em> Bully Online,</em> including the ability to buy cars and even lock them using car keys via a newly added inventory system. The upcoming mod even features a first-person shooter mini-game starring oversized rats, which is presented in-game as a video game you can play against other <em>Bully Online</em> players. Don’t worry, <em>Bully Online</em> isn’t adding guns to Rockstar’s boarding school game. That’s something SWEGTA and the team didn’t want to do. Instead, this FPS mini-game will provide players with some shooting action without handing assault rifles to the students at Bullworth Academy.</p>

 <p>Some fans are worried that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ambitious-gta-underground-mod-shutdowns-after-six-years-1847619249">Rockstar Games might show up and shut all of this down</a> because SWEGTA is a high-profile creator and is making a big announcement out of <em>Bully Online’</em>s reveal. And that’s possible. But I think <em>Bully Online</em> might be safe simply because it’s not directly competing with <em>GTA Online </em>or <em>Red Dead Online.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>According to SWEGTA, <em>Bully Online</em> has been in development for a “very long time,” but he and the team didn’t want to reveal it until it was far enough along that they all felt confident in showing it off to the public. That time is now, with SWEGTA confirming that <em>Bully Online</em> will be available to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbG85NU1zU1Y3YnF5SkdOdHJqZ2h3RjZhbjJhZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttWjBNZ0k5bTMtdUQ0aDZ5SGtxQnItaE1rMkVwd3oxQXRXLVZGa2c5NTdZWVVqTWJIMGNScWc0MVQ2MWRXZEwyZDRwZ0tGRDlUbF9pNFlxWXNCVE5wOGd6SEVVZ0FkUmFGOTdmNjZWSW1VOHM1OER0TQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fko-fi.com%2Fbullyonline&amp;v=2J0_BnWKvEA"><em>Bully Online</em> paid Ko-Fi subscribers</a> starting in December. The plan is to eventually roll out a fully public server available to anyone who owns <em>Bully</em> on PC and installs the mod. <a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-s-dan-houser-teases-bully-sequel-max-payne-3-5860860">It’s not quite <em>Bully 2</em>, but it’s better than nothing</a>.</p>

There’s also an added feeling of anxiety knowing there are over 100 of you all vying to be the final player left standing—knowing every footstep could be one move toward your next elimination, or your own demise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-bf-pro-battle-pass-worth-it-battlefield-6-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> introduced the fabled REDSEC battle royale mode after launch. It has the electric <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gauntlet-mode-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gauntlet mode</a>, but let’s see if Solos gets any love.</p>

<figure><figcaption>But, why? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield Studios has opted not to include a Solo playlist at Battlefield 6’s REDSEC battle royale launch.</strong></p>



<p>Don’t shoot the messenger! We’re just as disappointed as you are, and it really is a glaring oversight and an odd omission from REDSEC. There are no figures to back this up, but don’t be surprised if Solos is the most popular battle royale mode across all BR games.</p>



<p>It’s just easier for an individual player to pop in, without needing a squad, and trust their own survival instincts. REDSEC’s launch debuted with two playlist options: <strong>Duos and Quads</strong>—but no Solos.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-way-to-play-solo-in-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale">Is There Any Way To Play Solo In Battlefield 6 REDSEC Battle Royale?</h2>



<p><strong>The only way to sort of play Solos is to join a random team in Duos or Quads and play your own game in Battlefield 6 REDSEC battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>No, this isn’t genuine Solos, and yes, we know—but what else are you going to do? Duos is about as close as you’re going to get for the time being, and, to be honest, there’s a good chance <strong>many players will do the same thing</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s likely many Duos lobbies will be full of teams in name only, and both players are acting independently of one another. You too can do this, and go to the opposite end of the map to your ally if you want to prove a point.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-solo-playlist-coming-to-battlefield-6-redsec-br">When Is Solo Playlist Coming To Battlefield 6 REDSEC BR?</h2>



<p><strong>EA or Battlefield Studios hasn’t specifically mentioned Solos in any of its press releases or blog posts, but the use of “at launch” in a blog post is a dead giveaway that a Solo mode is coming.</strong></p>



<p>Logically, more content will be added to Battlefield 6’s REDSEC BR. There’s no direct mention of Solos in the Battlefield 6 Season 1 roadmap, and, again, we still find the lack of Solos bizarre.</p>



<p>However, a Season 1 roadmap <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/season-1-full-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> does say this: “REDSEC’s Battle Royale experience is built on Battlefield’s foundation of iconic all-out warfare, tactical destruction, and squad-based gameplay defined by its Class System. The standard Battle Royale match holds up to 100 players in either four-player squad or duo formats <strong>at launch</strong>.”</p>



<p>It’s coming, we all know it’s coming. Once it does, or it gets leaked, we’ll be the first to update you.</p>



<p>You can now vent your anger in the comments about Battlefield 6’s crazy decision to leave out a Solo playlist. Is Solos the best way to play battle royale?

<p>Battlefield’s REDSEC Battle Royale mode has launched, with plenty to sink your teeth into, and completing missions is a vital step to obtaining the best loot and securing victory.</p>



<p>Landing at the start of season 1, REDSEC in Battlefield has a variety of modes, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gauntlet-mode-battlefield-6-redsec-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mission-focused Gauntlet</a>, but these missions are also available in the standard Battle Royale modes.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for a breakdown of all the missions available in REDSEC Battle Royale inside Battlefield, we’ve got the definitive guide you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-redsec-battle-royale-missions">All REDSEC Battle Royale Missions</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Heavy support. Image via EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Missions are optional side quests that appear during a REDSEC match, providing a bunch of XP and valuable rewards to help you in the fight.</strong></p>



<p>Only one mission can be activated at a time, with any squad member able to select one to be completed. Once a mission is accepted by one player, no missions can be selected by another player in the squad until later in the match.</p>



<p>Rewards are available for successfully completing each mission, ranging from Rare Weapons and Drop-Ins to immediate access to Custom Weapon Drops, and a Vehicle Key Card required for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-tanks-in-battlefield-redsec-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaining access to a Tank</a>. Missions can be both PvP and PvE in nature, though the PvP aspects with other players in the Battle Royale will be constant.</p>



<p>Additionally, some missions will appear as a ‘Counter Mission’, which indicates a nearby squad is completing a mission and tasks you with disrupting their plans. This almost always involves head-to-head combat with enemy players, however, so only dive into these when you feel you are prepared for a battle.</p>



<p>The table below details all of the mission types that can appear in REDSEC Battle Royale, and details on how to complete them.</p>

            <p>
Following Amazon's decision to cuts 14,000 jobs, a new report has claimed the company is "gutting" its video games division as part of the move.
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, who, referencing a memo sent to Amazon employees, says the company plans to reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly MMOs. In the memo, Steven Boom (Amazon's vice president of Audio, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and Game) wrote, "While we're proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team."
</p>
<p>
While Amazon hasn't revealed the exact number of jobs being cut across its games division, affected employees are already taking to social media, suggesting teams from two projects - New World and the Lord of the Rings MMO announced back in 2023 - are impacted. On LinkedIn, former senior gameplay engineer Ashleigh Amrine <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7388974384306221056/">wrote</a>, "This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)."
</p>
<p>
Amazon entered the video games market in disastrous fashion, cancelling its free-to-play shooter Crucible <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-cancels-crucible-five-months-after-release-and-four-months-after-un-release">just five months after its release</a> in 2020, and four months after it was "unreleased" back into beta. Its other failures include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-announces-fresh-stab-at-turning-the-lord-of-the-rings-into-an-mmo">first stab at a Lord of the Rings MMO</a>, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-cancels-its-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">cancelled in 2021</a> following a dispute with Chinese mega-corp <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>. New World, too, has struggled to sustain interest after a strong start in 2021. Amazon's other major project is its upcoming Crystal Dynamics-developed upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider game</a>, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">said to be "going well"</a> in August last year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Francis Coulombe and publisher Devolver Digital have announced a major new update for pixel horror RPG&nbsp;<em>Look Outside</em>, and it's adding new quests, new monsters, and more to the apartment building-bound adventure today.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer, the Final Vision update, which is free for everyone who owns the base game, is adding a number of new features, including "multiple new endings", so you'd better get started on that new playthrough right now.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new interactions, new areas to explore, and new quests to complete, as well as "dozens" of new monsters to battle.&nbsp;<em>Look Outside&nbsp;</em>is also getting new boss encounters as part of this update, as well as "horrible new secrets", which is enticing. I think.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/look-outside-2.0-update-vincent.jpg?itok=V0a5qYGV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/look-outside-2.0-update-vincent.jpg?itok=h4jvEO-_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Vincent wants you to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Look Outside&nbsp;</em>2.0, and you wouldn't want to upset Vincent, would you?</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Look Outside</em>, it's a horror RPG that was created using RPG Maker. Much like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rv-there-yet-sales" rel="nofollow">fellow indie hit&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?</em></a>, the game began as a game jam submission, but in&nbsp;<em>Look Outside</em>'s case, developer Francis Coulombe expanded on its initial content thans to positive feedback.</p>

<p><em>Look Outside&nbsp;</em>sees you playing as Sam, a young man who's trapped in his apartment building thanks to a horrifying cosmic entity that turns everyone who looks at it into monstrous abominations.</p>

<p>Together with whatever survivors you can find in your building, it's up to you to explore the high-rise in order to find out whether there's a way for you to get everything back to normal, fighting off the monstrosities you encounter along the way.</p>




<p>I'd thoroughly recommend&nbsp;<em>Look Outside</em>, honestly; much like&nbsp;<em>Fear &amp; Hunger&nbsp;</em>(although it's significantly less punishing than those games), Coulombe's RPG is infinitely more unsettling than many higher-budget titles thanks to its lower-fidelity artwork, and it's a non-linear joy to play as well.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Look Outside&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3373660/Look_Outside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-duckov-sales-2m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-duckov-sales-reach-2m-in-under-two-weeks.1337152/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Team Soda and publisher bilibili have announced yet another huge sales milestone for single-player&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>riff&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em>, so it's safe to say the two studios have a solid hit on their hands.</p>

<p>As revealed by Team Soda and bilibili <a href="https://x.com/GameDuckov/status/1983053864820453385" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on X</a>,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell a whopping two million copies since launching earlier this month. It's achieved that figure in less than two weeks, which is impressive.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the newly-announced sales figure means that&nbsp;<em>Duckov&nbsp;</em>has picked up another 1.5 million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-duckov-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">since October 20th</a>, when Team Soda and bilibili revealed that their game had shifted 500,000 copies in its opening weekend alone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/escape-from-duckov-2m-sales-gameplay.jpg?itok=ptRHXCDq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/escape-from-duckov-2m-sales-gameplay.jpg?itok=FTlot79H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>has quacked - sorry, racked - up two million sales in its first two weeks.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>seems to deserve its high sales, as it's earned itself an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Overwhelmingly Positive rating</a> on Steam across over 3,000 reviews in the last couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Despite the name,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>doesn't actually share too much in common with&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>; it's a survival-focused looter-shooter, but it adopts a top-down isometric perspective as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>'s first-person shooting.</p>

<p>Obviously, the game is also largely focused around ducks, which...well, I can't confidently state&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>doesn't have any ducks, but it's certainly not quite as duck-centric as Team Soda and bilibili's game.</p>

<p>If you want to get a feel for what kind of game&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>is, you can check out a trailer for it, which shows off some of the (entirely single-player) gameplay as well as the game's overall aesthetic, right here.</p>




<p><em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>is just one of several indie hits currently storming the gaming charts.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, Nuggets Entertainment revealed that its indie driving adventure&nbsp;<em>RV There Yet?&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rv-there-yet-sales" rel="nofollow">crossed 1.3 million sales</a>, and they both follow hot on the heels of climbing sim&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-2m-sales" rel="nofollow">hit two million sales itself</a> back in June.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Early backers can get it discounted to €99, or around $115, but that’s still far more expensive than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24314884/anbernic-rg34xx-handheld-emulator-retro-nintendo-game-boy-advance">many of Anbernic’s handheld emulators</a> that are far more capable and ready to play right out of the box.</p><p>The more capable BrickBoy Gamer Kit that adds support for Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance games, compatibility with Bluetooth headphones, and a rechargeable battery is €169, or around $197, without discounts.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>'s battle royale mode REDSEC is out now, a "genre shifting free-to-play destination" that includes both the promised Fortnite functionality and a new squad-based competitive mode, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gauntlet">Gauntlet</a> - no, not that Gauntlet, auto keyword linker, stop it, you're making me look daft, UGH I don't have time to argue with you, please just go away - together with additional gubbins for Battlefield's Portal editor. You can find it either via your Battlefield 6 install or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3028330/Battlefield_REDSEC/">as a separate release on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
REDSEC's battle royale map is Fort Lyndon, pictured below, with takes place in the backyards and beaches of California, and is apparently the series' biggest map ever. The setup is familiar: 100 players divided into squads are dropped into the world and must scrounge for pick-ups and do shooticuffs and fistibangs within a shrinking (and partly destructible) playspace.

<p>
As for the Gauntlet mode, this is a tournament affair in which eight teams of four compete in round-based missions, with each round giving you five minutes to complete an objective. Each round, map and mission has different variables.
</p>
<p>
What, you think all of that sounds rubbish? Hie thee to the Battlefield Portal editor, then, where you can rip REDSEC's skin off and fiddle around with various parameters. The developers give the example of restricting everybody to sledgehammers or making use of scripting tools to put together more bespoke chains of events and objectives.

REDSEC - or Redsec, as it shall be known from this point on, because I am weary of bellowing at you through my keyboard - launches alongside the first season of Battlefield 6's live service offerings, which you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">read about here</a>. I'm not much of a battle royaler, certainly nowhere near as battleregal as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Aphid Leggings</a> enthusiast James, but I'll try to get a game going later and let you know how I fare.
