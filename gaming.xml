            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the TTRPG community, Roll20 is one of the largest virtual tabletop platforms on the market. It boasts one of the largest libraries of resources and hosts millions of games every day. Now, that platform will have more resources with an official Roll20 Demiplane acquisition.</p>

<h2>The Roll20 Demiplane acquisition announcement</h2>

<p>The announcement of the Roll20 Demiplane acquisition was covered in a report by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/roll20-announces-purchase-of-demiplane/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Comicbook.com</a>. According to the report, the purchase goes into effect today, providing Roll20 with a suite of character creation tools that can work in tandem with the VTT and online marketplace DriveThruRPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demiplane-shop-bundle-screenshot.jpg?itok=roQyzWMV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demiplane-shop-bundle-screenshot.jpg?itok=tRvN-0Rg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This kind of convenience may be coming to Roll20.</figcaption></figure><p>For those unaware, Demiplane is a VTT known for its robust suite of character-creation tools and RPG resource compendiums. Its closest competition in terms of convenience and usability on the market is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-buys-up-dd-beyond-from-fandom">D&amp;D Beyond</a>. Demiplane's supported titles include Paizo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/paizo-and-demiplane-announce-pathfinder-nexus">Pathfinder</a>, Paradox Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/world-of-darkness-nexus-embraces-partnership-with-demiplane"><em>World of Darkness</em></a>, and Darrington Press' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/demiplane-partners-with-darrington-press-to-launch-candela-obscura-nexus"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>.</p>

<p>In an interview with Roll20's CEO, Ankit Lai explained the reason for the Roll20 Demiplane acquisition. Lai explained that it was to further Roll20's goal of creating a seamless user experience. This aligns with the platform's past partnerships, providing user-created content through <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dms-guild-content-now-on-roll20">DMs Guild</a> or easy battlemap creation through <a href="https://help.roll20.net/hc/en-us/articles/16979743281943-Getting-Started-with-Dungeon-Scrawl" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dungeon Scrawl</a>.</p>

<p>The Roll20 Demiplane acquisition won't have any immediate impact on users, but Demiplane CEO Peter Romenesko noted that merged companies will look to close the difference between their two platforms very quickly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"What you'll see is a very concentrated effort to bring the distance between each of these different solutions that are now under the Roll20 brand, really start to bring them closer. Both in digital proximity so that all of a sudden you can start to use these things across the whole platform, whether you're playing in person or online....You may not notice [these changes] one by one, but it's something that we're really committed to. In addition, we'll continue to bring out a whole bunch of great games on our platform and find out really unique ways to bring Demiplane into DriveThruRPG and the virtual tabletop."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is unclear at time of writing which game systems will support Demiplane character sheet integration on Roll20. However, it is confirmed this acquisition will allow the support of playtest material for upcoming systems like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-13-playtest-available-now"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>.</p>

<p data-characters="214" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the release of <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em> fast approaching, the development team at Square Enix are doing everything in their power to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-begins-testing-cross-region-data-center-travel-later-this-month/">ease the expected congestion</a> when it comes to logging in around release.</p> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">The latest move is to provide players with more choices for their home world by <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/93750e4b0d6d5a4faf6a00dee199082392f1a754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creating four new worlds</a> on the existing North American Data Center, Dynamis. The DC has been running at half capacity since its launch in 2022, with four worlds, as opposed to the normal eight per DC.</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">The four new worlds will be added on June 11 at 3 a.m. PDT / 6 a.m. EST, bringing the following new worlds live and ready for new or existing players to populate:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Cuchulainn</li> <li>Golem</li> <li>Kraken</li> <li>Rafflesia</li> </ul> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">On top of boosting the capacity of North American servers, the four new worlds will also have completely empty housing districts, which is potentially the most exciting aspect of this news for a lot of people.</p> <h2 id="h-how-housing-works-on-new-worlds-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false">How housing works on ‘new’ worlds in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></h2> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">Let’s face it, getting a house in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> is never easy, even with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-housing-lottery-explained/">Lottery system</a> which was introduced in patch 6.1. However, being an early entrant into a brand new world can significantly boost your chances of getting your dream Eorzean home.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">All of these up for grabs plots will all be subject to the same conditions as any other as part of the Housing Lottery, with wards 1 to 9 being exclusively available to those seeking a base for their FC, while wards 10 to 24 will be reserved for players wanting a private residential oasis.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="722" data-injectable="true">For those who are interested in transferring to one of these new worlds but worried about giving up any property they already own on your current world, don’t fret. If you choose to up sticks, you’ll actually be eligible for a pretty hefty boost in funds. Not only will the full price of the estate you own be fully reimbursed, but you’ll also get 3,000,000 Gil for your willingness to leave your old world behind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="139" data-injectable="false">In the case of apartments, you’ll get the 500,000 Gil that you paid for the apartment back and also a bonus of another 500,000 Gil.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">However, it’s worth noting that if you choose to do this, you’ll need to keep hold of your current property while going through the Home World Transfer process. If you give up the rights to your property before the process is completed, you won’t be eligible to receive any bonuses.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="97" data-injectable="false">On top of these housing perks, there are also some other good reasons to transfer to a new world:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false"> <li>The <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/option_service/world_transfer_service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Home World Transfer Service</a> is free of charge (usually costs $18.00 USD)</li> <li>You’ll receive 10 Gold Chocobo Feathers, which can be exchanged for the following: <ul> <li>Managarm mount (8 feathers)</li> <li>Amber Draught Chocobo (8 feathers)</li> <li>Twintania Neurolink Key (15 feathers)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Double EXP bonus until level 80 is achieved</li> </ul>

<p data-characters="151" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The 2024 World Series of <em>Warzone</em> has officially kicked off, and it didn’t take long for chaos to ensue in the first round of qualifying matches. </p> <p data-characters="581" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><em>Warzon</em>e pro Fifakill posted a clip on <a href="https://x.com/Fifakill_/status/1798024779175543030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> of CHOWH and his teammates getting killed by a loadout drop during a <em>World Series of Warzone</em> EU qualifying match. Despite driving in an LTV, one of the best-armored vehicles in the battle royale, the trio stood no chance against a loadout drop that fell from the sky. Upon driving into the crate, the vehicle blew up and all three players got downed. To add insult to injury, the squad got finished off by an airstrike. CHOWH could do nothing but sit in disbelief as he saw his team fall victim to quite an unfortunate turn of events. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="true">BubbleCT and his trio called in the loadout drop, and he <a href="https://x.com/BubbleCT_/status/1798030870814814539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a>, “Shout out to our loadout, lmao.” Bubble had no intention of using the loadout drop of a weapon, but he certainly won’t apologize, as every kill matters in the <em>World Series of Warzon</em>e. From June 4-12, NA and EU qualifiers take place. Out of the 80 teams for both regions, only 68 will move on based on their performances throughout 15 matches. </p>
 <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="false">That group of 68 is divided even further based on their performance during the qualifying stages, so every game matters. Hence, losing one of those 15 matches like this is unquestionably frustrating. Unfortunately for CHOWH, his trio currently sits in 30th place with 28 points after the first five matches. And that’s before the second group of 40 teams play their first five matches. Luckily there are still 10 matches left, and CHOWH has plenty of time to regroup. </p>

This time, the robots were filling up servers and using their AI skills to destroy human players, making the game almost impossible to play, according to many longtime <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tf2-team-fortress-2-valve-100-players-servers-update-pc-1850684346&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tf2-team-fortress-2-valve-100-players-servers-update-pc-1850684346"><em>TF2</em></a></span><em> </em>fans. Players sent thousands of emails to Valve and outlets like <em>Kotaku </em>and <em>IGN,</em> trying to get attention on the issue. And it worked! Valve, the company behind Steam and <em>Half-Life</em>, acknowledged the bot problem and said it was working on fixing things. That was about two years ago and uh...well, the bots are still here and still making the game hard to play. </p><h2 id="h197952"><a id=""></a>Fans want Valve to save <em>Team Fortress 2</em></h2><p>On June 3, a new fan campaign started up. And like last time, players are trying to get Valve to step in and do something about all the annoying bots. This time, the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://save.tf/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://save.tf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fix TF2" campaign</a></span> is asking for player signatures, which will be delivered to Valve in the future. So far the site has collected over 210,000 signatures and the number keeps climbing. </p><p>“There’s no putting it lightly, <em>Team Fortress 2</em> is in an unacceptable state, and Valve’s apathy in dealing with the issue is nothing short of appalling,” claims a message on the “Fix TF2" site. </p><p>The campaign’s mission statement asks Valve to implement updated anti-cheat measures for the aging <em>TF2</em>, which still makes money every year via microtransactions. The fans also want an open line of communication with Valve about the state of the game and the bot problem.</p><p>As someone who has spent years emailing Valve for comments and answers as part of my job and received very few responses, I wish you all good luck with getting them to communicate more. Speaking of which, <em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Valve about <em>TF2</em>'s bots. </p><p>To help get Valve’s attention, the website is asking fans to share stories, screenshots, and clips of bots in <em>TF2 </em>on social media. It is also asking fans to share the campaign’s website, too. Nowhere on the site does it ask fans to review-bomb <em>TF2</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1798006015205785966&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1798006015205785966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but that’s also happening right now as well</a></span>, likely as a result of angry players wanting to get Valve to do something. </p><p>Valve has yet to officially respond to the campaign as of June 4, 2024. The official <em>TF2 </em>Twitter account’s last tweet was... <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the last time Valve replied</a></span> to fans complaining about bots in 2022. So we shall see if <em>TF2</em>'s second tweet in nearly two years is yet another promise that fixes are coming. Last time that worked to calm fans down. This time...I’m not sure.</p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>I tend to have an indie or two each year that I don't shut up about. Five years ago, Blue Manchu's roguelite strategy-shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/void-bastards/" data-ref-id="5000-489272">Void Bastards</a>, was <em>that</em> game for me. Now, studio Blue Manchu is back with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wild-bastards/" data-ref-id="5000-611497">Wild Bastards</a>, a spiritual successor that retains the sci-fi of the first one but adds a western element to it while expanding and deepening the game's systems. On top of that, the replacement-level characters, who served Void Bastards satirical story well, are swapped out for a Dirty (baker's) Dozen of voiced characters, each of whom has their own personalities and relationships with others in the gang.</p><p>Put it all together, and you have a game that seems, in my admittedly limited sample, to be even better than its excellent predecessor. With the full game due to launch later this year, I caught up with Blue Manchu's creative director Ben Lee to talk about how the team landed on another game in the loose "Bastards" series, what lessons it learned from that first game that made Wild Bastards better off, and where the studio may go from here as it continues to create visually captivating and mechanically complex games.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Wild Bastards Is More Than Just A Void Bastards Western</p>
      </div>
<p><strong>GameSpot: Wild Bastards has a lot of the same DNA as Void Bastards, but it's not a sequel. Can you talk about how this game found its shape in the years since Void Bastards? When did the team decide to develop another game in the same genre?</strong></p><p>Lee: We started pre-production about three months after the release of Void Bastards. We started out with a fairly broad remit, and the game took a long time to fully take shape.</p><p>Wild Bastards is all about playing a myriad of distinct characters, instead of a procession of random prisoners. We put a lot of effort into their unique playstyles, visuals and fully-voiced dialogue as you play through the narrative campaign.</p><p>Wild Bastards certainly has strategy/shooter DNA, but we have focused on much more complex combat encounters this time. The combat spaces are no longer just corridors and rooms, and the strategic factors that tie into each encounter go much deeper. Most importantly, the enemy variety and behaviors are significantly more varied and nuanced than the monsters in Void Bastards.</p><p><strong>Were there any obvious successes you knew would carry over from Void Bastards when you were developing Wild Bastards? On the flipside, were there any lessons VB taught you that you sought to rework or even remove in WB?</strong></p><p>There were plenty of both! The main thing we carried over was probably more on the technical and production side. We didn’t have to completely rethink the way we built the game thanks to all the problem solving we did on Void Bastards.</p><p>Outside of that, we often internally referred to things that we felt did or did not work well in Void Bastards, but we did not think of this game as a Void Bastards variant or sequel. We wanted it to be unshackled from that game as far as our design space went.</p><p>The initial versions of the game did not even have space travel as it is implemented now. It was much more of a huge planetary map exploration thing. But as time went on, we felt that we had more to offer in the strategy hybrid area and we leaned back that way instead of going a more RPG route.</p><p><strong>More broadly, the roguelite/roguelike space is so densely populated--on PC especially. What's it like sharing digital real estate with so many games trying to appeal to similar players?</strong></p><p>There is not quite yet an oversaturation of strategy-shooter hybrid roguelikes as far as we see things. Maybe that will change in future, but for now I think there’s plenty of room for different takes on the games in this loose genre.</p><p><strong>Void Bastards was inspired by BioShock and System Shock 2. What are the main inspirations for Wild Bastards?</strong></p><p>I can only speak on the thematic influences to the look and feel. I was raised by a mother who loved sci-fi and a father who loved westerns. Wild Bastards creative direction was inspired mostly by cinema. Namely the Sergio Leone Dollars trilogy, The Magnificent Seven (1960), Battle Beyond the Stars (1980), MTV’s Liquid Television from the late '90s, Muse’s Knights of Cydonia music video, Suspiria (1977) and Mandy (2018).</p><p><strong>Does Blue Manchu have aspirations beyond games of this size and scope or might you always want to create games such as Void Bastards and Wild Bastards?</strong></p><p>As long as we can make games, we will make games.

Can you talk about why the team leans toward this lighter tone and why you think it works for these games?</strong></p><p>Void Bastards was originally very serious and quite depressing in tone. Midway through the project, we decided to keep it quite dark but approach it from a more comedic angle. Cara and I both have a lot of appreciation for Douglas Adams, Terry Gilliam, and Red Dwarf, so that was what got us to bring her on board to write.</p><p>Wild Bastards was originally supposed to be more serious, but once we began the writing process with our old friend Jerry [Holkin, writer for Void Bastards], his sense of humor naturally worked its way into the fiction and dialogue. None of us complained.</p><p><strong>Did you ever consider moving away from the comic-book art style for Wild Bastards? Why did you end up back with this style in the end?</strong></p><p>The conceptual designs come from the same person (me), but Wild Bastards is actually less directly a comic book than Void Bastards. There is no cover page, no panel borders or visual onomatopoeia sound effects for example. Wild Bastards is more in line with a kind of acid trippy traditional animation as visual style. I would still be keen to return to a more intricate comic book/graphic novel look for a future game, to see how much further we could push it.</p><p><strong>WB's systems feel so intricate and layered. Is there ever a point in development when you must rein it in to avoid overcomplicating the game? How do you know when the game's systems have the right depth without becoming too deep?</strong></p><p>Short answer: Yes. I think all our games are too complicated at some point in development and it’s that editing process of trimming and refining that is so important to arriving at a final experience that feels right.</p><p>We had a lot more playtesting and user feedback on Wild Bastards, which had a much stronger impact on the final game than previous titles. Sometimes it’s the things you take out that have a bigger positive impact than all the stuff you cram in.</p><p><strong>The game features 13 playable gunslingers. I assume others were designed but ultimately left out. What made these characters the ones to make the cut? Do you have any favorites, or any expectations as to who players will gravitate toward?</strong></p><p>Ultimately it was how much fun the outlaw was to play and their place in the overall meta that determined which ones we kept. We started with in-game mockups for each one before going ahead with visual design or dialogue. When drawing the concepts, I had definite favorites, but by the time we had them all playable and voiced, I loved them all equally. That’s not a cop-out answer; it’s more of a testament to the way they developed through writing and recording.</p><p>Playtesters have had a really varied spread of opinions over the most effective or favorite character to use, which is exactly what we wanted to see. Some outlaws seem OP until they run into a particular set of enemies, or useless until certain strategies are discovered. It’s this variety and depth that really sets the game apart from our previous efforts.</p><p><strong>Do you have any post-launch plans for Wild Bastards?</strong></p><p>We are currently full speed ahead on getting the game ready to ship, which requires all of our attention… But check back with us post-launch for answers to that question!</p><hr><p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660840/Wild_Bastards/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist Wild Bastards on Steam</a> before it arrives on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and Switch later this year.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/">Elden Ring's</a> highly anticipated DLC, Shadow Of The Erdtree, is quickly approaching. As we get closer to its June 21 release date, more information about the DLC is beginning to surface, such as how many new bosses lie ahead and how a new feature will allow you to adjust the game’s difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will notice a new menu option called Shadow Realm Blessing whenever they visit a Guidance of Grace. This will serve as a new progression system for their character that will allow them to use the DLC's new powers. It'll even act as a difficulty modifier to ensure players aren't overpowered despite their level. That said, returning characters won't be as strong in the newer areas. So, they'll need to upgrade themselves using Scadutree Blessings.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In addition to all these changes, the Shadow Of The Erdtree will see you take on 10 new bosses. Similar to the base game, not all boss fights are required for you to finish the story. But as of the time of this writing, it's unclear which bosses players will be able to skip.</p><p dir="ltr">Shadow Of The Erdtree is scheduled to drop later this month on June 21.

Upgrade your trusty truck and visit a whole world of new destinations together. Discover fresh fruits and vegetables on each island of the Gustum archipelago, learn their customs, and cook meals that will make someone’s day.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But how does one actually capture an engaging snapshot of what cooking is, and what kinds of challenges and unforeseen complications show up in this neck of the woods? Come along on our journey of designing the cooking system for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fruitbus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It sounds straightforward enough: Forage an apple, cut it into bite-sized chunks, and compose with some kind of intent in a bowl. If you are feeling adventurous, you might even add a sliced banana to the mix. Sprinkle a moving truck on top, and it’s bound to be a memorable experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First of all, who makes a salad with fruit? That’s as obscene as interchanging burger and sandwich.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Second of all, isn’t it a little early to foreshadow in the introduction?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the menu for tonight are wildcards like:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quantum Entanglement! Compositions! Processes! … and Apple Crouton Soup?</span></p><p>Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Early Prototypes">Early Prototypes</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In general, our philosophy was to try to rely as much on physics as we could to provide a solid layer of interactivity with the mechanics.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Cutting">Cutting</h3><p>Dynamic Cutting, lots of pieces. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Frying">Frying</h3><p>Frying up a little piece of Apple. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the earlier stages of the game, we used the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/dynamic-mesh-cutter-208384">Dynamic Mesh Cutter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> plugin, which lets you dynamically cut up objects in runtime. We spliced that together with some basic knife skills and a bit of hand-holding.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, you fry the bits and chunks in the frying pan until their “cookedness” is above a certain threshold; push your luck, and it might get burnt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“You want an apple and ginger smoothie?” Let me scrap together enough chunks and bits of apple and ginger to make sure I meet the demands imposed upon me by the recipe.</span></p><p>Blend the little bits to make a lil smoothie. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stick your pile of chunks into a blender, and voila. You’ve filled a cup one-third of the way with some weird combination of liquids.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Individually any of these prototypes could pass as fun interactions or mechanics. Combine them and, fast-forward, the result is a messy kitchen with the floor full of various bits and chunks of fruit, mysterious liquids, and dubious amounts of state.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How would you represent the taste of a piece of Banana in code? What if the Banana had been fried, boiled and then blended into a liquid, then combined with an apple and ginger smoothie? How many pieces of Banana do you need to contribute to the taste of the dish? How much taste is added by being fried or being burnt? It gets messy and overwhelming quite fast, and it’s so arbitrarily granular.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The old me would have been confused, eagerly plotting out the course for some thin and long pasta shapes. For the new me, it’s simply a fried banana, apple, and ginger smoothie.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the great things that derived from the ideation and prototyping phase we had on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fruitbus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was finding the correct level of zoom or the correct scope for the cooking simulation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>feeling</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of cooking that is important, not the preciseness of the simulation. Thomas, our game director, called it “Hollywood Cooking.” Whenever I think of that phrase, my mouth curls into a grin.</span></p><p>Chili and Garlic Stir Fry. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Food Processing">Food Processing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A pivotal change in approach occurred in late 2022.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One day, Jonas and I conspired to the whiteboard, and some elements started appearing. The general process was mostly talking through the different steps food would have to take to end up in a dish that could be served and evaluated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We thought up a dish that would touch upon as many of the previous systems as possible—a sort of minimum viable dish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But before we get into that, it’s about time we go down a level.</span></p><p>Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Processes.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Verbs that represent the transformations the Food go through. Like Blending or Liquefying.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Appliances</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are the objects that can perform the processes, like a Blender. It requires input to be enabled (Externally, through a button, for example), but after that it can be left to its own devices.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tools</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are processes that can be triggered through Player interaction, like the Knife. It requires repeated input from the Player to perform any action. It also fetches the input directly instead of relying on external systems like an Appliance.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FoodObject</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is our representation of an edible object. A food object usually consists of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Archetype</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or the template: the gold standard banana, the pink-lady standard apple.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>State</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the representation of the Food Object (the apple is sliced and fried).</span><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Visuals,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the visual representation of the FoodObject in its current state.</span></p><p>Ever wondered what an Apple looks like in Fruitbus? Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, lettuce take a little detour into the anatomy of an Apple.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is the data structure that represents food in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fruitbus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which defines the archetypical version of that fruit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using the apple as an example. It’s quite obvious that it Can Be Desired.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It also has a distinct taste, which makes it persist through a multitude of processes, deeming it as Absorbable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And an apple is also Cuttable. Which means that when it is put to the knife, it can transform into a Sliced Apple, or a Fried Apple.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cuttable">Cuttable</h2><p>Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Code for defining what stages a Cuttable object can go through.</span></p><p>On the left, a sliced apple. On the right, diced. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s get back to the minimum viable dish. Here is the recipe to follow.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apple Crouton Soup.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Dice an apple and liquefy it. Bake bread. Cut off a slice. Dice that slice. Bake croutons. Boil the apple, and add the croutons.</span></p><p>Apple Crouton Soup, a staple in every home?! Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p>The minimum viable product of Food ProcessingTM: The Apple Crouton Soup. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The example above touches upon something that I find kind of exciting! Equipped with a handful of processes, we can now create a wide variety of dishes. And most importantly, we can talk about new dishes without having to get bogged down with too much technical jargon. We even had the opportunity to talk through a dish in front of a bouquet of Norwegian developers at Spillkonvent 2023, and it seemed that they could follow along with our excessive blabbering about processes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The work ahead of us now is polishing our selection of dishes, juicing it up, and gradually increasing the possibility space. It’s a matter of adding new processes and making the existing processes and dishes look and feel good.</span></p><p>Apple Smoothie. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That’s a wrap! Or maybe just a tortilla. But in reality, we’re not off the hook just yet.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Interactions and Complications">Interactions and Complications</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cooking in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fruitbus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> touches upon almost any other gameplay mechanic in the game; funnily enough, even driving the truck has implications for cooking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Physicality is another tenet in the realm of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fruitbus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Everyone knows that moving vehicles combined with dynamic objects are bound to produce some funny bugs. We found out quite early on that we needed a way to simulate the interior of the Truck in a sterile environment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Enter Quantum Entanglement*, an idea where we separate the simulation and the visuals. All objects that enter the Truck are entangled, which actually means that we have a physical clone of the object on a flat plane somewhere, where we can do all our physics without worrying about the Truck being flipped upside down or barrelling down the side of a volcano with malicious intent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">*Has nothing to do with actual quantum physics, we just crudely borrowed the concept and it sounds cool.</span></p><p>Chop chop, then compose. Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similar to the Quantum Entanglement, we run the composition simulations elsewhere and then apply them to the Object when things are stable. This approach is actually really cool because we just capture a specific snapshot of the simulation when things are stable and valid.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Apples have, in fact, been composed neatly in the bowl in a place faraway place, where there are no external factors that can mess up the Physics interaction, and the result is then projected and applied onto the bowl in your Truck.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Honorable mentions</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that we don’t have the time to talk about in this round:</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Interactions with the Characters, like holding the object in their hands.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Nesting Quantum Entanglement spaces.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Physical money in blenders.</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">A deeper dive into the Composition system</span></p><p>Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><p>Image via Krillbite Studio.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Something that I rediscovered while writing this article was that the current version of Food Processing would never have existed if we didn’t make the original scuffed prototypes to begin with. And I’m so thankful that we did.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the major reasons Food Processing ended up being a success for us was that we spent almost the same amount of time on pre-production and planning the rework as the time spent on the minimum viable product.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Something else that really worked out in our favor was the trust we got from the lead team. We had time to plan and make our ideas come to fruition. We also got challenged on our ideas, which forced us to solve more unknowns up front, which, in the end, produced a better result.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>For Coders</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: If you have a feeling in the back of your mind that a certain mechanic or system is not performing as intended, have the confidence to challenge the status quo, make a plan, and pitch it to your decision-makers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>For Leads</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The next time two (or any amount for that matter)of your coders cook up an idea to refurbish one of the core mechanics of the game, as long as it’s somewhat coherent it might be worth it to give them the time to prove their ideas. Poke some holes and challenge some of the concepts that seem loose, and you might end up with a version of that mechanic that could end up being a better fit for your game.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/diablo-4-masterworking-guide/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=diablo-4-masterworking-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="249" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Diablo 4’s</em> endgame upgrade system is a little convoluted at first blush. Since most casual players are butting up against The Pit and earning Masterworking materials, let’s do a quick rundown of how it all works and why you should do it.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-masterwork" data-injectable="false">How to Masterwork</h2> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">First thing’s first, you’ll need to have unlocked The Pit and completed at least one Tier 1 run-through. The quest “Pit of the Artificer” appears when you reach World Tier 4, and you can check <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-access-the-pit-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our Pit unlock guide </a>for more details. Once that’s done, head to the Blacksmith to use your earned Obducite to Masterwork your first piece of gear as part of the questline. </p> <p data-characters="85" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">Masterworking requires materials found in the pit, which drop in the following tiers:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li>Rank 1-4: Obducite; drops in Pit tiers 1-30</li> <li>Rank 5-8: Ingolith; drops in Pit tiers 31-60</li> <li>Rank 9-12: Neathiron; drops in Pit tier 61+</li> </ul> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">These materials can be converted into one another at the Alchemist, with higher level materials converting into increased numbers of lower ones (1 Ingolith will convert into 3 Obducite, for examples). Use this to save time if you’re blasting high-tier Pit runs! Just don’t forget to bring along the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-runeshards-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 required Runeshards.</a></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Masterwork upgrades</h2> <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">After this first Masterworking rank, that same item can be upgraded a grand total of 12 times, resulting in the following bonuses:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li>Each rank gives all base affixes a +5% boost</li> <li>Every fourth rank gives one random affix a +25% boost <ul> <li>This +25% boost can be applied three times to one affix, or spread out across multiple over the course of Masterworking</li> </ul> </li> <li>At Masterwork rank 12, you’ll have gained a 45% increase to all base affixes, plus an additional 75% spread across one to three affixes</li> </ul> <h2 data-injectable="false">Masterworking tips</h2> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Masterworking all your 925 item level gear that has Greater Affixes that suit your build is essential to progressing further into The Pit, but you should focus on reaching rank 4 on all pieces, then rank 8, then finally rank 12. Don’t waste time and effort trying to jack a piece up to rank 12 before anything else is upgraded! The power gains in those early ranks spread across multiple pieces of gear will far outweigh a completed one.</p>
 <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">Don’t forget, salvaging a Masterworked item will return all invested materials <em>except</em> those you used to get it to the current rank. So if you salvage a rank 3 item, you’ll get back 30 Obducite, but lose the 30 you used to get it to rank 3. </p> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="false">You can also reset the Masterwork of an item using some materials plus a staggering 5 million gold if you’re unhappy with how the bonus affix boosts pan out, but I’d save that for your tippity-top min-maxing later on. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/why-warzone-players-should-use-the-holger-26-post-dg-58-lsw-nerf/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=why-warzone-players-should-use-the-holger-26-post-dg-58-lsw-nerf<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="259" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Raven Software left no stone unturned after nerfing the DG-58 LSW a second time, taking the LMG out of long-range meta contention in <em>Warzone</em>. Fortunately, the Holger 26 performs closely statistically and could take over as the new king of the battle royale. </p> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">When <em>Modern Warfare 3’s </em>iteration of <em>Warzone </em>launched, the DG-58 LSW was a solid but unforgettable LMG that got outclassed by other class options. Everything changed in Season 3, as the new JAK Nightshade conversion kit transformed the slow and bulky LMG into a versatile AR. It didn’t take long for <em>Warzone</em> players to catch on, forcing Raven Software to respond accordingly. </p> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="726" data-injectable="true">As part of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mcw-jak-raven-kit-takes-over-warzone-meta-after-dg-58-lsw-nerf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 Reloaded update</a>, the DG-58 LSW JAK Nightshade conversion kit had its damage values, max damage range, and headshot multipliers nerfed. Some players suspected this Nerf would knock the LMG out of contention, but the weapon continued to top popularity charts and get used consistently in lobbies and by pro players. </p>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">So, to put down the behemoth once and for all, the DDG-58 LSW got <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-and-warzone-june-4-update-patch-notes-dg-58-lsw-nerf-dna-bomb-fix-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nerfed again</a> as the weapon’s damage values suffered another substantial blow. This time, we don’t expect the LMG to still find much more use after the patch. If players aren’t sure what to use next, look no further than the Holger 26. </p> <h2 id="h-best-holger-26-loadout-in-warzone-season-4" data-injectable="false">Best Holger 26 loadout in <em>Warzone</em> Season 4</h2> <p data-characters="68" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">TrueGameData shared the best possible Holger 26 loadout on <a href="https://x.com/TrueGameData/status/1798031547557396489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>. </p> <figure data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Holger Factory Barrel </li> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>VT-7 Spitfire Suppressor </li> <li><strong>Optic: </strong>JAK Glassless Optic </li> <li><strong>Stock: </strong>Ascent Lord Stick </li> <li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>Bruen Heavy Support Grip </li> </ul> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">TrueGameData tested time-to-kill speeds after the DG-58 LSW nerf and concluded that the Holger 26 and Holger 556 perform better now. From zero to around 35 meters, the Holger 26 has a time-to-kill speed of just over 750 milliseconds. Meanwhile, the DG-58 LSW has the same time-to-kill speed as the Holger 26 up to around 18 meters but falls off massively after.</p>
 <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">In comparison, the Holger 556 leads all three weapons with a 714-millisecond time-to-kill speed up to around 38 meters, but the Holger 26 has a larger magazine, which makes it easier to down multiple enemies at once. The JAK Annihilator Bullpup conversion kit for the Pulemyot 762 and MTZ-762 are also great options, but the Holger 26 has every characteristic of a powerful long-range meta weapon. </p>

<p data-characters="333" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It seems like every few days there’s more news about layoffs hitting video game developers, and today it’s Behaviour Interactive’s turn.&nbsp;The company announced via <a href="https://media.bhvr.com/behaviour-interactive-implements-strategic-changes-for-future-growth">press release</a> its plan to cut up to 95 jobs. The company’s Montreal studio will be hit particularly hard – 70 of the cut employees will be coming from there.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">Up until this year, Behaviour was experiencing some incredible growth. The company’s own press release acknowledges that it’s more than doubled in size over the past years, going from 575 to 1,300 employees. “Over the same period, the greater gaming industry has also witnessed remarkable growth,” the company writes, adding, “However, the industry’s unprecedented popularity has also led to unprecedented competition.”</p>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">According to the press release, these changes are aimed at helping the company focus on its primary goals to “lead in horror, lead in service, and explore the possibilities of location-based entertainment.” To that end, Behaviour says that the restructuring won’t affect its work on <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, which will continue to see regular updates and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/behaviour-interactive-teases-dungeons-dragons-coming-to-dead-by-daylight/">franchise crossovers</a>.</p> <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="923" data-injectable="false">At this point it seems almost unnecessary to point out that this is just the latest in a string of layoffs that’s been snaking through the industry since before the start of the year. Companies like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-lays-off-1900-employees-from-activision-blizzard-and-xbox/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-announces-its-cutting-about-900-jobs-closing-london-studio/">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/unity-to-lay-off-25-of-its-workforce/">Unity</a> – to name just a few – have all been hit, and the total number of jobs lost in 2024 alone is already reaching <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/around-9000-video-game-jobs-were-lost-in-2023-estimates-say/">2023’s depressing 9,000</a>. This restructuring from Behaviour may seem like small change in comparison, but every job lost is a life disrupted, and seeing all these losses piled together is staggering.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bad-boys-ride-or-die-has-a-troubling-case-of-franchise-cancer.889704/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24171554/bad-boys-ride-or-die-review-will-smith-martin-lawrence<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="sBtk4Z">Cancer is often described in layman’s terms as the body’s cells performing their function, just without any of the biological checks and balances that keep them from interfering with or overtaking one another. I’ve found it a useful metaphor for franchise cinema lately, and what can happen when it goes wrong: A film’s franchise elements metastasize and overtake a movie, trying to reinforce intellectual property at every turn, refusing to let a scene go by without some kind of callback, meta joke, or attempt to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pubd-spHN-0">make fetch happen</a>. </p>
<p id="g5rTz9"><em>Bad Boys: Ride or Die</em>, the fourth in the series of buddy-cop movies Michael Bay originated in 1995, seems like an unlikely victim of franchise cancer. The pleasure of a Bad Boys movie — as much as that can be discerned from a film series with a decade or more between previous entries — mostly comes from watching its two uniquely gifted comedic leads, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, engaging in antics under the direction of some of cinema’s foremost explosion-lovers. But in <em>Ride or Die</em>, the joys of Smith and Lawrence’s characters getting on each other’s nerves during improbably explosive shootouts is constantly derailed, as the script workshops or retcons every previous element from prior movies into the grand scheme of this one. </p>
<p id="vHvDim"><em>Bad Boys for Life</em>’s Belgian directing duo, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23160356/ms-marvel-directors-interview-avengercon">Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah</a> (<em>Ms. Marvel</em>) return for <em>Ride or Die</em>, which immediately follows the previous film. Detectives Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) are still trigger-happy Miami narcotics cops who play by their own rules. But they’ve got more backing these days, from AMMO support-squad members Kelly and Dorn (returning cast members Vanessa Hudgens and Alexander Ludwig), and their immediate boss, Lt. Rita Secada (Paola Núñez). They also get lots of reminders to slow down. Mike, the looser of the two loose cannons, is finally settling down and getting married, while Marcus has a near-death experience that has everyone telling him to diet and chill out. Unfortunately, it just makes him think he’s invincible. </p>

<p id="WOU5eB">This time around, the partners discover a conspiracy to tarnish the reputation of their late captain, Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano), who died in <em>Bad Boys for Life</em>. In their efforts to clear their former boss’s name, the two are framed as co-conspirators and must go on the run. It is perhaps the first, and most aggravating, failing of <em>Ride or Die</em> that nearly an hour of the movie’s 115-minute run time elapses before this — the central premise of the film! — actually happens. The second is all the aforementioned franchise cancer.</p>
<p id="oCLvmE"><em>Ride or Die</em> does not pass up a single opportunity to underline that this is a Bad Boys movie full of Bad Boys things. That conspiracy to frame Capt. Conrad? It’s tied to the case at the center of <em>Bad Boys II</em>. A vital clue for who’s behind it comes from Fletcher (John Salley), who you likely won’t recognize unless you’ve recently seen the first two films. “Bad Boys,” the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd68AthoNIw">1987 Inner Circle hit</a> made famous by the TV show <em>Cops</em> and adopted as the movie franchise’s theme song? You’ll hear no less than three versions of it. What’s more, Mike and Marcus sing it <em>twice</em>, and people constantly call them “the Bad Boys” as if they are the X-Men. </p>
<p id="5ol9ez">All of which makes <em>Ride or Die</em> feel like a less successful version of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/4/3/8325549/fast-and-furious-timeline"><em>Fast Five</em></a>. That film took what was at the time a series of four tonally distinct, loosely connected <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23720463/fast-furious-watch-order-movies-timeline-streaming">Fast &amp; Furious films</a> and willed them into a coherent franchise with some timeline shenanigans and heaps of charisma. The Bad Boys movies, however, do not have as much raw material to fashion into a modern engine of perpetual cinema. They have Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, and one very good callback involving Marcus’ son-in-law, Reggie (Dennis Greene). That’s about it. </p>

<p id="gTiBy4">Most of the fault can arguably be laid at the feet of Chris Bremner and Will Beall’s script, which is poorly paced and chock-full of clichés. (It’s kind of hard to keep your composure when Joe Pantoliano, in a pitch-perfect imitation of Princess Leia Organa, leaves the Bad Boys a recorded message calling them “my only hope.”) Smith and Lawrence gamely deliver some pretty terrible jokes, and the supporting cast that returns from <em>Bad Boys for Life</em> is sturdy enough for government work, even while working with such uninspired material. </p>
<p id="QENysQ">El Arbi and Fallah’s direction is the brightest aspect of <em>Ride or Die</em>. The pair has leveled up since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/15/21067187/bad-boys-for-life-review-will-smith-martin-lawrence"><em>Bad Boys for Life</em></a>, showing themselves as eager students of Bayhem, happy to deploy camera work as exciting as the shootouts it captures. Frenetic drone shots zoom through gunfire, cameras pivot over the barrel of a gun, and nothing ever, ever stays still. It’s a bit overwhelming: Restrained compared to Bay in their previous effort, they overreach a bit here. Their action shines brightest when it features someone capable of believably kicking ass on screen, like Jacob Scipio, returning as Mike Lowrey’s long-lost son from <em>Bad Boys for Life</em>.</p>
<p id="ytC4MO">However, the over-the-top shenanigans are all in the service of retrofitting a sprawling franchise over a handful of movies that were never really about strong narrative ties. This is all the more frustrating given the few moments that <em>do</em> get what the Bad Boys movies are about. Like, for example, the third-act shootout where Mike is at his lowest, and it’s on Marcus to motivate him — by shouting the lyrics of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd5gFx001qg">Run-DMC’s “Peter Piper”</a> at him. </p>
<p id="1jxBRC">This is the Bad Boys franchise operating as it should. It doesn’t need constant callbacks building out an elaborate mythology. It just needs two charismatic guys dishing out jokes of varying quality. It needs an irresponsible amount of gunfire. And it needs hell-yeah moments like this one, where Martin Lawrence yells that he needs a “big bad wolf in the neighborhood,” and the audience can yell “Not bad meaning BAD, but bad meaning GOOD” right back. </p>

<p data-characters="136" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The 91+ TOTS Player Pick SBC is an excellent challenge to complete for any <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team fan, as it guarantees a special card. </p> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">Moreover, the pool of cards only includes the very best items, as all of those with a rating of 90 or lower have been discarded. Moreover, the SBC also offers a pick, so you can choose one from multiple options (allowing you better chances at packing one of the more valuable items). </p> <h2 id="h-ea-fc-24-91-tots-player-pick-sbc-tasks" data-injectable="false">EA FC 24 91+ TOTS Player Pick SBC tasks</h2> <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">Since the potential to pack something is pretty high, EA Sports has included two tasks. The conditions of both the tasks are different, and the second one is more challenging. </p>
 <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="29" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – 85-Rated Squad</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="109" data-injectable="false"> <li>Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW</li> <li>Min.

Team Rating: 87</li> </ul> <p data-characters="148" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">You’ll need to use at least one TOTS or TOTW item, and I would recommend to go for the latter unless there’s a dupe TOTS item in stock. </p> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-ea-fc-24-91-tots-player-pick-sbc-cheapest-solutions" data-injectable="false">EA FC 24 91+ TOTS Player Pick SBC cheapest solutions</h2> <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="116" data-injectable="false">If you opt for the cheapest solution, it will save in-game resources for other SBCs like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-ultimate-team-thiago-silva-end-of-an-era-sbc-tasks-solutions/">Thiago Silva End of an Era</a>.</p> <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="145" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – 85-Rated Squad</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true"> <li>Dani Parejo 86</li> <li>Cristiana Girelli 86</li> <li>Bella Bixby 84</li> <li>Nacho Fernandez 83</li> <li>Merle Frohms 85</li> <li>Koke 84</li> <li>Dabritz 84</li> <li>Alex Grimaldo 84</li> <li>Koen Casteels 84</li> <li>Wilfried Zaha TOTW 86</li> <li>Romelu Lukaku 84</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="29" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 2 – 87-Rated Squad</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true"> <li>Fabinho 84</li> <li>Wendie Renard 88</li> <li>Bernardo Silva 88</li> <li>Koen Casteels 84</li> <li>Bruno Fernandes 88</li> <li>Christina Endler 88</li> <li>Alexandra Popp 88</li> <li>Stanislav Lobotka 84</li> <li>Lena Oberdorf 87</li> <li>Martin Odegaard 87</li> <li>Laura Freigang 83</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">Once again, the value of completing the 91+ TOTS Player Pick SBC completely depends on luck. While the 91+ rating includes the best possible TOTS items, it also includes many cheap fodder-grade cards. Moreover, this SBC can also offer the older TOTS team items which were released earlier in <em>EA FC 24</em>. </p> <p data-characters="135" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="false">This challenge is worth trying for those who have lot of duplicate fodder and want to gamble at getting one from the best TOTS players.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/splodey-review-precision-platformer-based-on-explosive-momentum</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splodey-review-a-precision-platformer-based-on-explosive-momentum.889683/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/splodey-review-precision-platformer-based-on-explosive-momentum<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Platformers are where many gamers got their start - <em>Mario, Crash Bandicoot, LittleBigPlanet, Lucky </em>- the list goes on. Graduating from that to the precision platformers like <em>Super Meat Boy</em> is the next step. <em>Splodey </em>from Send It Studios takes this a step further by creating a precision platformer with no jump button.</p>

<p>In <em>Splodey </em>the player takes on the role of a wizard with exploding potions. Traversing around normally the wizard has a pretty slow movement, and as I stated above, they can't jump. How the wizard gets around this though is by using their exploding potions to propel them.</p>

<p>Starting in a hub space the first challenge you'll face is trying to reach the first batch of levels…</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splodey-level-select.jpg?itok=zZ8LzAqD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splodey-level-select.jpg?itok=AeUdmQf1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once you unlock further worlds it's a platforming challenge to even reach them</figcaption></figure><h2>Reverse Momentum Pixel Platforming</h2>

<p>When I first heard of this game I was very interested in the idea of a "platformer without a jump button", after seeing some gameplay I thought it might play a bit like <em>No Time To Explain</em> but it is so much harder.</p>

<p>Unlike <em>No Time To Explain</em>, where at any point you can alter the trajectory of the gun that is pushing the player character the momentum of the wizard in <em>Splodey </em>is wholly dependent on the trajectory of your initial explosion.</p>

<p>If you want to fly high then you'll need to aim directly down, if you want to cross a great distance then you need to fire a potion at a very flat angle, or be against a wall. Once in the air firing another potion will do nothing to affect your flight path.</p>



<p>This is a tough movement style to learn, controller is definitely recommended, but as you are forced to chain jumps, and added momentum there are so many satisfying levels that you'll complete and watch the replay in awe of your own prowess.</p>

<h2>Beat Levels, Unlock Worlds, Obtain New Challenges</h2>

<p>The core gameplay is completing each individual level by reaching the portal at the end. In the beginning, the hurdles you face are just ledges and pits, forcing you to precisely make your way over or past them, but as you continue between the different worlds different obstacles will begin to appear.</p>

<p>Just when you start to feel you've gotten the hang of spikes a new world will introduce repeating turrets firing out arrows, or blocks that you can only stand on for a certain amount of time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splodey-falling-level.jpg?itok=Z7v6XDf8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splodey-falling-level.jpg?itok=S9oX0F_M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some levels have you attempting to reach floors past what you can normally see</figcaption></figure><p>Playing this game was a constant uphill struggle, just when I felt I had started to understand a mechanic or had gotten good at precisely throwing a potion while parachuting so I didn't hit spikes the game would immediately put me in my place.</p>

<p>Lengths of levels were something that did begin to get on my nerves. As each level is so bite-sized it's understandable you could get through them in seconds before moving on. I found a lot of the levels would have a gimmick or plan to it but then would add one more step or two to the end that would make things especially frustrating.</p>

<p>One of the best examples of this is a room with low ceilings and arrows that you need to get through with short hops. To get through one corridor would be easy, two or three a bit more of a pain, but having to get through five corridors like this felt like a bit much.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splodey-momentum-level.jpg?itok=R_oQ8VJf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splodey-momentum-level.jpg?itok=s0Ey-rtE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maintain momentum and make precise jumps through portals to launch yourself through portals</figcaption></figure><p>That being said, those levels where the gimmick requires just that bit more perfection will be the ones that gamers looking for a difficult platformer will really eat up.</p>

<h2>Extra Challenge On Top Of Your Challenge</h2>

<p>While playing there are also Souls in the shapes of flying skulls for you to collect (normally in hard-to-reach places), gold coins that can be earned by completing levels in a certain time frame, and hidden bonus levels that turn the challenge up to eleven.</p>

<p>The two collectibles contribute to new character skins and potion colors respectively but don't alter gameplay, those challenge levels are not for the faint of heart.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splodey-soul-level.jpg?itok=MfQjEIb2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splodey-soul-level.jpg?itok=XD3VHA00 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Souls will have you put yourself in danger, or even force you to backtrack through the level to claim</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Splodey </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I'm a fan of a lot of precision platformers, like <em>Super Meat Boy </em>or <em>Celeste</em>, but the core mechanic of directed explosions to jump was a lot to wrap my head around. <em>Splodey </em>does a great job of taking something we have seen before but to a whole new level and if you're a fan of tough platformers this is one you should be looking into.</p>

<p>While the levels themselves are challenging, and sometimes a bit too long, done successfully it's a fast process. This lends the game to a pick-up-and-put-down kind of gameplay style, which is great for when you get a bit too fed up with a game and need to put it down for a bit.</p>

<hr><p><strong><em>Splodey&nbsp;</em></strong><em>was reviewed on PC via Steam, using a copy provided by the developer over the course of 5 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

                <p>
                            Splodey does a good job of creating a unique twist on the Precision Platformer genre and, while I do think smaller individual challenges would be better, those who are into the genre will likely enjoy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24171548/7th-citadel-kickstarter-solo-cooperative-adventure-release-date-price<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="LHOB9E">Given the nature of the work that I do here as Polygon’s tabletop editor, I end up playing an awful lot of board games by myself. Not board games that you <em>should</em> play by yourself, mind you. Instead of luxuriating with the cardboard equivalent of the Times’ Sunday crossword, I look more like <a href="https://youtu.be/SdGlrC0oL_A">Bugs Bunny playing baseball</a>. That’s why I’m excited to get my hands on <em>The 7th Citadel</em>, among the best modern solo board games. It’s also pretty great as a cooperative experience.</p>
<p id="xjYlmI">Published by <a href="https://shop.seriouspoulp.com/us/">Serious Poulp</a>, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/return-to-the-7th-citadel-explore-build-you-are-the-hero"><em>The 7th Citadel</em></a> is the descendant of <a href="https://shop.seriouspoulp.com/us/games-in-english/78-core-box-english-3760212172618.html"><em>The 7th Continent</em></a>, a Cthulhu-inspired board game that made waves back in 2015 with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/the-7th-continent-explore-survive-you-are-the-hero">a €1.2 million campaign</a>. That one I’ve played quite a lot, and I admire its depth and complexity. Players take on the role of explorers who must use their survival skills to prevail against otherworldly odds. But the game itself is just a big box of numbered cards. The system, inspired by <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> books<em>, </em>uses those numbered cards — nearly 850 of them in the base game — to tell an elaborate story. Then, at the end of the adventure, you end up with a table covered in a charming isometric map made from the cards you’ve drawn.</p>
<p id="I9Lrus">Not only does the game work exceedingly well as a solo experience, I’ve also played it more or less hot-seat with other members of my family. While I have the attention level to see it through to the end, I’ll often be joined at several points along the way by other explorers. It’s a delight. </p>
<p id="rgvDP5">Meanwhile, Serious Poulp kept on publishing. It blew the doors of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/the-7th-continent-what-goes-up-must-come-down">its next campaign in 2018</a>, which included a reprint and a big expansion. All told, it earned <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/2/16842204/tabletop-games-are-exploding-on-kickstarter-video-games-are-flat">over $7 million dollars</a>. That effort was later followed up, in 2020, with <em>The 7th Citadel</em>, a dark medieval-inspired tale with nearly identical mechanics. That one pulled in more than €3.2 million.</p>

<p id="VDahu8">Now the design team of Ludovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter are back for another reprint. This one includes <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/return-to-the-7th-citadel-explore-build-you-are-the-hero">a lavish new version of <em>The 7th Citadel</em></a><em> </em>and, like the reprint campaign for <em>The 7th Continent</em> from 2018, also includes a hefty expansion, as well as the promise of more stretch goals as the campaign progresses.</p>
<p id="hG68bl">Here’s a bit from the press release about how it differs from its forebears:</p>
<blockquote><p id="tskAOX"><em>The 7th Citadel</em> differentiates itself from its predecessor by bringing lots of new elements to the table. First of all, it has its own original universe to explore: <em>The 7th Citadel</em>’s story takes place in a post-apocalyptic medieval world called “The Collapsing Lands”. Players will step into a dark world filled with mysterious Necrodruids, monstrous plants, and the even more dangerous Burrowers, in a fight for survival spanning multiple adventures called Threats. In terms of mechanics, <em>The 7th Citadel</em> offers exciting new additions such as an evolving world map, customizable Action decks, the possibility for players to develop their own Citadel between scenarios, and much more.</p></blockquote>
<p id="CnbrTA">While I may not pony up for the campaign myself, it’s certainly on my radar once it hits retail. But if you’d like to get yours sooner, move fast. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seriouspoulp/return-to-the-7th-citadel-explore-build-you-are-the-hero/description">The campaign</a> only runs from today until June 19. Copies start at about $54, with delivery expected by Nov. 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-war-for-arrakis-board-game-review.889668/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-war-for-arrakis-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>If there’s a sci-fi equivalent to the fantasy cultural juggernaut that is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-books-reading-order">Lord of the Rings</a>, then it’s Frank Herbert’s Dune. So it’s perhaps surprising that the same design team of Marco Maggi and Francesco Nepitello are responsible for big strategy <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war board games</a> on both subjects. Their Tolkien game, 2004’s War of the Ring, is a widely recognised classic, marrying asymmetric maneuver warfare with the rich narrative possibilities of the novel. </p><div id="201625"><p><h3>Dune: War for Arrakis</h3></p></div><p>Now they’re hoping to repeat the same acclaim using some of the same mechanics in Dune: War for Arrakis, as the houses Harkonnen and Atreides fight for control of the desert planet.</p><h2>What’s in the Box</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/20240527-185634-1717526165653.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>As a CMON game, one of the big draws in this big box is the big selection of miniatures, and Dune: War for Arrakis doesn’t disappoint. There are three trays of figures, which range from generic and elite soldiers for both sides in multiple sculpts, to detailed miniatures of all the main characters from Dune, including Paul Atreides and Baron Harkonnen. There are also some big, chunky miniatures of vehicles like harvesters and carryalls, and bigger, chunkier miniatures of the famous sandworms that infest the desert planet.</p><p>While the figures are the main draw here, production values are high across the contents of the box. The board, depicting the inhabited areas of the titular planet and the deeper desert regions around it, comes in two full-sized halves to match the epic scale of the action, lavished with artwork that makes the most of the beige hues that are enforced by the desert geography. There’s a sheet of good quality cardboard tokens to punch, a big bag of custom dice and several decks of glossy cards.</p><p>For such a visual feast it is, perhaps, surprising that beyond the board the art is pretty sparse. Most of the cards are bare, while the character cards have ink sketches of their subjects rather than full color. There are also some player boards to help each player track their game state, and these are surprisingly flimsy, especially given the full-on production treatment on show elsewhere. However, even these minor let-downs are perfectly functional and clear, attractive graphic design makes up for the lack of card art.</p><h2>Rules and How It Plays</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/20240527-105750-1717526327106.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Like the designer’s other best-known titles, this uses an action <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dice-rolling-board-games">dice game</a> system. Both sides get a handful of these dice to roll, four for the Atreides and eight for the Harkonnen, and the faces that come up indicate what actions you can take. Most are fairly self-explanatory: strategy and leadership both let you move and attack with your forces, under slightly different circumstances, while deployment lets you add troops to the board, and Mentat actions let you draw cards. If you have named leaders—characters from the franchise—in play then their cards tend to power up these basic actions, giving you more options.</p><p>It’s a great system, so much so that it’s surprising it’s not been copied more by other designers. The actions you roll are critical, so that initial spill of dice across the board is heart-stopping. But whether you get what you wanted or not, there’s a lot of creative strategy involved in trying to make the best of what fortune has given you. You way want to deploy before you attack, for example, or if you’re short on military options, perhaps fishing for cards might give you what you need. Every choice has a knock-on effect, every strategy needs to be flexible to cope with the whims of fate, and every time one player spends a die, their opponent will need to reconsider their choices on the fly. It’s brilliant.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/20240527-105056-1717526534736.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Whatever you choose, your picks then feed into the second layer of this interesting meat-grinder. Like most of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a>, Dune: War for Arrakis gives both players competing priorities and not enough troops or actions to cover them all. The Harkonnen have a very clear military and action advantage but, to maintain it, they must harvest and deliver spice else the Emperor will withdraw support in the form of locking up some action dice. Those deliveries are very vulnerable to raids by the Atreides troops, which, while fewer, can survive in the deep desert. But to win, rather than just survive, the Harkonnen player must find and destroy enemy settlements hidden in the desert, while their opponent needs to fulfil missions that vary each turn and find the ecological testing stations that dot the board.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>At around two hours for a game, it’s long enough to feel epic, but not too long to tax your patience or your free time.</p></div><p>So, for both sides, when you attack, you inevitably leave yourself short on defence. Choosing the balance is central to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a> and tactics of the game, and boils down to how well you use your cards, troops and action dice, and read the situation on the board. Initially, the Harkonnen player seems incredibly dominant starting with more troops, ornithopters to move them, and having unlimited reinforcements compared to a paltry eight deployment actions over the entire game for their opponents. </p><p>Combat is dice based and this random, but a lack of combat effects in the card decks means weight of numbers usually tells. While this can feel repetitive, it aids in planning strategy, and the Harkonnen will likely steamroll over the first few settlements very fast. But their flow of spice, and with it their access to dice, will stutter, and their troops will suffer if left exposed in the desert. Then the Atreides can start to make use of their much more flexible arsenal, including command of the giant sandworms, and turn the tide.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/20240527-103958-1717527153575.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Not that that prolongs the action past its welcome. Games like this, with fairly complex rules, narrative aspirations, and bags of miniatures, have a reputation for playing long, but Dune: War for Arrakis is a very welcome change in that regard. At around two hours for a game, it’s long enough to feel epic, but not too long to tax your patience or your free time. There might even be time to swap sides and re-rack for a rematch. It’s secret here is simply the rapid manner in which players accrue victory points. </p><p>Each settlement has a secret value between one and three, and the Harkonnens need just ten to win. Meanwhile, the Atreides have a secret win condition based on three different victory pools and their missions, too, will be scoring on every turn. The hidden aspects of both ensure there’s a tense finish to every game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/20240527-140322-1717528194068.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Despite the detailed miniatures and thematic trappings, narrative is one area where the game falls down. Yes, the spice and the worms and other iconic trappings of the franchise are all here, but this is very much a wargames, and there’s little sign of the politics and treachery that characterize the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-books-in-order">novel series</a>, let alone its explorations of ecology, gender dynamics and other issues. It’s also notable that very little coherent story emerges from the play, besides the obvious one about the cut and thrust of powerful attacks and heroic defences. This might all sound a tall order for a game, and it is, but this design team managed to tick all those boxes against the source material of their previous effort, War of the Ring.</p><h2>Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Jdp1e" target="_blank">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/8B4ed" target="_blank">Get it at Asmodee Store</a></li></ul></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 4, 2024 7:08 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Comparisons to War of the Ring are going to be inevitable and, in truth, Dune: War for Arrakis has neither the strategic nor narrative richness of that game. But it takes half the time to play and is less complex while hitting many of the same mechanical highs, so it’s very much a trade-off. Gamers who want more deterministic strategy may also be put off by the number of dice involved, but that action dice system gives the game a rare combination of dynamism and strategic heft as you’re forced to roll with the punches. If you have the time, and the considerable asking price, this is a great head-to-head conflict game that gives players a taste of much heavier wargames in a reasonably approachable package.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In January, Behaviour <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-behaviour-interactive-lays-off-45-employees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laid off 45 individuals from its Montreal office</a>, citing "changing market conditions." </p><p>However, Behaviour has also been on a bit of a spending spree of late. Just this past March, it <a href="https://www.bhvr.com/behaviour-interactive-acquires-montreals-fly-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired Fly Studio</a> in Montreal. In 2023, the company acquired both <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/behaviour-interactive-acquires-sockmonkey-studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SockMoney Studios</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/behaviour-interactive-snaps-up-codeglue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codeglue</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/behaviour-interactive-forms-new-uk-studio-with-former-antimatter-games-staff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spun up a new studio</a> in Cornwall. And before that in 2022, Behaviour <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/behaviour-interactive-is-acquiring-midwinter-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquired Midwinter Entertainment</a>, and opened a <a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/news/behaviour-interactive-toronto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new office in Toronto</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Behaviour has stated that the development of Dead by Daylight will not be impacted by the layoffs. Just yesterday, Dead by Daylight got its <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dead-by-daylight-official-dungeons-dragons-chapter-launch-trailer">official Dungeons &amp; Dragons chapter release</a>.</p><p>This continues an ongoing trend of industry layoffs that's been steady for nearly two years, resulting in over 10,000 individuals losing their jobs in 2023, and an additional 10,000 layoffs in just the first half of this year. Though largely attributed to pandemic overspending, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-never-seen-it-this-bad-game-developers-explain-the-huge-layoffs-hitting-riot-epic-and-more">developers say the reasons are far more varied and complex</a>, and have a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-developers-mass-layoffs-human-impact-sony-ea">dramatic and painful impact on individuals</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p data-characters="270" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There was little doubt that <em>Kaiju No. 8 </em>was going to be a talked-about show when it debuted this season. It’s got a little bit of everything: action, comedy, creature design, and originality. But having those qualities and doing them well are two different things.</p> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">Keeping the monster-mashing action and honestly surprising comedic moments in balance <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kaiju-no-8-is-the-feel-good-monster-mash-we-need-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can be tricky</a>, especially for the voice actors lending their talents to these characters. So when I was invited to sit down with three actors behind three leads in <em>Kaiju No. 8</em>, I wanted to explore how they manage those tonal contrasts.</p> <figure data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Kaiju No.8 | DUB TRAILER" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsAKMsUjaK0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">As it turns out, the dynamics are part of the fun. Actors <a href="https://x.com/NazeehTarsha" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nazeeh Tarsha</a> (Kafka Hibino/Kaiju No. 8), <a href="https://x.com/askforabigail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abigail Blythe</a> (Kikoru Shinomiya), and <a href="https://x.com/ninjamac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam McArthur</a> (Reno Ichikawa) all bring something of their own to their roles, and a recurring notion was the range of depth and emotion they get to explore. Here’s our full conversation with the cast.</p> <p data-characters="48" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false"><strong>How did you first get introduced to <em>Kaiju No. 8</em>?</strong></p> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="852" data-injectable="true"><strong>Nazeeh Tarsha </strong>(Kafka Hibino/Kaiju No. 8): “My introduction was through various friends that have consumed the original run. I mean, still ongoing, of course. But you know, every so often you hear someone say, ‘Man, this. This manga is like, so awesome.’ And it’s like, oh, okay, cool. Like, maybe I’ll like, check it out every now and then. And then the reintroduction came when, you know, the audition came for the show.”</p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true"><strong>Abigail Blythe </strong>(Kikoru Shinomiya): “Yeah, same here. I had seen some people talking about it online, some voice acting friends, of how they were so excited for the adaptation. And I was like, ‘Oh, yeah, that’s gonna be a thing.’ And then I read the first five chapters for the audition, and then I got a feel for the project, and I became really excited. I thought it was really cool.”</p>
 <p data-characters="527" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true"><strong>Adam McArthur </strong>(Reno Ichikawa): “Yeah, it’s always, I think, it’s like our job as actors to kind of keep an eye out for things that are kind of coming down the line, and things that might be a good fit for us, audition-wise and stuff like that. So yeah, it was kind of the same thing. Alejandro Saab, who voices Kaiju No. 9, is a massive fan of <em>Kaiju No. 8</em> and I think he’s the one who I first realized was talking a lot about this series, and all that stuff. So learned kind of about it from him, really.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>© JAKDF 3rd Division © Naoya Matsumoto/SHUEISHA</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="137" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true"><strong>What have y’all enjoyed the most about working on this project? What has stuck out to you the most about <em>Kaiju No. 8</em>, specifically?</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true"><strong>Abigail: </strong>“Well, considering this is like my first lead, getting to explore all of the parts of her character development on-screen, I get to – since she has more screen time – I get to play the softer moments, the more comedic moments, her in action, and get to just explore all of these ranges, which is just such a treat for an actor. So that’s been most exciting for me, and just a dream come true, getting to play the entirety of like, emotional depth of a character is just, it’s so exciting.”</p>
 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true"><strong>Adam: </strong>“Yeah, I think for me, it’s just like, it has everything. Everything from amazing animation and character design, amazing music, amazing characters. It’s got a lot of like, action, but it also has a lot of humor. It’s just been, like, refreshing to see sort of like, a new shonen take. Yeah, like a new take on the genre. And, yeah, it has something for everybody. I think that’s kind of like my favorite part.”</p>
 <p data-characters="489" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true"><strong>Nazeeh: </strong>“For me, it’s the amount of heart that exists within the production on all aspects, you know, Between the writing, between the original Japanese performances, between the English direction, the castmates, the amount of passion that’s going around in all aspects in order to bring the story, I think, is one that makes it truly a delight to work on. Because it’s not something that’s inherently available within every production that we work on.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>© JAKDF 3rd Division © Naoya Matsumoto/SHUEISHA</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="721" data-injectable="true"><strong>I find that <em>Kaiju No. 8</em> has a distinct amount of comedy to it, for an action series – what you would normally consider like, a more-traditional action series – but it has a lot of comedy to it. Everyone I talk to is like, wow, it’s funnier than I thought it would be. Do you find that balancing the action and comedy is difficult, or is it easy for y’all to kind of switch between those two vibes?</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="892" data-current-count="892" data-injectable="true"><strong>Nazeeh: </strong>“Every time I get in the booth, it’s always a countdown timer of how many seconds before I immediately have to start screaming or shrieking or go into some sort of tonal whiplash. And it doesn’t last more than that. It’s always like, two lines in, here we go. Um, balancing it is definitely a little bit of a challenge, but you kind of learn to navigate it, especially thanks to our director, Shawn Gann, who does a fantastic job of sort of breaking the scenes down for us, letting us kind of experience them. And then separating the beats and the tonal shifts so that, you know, we kind of segment it a little bit, so that it’s a little easier to tackle. But there are times where it’s… there’s nothing you can do, you are going from a hardcore kaiju punch to all of a sudden, comedic nipple peeing. Like, it is what it is. [<em>laughs</em>]”</p>
 <p data-characters="986" data-current-count="986" data-injectable="true"><strong>Adam: </strong>“Yeah, I think that I think that a lot of that, like tonal like that the vast range and tone is sort of an anime specific, you know, it’s specific to the anime, to anime genre, you know. Any anime kind of has stuff like that. So I think we’ve all, you know, been in the genre long enough and been working on things to kind of understand at least, conceptually, what that’s going to require of us as voice actors when we’re in the booth. But then there’s the technical side of it when you’re in there. And like Nazeeh said, like, our director Shawn will break things down where you know, if it’s too fast, or you’re going from like, you know, screaming like you’re blocking bullets with your voice to a thought filter, where basically like, your character’s monologuing but it’s all inside their head, he’ll break it down so you can take it in chunks. And the power of editing makes us all sound amazing.”</p>
 <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true"><strong>Abigail: </strong>“Exactly. I mean, it’s definitely a workout for your larynx. It’s going up and down all the time. But Shawn is great at navigating it. And I think also just the nature of ADR, as we are like dubbing actors, we have grown to be highly adaptable to any circumstance that is thrown at us because we are acting on the fly constantly. And we, everything that we do is very much like cold-reading and improv, so we have been adapted to be ready for circumstances like this.”</p>
 <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false"><strong>Adam: </strong>“Yeah, and I would actually just like to take one quick second to point out Abigail’s correct use of ‘larynx.’ I always thought the word was ‘lair-nyx.’ So I just thought, that like, seamlessly rolled off your tongue and I thought that that was amazing. And it speaks to your skills as an actor. [<em>laughs</em>]”</p> <p data-characters="136" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true"><strong>Abigail: </strong>“Well, I was a vocal performance, I studied music for four years in school, so you have to take vocal anatomy classes.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>© JAKDF 3rd Division © Naoya Matsumoto/SHUEISHA</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true"><strong>When it comes to your individual characters, what did you find that you vibe with in your specific characters? Do you have a particular favorite aspect about playing your character?</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="689" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true"><strong>Nazeeh: </strong>“I absolutely adore every aspect of Kafka. I’ve said this time and time again, he is just like, the embodiment of the human condition. He’s got the comedy that comes into play, the sort of goofiness of his personality, with a person having fun. He has the tone of a person who kind of has life experience, and kind of got into complacency, then had renewed aspirations, and just kind of goes through the entire spectrum of human emotions. And more than anything else, he’s also loyal to a tee, as exhibited by how often he tries to protect everyone. So yeah, I don’t think there’s a single aspect about Kafka that I don’t vibe with.”</p>
 <p data-characters="704" data-current-count="704" data-injectable="true"><strong>Abigail: </strong>“On the same level, Kikoru is actually, the more that I delve into her character, I noticed that she was a lot – I was a lot like her. Like, perfectionist, hard to relax, doesn’t always work well with others in a team aspect because you’re always thinking like, ‘I have to make sure that everything comes out perfect.’ I had those troubles growing up, not so much now because I’ve grown, but when I was her age, definitely. Emotionally withdrawn, very guarded. A lot of those qualities, I relate a lot to myself. So being able to play those into her character, and not just the negative ones but the positive ones too, have been really cathartic.”</p>
 <p data-characters="898" data-current-count="898" data-injectable="true"><strong>Adam: </strong>“Yeah, with Ichikawa, he’s just a good boy. He’s just like a loyal, good boy. It’s been really cool, sort of… He’s unique though, in that I do feel like there’s a lot bubbling underneath. We’ve yet to find out why he sort of is the way he is, we haven’t got an Ichikawa backstory yet in the anime. So I’m very excited to explore more of his past and to see sort of what led him here, and why his drive to be great is what it is, and why he wants to be a part of the Defense Force. But then also why he takes to Kafka so quickly, you know. I think that it’s really cool, and a testament to his character and how good of a boy he is that, you know, he sort of looks up to Kafka right away, but also does it in a way that he wants to keep him safe and make sure that he doesn’t have to let this Kaiju out and all that stuff.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>© JAKDF 3rd Division © Naoya Matsumoto/SHUEISHA</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true"><strong>For Nazeeh – how do you find playing both Kafka and Kaiju No. 8? Is it fun to kind of switch back and forth between the two characters, getting to kind of style-switch that Jekyll and Hyde-type of character?</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="677" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true"><strong>Nazeeh: </strong>“Yeah, no, it’s really, really fun. Sort of exhilarating. Vocally taxing, I will also say. [<em>laughs</em>] But like I said, you get to explore the entire range of human emotion through it. And it’s not often that you have a character, especially a protagonist of a shonen-like anime, where he is the comedic relief of his own show. And then all of a sudden, you get this sort of just like, hardcore, you know, fighting protag that we’re all used to in various media. But yeah, no, it’s super fun being able to explore all that, and it’s very rewarding being able to pull off those like, moment-to-moment scenes and those beats, yeah.”</p>
 <p data-characters="52" data-current-count="52" data-injectable="false"><strong>You get like, a really fun dramatic range with that.</strong></p> <p data-characters="122" data-current-count="174" data-injectable="false"><strong>Nazeeh: </strong>“Yeah, no, I’ve definitely come close to losing my voice a couple times. So there is that.

However, the demo for new indie game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/tricky-madness&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/tricky-madness"><em>Tricky Madness</em></a></span> has given me hope that maybe, just maybe, somebody can recapture <em>SSX</em>’s greatness.<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p><em>Tricky Madness </em>isn’t shy about the fact that it is an homage to <em>SSX Tricky</em>. If the name doesn’t give it away, then the Tricky meter and colorful snowflake icons littered across the demo’s single course sure will. That isn’t, strictly speaking, a problem, and if you’re as big a fan of <em>SSX</em> as me, then the overt homage is exactly what pulled you in in the first place. But it’s a bold move to take so much directly from your inspiration when you might not live up to it.</p><p>The demo, now available on Steam, gives you access to a single character on a single course. You can try your hand at a time trial or a trick competition, in the same way that <em>SSX Tricky</em> offered races and freestyle competitions. The course currently available is a simple snowy track down a mountain surrounded by large trees and populated with jumps and rails, very much like an early track you might race down in <em>SSX </em>or <em>SSX Tricky</em>. The similarities are so strong that immediately upon starting my first run down the course, I was struck by how much my muscle memory took over. </p><figure id="" data-id="7f04dc53a3356c910ad1faa2a27b2982" data-recommend-id="image://7f04dc53a3356c910ad1faa2a27b2982" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A snowboarder soars through the air towards a giant yellow snowflake" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A snowboarder soars through the air towards a giant yellow snowflake" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nathan Dearth</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7f04dc53a3356c910ad1faa2a27b2982" data-recommend-id="image://7f04dc53a3356c910ad1faa2a27b2982" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A snowboarder soars through the air towards a giant yellow snowflake" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Switching between the <em>Tricky Madness</em> demo and <em>SSX Tricky</em>, I quickly confirmed a few things that my muscle memory had suspected. <em>Tricky Madness</em> is a much faster game, not in the speed at which you go down the mountain but in the speed at which you pull off tricks. Doing spins and flips feels incredibly fast-paced, which I only had a problem with when attempting the game’s equivalent of Uber tricks (which are just called Uber tricks here as well). The issue is that in some ways, performing these special tricks currently feels too easy, whereas the slower pace of tricks in <em>SSX Tricky</em> made Uber tricks feel like a risky endeavor.<br></p><p>Furthermore, I can’t get over <em>Tricky Madness</em>’ current steering controls, which are mapped to the left stick. Once you press the A button on an Xbox controller to prepare for a jump, you can’t steer but instead must prepare the direction you will spin in the air by pressing on the d-pad. Switching on the fly between the left stick and d-pad when going from steering to trick preparation is a little cumbersome at the moment, and I yearn for the ability to both steer and prepare for tricks on the d-pad like in <em>SSX Tricky</em>. Therein lies the biggest problem of <em>Tricky Madness</em>: the game feels <em>so much</em> like <em>SSX Tricky </em>that those moments where it deviates from its inspiration become unnerving. But again, this is just a demo and these things are very much in an early stage of development.</p><p>The more time I spent with<em> Tricky Madness</em>, the more I appreciated its clear understanding of and love for <em>SSX</em>. While the game’s art isn’t quite as poppy as that of its inspiration, the demo’s singular course still gives you a sense that it would feel right at home amongst <em>SSX</em> courses. That feeling grows even stronger as you poke at the edges of the course in search of secret routes. I was glad to discover a handful of shortcuts that helped me shave seconds off my time, and even a hidden half-pipe that gave me the perfect venue to pull off a series of tricks in seamless succession. </p><hr><p><em>Tricky Madness</em> doesn’t have a release date yet but the full version promises eight full courses and characters (who will be voiced and have unique tricks), a campaign and free-roam mode, and a voiced DJ to fully evoke the <em>SSX Tricky</em> experience. After my time with the limited demo, I can’t definitively say if <em>Tricky Madness</em> is the <em>SSX</em> successor we’ve all been waiting for, but I can say that it has given me hope it will earn that title.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Members of the Legendary Computer Bugs Tribunal, honored guests, if I may have your attention? I would, humbly, submit a new contender for your esteemed judgment. You may or may not find it novel, you may even deign to call it a "bug," but I assure you, you will find it entertaining.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://www.nethack.org/"><em>NetHack</em></a>. It is one of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/ascii-art-permadeath-the-history-of-roguelike-games/">the all-time roguelike</a> games, and I mean that in the more strict sense of that term. The content is procedurally generated, deaths are permanent, and the only thing you keep from game to game is your skill and knowledge. I do understand that the only thing two roguelike fans can agree on is how wrong the third roguelike fan is in their definition of roguelike, but, please, let us move on.</p>
<h2><em>NetHack</em> is great for machine learning…</h2>
<p>Being a difficult game full of consequential choices and random challenges, as well as a "single-agent" game that can be generated and played at lightning speed on modern computers, <em>NetHack</em> is great for those working in machine learning—or <a href="https://underactuated.mit.edu/imitation.html">imitation learning</a>, actually, as detailed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09423">Jens Tuyls' paper</a> on how compute scaling affects single-agent game learning. Using Tuyls' model of expert <em>NetHack</em> behavior, Bartłomiej Cupiał and Maciej Wołczyk trained a neural network to play and improve itself using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a>.
</p><p>By mid-May of this year, the two had their model consistently scoring 5,000 points by their own metrics. Then, on one run, the model suddenly got worse, on the order of 40 percent. It scored 3,000 points. Machine learning generally, gradually, goes in one direction with these types of problems. It didn't make sense.</p>
<p>Cupiał and Wołczyk tried quite a few things: reverting their code, restoring their entire software stack from a Singularity backup, and rolling back their <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit">CUDA</a> libraries. The result? 3,000 points. They rebuild everything from scratch, and it's still 3,000 points.</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><figcaption><p><em>NetHack</em>, played by a regular human.</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>… except on certain nights</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/cupiabart/status/1793930355617259811?s=46">detailed</a> in Cupiał's X (formerly Twitter) thread, this was several hours of confused trial and error by him and Wołczyk. "<span>I am starting to feel like a madman. I can't even watch a TV show constantly thinking about the bug," Cupiał wrote. In desperation, he asks model author Tuyls if he knows what could be wrong. He wakes up in Kraków to an answer:</span></p>
<p><span>"Oh yes, it's probably a full moon today."</span></p>
<p>In <em>NetHack</em>, the game in which the DevTeam has <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/The_DevTeam_Thinks_of_Everything">thought of everything</a>, if the game detects from your system clock that it should be a full moon, it will generate a message: "You are lucky! Full moon tonight." A full moon imparts <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Time">a few player benefits</a>: a single point added to Luck, and werecreatures mostly kept to their animal forms.</p>
<p>It's an easier game, all things considered, so why would the learning agent's score be lower? It simply doesn't have data about full moon variables in its training data, so a branching series of decisions likely leads to lesser outcomes, or just confusion. It was indeed a full moon in <span>Kraków</span> when the 3,000-ish scores started showing up. What a terrible night to have a learning model.</p>
<p>Of course, "score" is not a real metric for success in <em>NetHack</em>, as <a href="https://x.com/CupiaBart/status/1794614271281905955">Cupiał himself noted</a>. Ask a model to get the best score, and it will farm the heck out of early-stage monsters because it never gets bored. "<span>Finding items required for [ascension] or even [just] doing a quest is too much for pure RL agent," Cupiał wrote. Another neural network, <a href="https://github.com/maciej-sypetkowski/autoascend">AutoAscend</a>, does a better job of progressing through the game, but "even it can only solve sokoban and reach mines end," Cupiał <a href="https://x.com/CupiaBart/status/1794440727117668776">notes</a>.</span></p>
<h2>Is it a bug?</h2>
<p>I submit to you that, although <em>NetHack</em> responded to the full moon in its intended way, this quirky, very hard-to-fathom stop on a machine-learning journey was indeed a bug and a worthy one in the pantheon. It's not <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/worlds-first-computer-bug/">a Harvard moth</a>, nor a <a href="http://web.mit.edu/jemorris/humor/500-miles">500-mile email</a>, but what is?</p>
<p>Because the team used <a href="https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html">Singularity</a> to back up and restore their stack, they inadvertently carried forward the machine time and resulting bug each time they tried to solve it. The machine's resulting behavior was so bizarre, and seemingly based on unseen forces, that it drove a coder into fits. And the story has a beginning, a climactic middle, and a denouement that teaches us something, however obscure.</p>
<p>The <em>NetHack</em> Lunar Learning Bug is, I submit, quite worth memorializing. Thank you for your time.</p>
