That's not all, though! If you only watched the trailer and didn't actually catch the Nintendo Direct, you might have missed two other scenes.</p>
<p>During the short presentation by Shigeru Miyamoto, Illumination's Chris Meledandri (and the voice of Bowser, Jack Black), Mario fans got a teaser of a Rosalina and Bowser Jr. scenes. In the main trailer, Rosalina doesn't speak, so this is technically the first scene we've seen of her talking.</p>
<p>The cosmic protector will be voiced by the "academy award winner and Nintendo super fan" Brie Larson. As <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/12-details-you-might-have-missed-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer">we noted in our recent feature</a>, this scene gives us a brief look at some Luma (including a little one with a dummy) listening to Rosalina's story as well as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/paper_mario">Paper Mario</a>-style storybook scene. Here it is in full:</p>

<p>Next up, we've got a look at Bowser Jr. - the new villain in the Mario Galaxy Movie, voiced by Benny Safdie. This "uncut gem" (Jack Black's words) co-directed the award-winning crime-thriller Uncut Gems, and can be seen as Bowser's son in this first look, plotting his family's rise from the ashes.</p>

<p>So, there you go - a little more footage to enjoy until the next update or trailer drop. The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will arrive in theatres in <strong>April 2026</strong>. You can find out more about everything in the main trailer as well as our feature and guide here on Nintendo Life.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-ps5-trailer-2000643663</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-reveals-secret-horizon-mmo-that-looks-like-monster-hunter-but-isn%E2%80%99t-coming-to-ps5.1352122/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony has officially revealed the long-rumored <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-open-world-7th-anniversary-1851293448"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> MMO spin-off</a> it’s making with <em>Guild Wars</em> publisher NCSoft. It’s called <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, it looks a lot like <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and it’s not coming to PlayStation 5.</p>

 <p>Announced during South Korea’s G-Star gaming convention, <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> was developed in partnership with PlayStation studio Guerrilla Games and centers around big, raid-like boss fights against the franchise’s detailed assortment of futuristic prehistoric robots. Instead of following the story of franchise protagonist Aloy, players will create their own custom characters and team-up to take down their mechanical quarries across PC and mobile.</p>

 <p>There’s no release date yet but we did get a 10-minute deep-dive into the RPG’s gameplay and development backstory:</p>  <p>You play as a machine hunter in the Deadlands (inspired by Arizona and New Mexico) who hails from one of four tribes: the Nora, Tenakth, Utaru, or Oseram. It’s unclear exactly how many other players you’ll be able to team up with or how seamless the world will be as you explore, but early footage teased several different biomes, from fire-ravaged deserts to icy tundra. Players have ground and aerial mounts they can utilize for exploration and combat and there’s one moment in the trailer where players are galloping across a field alongside a mechanical herd as well as one of the series’ iconic Tallnecks.</p>

 <p>I have no idea how it’s supposed to run on phones but it looks great.</p> <p>“<em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> is a full-fledged MMORPG that NCSoft has built specifically for mobile,” Guerilla Games studio director Jan-Bart van Beek said during the video. “You’re sharing the frontier with thousands of other players, sometimes working together to take down machines and other times competing with rival tribes or fighting over resources, and that mix of cooperation and competition creates moments that you could never script.”</p>

  <p>A gameplay trailer gives a better sense of how exactly combat will work and it certainly looks a lot like <em>Monster Hunter</em>. Players will hack away at enemies, targeting weaknesses and damaging specific parts of them over the course of battle. But it’s not just mashing buttons. Players will also be able to make use of carefully placed traps and grappling hook-like pullcasters to sling-shot themselves around the battlefield and onto enemies’ backs. Based on the UI, it looks like there might even be some sort of stagger mechanic.</p>

 <p>NCSoft executive producer Sunggu Lee said during the developer interview that <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em><em>‘ </em>emphasis will be on teamwork and strategy. As an MMORPG coming out of South Korea built primarily for smartphones, I also expect it to be a heavily monetized XP grind. If the company can make it feel more like a coop Horizon adventure than a second job min-maxing spreadsheets, <em>Horizon</em> meets <em>Monster Hunter</em> has the potential to be really cool. But a lot of that will come down to how smooth and rewarding the moment-to-moment combat looks and feels.</p> <p>Sony is currently all-in on the <em>Horizon</em> franchise. In addition to Guerrilla teasing a third mainline entry in the existing open-world RPG series, there were rumors of a live service multiplayer spin-off based on project footage from 2020 that <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-forbidden-west-aloy-sequel-burning-shores-ps5-1850369063">leaked several years ago</a>. It’s unclear whether that was abandoned, became <em>Steel Frontiers</em>, or remains another multiplayer project in the mix at Sony. There’s also the <em>Horizon</em> movie that’s currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-movie-date-sony-tencent-lawsuit-last-us-2000636587">slated to begin filming next year</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-death-stranding-anime-is-in-the-works-at-disney.1352107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Death Stranding is becoming an anime series thanks to the folks at Disney+. Furthermore, creator Hideo Kojima will executive produce while animator Takayuki Sano (Jujutsu Kaisen 0, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood) will direct the show.</p>







<p>The Death Stranding series is the first new IP from Kojima Productions, led by Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima. With two entries, with On the Beach releasing in 2025, the post-apocalyptic strand game has become a hit for PlayStation fans. It helps that it bolsters an all-star cast, led by The Walking Dead’s Norman Reedus, and some great visual and narrative storytelling. A few months ago, Kojima announced more projects based on Death Stranding, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-anime-confirmed-by-hideo-kojima/">an anime movie</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-film-a24-original-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film adaptation from A24</a>. Now, it seems there’s another project in the works and at Disney+, of all places.</p>



<h2 id="h-death-stranding-isolations-to-stream-on-disney-in-2027">Death Stranding Isolations to Stream on Disney+ in 2027</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The official poster for Death Stranding Isolations, streaming on Disney+</figcaption></figure>



<p>The news comes from Disney at the Disney APAC Showcase, currently going on in Hong Kong. There, the company revealed that it’s releasing Death Stranding Isolations (title not final), a 2D hand-drawn anime, in 2027. The animation will be handled by E&amp;H production, led by Jujutsu Kaisen director Sunghoo Park. Directing the show is Takayuki Sano, whose resume includes anime like Attack on Titan, Banana Fish, and Promare. A short synopsis was also provided by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/disney-unveils-death-stranding-isolations-from-game-creator-hideo-kojima-1236616004/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>. It can be found in full below.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Set in the same world as the video game,&nbsp;Death Stranding Isolations<em>&nbsp;</em>follows Sam Bridges as he attempts to save America, and those trying to deal with their isolation in their own way. </p>



<p>An old man is trying to realize salvation through ways outside of the connection advocated by Bridges. A female warrior is trying to kickstart a world of constant fighting. A boy holds a grudge against Bridges, and a girl has embraced her loneliness. On the precipice of the end of humanity and the world, their fates and hopes converge, as another story of Death Stranding begins.</p>
</blockquote>



<p> In attendance at the Disney APAC Showcase was creator <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wishes-to-scan-real-ghosts-for-od/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a>, who will executive produce the show. Speaking on behalf of the team at the event, Kojima stated,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I grew up loving Japanese anime, and it has shaped my worldview,” said Kojima. “I’ve always been a fan of Disney, since I was small, and I was glad that they showed my documentary on the platform. When they approached me, I decided to work with them.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Interestingly enough, this isn’t the only anime of Death Stranding we’re getting. Death Stranding: Mosquito, an animated film by ABC Animations, is currently in the works, as well. However, it seems like Sam Porter Bridges is going to be in Isolations and not Mosquito, as far as we know. We’ll likely learn more about both as 2026 comes around, but at least we have a look at the title through the artwork, shown above.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Horizon Steel Frontiers: How the New Mobile MMORPG Changes Machine Combat]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-trailer-breakdown</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/horizon-steel-frontiers-how-the-new-mobile-mmorpg-changes-machine-combat.1352104/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A brand new Horizon game has been announced, but it’s not the sequel to Forbidden West that you may have been expecting. It’s not a single-player game, nor is it even a PlayStation game. Horizon Steel Frontiers is a MMORPG developed by NCSoft for mobile and PC. Confused? Don’t worry, we’re here to break down everything revealed in the debut trailer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the idea of an online multiplayer Horizon game sounds familiar, then you’ve likely been paying attention to the rumours that began as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-ps5-remaster-reportedly-in-the-works-alongside-a-multiplayer-game">far back as 2022</a>. At first glance, it’s clear that this is very much a Horizon game you can play with a team of co-op buddies. The world looks very similar to what we’ve explored before, however this time we’ll be headed to the Deadlands, a brand new region inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. Within that location are plenty of recognisable elements, from destroyed remains of humanity’s past, to the real stars of Horizon: its giant mechanical beasts. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/12/horizon-steel-frontiers-sword-1762959243816.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">But let's start with something less familiar. It’s clear that Steel Frontiers has a different approach to combat compared to its predecessors. Where the single-player games largely focus on ranged combat, using weapons like bows to shoot enemy weakpoints, this new take on the universe seems to be predominantly focused on melee. The trailer’s focal character uses a huge sword, while other characters can be seen using dual blades to slice and dice their way through machine armour. That’s not to say archery has been eliminated – a bow still features throughout the trailer – but blade combat appears to be front and center. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There seems to not just be a change in distance between you and your foe, but a dramatic re-think of combat fundamentals. The trailer demonstrates a charged blade ability that can be used to deflect an incoming attack, a type of defensive strategy that’s brand new to Horizon. When it comes to the offensive, you can now, after destroying a specific part of a machine, use the Pullcaster grapple hook to climb onto your target and place a status-inflicting trap on the damaged part. NCSoft has said that elements like this are part of a new approach that tailors Horizon’s existing ideas to suit an MMORPG. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s clear that lots of Horizon’s combat DNA still remains – we can see machine parts detach in every fight, such as when the main character shoots off a Blaze canister in the trailer’s opening battle. And later, we can see that destroyed machines leave behind resources to pick up. But from what’s shown in this trailer, it seems like Steel Frontiers may feel more like Monster Hunter than traditional Horizon. Executive producer Sung-Gu Lee explains that at the core of the experience is “cooperation and strategy”, and that “players must take on their roles,” ideas that form the basis of Monster Hunter’s multiplayer expeditions. Furthermore, we even see some characters cooking a meal in a cutscene that resembles the chef montages from Monster Hunter’s own meal prep system. Perhaps all this shouldn’t come as a surprise, though: there’s certainly more than a little of Capcom’s series in Horizon already.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other combat additions we can see in the trailer include some kind of sticky bomb that can be used to deal massive damage to machines – perhaps this is one of those aforementioned traps? You also now have the ability to pack machine weapons on your mount, allowing you to transport heavy artillery from one battle to another.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/12/horizon-steel-frontiers-mount-1762959265554.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking of mounts, we see almost all of the tameable machines from Forbidden West being used in this trailer. It opens with a Bristleback being Overridden and claimed as a mount, and later we see characters riding Sunwings and Chargers. We also see confirmation of a brand new mount: the trailer’s protagonist rides on the back of a Stalker, the stealth camo-equipped, Panther-like machine. Considering Forbidden West expanded the number of mounts available, and MMORPGs are typically known for their range of mounts, it seems likely that even more machines will be available for taming. With any luck, this is the game where we can finally pilot a Thunderjaw. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don’t actually see Horizon’s iconic, metallic T-Rex in this trailer, but there are over a dozen other machines on display here, from the tiny all the way up to the gigantic. The most impressive fight sees a group take on a Slaughterspine, which uses many of the abilities it did in Forbidden West, including its rain of munitions. Other examples of “Oh god please don’t kill me” machines include the fearsome Fireclaw, a napalm-spewing robo-bear, and a huge snake-like machine that looks like a Slitherfang crossed with a Rockbreaker, which is very likely our first glimpse of a new variety of metal monster. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest creature, though, is the Tallneck, and we can see a group of machine hunters attempting to bring one down in the desert. Once again, these look like they’ll be large climbing puzzles, judged on the way the characters climb its neck. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the smaller side, we can spot a Watcher, some Grazers, a Plowhorn, a Trampler, a Ravager, and a Shellwalker… whose shell is whisked away into the sky by a Glinthawk. It seems like NCSoft understands the mission when it comes to enemy variety.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/12/horizon-steel-frontiers-dungeon-1762959281074.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously mentioned, the world looks suitably like Horizon’s signature vision of the future. Lush green foliage has overtaken the ruins of human skyscrapers, people live in villages that take inspiration from Native American tribes, and below the ground lie giant vaults filled with advanced technology . These “Cauldrons” return from the single-player Horizon games, but can now be explored with a team of allied players. It seems sensible to guess that these Cauldrons may be Steel Frontiers’ equivalent to the classic MMORPG dungeon.     </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, a great deal of what we’ve seen looks very close to what we’d expect of a Horizon game. Steel Frontiers has been developed in collaboration with original developer Guerrilla, and so no doubt many efforts have been made to keep the visual style and many gameplay ideas consistent. However, with the Korean-based NCSoft being the lead developer, you can also see some more Eastern elements finding their place in this universe. All the characters have an anime-like aesthetic, looking more like folks from Final Fantasy or NCSoft’s own Lineage games, rather than the characters from the original Horizon series. There’s even a bit of a cutesy thing going on with a character’s wearing metal cat ears – something we’d never see the serious Aloy wear in a thousand years. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/12/horizon-steel-frontiers-cat-ears-1762959611713.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, if you're a Horizon purist, you may be able to create a character that’s more in-line with the original games’ aesthetic in the character creator. This being an MMORPG, you won’t be playing as Aloy or any other pre-written protagonist, but a character of your own design. The character creator seems reasonably in-depth, and also allows you to choose which tribe you’ll join: the Nora, Tenakth, Utaru, or Oseram – all groups previously established in Horizon lore. The trailer’s narration hints at competitive PvP as well as co-op machine hunting, so it may be that your tribe also acts as your “team” in such scenarios.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Steel Frontiers looks to contain much of what we’d expect from Horizon, from RPG dialogue sequences to giant metal monster fights, this is certainly set to be a new and different take on the universe we’ve come to love over the last couple of PlayStation generations. Not to mention, it’s a Horizon game we’ll be playing on our phones, not our PS5s. But did you spot anything new and interesting in the trailer that we missed? Let us know your sharp observations in the comments below, as well as what you think of this new MMO direction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-trailer-breakdown]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>And here are some comments from NCSOFT chief corporate officer Taekjin Kim, Guerrilla Games studio director Jan-Bart van Beek, and NCSOFT executive producer Sung-Gu Lee, via the announcement video:</p><div><p><strong>Taekjin Kim, NCSOFT Chief Corporate Officer</strong></p><p>“When I fist experienced <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> in 2017, I was instantly drawn into its vibrant and captivating world. The battles against colossal machine lifeforms were exhilarating and the mysterious narrative sparked my curiosity, urging me to explore every corner of that universe. Yet I couldn’t help but feel a little wistful that such an incredible world had to be experienced alone. I imagined how thrilling it would be to meet others, to team up and face these massive machines together.</p><p>“From the beginning, I was convinced: battling machine lifeforms would be far more exciting than facing any fantasy monster. That vision inspired us to create an MMO set in this extraordinary universe. And today, I’m proud to present <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>—a dream realized. <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> represents a new challenge for NC, and the start of an exciting journey ahead. We hope you look forward to this new <em>Horizon</em> born from the collaboration between NC and Guerrilla.”</p><p><strong>Jan-Bart van Beek, Guerrilla Games Studio Director</strong></p><p>“I was the one who originally came up with the concept of the <em>Horizon</em> franchise. The <em>Horizon</em> franchise is incredibly special to me and to everyone at Guerrilla. It’s a world we’ve poured our hearts and souls into. It’s a place where humanity, nature, and technology are constantly colliding. It’s become a vibrant and living world full of stories, tribal cultures, and of course, those incredible animal-like machines that rule the land.</p><p>“From the very beginning of creating this franchise, we’ve imagined the <em>Horizon</em> universe as one that could be experienced in many different ways. <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> is a full-fledged MMORPG that NCSOFT has built specifically for mobile. With <em>Steel Frontiers</em>, you can step into this world, anywhere, anytime.</p><p>“Players take on the role of machine hunters, chasing opportunity in a region called the Deadlands, which is inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. You’re sharing the frontier with thousands of other players, sometimes working together to take down machines, and other times competing with rival tribes or fighting over resources. And that mix of cooperation and competition creates moments you could never script.</p><p>“At the heart of the <em>Horizon</em> story is the search for the balance between humanity, nature, and technology. Sometimes that’s harmony, sometimes that’s conflict. But it always creates a world filled with mystery and beauty. What we want players to feel is the world’s resilience and its hope. And that even when everything seems overwhelming, humanity can adapt, can survive, and find meaning in the world.</p><p>“We already had groups at Guerrilla playing <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> together at the office, and it’s really amazing. Whenever I get a chance to jump in on an early gameplay test, what really stands out is <em>Steel Frontiers</em>‘ distinct tone and atmosphere. It has a unique identity of its own, and has been brought to life by NCSOFT’s developers. But it fits perfectly with the Horizon universe, and that balance with the essence of <em>Horizon</em> and something fresh is what really excites me about this project.”</p><p><strong>Sung-Gu Lee, NCSOFT Executive Producer</strong></p><p>“I’m a bit nervous to present this project to the world for the first time, but at the same time, I’m extremely excited. The core concept of <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> can be summed up in one phrase: the thrill of taking down colossal machines. Hunting massive machines was one of the greatest appeals of the original&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em> series. And now, we’re expanding that experience into the world of MMORPGs.</p><p>“Our main focus is designing a new combat experience tailored for an MMORPG. In <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, we’ve added unique, original gameplay elements to the process of taking down giant machines. For example, after destroying a specific part of a machine, you can quickly approach and climb onto it using a Pullcaster, set traps on the damaged part, and inflict status effects. During battle, you can even pick up weapons dropped by the machine, carry them on your mount, and use them in subsequent fights. At the heart of giant machine hunts are two core values. cooperation and strategy. Players must take on their roles, act strategically, and work together seamlessly. These combat mechanics truly shine in large-scale battles, offering the scale and dynamism that only an MMORPG can provide.</p><p>“In <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, every player is a hero. We’ve put great care into customization, allowing you to fully express your individuality—even down to the smallest details. During character creation, we’ve incorporated the tribes from the original <em>Horizon</em> world. You can choose from diverse tribes such as Nora, Tenakth, Utaru, or Oseram, and create your character based on your preferred tribe. Our system provides a high degree of freedom, so you can design your character exactly as you envision—from facial features, body type, and hair, to makeup and finer details. The characters you create can be shared with other players, allowing you not only to show off your own style, but also draw inspiration from others to further customize your hero. Step into <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> as a truly unique machine hunter, crafted entirely by you, and explore a world where your individuality matters.</p><p>“In the world of <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, you’ll be able to develop your own character, team up with friends to hunt colossal machines, and live the story of a machine hunter in the Deadlands. We can’t wait to see you all become the heroes of this adventure, and we’re doing our best to make that day come as soon as possible.”</p></div><p>Watch the announcement video and gameplay trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/ncsoft-announces-mmorpg-horizon-steel-frontiers-for-pc-ios-and-android]]></content:encoded>

<p>As it expands into mobile gaming with a major IP</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>In recent years, Nintendo has been able to grow its brand and expand its IP with mobile game apps. To date, the cumulative number of unique downloads for Nintendo apps has now surpassed 950 million, and it's banked a lot of coin in that time.</p>
<p>It's a market that's ripe for the picking, and in some industry news this week, Sony's PlayStation Studios has now announced it will be stepping up its game with the release of a new "free to download" <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ratchet_and_clank_rift_apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> multiplayer mobile title. As our colleagues at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/new-ratchet-and-clank-game-announced-but-not-for-the-platform-you-want">Push Square</a> note, although Sony has been dabbling with mobile games for a while, this is seemingly "one of the first real attempts" to bring its IP to this platform.</p>
<p>The game is officially titled <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/new-ratchet-and-clank-game-announced-but-not-for-the-platform-you-want">Ratchet and Clank: Ranger Rumble</a></strong>, and it's notably drawn some comparisons to games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_league">Rocket League</a> and even the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Federation Force</a>. The Metroid comparison has been spurred on by a mode called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_blast">Blast Ball</a>, which you might remember was a dedicated competitive multiplayer experience on the 3DS.</p>

<p>Much like Nintendo with Super Mario, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a> and other IP like Fire Emblem, PlayStation appears to be following up this Ratchet &amp; Clank title with a <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/the-next-horizon-game-is-an-mmo-by-ncsoft-for-pc-mobile">new Horizon MMO for mobile (and PC)</a> that's already leaked.</p>
<p>Obviously, there's a huge audience on mobile, so Nintendo and PlayStation can easily co-exist, but this is a notable development on the PlayStation front. And it's easy to see why Sony might have also considered this market after the success Nintendo has had in this space. After all, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/sony-once-again-takes-a-leaf-from-nintendos-playbook-in-japan">always kept a close eye on Nintendo</a>.</p>
<p>As for Nintendo's mobile expansion, it most recently launched the new title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_shadows">Fire Emblem Shadows</a> on Android and iOS devices in September. Earlier this month, it also released a new mobile application in select regions, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-releases-a-storefront-app-for-android-and-ios">allows users to access its storefront</a>. In some other industry news, Valve has announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/random-steams-brand-new-game-console-sure-looks-awfully-familiar">a new Steam Machine this week</a>, and Nintendo dropped a trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/12-details-you-might-have-missed-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer">the new Mario Movie</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/details-on-a-new-horizon-mmorpg-have-leaked-online.1352029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An MMORPG based on PlayStation and Guerrilla Games’ Horizon series has been leaked before its official reveal. We now know several details surrounding the game, now called Horizon Steel Frontiers.</p>







<p>While a newer IP, the Horizon series, consisting of 2017’s Zero Dawn and 2022’s Forbidden West, has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-franchise-32m-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-received by critics</a>. The third-person post-apocalyptic shooter is known for its gorgeous graphics and intuitive open-world gameplay. With hulking mechanical monsters and a lush environment, Horizon’s iconic settings make for the perfect setup for games outside of the main series. We did see LEGO Horizon Adventures and a VR spinoff, but it’s stayed in its lane for a bit. However, rumors of an MMORPG had surfaced over the past years, but it was thought to be cancelled. However, according to new information, it seems it’s here and, most likely, will be revealed quite soon.</p>



<p>UPDATE: Horizon Steel Frontiers is, indeed real, as PlayStation and NCSoft announced the project soon after publication. The video mentioned in the article <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiogVFtmchg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can be found here</a>. Most of the details regarding gameplay and such can be found below.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-minute-video-of-mmorpg-horizon-steel-frontiers-coming-soon-according-to-leak">10-Minute Video of MMORPG Horizon Steel Frontiers Coming Soon, According to Leak</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Leaked key art from Horizon Steel Frontiers </figcaption></figure>



<p>The leak in question comes from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819657/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-sony-ncsoft-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, which supposedly saw a 10-minute video of the Horizon MMORPG, called Horizon Steel Frontiers. It even included key art, which we have above. Supposedly, the game is set to be revealed at the G-STAR 2025 event, but information came out early. </p>



<p>In the article, it mentions that the game is a collaboration between PlayStation and Korean developer NCSoft. The video, planned to be shown there, showcases gameplay, both complete and in development. As it is an MMORPG, instead of playing as Aloy, you’ll create your own character and join others in the world, called the Deathlands. It also says that the title will release on PC, iOS, and Android. No mention of a release date or if it will go to PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As the game is not yet confirmed, take the news with a grain of salt for now. However, given the content leaked, it’s safe to say it’s only a matter of time before it’s announced. Either way, it will be interesting to see how Horizon fits into the MMORPG genre and the differences between it and the main series.</p>

                <p>Valve has unveiled its first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">its new gaming machines</a>, including Steam Frame, a virtual reality headset that can handle VR and non-VR games. Apparently, Steam Frame is also being used as a way to bring Android games directly to Steam users.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Valve will support and encourage developers to bring Android apps to Steam. As part of this initiative, Valve will release a Steam Frame developer kit for developers who already use Android APKs for apps and VR headsets on Android phones.</p><p>"From the user's perspective, our preference is that they don't even have to think about it," explains Valve engineer Jeremy Selan. "They just have their titles on Steam, they download them and hit play ... They're really VR developers who want to publish their VR content, and they're porting a mobile VR title where they're already familiar with how to make those APKs. They are now free to bring those to Steam, and they'll just work on this device."</p><p>This seamless transition from Android to Steam is possible because Steam Frame uses an Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, which can run the apps directly. That will allow the Android games and VR apps to be easily accessed on Steam Frame.</p><p>In addition to Steam Frame, Valve announced a Steam Machine that can bring PC games to living rooms like a console, as well as a new Steam Controller. Valve <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">hasn't disclosed pricing for any of its new Steam hardware</a> yet, but hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Steam Machine will likely be competitively priced to be an affordable alternative to consoles.</p><p>"If you're trying to make a PC that has similar features and similar performance, I think the Steam Machine is going to be a really competitive price to that and provide really good value to it," said Aldehayyat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium wireless earbuds have become one of those purchases where the options feel endless and the prices keep climbing higher. You’ve got Apple’s AirPods Pro at $249, Google’s Pixel Buds Pro at similar pricing, and Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro normally sitting at the same $249 mark. The specs all start to blur together after a while, and trying to figure out which pair actually delivers the best value can feel overwhelming. Price becomes a major factor when everything seems comparable on paper, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">right now Amazon has dropped the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to just $174, down from their usual $249</a>. This is a new all-time low that you won’t even find on Samsung’s official website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro <strong>pack AI-powered features</strong> that are constantly adapting to your environment throughout the day. Samsung’s sound optimization technology analyses the shape of your ear canal to adjust audio output for balanced sound that matches your unique anatomy. This happens automatically in the background, so you’re not always tweaking equalizer settings and wondering if you’re missing out on certain frequencies. The <strong>AI continuously monitors ambient noise levels and adjusts the intensity of active noise cancellation</strong> to match and ramps up when you step onto a busy street and dialing back when you’re in quieter spaces.</p>



<h2>Adaptive Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro works through a <strong>combination of external and internal microphones</strong> that capture ambient sound and generate inverse sound waves to cancel unwanted noise. The technology proves especially effective at eliminating low-frequency rumble from airplane engines, subway cars, or air conditioning units. You’ll notice the difference immediately on your commute as traffic noise fades into the background and you can finally hear podcast dialogue clearly without cranking the volume to dangerous levels.<strong> Transparency mode</strong> flips this system around and pips in external sounds when you need to hear announcements, have quick conversations, or stay aware of your surroundings while walking.</p>



<p>Samsung redesigned the fit for the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to address one of the most common complaints in its predecessors: This <strong>new ergonomic contour sits more securely in your ear</strong> without creating pressure points that cause discomfort after an hour or two of wear. You get three different ear tip sizes in the box, and the companion app includes a fit test that plays audio to verify you’ve created a proper seal. Getting this seal right is enormously important for both sound quality and noise cancellation effectiveness, since even small gaps let sound leak in and bass frequencies escape.</p>
<p>The <strong>Bluetooth connectivity</strong> maintains stable connections for the typical range you’d expect from modern wireless earbuds, staying paired reliably when your phone is in your pocket or bag. Pairing happens quickly through Samsung’s ecosystem if you own a Galaxy phone, as the earbuds pop up automatically on screen when you open the case near your device. Android users outside the Samsung ecosystem and <strong>even iPhone owners can still pair these earbuds</strong> through standard Bluetooth settings, though they’ll miss out on some of the deeper integration features that Galaxy phone users enjoy.</p>
<p>Battery life gives you about six hours of continuous playback with active noise cancellation enabled, which will cover most daily use scenarios, like commutes, work sessions, or gym visits. With the charging case included, y<strong>ou get about 26 hours of total listening time</strong> before you’ll need to find an outlet; it also supports USB-C wired charging and wireless charging via Qi-compatible pads. With just a five-minute charge, you can attain about an hour of playback in case you are in a hurry and forget that your earbuds are dead.</p>
<p>This is one of the best deals on Samsung’s earbuds so far in 2025.</p>

      <p>We're proud and <em>incredibly </em>excited to announce some new Aftermath merch: a collaboration with artist<a href="https://linktr.ee/Aurumek?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Simon Hintermann, aka Aurumek</u></a>, on a new piece called 'Printe Shoppe', which is available now<a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/en-aud?ref=aftermath.ghost.io"> <u>on our store</u></a>.</p><p>It depicts Aftermath working as we'd <em>all </em>presumably like to spend our days: not hunched over computers, which are inherently evil, but relaxing in our quaint countryside office, blue sky overhead, each letter of each blog being slotted purposefully into a printing press by hand. Thoughtful work, <em>human </em>work.</p><p>The art is available as both <a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a print and a premium unisex t-shirt</u></a> (available in 'natural’ and 'black' colourways). I've got the print framed in my living room and it looks <em>amazing, </em>and all proceeds are split between all humans involved.</p><p>You can buy both (and all our other merch, from hoodies to mugs to<a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/en-aud/products/new-combined-listing-offer?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>our 'Destroy AI' tee</u></a>)<a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>at the Aftermath store</u></a>.</p><p>(Also: <a href="https://aftermath.site/#/portal/account/plans" rel="noreferrer">subscribers to our Member and Benefactor tiers</a> get a discount at our merch store.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-performance-beast-from-dell-is-70-off-on-amazon-now-priced-like-a-basic-mid-range-machine-2000643568</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Finding a laptop that can handle everything from pro-level video editing to more casual gaming means spending upwards of $3,000, and that’s something most people simply can’t justify. Everyone wants a powerful machine that doesn’t chug when the work starts to get serious but the budgetary reality most are faced with compromises. Until now. This early Black Friday deal on Amazon completely upends that equation by dropping <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/">the Dell Inspiron 16″ laptop (1TB SSD, 32GB DDR5 RAM, etc) from its usual $3,299 price all the way down to just $995</a>. That’s a <strong>huge 70% discount on a true performance powerhouse</strong>, and the deal isn’t even available on Dell’s own website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The Intel Core 7 150U processor powers this machine with the kind of processing muscle you would expect from significantly more expensive laptops. This chip has speeds up to 5.4 GHz and boasts a hybrid architecture, with <strong>10 cores split between 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores, all working across 12 threads</strong>. You get three separate engines inside: CPU tasks, GPU graphics, and NPU AI acceleration. In other words, it handles everything from complex spreadsheets to AI-powered applications with ease.</p>



<h2>Ideal for Daily Tasks</h2>
<p>The 32GB of DDR5 RAM changes the way you work as slowdowns that plague machines with less memory are gone. You can keep dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple Adobe Creative Suite apps at once, have multiple Excel workbooks processing data, and still switch between everything instantly. Compared to DDR4 found in older laptops, DDR5 provides faster data transfer rates which means your processor spends less time waiting for information and more actually processing your work.</p>



<p>The touchscreen features a 16-inch WQXGA display with 1920 x 1200 resolution and offers more vertical real estate compared to the usual 1080p panel. That extra height makes a difference when you code, read long documents or deal with a spreadsheet that requires a few more rows visible at once. The 300-nit brightness is sufficient for you to comfortably work in well-lit offices or near windows while the anti-glare coating prevents reflections from turning your screen into a mirror.</p>
<p>The Thunderbolt 4 port delivers transfer speeds up to 40 Gbps and means you can transfer whole project folders to external drives in seconds, rather than minutes. This same port supports dual 4K displays or a single 8K monitor, turning your laptop into a multiscreen workstation when you’re at your desk. Combined with traditional USB 3.2 ports for peripherals, HDMI for presentations, and WiFi 6E for lightning-fast wireless connections, this laptop connects to everything you need without requiring a drawer full of adapters.</p>
<p>This is one of the best laptop deals you can get right now, and it’s exclusively available at Amazon.</p>

Developer Jagex is calling it a "new era" for the MMORPG.</p><p dir="ltr">In a video announcing the decision, Jagex CEO Jon Bellamy (known to the community as Mod North) said "the community has spoken," and as such, Treasure Hunter will be removed on January 19, 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">The feature sees players granted keys each day that can be used to open what are effectively loot boxes containing XP, gold, and more. While players are granted a number of keys for free each day, keys can also be bought for real money. More than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/runescapes-future-may-be-radically-reshaped-after-fan-vote/1100-6535811/" data-ref-id="1100-6535811">120,000 players voted</a> to see Treasure Hunter and other microtransactions removed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCjHVGbFwr4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JCjHVGbFwr4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That is, however, just the start of Jagex's plans. Bellamy said on the same day Treasure Hunter is removed, Jagex will also significantly reduce the amount of "gameplay-impacting MTX across the board." That includes the ability to purchase items that grant direct XP, as well as other items like Proteans, Dummies, and more, North said.</p><p dir="ltr">"January 19 is the start of a new era for RuneScape, powered by a shared desire to see this game grow for decades to come," North said.</p><p dir="ltr">Next year, Jagex will release an "integrity roadmap" that will address core issues surrounding the game, including the user interface and user experience, the game's visual identity, and more. Additional details will be shared on January 19.</p><p dir="ltr">Removing Treasure Hunter has been a long time coming. In June, Bellamy noted in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbIXekZocI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> that its approach to microtransactions was "harming RuneScape" and stated "it's time that we took action. Jagex then experimented with a number of different changes to in-game purchases. In September, Bellamy said in an <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/jagex-prepared-to-take-financial" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a> that Jagex "probably won't maintain the revenue that we currently are" when making changes to microtransactions.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's the truth," Bellamy said.

            <p>
Undoubtedly the only thing anyone in the PC world will be talking about for the next week is Valve's trio of hardware announcements, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a>, and their new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>. But don't forget about the old Steam Deck just yet! While Valve didn't announce anything handheld related today, they have commented on where they're at when it comes to anything like a Steam Deck 2.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-says-it-has-a-pretty-good-idea-of-what-steam-deck-2-is-going-to-be-explains-why-its-holding-off-for-now">IGN</a>, Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais shared that there are plans for an upgraded version of the Steam Deck somewhere along the line, it's just that the technology just isn't there yet. "Obviously the Steam Deck's not our focus today, but the same things we've said in the past where we're really interested to work on what's next for Steam Deck… the thing we're making sure of is that it's a worthwhile enough performance upgrade to make sense as a standalone product," Griffais  said.
</p>
<p>
He noted how Valve isn't interested in marginal improvements of performance at the same battery life, and that they "want something a little bit more demarcated than that… and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be, but right now there's no offerings in that landscape, in the SoC [System on a Chip] landscape, that we think would truly be a next-gen performance Steam Deck."
</p>
<p>
Not that we should be encouraging hours upon hours of playing games, but battery life is one thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">even the Steam Deck OLED struggles with</a>. It does run better than the original Steam Deck, it just also isn't necessarily all that suited for taking on the go, which is kind of the point of these things. Hopefully Valve have plans bigger than just better battery life. I dislike that new generation of consoles offer uniformly the same experience as their predecessors but with slightly fancier graphics, and don't want to see that in a hypothetical Steam Deck 2.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-1-2-review-aaron-paul-critical-role-2000639678">Superhero workplace comedy game <em>Dispatch</em></a> has proven to be a big hit this year, already selling over a million copies since launching in October. And the fandom around the game is ravenous, with many players deeply invested in the narrative-driven adventure game’s romances. This caught the devs off guard, and might lead to some cut sex scenes returning in some form.</p> <p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dispatch-romance-deleted-sex-scenes-telltale-developers-exclusive-interview">In a new interview with <em>Inverse</em>,</a>&nbsp;<em>Dispatch</em> writer Pierre Shorette talked about how the game came together over the last few years and was asked about fans going wild over the few relationship and romance options in the superhero game developed by some former Telltale folks.</p>  <p>“I don’t know that I anticipated it to be as ravenous as it’s been,” said Shorette of the fan reaction. “It’s probably why we didn’t plan for more romance options, because we didn’t know it was going to be such a meaningful part of the experience for folks.” Shorette explained that he often defaults to romantic comedy when writing and has tried to resist this tendency, but romance was never an intentional focus of <em>Dispatch.</em> Rather, it was just one of the many parts of the game. Still, seeing the fans react to the romance and sex that exist in the game has Shorette wondering if they made a mistake.</p> <p>“We definitely cut some sex scenes. Which, in retrospect, we shouldn’t have,” Shorette told the outlet. “Maybe folks will get to see those one day.”</p> <p>“There isn’t anyone on the development team that wouldn’t have a laundry list of stuff they wish they could polish more or gotten into the game. On the writing side, our team has a bunch of darlings that had to be killed along the way. We’re still an indie studio, I think people forget that because it’s doing so well and looks so good. But because it looks good, it costs a lot per second to make this video game, and sometimes it costs things that often, with these games, is branching too.”</p> <p>Regardless, <a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-dialogue-options-chair-episode-3-golem-choice-2000640791"><em>Dispatch</em></a> has proven to be a big hit, with fans begging the devs for another season. And that might just happen. But for now, Shorette and the team at Ad Hoc Studios are just happy people like <em>Dispatch</em> so much.&nbsp; All eight episodes of <em>Dispatch</em> are out now on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

                <p>Even former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime was surprised by the somewhat sparse launch lineup of the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>"I wouldn't be completely honest if [I didn't say] from a business perspective, when I first saw that lineup, I scratched my head a little bit," said Fils-Aime--who served as Nintendo of America's president and chief operating officer from 2006 until he retired in 2019--during an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about?triedRedirect=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "But I think certainly what I underestimated was the enhanced performance, the enhanced Nintendo Switch 1 content, I think has been compelling. The stuff that you get for free as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, I think that has helped drive some of the momentum. And then certainly Bananza was a key driver for them."</p><p>When the original Switch launched in 2017, it was accompanied by The Legend of Zelda: Breathe of the Wild and joined later in the year by Super Mario Odyssey. Switch 2's big launch title was Mario Kart World in June 2025, followed by Donkey Kong Bananza a month later. But while many didn't consider those games to be system sellers, they were both hits with players and critics alike.</p><p>Fils-Aime attributed the success of the Switch 2 launch to Nintendo's global team and noted that "being able to successfully launch a new system after you've had historical success with the prior system is quite a challenge." He pointed to several examples of that, including Nintendo following the Wii with the less successful Wii U.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alum-reggie-subtly-roasts-switch-2-welcome-tour-price/1100-6530775/" data-ref-id="1100-6530775">Fils-Aime appeared to disagree</a> with Nintendo's decision to charge $10 for the Switch 2 Welcome Pack. As a contrast, he compared it to his decision to release Wii Sports as an included title for Wii consoles in North America. In 2022, Fils-Aime predicted that the large number of studio acquisitions by Sony and Microsoft would lead <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nintendo-of-america-boss-reggie-fils-aime-reacts-to-microsoft-and-sonys-acquisition-sprees/1100-6507374/" data-ref-id="1100-6507374">to senior designers breaking away</a> and launching their own innovative games. There have been some high-profile directors and designers that left larger companies, but Fils-Aime noted a lack of innovation during his new interview.</p><p>"I do hope that this industry doesn't stagnate," said Fils-Aime. "There are, at times, signs that the innovation isn't there. The breakthrough new type of content seems to be a little bit further and far between. That concerns me, and I hope that doesn't stop."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/as-arc-raiders-takes-off-developer-embark-defends-its-use-of-ai-tools">Embark caught some flak for this approach</a> (which was also used in the company's other major release, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/finals">The Finals</a>), to the extent that our friends over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Eurogamer</a> took a stand and marked the game down for its use of GenAI.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">Automaton Media</a>, ARC Raider publisher Nexon has now added its voice to the mix, with CEO Junghun Lee telling Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game*Spark</a> that "it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI."</p>

<p>While Lee goes on to clarify that human creativity is the key ingredient even in a world dominated by AI, his initial statement has triggered a frosty reception from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> developer Necrosoft Games.</p>
<p>"Not only do we not use AI we would rather cut off our own arms than do so," says the studio in a post on social media. "Demonschool is 100% human made."</p>
<p>Demonschool is a tactical RPG with a focus on swift combat that takes inspiration from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-persona-games-on-switch-and-nintendo-systems">Persona</a> series. It launches on November 19th. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hands-on-demonschool-is-a-love-letter-to-ds-games-and-italian-horror-movies">We previewed it back in 2022</a>, so give that a read if it sounds like it's up your street.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/16-cool-details-about-valve%E2%80%99s-new-steam-console-controller-and-vr-headset.1351885/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">Valve announced not one, not two, but three new pieces of video game hardware</a>: The console-like Steam Machine, the Steam Frame VR headset, and the Steam Controller. All of this stuff launches sometime in 2026 (<a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">price unknown</a>) and works together, alongside the Steam Deck, to create what is shaping up to be an impressive Steam ecosystem that rivals anything from Xbox, PlayStation, Apple, or Nintendo.</p>

 <p>But announcing three pieces of gaming hardware in one day means there are a lot of information and interviews floating around. So I’ve read through all of it, as well as all of Valve’s own posts, to narrow down 16 interesting, cool, important, and fun details about the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-controller-steamos-reaction-price-date-2000643563">Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller</a>.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Machine is bringing back Xbox 360-like faceplates</h2> <p>Valve’s new Steam console features a removable faceplate that reminds me a lot of the Xbox 360 faceplates from back in the day. Sadly, the company doesn’t sound committed to selling different plates, but they will be sharing all the files needed to 3D print your own. So I expect a lot of third-party plates will be available after launch. Oh, and Valve, you should totally sell this e-ink plate, please!</p>   <h2>Valve wants every game running at 4K60 on Steam Machine</h2> <p>“Our benchmark has always been that it should have enough performance to play every game on Steam at 4K60 when you do some sort of upscaling like FSR,” Yazan Aldehayyat, a Valve engineer working on the Steam Machine, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/steam-machine-specs-availability/">told<em> PC Gamer.</em></a> That’s a pretty big promise and likely will mean some newer, Unreal Engine 5 games will need to have their settings lowered a lot. But games from a few years ago, indie titles, and other similar titles should run like a dream on the device.</p>

 <h2>You can easily expand Steam Machine’s storage and even change the RAM</h2> <p>Valve has designed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine">Steam Machine</a> to let you add more SSD storage easily if you so desire. You can also slap in a fast, high-performance SD Card to add more storage. And for those willing to open the console up a bit more, you can even replace the RAM, though Valve says this will be tricky and likely not something most people do.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Machine is reportedly very, very quiet</h2> <p>According to <em>PC Gamer</em>, the Steam Machine is very quiet. Even while playing <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and standing close to the Steam console, it barely made any noise.</p> <h2>It’s also just a computer, if you want</h2> <p>Similar to the Steam Deck, Valve has designed the Steam Machine to be usable as a computer. Hook it up to a monitor, connect a mouse and keyboard, and you have a beefy little Linux-powered desktop PC that can run Steam and other software easily.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643621"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643621">©Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>You can wirelessly connect four Steam Controllers to the Steam Machine</h2> <p>Want to play a game with your pals on the Steam Machine? Well, good news: It supports four Steam Controllers at once without needing any extra dongles. Nifty stuff!</p> <h2>Steam Machine can run Windows, if you like that kind of thing</h2> <p>If you’re someone who prefers gaming on Windows, you can swap out SteamOS for Windows 11 and run that operating system instead. I wouldn’t recommend doing this, but hey, I’m not your dad.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Machine will be available in every country where the Steam Deck is sold</h2> <p>If you can legally buy a Steam Deck where you live now, you’ll be able to buy a Steam Machine, Frame, and Controller when they launch globally in 2026. Here’s the list of countries where the Steam Deck is currently for sale:</p> <ul id="658bd5bd-5531-4e7a-8de2-8daaef2adc91"> <li>USA</li> <li>Canada</li> <li>UK</li> <li>Germany</li> <li>France</li> <li>Australia</li> <li>Japan</li> <li>South Korea</li> <li>Taiwan</li> <li>Hong Kong</li> </ul> <h2>The Steam Deck, Controller, and Frame VR headset all work together</h2> <p>Valve is making a big deal about how all of these new Steam devices work together and connect in various ways. So you can, for example, stream a newer game from your Steam Machine to your Steam Deck. Or play a Steam Deck favorite of yours natively on the Steam Frame headset while using the Steam Controller completely wirelessly. And of course, all your Steam games and progress hop around seamlessly between every device.</p>

 <h2>Steam Controller’s thumbsticks sound very fancy</h2> <p>The Steam Controller includes <a href="https://tmrjoystick.com/">Tunnel Magnetoresistance (TMR) thumbsticks,</a> which are even better, more reliable, and more precise than Hall Effect sticks.&nbsp;“They’re super responsive, meaning that we’re able to lower the default dead zone by more than half. And super reliable. They’ll keep drift at bay much, much, much longer. These things are super great,” Steve Cardinali, an engineer at Valve, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/controllers/steam-controller-specs-availability-hands-on/">told <em>PC Gamer.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>The Steam Controller fully supports gyro aiming</h2> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/controllers/how-gyro-support-was-added-into-the-new-steam-controller-is-a-typical-valve-story/">Here’s a fun story:</a> The Steam Controller features full gyroscopic control because one person at Valve is way into gyro aiming and moved his desk into the same place the device was being designed to help get the feature in the gamepad. All you fans of gyro aiming should thank that person if you get the chance.</p> <h2>Steam Frame is basically a Steam Deck on your face</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000643622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643622"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643622">©Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While they don’t run on the same hardware, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamframe">Steam Frame VR headset</a> runs the same OS as the Steam Deck and should feel familiar to anyone who has played Valve’s portable PC. And because it’s a standalone device that runs SteamOS natively, all your Steam Deck games can be played on it in a big virtual theater.</p>

 <h2>The new VR headset is built for streaming, so no more wires</h2> <p>While you can plug a Steam Frame into a computer, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/vr-hardware/hands-on-steam-frame-impressions/">Valve has designed the device to be totally wireless</a>. It uses a dedicated 6 GHz connection via an included USB dongle to make sure your game is streamed perfectly to the headset. Those who have tried it out say it’s flawless, and the lack of cables is freeing in games like <em>Half-Life: Alyx.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>All Steam Deck Verified games will instantly be Steam Machine Verified</h2> <p>Valve is expanding its Verified program with the launch of all this new hardware. So now games can be Steam Deck, Steam Machine, and/or Steam Frame Verified. And because the Steam Machine is so much more powerful than the Steam Deck and supports a controller experience, Valve is automatically marking all Steam Deck Verified games as Steam Machine Verified. That means this device will launch in 2026 with a shit-ton of games that should, in theory, just play without issue on it.</p> <h2>You can stream games from the Steam Machine to the Steam Deck</h2> <p>While someone is watching TV, you can use the Steam Machine to play a newer, more taxing game on your Steam Deck wirelessly via streaming. It’s like the Wii U is back, but actually good.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Rogue Piece monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free Gems and Cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogue Piece is an exciting anime-based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monsterverze-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that is based on the ultra-popular anime series One Piece, while also taking inspiration from various other anime shows. Players progress through the game by exploring various islands, defeating enemies along the way to get stronger and level up. The enemies that players will have to face get stronger as the game progresses, which makes grinding that much harder, and that’s where Rogue Piece codes can be of use to players. The codes will provide players with some much-needed resources, which can be used to get stronger weapons and upgrade existing abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-rogue-piece-codes">How To Redeem Rogue Piece Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rogue Piece Codes Redemption Page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Many Roblox games nowadays require players to complete certain steps before they’re able to redeem codes in the respective game. Some require players to follow the social media profiles of the developers, while others force players to join the game’s official Discord server before the code redemption feature gets unlocked for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogue Piece, however, doesn’t fall into the category. Redeeming codes in Rogue Piece is as simple as navigating through the menus and inputting one of the active codes given above into the correct text box. For newer players of the game who may be unfamiliar with the Roblox menu ecosystem, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to redeeming codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Rogue Piece.</li>



<li>Click on the settings button on the left side of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down till you see the ‘code’ text box.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click the ‘Enter’ button to claim your reward.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-rogue-piece-codes">How To Get More Rogue Piece Codes</h2>



<p>The developers of Rogue Piece often drop new codes during updates or special events, which means that the next set of codes could be released very soon. However, tracking the release of these codes can be a hassle, as it requires players to comb through the game’s social media handles or Discord server regularly. Instead, the easiest way for players to stay up to date with the latest codes would be to bookmark this page. We update this article immediately after any new codes are dropped, making it your one-stop shop for all things Roblox codes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Congratulations to Pikachu.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The New York Videogame Critics Circle has unveiled the winner of its annual Andrew Yoon Legend Award ahead of the New York Game Awards in January. And unlike past years, it's not going to an individual luminary from the video game industry. It's going to...the Pokémon franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a first in the award's ten-year history, with past winners including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sam-lake-receives-andrew-yoon-legend-award-new-york-game-awards-alan-wake-control-remedy">Sam Lake</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-creative-head-neil-druckmann-to-receive-nyvgcc-legend-award">Neil Druckmann</a>, Phil Spencer, Tim Schafer, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/29/reggie-fils-aime-to-be-awarded-new-york-game-awards-legend-prize">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a>. That's not to say the award hasn't been flexible in its definition before, though. In its first year, 2016, the award was given to a studio: Rockstar Games. And in 2021, the award was given to four people: Jerry Lawson, Hideo Kojima, Brenda Romero, and John Romeo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's still unusual to see the Legend award go to a franchise. On its website and in past years, the NYVGCC has described the award as going to "a game changer in the video games industry" and "those who have propelled the gaming world forward, celebrating their profound impact on an industry that continues to captivate and connect people worldwide." This year, the press release describes the award's purpose as to "recognize industry icons and organizations that exhibited a significant, sustained body of work demonstrating exceptional artistic achievement and innovation."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Per the NYVGCC, Pokémon was chosen as "an iconic staple of global popular culture, breaking through to video game and mainstream audiences in the mid-to-late 90s with a unique combination of collectibility, strong and approachable RPG gameplay and unparalleled character design." The release cites its $12 billion in global retail sales in 2024, over 489 million game copies sold since 1996, and the fact that it's one of the highest-grossing media franchises. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">gave the most recent Pokemon game, Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, an 8/10, saying it "finally feels like Game Freak hitting its stride in Pokémon's 3D era, with a fun setting to explore, a well-written story, and a total battle system overhaul that works surprisingly well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How do you articulate the impact of a cultural phenomenon like Pokémon? ‘Legend’ is the only word that comes to mind,” said Harold Goldberg, the president and founder of NYVGCC. “For 30 years, the franchise has grown to become the most recognizable game series in the world and is beloved for its unique monster designs that have compelled players young and old to catch ‘em all. It is a tremendous honor to present the company with the Andrew Yoon Legend Award at our 15th celebration of the New York Game Awards.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The award will be accepted by The Pokémon Company at the awards ceremony on January 18, and The Pokémon Company will be in attendance with "two fan-favorite Pokémon" characters available for fan photo opportunities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to NYVGCC for comment on the decision to honor a franchise this year and received the following official statement:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Pokémon Company’s Legend Award heralds the second time the New York Game Awards has decided to honor an overall team over a single individual creator. The first was Rockstar Games in 2016. With their influence across entertainment, console and tabletop gaming for 30 years, we felt that the many people who work with The Pokémon Company deserve to share the prestigious Andrew Yoon Legend Award for our 15th anniversary." </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>After starring in multiple Naughty Dog games, actor Troy Baker continues his working relationship with the studio for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. The actor recently discussed working with director Neil Druckmann, what it feels like to not play the lead in a Naughty Dog game, and how he wants to have a career similar to Oscar-winner George Clooney.</p><p><a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/troy-baker-makes-first-comments-about-naughty-dogs-intergalactic-game-exclusive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to ComicBook</a>, Baker said one thing that's stayed the same working with Druckmann on Intergalactic after starring in The Last of Us series as Joel and as Sam in Uncharted 4 is that they still butt heads.</p><p>"Neil and I will always, it's our vibe," he said. "We just love to butt up against each other. We were doing a table read, and I was literally like, 'Why are you giving me shit right now? I'm asking you a question!' And everybody else is like, 'Our mom and dad are fighting, are we still going to Disneyland?' We're fine. We're fine!"</p><p>Baker didn't say exactly what he and Druckmann were clashing on, nor do we even know much about the character Baker plays in Intergalactic... or the story of the game, for that matter.</p><p>Also in the interview, Baker discussed playing a supporting role in Intergalactic after playing one of the leads in the Last of Us franchise. This time around, Baker said he's excited to sit back somewhat, with Tati Gabrielle's character, Jordan A. Mun, serving as the lead.</p><p>"I've had a hell of a career. This industry owes me nothing. What a ride. I don't think that I deserve or need any more," he said. "But I am enjoying it now, now that I understand more about game development, I enjoy the process more than I do the credit. So I'm enjoying the position that I have, which I still feel is a very important position with Intergalactic."</p><p>Intergalactic is in development now for PlayStation 5, and one of the things that Druckmann keeps saying about it is that it has the "deepest gameplay" ever for a Naughty Dog game, whatever that means. The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-wont-be-released-until-2027-at-the-soonest-report/1100-6530386/" data-ref-id="1100-6530386">not expected to release until 2027</a>. Naughty Dog may also be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p><h2><strong>"I want to be like George Clooney"</strong></h2><p>Baker also discussed his career ambitions on a longer timeline, saying he wants to "be like George Clooney," the Oscar-winning actor whose career has spanned decades and many different genres.</p><p>"I want to have my Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? and my Michael Clayton, and some of his directing work too," Baker said. "He's just an amazing person. The things that he’s able to create and the reason why he continues to be in things like Oceans 11, Up in the Air, or The American is because people just want to work with him."</p><h2>Baker's career</h2><p>Baker may be best known for his roles in Uncharted and The Last of Us, but he's done much more beyond those two Naughty Dog franchises. He also played the main character, Booker DeWitt, in BioShock Infinite and Rhys in Tales from the Borderlands. Baker also voiced Talion in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Agent Jones in Fortnite. Baker is also known for portraying the villain Pagan Min in Far Cry 4 and Higgs in the Death Stranding series, and has voiced Batman in some Lego projects.</p><p>More recently, he played the iconic character Indiana Jones in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Original Indiana Jones actor Harrison Ford <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harrison-ford-praises-troy-baker-and-the-lack-of-ai-for-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/1100-6529281/" data-ref-id="1100-6529281">praised Baker's performance in the game</a> and how he achieved it without AI.</p><p>In 2022, Baker partnered with a blockchain company called Voiceverse and was caught up in drama related to AI and plagiarism. He later <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/troy-baker-ends-partnership-with-nft-firm-and-says-sorry-for-hate-or-create-comment/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cut ties with the company</a> and owned up to what he described as antagonistic remarks he made when the collaboration was first announced.</p><p>Baker is also a musician and has released multiple albums. On TV, he appeared in HBO's The Last of Us in a Season 1 episode as the cannibal <a href="https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/James" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">James</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Valve has announced three major bits of new hardware coming in 2026, with a PC called the Steam Machine, a new wireless VR headset called Steam Frame, and a brand new controller simply named the Steam Controller. The hardware will allow you to play all of your games in your Steam library from indie titles to AAA titles. Additionally, the Steam Machine will let you install apps and different operating systems.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steam Hardware Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So what kind of specs are we looking at? Let’s start with the Steam Machine, which will come in two models with those being one equipped with 512GB NVMe SSD and the other a <wbr>2TB NVMe SSD. All the other hardware will be the same internally, and both will include a high-speed microSD card slot.</p>
<div id="SaleSection_10">
<ul>
<li>CPU :Semi-custom AMD Zen 4 6C / 12T. Up to 4.8 GHz, 30W TDP</li>
<li>GPU: Semi-Custom AMD RDNA3 28CUs. 2.45GHz max sustained clock, 110W TDP</li>
<li>RAM: 16GB DDR5 + 8GB GDDR6 VRAM</li>
<li>Power: Internal power supply, AC power 110-240V</li>
<li>Connectivity: Wi-Fi – 2×2 Wi-Fi 6E. Bluetooth – Bluetooth 5.3 dedicated antenna</li>
<li>Steam Controller: Integrated 2.4 GHz Steam Controller wireless adapter</li>
<li>Displays: DisplayPort 1.4. Up to 4K @ 240Hz or 8K@60Hz. <wbr>Supports HDR, FreeSync, and daisy-chaining</li>
<li>HDMI 2.0: Up to 4K @ 120Hz. <wbr>Supports HDR, FreeSync, and CEC</li>
<li>USB: Two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports in the front. Two USB-A 2.0 High speed ports in the back. <wbr>One USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port in the back</li>
<li>Networking: Gigabit ethernet</li>
<li>LED Strip: 17 individually addressable RGB LEDs for system status and customizability</li>
<li>:Size and Weight: 152 mm tall (148 mm without feet), 162.4 mm deep, 156 mm wide and 2.6 kg</li>
<li>Operating System: SteamOS 3 (Arch-based)</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up is the Steam Frame, which will support both VR and non-VR gaming. So you can strap the headset to your face, and play non VR games without needing another display. The Steam Frame will also come with controllers that are battery powered, so you will need a haul of AA batteries. The full specs for the Steam Frame and controllers are as follows.</p>
<div id="SaleSection_14">
<ul>
<li>Processor: 4 nm Snapdragon® 8 Gen 3. Architecture: ARM64</li>

			<p>Epic has released Unreal Engine 5.7 to developers. This new version of the leading commercially available game-making engine introduces several improvements over previous releases, as well as some new features. </p>



<p>For example, the MegaLights feature, which was previously tagged as Experimental in earlier UE5 builds, has now moved to Beta. With it, developers are allowed to inject a much greater number of dynamic, shadow-casting lights into the scenes of their games to achieve effects such as realistic soft shadows from complex light sources, like area lights. This more scalable lighting workflow enables them to work more intuitively and create larger, richer, and more intricate worlds than ever before.</p>



<p>Unreal Engine 5.7 also delivers a significant enhancement to visual fidelity, offering new support for directional lights, translucency, shadow casting for Niagara particles, and more accurate shading and shadowing on hair. Epic says developers can also expect better out-of-the-box performance, improved noise reduction, and reduced need for manual optimization of lights.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Another highlight of Unreal Engine 5.7 is undoubtedly Nanite Foliage (available as an Experimental feature). Previously, Nanite could not be used with foliage, but that's changed thanks to a new geometry rendering system powered by the so-called Nanite Voxels. These automatically and efficiently draw millions of tiny, overlapping elements that appear as a solid mass from a distance, such as tree canopies, pine needles, and ground clutter. This is achieved at stable frame rates, without cross-fades or pops, and without the need to author LODs. Nanite Foliage also uses Nanite Assemblies to reduce storage, memory and rendering costs, as well as using Nanite Skinning to determine dynamic behaviours such as wind response. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new Unreal Engine 5 also offers an updated Procedural Content Generation (PCG) framework. It's now production-ready, featuring improved GPU performance and a new Editor Mode for easier customization.</p>



<p>This build provides developers with a production-ready version of Substrate, the system designed for creating complex, high-fidelity, physically accurate layered and blended materials. Lastly, Unreal Engine 5.7 adds an AI Assistant that provides helpful guidance directly in the Editor. A dedicated slide-out panel lets the user ask questions, generate C++ code, or access step-by-step guidance without having to leave the Editor.</p>



<p>There are many more fixes and improvements to other systems, such as Metahumans and the animation toolset. Read everything <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-5-7-release-notes">on this page</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has released a <em>Riftbound: Spiritforged</em> preview. The second set in the official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> TCG will introduce new cards, new gameplay mechanics, and feature certain Legends from across the popular franchise.</p>



<p>The <em>Riftbound: Spiritforged</em> preview shows off a small handful of cards, some new prebuilt champion decks, and three new mechanics coming to the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-preview-card-artwork.jpg?itok=WRs6_P1y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-preview-card-artwork.jpg?itok=FAyIjFtp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Equipment is a new card subtype. Equipment can be attached to to units to make them stronger. Interestingly, equipment sticks around even if even if the unit is killed. Gold is a new resource that you can "spend" to get a new resource called Power, which is a required cost for certain cards. Lastly, there is Repeat. A spell with this effect can be doubled if you pay the card's cost a second time.</p>

<p>Some of the cards in the <em>Riftbound: Spiritforged</em> preview showcase some of these new mechanics. These include new Equipment cards such as <em>Guardian Angel</em>, <em>Dorian's Shield</em>, and <em>Sterak's Gage</em>. In keeping with his character, the cards featuring the Legend, Draven involves gaining and using Gold.</p>

<p>Notably, the assets in the preview do confirm at least two new champion decks. One will feature the dangerous duelist, Fiora. The other showcases the genius tinkerer, Rumble. As for how those particular decks will play is anyone's guess.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are 12 new Spirit Blossum-themed Overnumbered cards in the set. These cards are tied thematically to the set, which involves the lifting of the veil between the mortal and spirit realms.</p>

<p>Riftbound launched last month and, despite <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/riot-games-addresses-launch-issues-with-riftbound-origins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some launch issues</a>, has found its audience. It has entered a crowded space of other competitive card games such as <em>Magic The Gathering</em>, <em>Disney Lorcana</em>, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG</em></a>. The Spiritforged set will launch in December 2025 in China, and in English-speaking regions February 2026.</p>
