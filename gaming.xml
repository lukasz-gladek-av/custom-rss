In my limited experience, it was always too laggy, made the games look ugly as shit, and needed far too potent a signal to work even passably well. However, I went away this past weekend and didn’t want to lug around either of my consoles, so I gave it an earnest shot again and I must say, I’m <em>pleasantly </em>surprised with how far cloud and remote gaming’s come.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,196923" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>My biggest motivating factor for giving these alternatives another shot is that I simply did not want to be away from my PS5, which has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/elden-ring&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a></span><em>:</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a></span> currently installed on it. Despite starting the DLC prior to my trip, my attention’s been pulled in a million different directions and I’ve not been able to commit the time I wish I could give it. So I made it a point this weekend to try out my PS5’s Remote Play from my gaming laptop, dig into the DLC as much as I could, and test the bounds of the tech.</p><h2 id="h2565"><a id=""></a>Remote and cloud gaming has come a long way</h2><p>The last time I tried Remote Play—which doesn’t use the cloud since your games must be installed on your PlayStation console—was back in 2020. I tried playing <em>Persona 5</em> from the comfort of my own bed just a room over from my console and router and it was awful. Around the same time, the tech allowing you to stream games was beginning to take off, and my experience with it was pretty similar. Whenever the streams did manage to stay up for a bit longer than usual—since I was forcibly disconnected pretty quickly—screen tearing made it an illegible mess. “Surely,” I thought, “if my decent internet can’t even handle this, it’s got to be a mess for most everyone else,” and I never bothered touching either function again.</p><p>This time around, I had a much smoother experience, though it wasn’t without some predictable hiccups. At first, my laptop struggled to find my PS5 back home, which it searched for via the internet. Thankfully, my roommate helped me by turning my console on and off and ensuring it was on rest mode so that I could finally connect. When I finally managed to establish a connection, my video stream almost immediately froze, though I could still hear my inputs being acknowledged. After a few restarts, I learned I couldn’t really idle for fear of my stream immediately freezing again, meaning I had to twiddle the thumbsticks rather than stay put. It was a small but annoying price to pay in order to keep playing, and I sucked it up because I really wanted to get through the <em>Elden Ring</em> DLC.</p><p>Once the issues (mostly) cleared up though, it was kind of stunning how well Remote Play worked. I managed to make quite a bit of progress in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a></span>, clearing the entirety of a dungeon and even defeating the Divine Beast Dancing Lion in two tries. There was no significant input lag, and after I solved the freezing issue, it rarely disconnected. I think I was able to put most of, if not more than, an hour into the expansion with a few stutters, but no major disconnections or freezes. The game <em>did </em>seem to get overwhelmed by two agile enemies who rushed me just outside a boss arena and crashed my Remote Play session, but they were the exception in what eventually became a pretty smooth experience. I was genuinely impressed by how well it eventually held up, even if the biggest issue appears to be that Remote Play struggles maintaining a stable connection for long periods of time.</p><p>By comparison, XCloud—Microsoft’s entirely cloud-driven gaming experience that allows you to stream whole games without installation—was a surprisingly more stable experience due to built-in compensations. While <em>Elden Ring </em>remained a mostly gorgeous game streaming from my PS5 (since it was installed), games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/another-crabs-treasure-review-1851435745&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/another-crabs-treasure-review-1851435745"><em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-show-impressions-good-in-2024-updates-1851428848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-76-show-impressions-good-in-2024-updates-1851428848"><em>Fallout 76</em></a></span><em>,</em> which weren’t downloaded to my Xbox,<em> </em>appeared much more washed out on stream.The tradeoff, however, was that they ran fuckton better and my cloud session never crashed or froze. When I first tested the capabilities of XCloud at home, where my internet connection is strained between me and my roommates’ countless devices, it seemed to barely hold up, and there was significant screen tearing every few seconds. On my parents’ much less populated connection, it worked like a charm, even if the games kind of looked ugly as sin.</p><p>Though neither experience was without its blemishes, I was able to get in, play my games, and get out, and that’s about all I could ask for. My time with Remote Play was leagues better than the experience I had years ago, and despite my hang ups, I have to admit that XCloud earnestly impressed me. I’m actually stoked to see how it continues to develop now. Anything to not have to carry around those ugly (and heavy) ass boxes anywhere anymore. Congratulations, y’all have made a convert out of me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>GMs (Game Masters) are always taking inspiration from other media to implement new ideas into their world, and it looks like Wizards of the Coast is no different, because Larian Studios<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/"> Baldur's Gate 3</a> has directly influenced how certain mechanics now work in Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p dir="ltr">The news comes from the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0rXo-Wp_II&amp;t=7s"> official Dungeons &amp; Dragons YouTube channel</a> (via<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-dragons-rules-update-includes-changes-prompted-by-games-lead-designer-playing-baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow "> Eurogamer</a>), where D&amp;D developers explain the 2024 Player's Handbook. Lead designer Jeremy Crawford says his time with Baldur's Gate 3 played a huge part in changing the rules for a few spells, including Cloud of Daggers and Produce Flame.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0rXo-Wp_II" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="7">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P0rXo-Wp_II?start=7" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Now, whenever a spell caster uses Cloud of Daggers, they can move it around the battlefield to ensure it inflicts as much damage as possible. Crawford had wanted to do this for some time, but Baldur's Gate 3 was the final nail in the coffin that made him pull the trigger on changing the rule.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some spells that were really painful to cast in terms of their action economy are far less painful," Crawford said.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/2024/7/2/24189959/overboard-hues-and-cues-color-guessing-mattie-lubchanksy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="gkidDD">Many boardgames in the party game genre like to test the players knowledge with trivia or social deduction. It’s all in good fun, but there are objectively correct answers. That immediately makes <em>Hues and Cues </em>a different experience, because this game is all about the subjective task of describing a color.</p>
<p id="SDNBJp">What specific shade of yellow is a school bus? Does oat milk have a particular color? Which is the more royal hue: Blue or purple? These are the sorts of questions you’ll be contending with in <em>Hues and Cues</em>, which we played in the latest episode of Overboard with special guests <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flinktr.ee%2Flubchansky&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Ftabletop-games%2F2024%2F7%2F2%2F24189959%2Foverboard-hues-and-cues-color-guessing-mattie-lubchanksy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23954000__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://linktr.ee/lubchansky\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/2024/7/2/24189959/overboard-hues-and-cues-color-guessing-mattie-lubchanksy&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23954000__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://linktr.ee/lubchansky&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/2024/7/2/24189959/overboard-hues-and-cues-color-guessing-mattie-lubchanksy&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Mattie Lubchansky</a> and <a href="https://www.eater.com/authors/jaya-saxena">Jaya Saxena</a>.</p>
<p id="B96Kic">In <em>Hues and Cues</em>, the cue giver selects a color from four choices on a card before giving their first cue. There are only a few rules that the cue giver must follow: The cue must be one word, and it can’t include a basic color, like red or green, though fancy colors like vermillion and chartreuse are legal. They also can’t use a specific object in the room, a cue that’s already been used, or a letter or number that could point to its location on the board.</p>
<p id="Gyaqdw">Once every player has made a color selection in clockwise order, the cue giver can give a second cue. This time it can be two words, but they must avoid using words that directly indicate it’s position relative to the player’s guesses, like “darker” or “south.” After all the players have made their second guess (this time in counter-clockwise order), the cue giver places the score box around their hue.</p>
<p id="syOhPe">Points are awarded based on how close players get to the correct hue, while the cue giver gets points for every guess inside the score box. After every player has been cue giver twice, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins. The game can be made easier for beginning players by letting cue givers select their color from the entire board, or harder by limiting the cues to specific categories like comic book characters or Pokémon. Either way, it’s an immensely fun party game that’s sure to provoke strange discussion about just what colors even are.</p>

Features like the hundreds of character customization sliders and pronoun options separate from your character’s gender live up to game director Corinne Busche’s promise that Dragon Age: The Veilguard was created with inclusivity in mind. This desire was carried over into the difficulty options too, which include standard choices like the story-focused Storyteller path, a balanced Adventurer mode, or the more crushing Nightmare mode, which can’t be changed once a playthrough is started.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/11/the-veilguard-1718088314067.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will have a host of difficulty options.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Where BioWare’s latest gets interesting in this regard is its Unbound difficulty mode. This option is said to allow players to tailor their Dragon Age: The Veilguard adventure as they please with a variety of tweakable settings. Some highlights include the ability to adjust how wayfinding guides the experience, aim assistance, an auto-aim option, and wider (or narrower) parry windows. Enemy and player damage can also be finetuned, as can enemy pressure, but the real game-changer might be the option to turn off death for your character entirely. These are all options meant to make Dragon Age: The Veilguard more inviting for every kind of gaming fan.</p><p>"[None of these options] are a cheat," Busche explained. "It's an option to make sure players of all abilities can show up."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Game Informer was unable to view every difficulty and accessibility setting BioWare will offer, but Busche says players can expect to find more options upon launch. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is currently set to come to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S sometime this fall.

            <p>
Somehow I'd missed hit horror movie franchise A Quiet Place was getting a video game adaptation (it turns out I'm just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-revealed-for-pc-and-consoles">deeply inattentive</a>), but barely a month after its re-reveal, a fresh look at its alien-evading action has come our way - and it definitely shows potential, assuming you've got the constitution for a game of near-silent sneakery and one-wrong-move tension.
</p>
<p>
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-quiet-place-is-a-new-single-player-story-driven-horror-game-based-on-the-film">announced back in October 2021</a> before (appropriately) going silent for a while, and is the work of Stormind Games - the studio behind 2018's surprisingly effective Clock-Tower-inspired pursuit horror Remothered: Tormented Fathers. It doesn't have a release yet, but it's currently expected to launch this year.
</p>
<p>
Unfolding across an "eerily tranquil, post-apocalyptic landscape", A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead casts players as Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin. She'll face "interpersonal family conflicts, all while coming to terms with her own inner fears" - as well as lots of silently insistent pointing, judging by the new trailer.

<p>
In gameplay terms, The Road Ahead is a first-person stealth-horror requiring players to minimise the noise they're making as they attempt to evade their sonically sensitive pursuers. There's also a shotgun and a car chase in there, so it clearly won't <em>all</em> be irritated shushing.
</p>
<p>
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead doesn't have a release date yet, but it'll be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2233120/A_Quiet_Place_The_Road_Ahead/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009366">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead/9NZLPG7P5KSS">Xbox Series X/S</a> when it eventually shows up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24190812/skaven-age-of-sigmar-army-warhammer-40k-addition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="8AL3Fe"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/warhammer-40k"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> is stuffed to the brim with bad guys; nearly every faction racks up atrocities on the daily. There’s the protagonist faction, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24113824/warhammer-40k-god-emperor-lore-dark-king-star-child-godblight">Imperium of Man</a>, which is quite literally the most brutal and inhumane regime possible. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/6/18253801/warhammer-40k-chaos-space-marines-abaddon-sisters-of-battle-new-models">Chaos Space Marines</a> are engaged in a 10,000-year-long war, using the powers of the dark gods to fuel their armies. And, of course, there’s the stupid, sexy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23801775/warhammer-40k-drukhari-faction-lore-dark-eldar-xenos-fun">Dark Eldar</a> who torture and pillage their way through the galaxy. But there’s one specific kind of bad guy that’s missing from the setting, and a recent <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161719/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-launch-box-reveal-preview-weekend-40k-aos-sisters-of-battle"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> release throws that into stark relief: I demand that Games Workshop add Skaven to 40K, you <em>cowards</em>.</p>
<p id="ejqSdd">The Skaven are a longtime presence in the Warhammer fantasy settings, including <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, an alternative fantasy setting introduced in 2015. <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2024/05/17/skaventide-is-the-jam-packed-launch-box-for-the-new-edition-of-warhammer-age-of-sigmar/">The new <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> <em>Skaventide</em> box set</a> — which went up for pre-order on June 29 — pits the Skaven, a ravenous horde of rat men who are scratching at every door and every dimension in hopes of finding something to feast upon, against the noble Stormcast Eternals. <em>Age of Sigmar</em> has some great villains, like the father of necromancy and all-time hater Nagash, but few are as beloved as the Skaven. They’re even the antagonist in the popular Vermintide games developed by Fatshark. You can’t truly escape the Skaven, and the only saving grace is that they’re so busy fighting each other that they sometimes forget about their mission of total annihilation.</p>
<div id="85ipIe"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ZSiQ8lG0fs?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="RKmcJz">The Skaven are bipedal critters who swarm en masse, which is obviously dangerous in and of itself, but the fact that they have a decent grasp on technology just makes matters worse. In the original <em>Warhammer Fantasy Battles</em>, the human empires largely denied the existence of Skaven. (There are no rats living in Altdorf, waiting to rise up and overthrow humanity. That’s <em>ridiculous</em>; you must be just seeing things. Do not ask any more questions about the giant rats whomst walk like men.) They worship a Chaos entity called the Great Horned Rat, who is not a literal rat, but the metaphysical manifestation of all things ratlike. </p>
<p id="cj5bOa">The Great Horned Rat has a furry finger in a lot of different pies, but its main objective is just keeping the rest of its horde organized and focused. In the lore of <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, a magical apocalypse has shattered the traditional fantasy realm of<em> Warhammer Fantasy Battles</em>, and the setting is more of a multiverse. There are eight mortal realms, and then layers of sub-realms and alternate realities. One of these is the home of the Skaven, Blight City. The Skaven have organized themselves into 13 clans and have gnawed holes into each of the eight realms. Each Skaven thinks that they’re the best rat around, which makes for a bunch of backstabbing, betrayal, and bickering.</p>
<p id="LNPITg">The Skaven are known for their use of warpstone, an extremely powerful crystal formed of pure Chaos energy, to power technology that’s highly volatile — but, also, great for doing murder. Sure, a few dozen rats might get exploded into a fine mist when getting a given McGuffin dialed in correctly, but that’s a small price for an extremely powerful auto-cannon or a far-reaching communications device.</p>
<p id="eQybvS">But why would we want a faction of sentient rats in the grim darkness of the far future? Well, we mentioned that warpstone. But also? The Great Horned Rat is kind of a big deal. Traditionally, the Warhammer settings have four Chaos gods: the violent Khorne, the scheming Tzeentch, the rapturous Slaanesh, and the plague-loving Nurgle. In <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, the Great Horned Rat is also at the table, which is a feat that many have tried but none have managed. So why not fully elevate the Skaven to the science fiction big leagues?</p>
<p id="tSpt8z">As a faction, the Skaven are in an interesting place because of their inherent duality. On one hand, they’re a bunch of silly little guys scampering around and getting up to antics. On the other hand, they’re terrifying creatures who want nothing more than to flay you and then gnaw on your bones. A Hammer and Bolter episode, normally available as part of the subscription service Warhammer Plus, was recently made available on YouTube. It shows how hunting the Skaven is a difficult task.</p>
<div id="GG43NX"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9R24vuaesUA?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="39XIxA">Making matters worse, recent developments in the lore of <em>Age of Sigmar </em>have put the Skaven on the offensive. They’re no longer content with raiding and pillaging from afar. Archaon the Everchosen, one of the main antagonists of <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, teamed up with the Great Horned Rat to teleport the sub-realm of Blight City into reality. A huge chunk of Blight City showed up in the realm of Aqshy, one of the mortal realms, in an event called the Vermindoom.</p>
<p id="AHjLXM">For context, imagine you saw some rat holes gnawed into the foundation of your house. You’d probably be pretty concerned, driven to put down traps and call an exterminator. Now, imagine the rats smashed through the drywall and took over the master bedroom. Before long, you might find yourself barricaded in the basement, hoping that the rat men are content with raiding your fridge for cheese.</p>
<p id="nInJ0r">It’s perhaps no surprise that the Skaven are so popular that fans regularly demand they show up in Warhammer 40,000 as well. Let me join them in saying: Please, Games Workshop, let the rat army show up in the far sci-fi future of 40K as more than just a rare cameo. It’s what we deserve. Some antagonists are nuanced, and we’re meant to see reflections of ourselves in their own moral failings. Others are giant stinky rats with a massive cannon, and that’s great. They don’t even need spaceships — rats are infamous for hitching a ride on vessels, after all. Why not a Space Hulk? </p>
<p id="2Cu0BF">I, for one, would be willing to bend the knee to our new sci-fi rat overlords — so long as Games Workshop can bring a decent 2,000-point army down to a reasonable number of miniatures. </p>

Did the community reject <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>?

They <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SonicFox/status/1807891861681721612&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SonicFox/status/1807891861681721612" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weighed in</a></span> and said while <em>MK1</em> has issues, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>’s lower standing in tournament sign ups is likely the effect of years of community members dunking on the series—not just a potential dissatisfaction with the latest game.</p><p>“This has been ongoing for years,” they said in a tweet. “I genuinely believe the game is incredibly good, and is arguably in its best spot yet, but folks do not stop talking about it in a negative light.

Maintaining a high player count requires just as much attention to be given to people not looking to throw down at their local tournament.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Yeah since release, I’ve only spent 45 hours on this game (according to my stats),” MANavarro17 wrote on Reddit. “The combat and Kameo mechanics are great, but as a casual, the grind is just ass and doesn’t feel as rewarding compared to previous games. ‘Invasions’ isn’t fun at all, most times frustrating and tedious.”</p><p>“The kameos were a bad idea imo,” Exciting_Passenger39 wrote. “I thought it was going to be like a tag team setup not this bs we got.”</p><p>“For all intents and purposes, I’m a mega fan of this franchise but I must say, yeah, I’m not super enthralled with <em>MK1</em>,” RealmJumper15 wrote. “The gameplay is fun and the Kameo system is neat but outside of that the game doesn’t really have anything to keep me around.”</p></blockquote><p>But some still argue that <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>(and the franchise broadly) isn’t built for long-term competitive play, and that’s what makes it approachable compared than its contemporaries. So perhaps it doesn’t matter that it doesn’t draw as many competitive players to EVO.</p><p>“I think it’s probably because of the entirely competitive side of things,” ChemistryTasty8751 wrote. “Other fighting games like <em>Street Fighter</em> and <em>Tekken</em> pride themselves on balancing for pro play and competitive, trying to outdo each other with high-budget tournaments. Meanwhile <em>Mortal Kombat</em> don’t fuck with that. <em>Mortal Kombat</em> is a game that prioritizes casual fun because it’s the only fighting game I would actually recommend to newbies because it’s not ‘you need to hit this frame perfect input and space yourself at this exact point to remove end lag’ It’s more ‘here’s your character, go nuts.”</p><p>But in the broader competitive landscape, is it not concerning that <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>is trailing so far behind not only its direct competitors, but its own games?</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“This is actually hilariously pitiful,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1dszfbq/evo_final_registration_numbers_for_mk1/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1dszfbq/evo_final_registration_numbers_for_mk1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NatiHanson wrote</a></span> regarding <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>’s registration numbers on Reddit. “People are gonna come up with different forms of copuim, but this is sad. Year 2 MKX had more entrants than this. NetherRealm were completely caught off guard with the competition (<em>T8</em>, <em>SF6</em>), and I don’t think Kameos caught on like they hoped.”</p><p>“<em>Tekken</em> and <em>SF</em> and even anime are putting out the best products they probably ever have (I’m not saying game DESIGN necessarily - but just AS A PRODUCT),” Vergilkilla wrote in response. “Meanwhile NRS—while the gameplay of <em>MK1</em> is a massive improvement over <em>MK11</em>—as a product it is worse. Buggier, less content, less modes, worse online than the previous game for some reason. It’s a worse consumer product even if it is a better game. You can’t be going backward when all your competitors are going way, way forward.”</p></blockquote><p>Ultimately, <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>might not be dead, but it is clearly in an odd spot in both its competitive and casual scenes. What lessons will NetherRealm learn from this, if any? Is the lesson that the studio should make <em>Injustice 3</em> instead? That’s what I would like to see.

<p>Nexon certainly has a reputation in the gaming community for its numerous projects falling by the wayside. As such, folks feel somewhat cautious about approaching The First Descendant—a free-to-play third-person shooter that resembles a mixture of Destiny 2 and Warframe. But if you’re on the fence, this may be the deciding factor you need to try the game. So, do you need a Nexon account to play The First Descendant?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-the-first-descendant-require-a-nexon-account">Does The First Descendant Require a Nexon Account?</h2>



<p>You’ll be happy to know that The First Descendant does not require a Nexon account to play the free-to-play looter-shooter. You require an account if you wish to participate in the game’s cross-progression mechanics or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-score-all-of-the-first-descendant-twitch-drops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">receive the game’s many Twitch Drops</a>.</p>



<p>If you don’t care about cosmetics, emotes, or in-game currency, and if you only play your games on a single system, you don’t need to worry about signing up for a Nexon account. But if you intend to dive deep into The First Descendant on, say, PC and PlayStation 5, then you’ll want to sign up for a free Nexon account.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-the-first-descendant-cross-progression-works">How The First Descendant Cross-Progression Works</h2>



<p>As mentioned, The First Descendant does offer cross-progression support. However, you must sign up for a Nexon account to use the system. Once you’re set, the game will allow you to pick up your progress, characters, stats, and equipment on any <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-systems-first-descendant-releasing-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supported system</a>. Currently, The First Descendant is available on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S—free to download and play on any of these systems!</p>

<p>It’s always nice to know the exact system requirements of an upcoming game that you’re most excited about playing. In this case, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. It’s a gorgeous game from what we’ve seen of its trailers, thanks to Capcom. But can you run the game? Here are the current Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster system requirements, though they’re subject to change before the game’s official release date!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-system-requirements">What Are the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster System Requirements?</h2>



<p>As you can see from the official Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster system requirements below, the upcoming third-person zombie-slaying adventure isn’t overly demanding. It’s not an official remake, so the requirements prove rather accommodating to most systems these days. That said, it does support 4K, so if you want the zombie gore in ultra graphics, you’ll need a beefier system!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-6700 / AMD Ryzen 5 3400G</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB) / AMD Radeon RX 580</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Network</strong>: Broadband Internet Connection</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070ti / AMD Radeon RX 5700</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Network</strong>: Broadband Internet Connection</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-what-systems-will-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-on">What Systems Will Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Release On?</h2>



<p>We hope you’re ready to once again visit Willamette Mall, albeit in gorgeous 60 FPS and 4K resolution in the upcoming remaster. Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will launch simultaneously on:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>Xbox Series X|S</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>It will not, as of right now, launch on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, however. The last-gen consoles won’t get the opportunity to enjoy the remaster, though the original is still available to many who have yet to upgrade!</p>

            <p>Surgent Studios has reportedly laid off an undisclosed number of employees.</p>
<p>The cuts come just three months after its latest release, Tales of Kenzera: Zau, released to strong critic and fan reviews.</p>
<p>Whilst neither the studio itself nor founder Abubakar Salim has commented publicly on the layoffs, former Surgent devs have discussed the redundancies on their personal social media profiles.</p>
<p>"The chapter entitled 'Pete Works At Surgent Studios' is coming to a close at the end of the month," wrote former level designer Peter Brisbourne on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peteb_hello-the-chapter-entitled-pete-works-at-activity-7213868361368174594-wVBF/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a producer wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/raysura.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> yesterday that there was a "very high likelihood [they were] going to get some really bad news", and updated today with a simple: "Well, I’ve officially been laid off, as expected. Sh*t sucks."</p>

			<p>As part of the ongoing exclusive Game Informer coverage, BioWare <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/01/a-look-at-dragon-age-the-veilguards-difficulty-options-and-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> more information on the difficulty settings available in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>Preset difficulty options include Storyteller, Adventurer, and Nightmare, which are pretty self-explanatory. You may swap between them at your leisure, with the notable exception of Nightmare difficulty: once that has been selected for a playthrough, it cannot be reverted. You'd have to start a new one at a lower setting if needed.</p>
<p>The surprise option is the custom 'Unbound' setting, which will allow players to craft their own challenge level by tweaking parameters like parry timing, aim assistance (up to auto-aim), enemy pressure (how quickly and often you will be attacked), the amount of damage dealt to and received from enemies, and even wayfinding. Last but not least, fans who are interested in Dragon Age: The Veilguard solely because of the story (and there are quite a few of those) can turn on the no-death setting.</p>
<p>Game Director Corinne Busche told Game Informer that the studio doesn't consider these as 'cheat' options. Rather, they have been implemented to allow all kinds of fans to partake in the adventure. Players can expect other accessibility features, too, with more information to be shared closer to launch.</p>
<p>On that note, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is still scheduled for a generic Fall 2024 launch across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. That may change soon, though, with Gamescom around a month and a half away.</p>

  <p id="5dXUJT">Sony has made no secret that its recent <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24067436/helldivers-2-biggest-playstation-launch-steam-pc">push into PC games has been fruitful</a> for the House of PlayStation, both from a sales perspective but also with regard to quality; these are good ports that stand up to their console counterparts. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-superb-case-of-the-golden-idol-joins-game-pass-in-july.917346/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24190770/game-pass-july-2024-free-xbox-games-case-of-the-golden-idol-tchia-neon-white-flock<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="WNbCum">Microsoft has revealed what’s coming to Game Pass during the first half of July and, while absent any big-hitters, the lineup features at least four really excellent indie games that will be well worth your time during this relative dry spell for big releases.</p>
<p id="T31elC">Polygon’s favorite of the lot is probably <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23433618/case-of-the-golden-idol-review-return-of-obra-dinn-detective-game"><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em></a>, joining Game Pass on July 9: a hilarious, macabre point-and-click detective mystery set in the 18th century, with an illustration style you’ll never forget. It’s also an excellent puzzle game with perhaps the most satisfying murder-mystery detection mechanics in any video game.</p>
<p id="c92Gmz">But it’s far from being the only worthwhile pick here. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23645683/tchia-review-action-adventure-zelda-open-world"><em>Tchia</em></a> (joining July 11) is a joyful, Zelda-influenced open-world exploration game set in a version of the beautiful Pacific island nation of New Caledonia. If you fancy something a little less sedate, may we direct you toward <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23185130/neon-white-review-speedrun-fps-deck-builder-pc-switch"><em>Neon White</em></a> (also July 11), a fast-paced, first-person, anime-style action game about slaying demons. It’s a speedrunners’ delight, with a perfect difficulty curve, and you might find your friends’ leaderboard gets pretty competitive.</p>
<p id="0FEa7e">Also of note: <em>Flock</em> is a new release coming to Game Pass on day one on July 16. This chill multiplayer game about the joy of flight isn’t out yet, but what we’ve seen is very promising indeed.</p>
<p id="68DdZc">Here’s everything coming to Game Pass over the next couple of weeks.</p>

Directed by Eli Roth and also starring Jack Black and Kevin Hart, the live-action adaptation of Gearbox’s popular looter shooter series seemed like a strange choice for the renowned actress.

Some theorized she was looking for a big paycheck. Others suggested she was secretly a <em>Borderlands</em> sicko. But the actual truth is that during the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/so-its-been-a-year-huh-1846477237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/so-its-been-a-year-huh-1846477237">pandemic lockdowns</a></span>, being cooped up and not working started taking a toll on her, and she took the job. </p><p>As explained in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/borderlands-movie-cate-blanchett-gunslinger-eli-roth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/borderlands-movie-cate-blanchett-gunslinger-eli-roth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new online excerpt</a></span> from a feature about the <em>Borderlands </em>film in <em>Empire</em>, Blanchett says that she enjoys “crazy” roles that people wouldn’t expect her to take. However, she also suggested a bit of “covid madness” was involved as well. </p><p>“I was spending a lot of time in the garden, using the chainsaw a little too freely. My husband said, ‘This film could save your life,’” said Blanchett. </p><p>Funnily enough, the previously mentioned report claiming she was in talks to star in the film (which ended up being accurate) was from May 2020, just a few months into the global lockdowns happening due to the pandemic. So this all tracks. Honestly, it makes more sense now that she said yes to <em>Borderlands </em>because she was stuck in her house for months and was losing her mind. </p><p>According to <em>Empire</em>, to get prepared for the role Blanchett got a PS5 and started playing the games. She also got “absorbed” into the <em>Borderlands </em>community, looking at cosplayers and super fans online.

<p>It’s a day that many football fans have been waiting for for a long time, a deep dive into the Dynasty Mode coming to College Football 25.</p>



<p>The deep dive comes with a six-minute trailer along with a 17,000-word blog post from EA. In it, everything you can expect from the mode is covered. From the coaching carousel to recruiting to conference alignment to even how gameplay falls into off-field decisions. It’s clear that a lot of passion has gone into the mode, and it shows with the deep dive.</p>



<p>Without getting into all 17,000 words of it, here are a few of the biggest takeaways:</p>



<ul>
<li>You can be a head coach, offensive coordinator, or defensive coordinator</li>



<li>Coaches fall under three archetype categories: Recruiting, Motivation, Scheme</li>



<li>RPG-like skill tree for your coaches</li>



<li>Over 3,500 high school recruits are generated each year to scout</li>



<li>14 pitch grades to determine a recruit’s interest in your school</li>



<li>Some players have dealbreakers than can lead to them not wanting to talk with you or even transfer from your school.</li>



<li>Players can de-commit from your school ahead of National Signing Day</li>



<li>Full conference re-alignment</li>



<li>Team Builder allows importing of up to 16 teams per dynasty (private dynasties only)</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-sues-two-switch-pirates-for-substantial-and-irreparable-harm<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>"Defendant is well aware that his conduct is unlawful and infringes Nintendo’s intellectual property rights"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Nintendo of America has filed lawsuits against two individuals it accuses of violating its copyright by trading and selling "circumvention devices".</p>
<p>In court papers uploaded to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-modded-hardware-and-r-switchpirates-moderator-archbox-240701/">Torrent Freak</a>, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/nintendo-modded.pdf">Ryan Michael Daly </a>of Modded Hardware – a website Nintendo believes has contravened the DMCA by selling modded consoles, pirated games, and mod chips – has been accused of trafficking in circumvention devices, copyright infringement, breach of EULA contract, and tortious interference with contract.</p>
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/nintendo-archbox.pdf">James C. Williams</a> – known online as 'Archbox' – has similarly been accused of copyright infringement, circumvention of technological measures, trafficking in circumvention devices, breach of contract, and tortious interference with contract.</p>
<p>The complaint – filed in Seattle, Washington, on June 28 – states that the defendants' sale and distribution of "circumvention devices, hacked consoles, and circumvention services" has done "substantial and irreparable harm" to Nintendo.</p>
<p>"Defendant not only offers the hardware and firmware to create and play pirated games, but he also provides his customers with copies of pirated Nintendo games," the lawsuit against Daly asserts.</p>
<p>"Typically, when a customer purchases a Hacked Console or the Circumvention Services, Defendant preinstalls on the console a portfolio of ready-to-play pirated games, including some of Nintendo’s most popular titles such as its Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid games."</p>
<p>Nintendo adds that "it is only because of products and services such as those sold by Defendant that illegal marketplaces distributing pirated games exist and thrive".</p>
<p>In Williams' paperwork, Nintendo claims he "became a leading (if not the primary) moderator of the SwitchPirates Reddit community, which he helped grow to nearly 190,000 members."</p>
<p>Nintendo claims it issued a cease and desist to both Daly and Williams in March 2024 and alleges the latter "bragged publicly that he is a 'pirate' who '[isn’t] going to give Nintendo $50 for a game'."</p>
<p>The "defendant is well aware that his conduct is unlawful and infringes Nintendo’s intellectual property rights," Nintendo states.</p>
<p>Back in May, Nintendo issued a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-issues-dmca-takedown-notice-against-over-8500-yuzu-emulator-repositories">DMCA takedown notice against 8,535 GitHub repositories that contained code from the Yuzu emulator for Switch</a>. It followed a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-and-yuzu-developer-settle-lawsuit-for-24m">settlement in March between Nintendo and Yuzu developer Tropic Haze</a>, in which the latter agreed to pay $2.4 million to the company and end its support for the emulator.</p>
<p>Nintendo initially <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-files-lawsuit-against-yuzu-emulator-creators">took legal action against Tropic Haze in February</a> for copyright infringement and, back in April 2023, the Paris Court of Appeals sided with Nintendo in a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-wins-court-battle-against-site-used-to-pirate-its-games">similar dispute with sharehosting website operator Dstorage</a>.</p>
