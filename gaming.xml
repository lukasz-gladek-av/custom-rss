		<p>Sometimes, a game can live rent-free in your head, despite never having played it. That’s been “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/is-this-seat-taken-is-a-polite-and-cosy-puzzler-where-you-have-to-consider-other-peoples-feelings/">Is This Seat Taken?</a>” for me. Announced just a couple short weeks ago, I’ve watched the trailer a bunch of times, forced other people to watch it a bunch of times, and even taken it upon myself to force my phone on acquaintances to watch it a bunch more. So, it might have caught my attention. Is This Seat Taken? is a puzzler built around the idea that people don’t like sitting next to most other people. You have to balance the needs of everyone, despite the fact that they smell, they’re messy, and hell, they might pull their phone out and make you watch random game trailers. The monsters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Is This Seat Taken? Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5Nw0qzomec?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Each level of Is This Seat Taken? presents you with a setting, and then a batch of people you need to place within it. The first level is a taxi, getting you used to dragging and dropping your little folks onto the available seats, while their desire card pops up at the bottom of the screen.</p>


<p>Things start out simple enough – Jordi wants a window seat, when there’s two available, and Aurora prefers to sit alone, so she can sit on the other end of the row. They’re both very reasonable about it too, and there’s no pushing or shoving which tells you this must be a fantasy world.</p>


<p>Then you find yourself dealing with a limousine. Suddenly, there’s five people to deal with, the seats all face different directions, and each person has two needs rather than one. After various roles in hospitality, I’m all about making customers happy, but I’m already sweating the details. Given that you’re essentially doing this for reviews or likes – a thumbs up shows you’ve picked a good seat – I’m now beginning to worry about being reviewed on SeatAdvisor. This isn’t supposed to be stressful is it?</p>
<p>Juggling the different needs of each person becomes increasingly tricky, and through the demo you find the numbers of people you’re dealing with steadily increase. A bus journey proves really interesting, with people getting on and off, and a bunch of new needs like wanting to sleep or – the horror – wanting to play loud music. I mean, there should be an option to forcibly eject those people at the bus stop, but anyway.</p>
<p>There’s little snippets of storyline woven into some of the scenes, with indie movie director Alexis helping their actor friend Nat to feel at ease, while we learn all about Hat Wars fandom, where the movies are great but the fans are awful. It seems as though Is This Seat Taken? has an awful lot to say about the world, despite being a game about little shape people being polite and sitting in the right seats. It’s a great combination.</p>

<p>Despite the complicated human interactions, Is this seat taken? is a joyful and upbeat game. The laidback tunes help to ease the trickier puzzle moments, and you’re helped along the way by the changing expressions of each sitter, telling you whether they’re content or not.</p>
<p>You can check out Is This Seat Taken for yourself right now, with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/">demo available to download on Steam</a>, ahead of its release on PC and mobile later this year.</p>

<p>After hearing Take-Two CEO’s recent comments on supporting “legacy titles”, GTA Online may have a chance at survival even after GTA 6 arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two’s CEO, was recently asked why players should keep investing in GTA Online in 2025 when an improved and enhanced version could arrive with GTA 6. Zelnick didn’t mention GTA Online or an online version of GTA 6 specifically; however, his answer provides some hope to the massive community.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Zelnick stated that his statements are theoretic, as he can’t mention a particular project (GTA 6 Online) “when an announcement hasn’t been made.” However, he added that Take-Two is known for its support properties if the community is still involved with the games.</p><p>&nbsp;As an example, he explained that 2K released NBA 2K Online in China in 2012, and soon after, a new version called NBA 2K Online 2 was released in China in 2017. However, even after the latest version arrived, the company didn’t sunset the first online game, and they are both still available in the market. The CEO concluded, stating, “We’ve shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>GTA Online is one of the most popular multiplayer games, bringing in over 150,000 players daily on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/271590/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam alone</a>. The online version of GTA 5 has been available for more than 10 years now, and players have gathered a considerable amount of wealth and assets in the game by investing a lot of time and sometimes a lot of real-world money. Take-Two and Rockstar have earned a lot through GTA Online, and with a community so big, there might be a chance that the game survives even after GTA 6 arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the GTA 6 publisher is ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-publisher-is-not-worried-about-the-game-influencing-violence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not worried</a>’ about the game influencing violence in the real world. Also, Take-Two’s CEO recently spoke about GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not coming to PC at launch</a>. Do you want GTA Online to survive even after GTA 6 releases? Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

    <p><span>Rescue lives, unveil the truth behind the catastrophe, and reignite hope with the Coreflame.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.1 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Light Slips the Gate, Shadow Greets the Throne,” will launch on February 26, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [185 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-944235"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this update, Trailblazers and their companions will forge ahead on the grand Flame-Chase Journey, venturing into uncharted territories and embracing a tapestry of thrilling events. Adding brilliance to the adventure are two new playable characters, Tribbie and Mydei, each weaving their unique threads into the ever-unfolding saga.</p><p>In the previous chapter, Nikador’s Coreflame was successfully reclaimed. Yet, the Flame-Chase Journey remains a race against time. With this pivotal milestone achieved, preparations for the next step are already underway. In Version 3.1, the Trailblazer will take on the role of a messenger, embarking alongside their companions to a brand-new map, “Grove of Epiphany,” where the journey continues with renewed purpose.</p><p>The Grove of Epiphany, a revered city-state honoring Cerces, the Reason Titan, stands as Amphoreus’ cradle of knowledge and maintains strong ties with Okhema. Known for its vital academic contributions to the Flame-Chase Journey, the Grove has long provided critical research on the black tide and Titans, serving as a beacon of enlightenment and progress. Cerces, like Kephale, harbors goodwill toward humanity and, with boundless generosity, transformed the Grove into a sanctuary for knowledge seekers, offering rest, study, and the wisdom of the world to mortals once shrouded in ignorance. However, this haven of learning has recently fallen to the black tide’s assault. Amidst the ensuing chaos, a shadowy foe has emerged, seeking to claim Cerces’ Coreflame for their own. In the Version 3.1 Trailblaze Mission, Trailblazers must rise to the challenge, rescuing survivors, uncovering truths about the catastrophe, and reclaiming Cerces’ Coreflame to restore hope to Okhema.</p><p>Moreover, in Version 3.1’s Main Story, Trailblazers will harness the power of Oronyx to awaken echoes of the past, leading them to a new map where the “Abyss of Fate,” once known as “Janusopolis,” stands in its Day State. Along the way, they will uncover long-buried secrets from the “Era Chrysea,” gradually unveiling the mysterious past of Tribbie, the latest 5-star playable character.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

As a 5-star Imaginary character following the Path of Destruction, in battle, Mydei fully utilizes his undying nature to fight the enemies. With a mass of Max HP, he can consume HP to charge, and then enter an enhanced form. When enhanced, Mydei automatically strikes enemies in his turn, dealing greater DMG and showcasing the might of the crown prince in Castrum Kremnos.Additionally, the limited 5-star characters Yunli and Huohuo will have their return in the first and second halves of the Version 3.1 warp event, respectively. Their formidable assistance makes them invaluable allies for your future journeys.In addition to new characters and storylines, Version 3.1 brings an array of exciting events. One highlight is the new season of Divergent Universe, which introduces a brand-new research topic centered on Amphoreus. This time, battles will feature the innovative "Day and Night System," where combat alternates between day and night. Each state provides unique boosts, while transitions between them trigger additional effects. Furthermore, the Day and Night System, along with its associated Blessings, is deeply connected to the Titans and the Chrysos Heirs, adding layers of strategy and lore to the experience. Additionally, Trailblazers will take part in The Awooo Firm event, where players step into the role of manager to assist the chimera squad in Okhema. By providing guidance and support, Trailblazers will help the squad turn their fortunes around and rise to become the strongest team of all.<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,864 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,363 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-31-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.1, with the latest update for the spacefaring turn-based gacha RPG set to land later this month.</p>

<p>Titled "Light Slips the Gate, Shadow Greets the Throne" in typical grandiose HoYoverse style, Version 3.1 will arrive on February 26th and will bring a brand new map to explore, plus two new 5-star characters to use and more.</p>

<p>First up, Version 3.1 will let you explore the Grove of Epiphany, a city-state under attack by a "shadowy foe" looking to claim its Titan's Coreflame for its own. The Trailblaze Mission for this update will see you investigating what's happening in the Grove and reclaiming the Coreflame.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.1-release-date-mydei-fight.jpg?itok=vpjY_6zz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-star-rail-version-3.1-release-date-mydei-fight.jpg?itok=S2RYc3ku 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mydei is one of your two new fighters in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.1.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd expect from a&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>update (well, if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-27-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous form</a> is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-26-release-date" rel="nofollow">anything to go by</a>, that is), there are two new 5-star characters joining the game's roster in Version 3.1.</p>

<p>The first is Tribbie, a transformed version of the demigod Tribbios. HoYoverse says she deliberately split herself into "thousands of Messengers" using the Century Gate, and now, she can join your party.</p>

<p>She can buff your team and debuff enemies to help your party deal more damage, so she's a valuable combatant to have if you need an extra edge in combat.</p>

<p>Your second new fighter in Version 3.1 is Mydei, a "warrior as valiant as a lion" who consumes HP to deal extra damage. Reruns for Yunli and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-introduces-new-five-star-character-huohuo" rel="nofollow">Huohuo</a> will also appear in the first and second halves of the Version 3.1 event cycle.</p>




<p>You can also look forward to a new season of Divergent Universe in which battles will be split between day and night, introducing unique effects for both times of day. That's alongside the usual gameplay fixes and miscellaneous quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 3.1 launches across all platforms on February 26th.</p>

            <p>Renowned actress Laura Bailey portrayed deuteragonist Abby Anderson in The Last of Us Part 2, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> almost didn't cast her because "she's in everything".</p>
<p>That's coming from The Last of Us creator and Naughty Dog exec Neil Druckmann himself. Druckmann was chatting with Santa Monica Studio's creative director Cory Barlog during a panel at DICE this week, where he said he was "sure it was going to be a different actor" when he was watching the auditions live (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/neil-druckmann-wasnt-going-to-cast-laura-bailey-in-the-last-of-us-part-2-because-shes-in-everything-but-changed-his-mind-after-studying-her-audition-frame-by-frame/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>Even the studio more generally thought Bailey wouldn't be right for the role as Abby, as she had already been in so many other games, including Naughty Dog's own Uncharted series.</p>

</figure>
<p>However, and as we all know, the team changed its mind. Druckmann said the tipping point came after studying the audition videos "frame-by-frame", and noticing a moment of "vulnerability" in Bailey's audition that others hadn't shown. Druckmann then showed this moment to the wider Naughty Dog team, convincing them that Bailey was the right choice for Abby.</p>
<p>Bailey went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2020-live-report">win the Best Performance accolade at the 2020 Game Awards for her portrayal of Abby</a>.</p>
<p>For her role, Bailey received inexcusable online abuse, which didn't just threaten her life, but that of her baby son's as well. During a behind-the-scenes documentary about the game last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-abby-actor-reveals-online-abuse-didnt-just-threaten-her-life-but-her-baby-son-too">Bailey confirmed that the "real hardcore death threats" were so concerning</a>, they were passed on to police.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-will-get-official-mod-support-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warhorse Studios has <a href="https://x.com/KingdomComeRPG/status/1889706030226956469/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> the imminent launch of official mod support for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. The developer also revealed that it will be implemented through Steamworks rather than other options like Mod.io. As such, you should be able to download mods directly through Steam Workshop.</p>
<p>This will, of course, be in addition to all the regular mods that have been released and will continue to be released via platforms like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods?BH=7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-mod-roundup-unlimited-saving-and-increased-convenience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> some of the convenience mods last week, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-4k-skins-mod-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4K skin mod</a>, but there's a lot more you can find there. There are 412 Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 mods on Nexus, 291 of which were released in the last seven days. With the official mod integration, the community will have even greater incentives to continue improving, tweaking, and enhancing the game. Presumably, official mod tools will be released, too, although that was not explicitly confirmed at this point.</p>
<p>Warhorse's Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was a resounding success on all accounts. Commercially, it has already recouped costs and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold over a million units</a>. Critically, it stands at 88 average score on Metacritic. This includes our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10/10 score from Chris Wray</a>:</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>
<p>The release of official mod support won't be the end of Warhorse's work for this game. The Czech studio has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> its 2025 roadmap, announcing a free update for Spring (bringing barber, horse racing, and Hardcore mode), the Brushes With Death DLC for Summer, the Legacy of the Forge DLC for Autumn, and the Mysteria Ecclesiae DLC for Winter.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-first-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-and-first-major-update-revealed.1109490/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-first-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Heart Machine and publisher Arc Games have revealed the first major Early Access roadmap for action-adventure roguelike&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, as well as what's coming as part of the game's first big update next week.</p>

<p>The game launched last month to mixed player reviews on Steam, with players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">criticizing performance and accessibility issues</a> as well as some of the game's design.</p>

<p>As you can probably guess, the first big update in February, which lands on the 18th, aims to address some of those problems, promising rebalancing for combat and gear as well as "performance updates" and bug fixes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-fight.jpg?itok=oiZfF5AO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-fight.jpg?itok=tESpoMn1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>'s first roadmap is aiming to address some of its most common sticking points.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as these fixes and rebalancing efforts, the February monthly update will also bring a new player character, new holobytes, and new enemies to fight, plus new affixes to experiment with.</p>

<p>Another monthly update will arrive in March, and it'll bring plenty of new stuff; new enemies and a new assassin are on the way, plus more performance updates and more rebalancing.</p>

<p>Following that, a significant new update is coming in April, and this one's big enough to get its own name. The Buried Below update continues the previous two updates' efforts with regards to rebalancing and bug fixing, but it also brings new areas, another new player character, and "improved onboarding".</p>

<p>There's plenty more coming before the game's 1.0 launch as well, although that launch still doesn't have a release date. You can see the full&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>Early Access roadmap right here.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=vjJ4C1_a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyper-light-breaker-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=ZQ4dAe-z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's lots on the way for&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light&nbsp;</em>series. Developed by Heart Machine, the game eschews its predecessor's top-down&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>-style perspective in favor of a full 3D look, and it's a roguelike as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Drifter</em>'s handcrafted adventure.</p>

<p>While sales figures haven't been officially released, it seems that&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>hasn't exactly performed as well as parent company Embracer would have liked, at least if its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-embracer" rel="nofollow">recent financial statement</a> is anything to go by.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Hyper Light Breaker&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Early Access</a>, and if you'd like to know what our very own Austin thought of the game, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hyper-light-breaker-preview-journey-worth-taking" rel="nofollow">take a look at his preview here</a>.</p>

<p>"After 16 years, when it came time to give Castle Crashers some more love, I started by drawing brand new knights," explained Dan Paladin, co-founder and art director at The Behemoth.</p>
<p>"I was able to do this fairly quickly and thought, 'Why shouldn't everyone have the ability to do this?', so - BOOM - the Painter Boss gave us all a perfect opportunity to make a natural shift to creating. People have wanted new characters so often - this allows the whole community to finally share more than we could ever give them!"</p>
<p>Although Castle Crashers debuted on Xbox and is still available on Sony consoles and Nintendo Switch, the $4 DLC (regional pricing is still to be confirmed) is only coming to Steam. You can wishlist it now.</p>
<p>"Much like The Behemoth's last Live Arcade effort, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alien-hominid">Alien Hominid</a> HD, this is a resolutely old-fashioned side-scroller," Dan Whitehead wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/castle-crashers-review">Eurogamer's Castle Crashers review</a>, waaaaay back in 2008.</p>
<p>"Where it differs is in a much less brutal learning curve, a vastly increased amount of peripheral stuff to play with and a generally more rounded gaming experience."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The first network test for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has suffered server issues and is unplayable.</p>
<p>The online co-op spin-off has a number of three hour long sessions over the course of the weekend, with the first meant to be from 11am - 2pm UK time today. However, server issues have meant players haven't been able to get past the initial menu.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1890375131463082321">FromSoftware Player Support</a> has shared a number of messages, noting the server is "congested" before it restarted the server to solve the issue.</p>

<p>It's unclear how long it will take for servers to be reset, or if the remaining sessions will also be affected. After all, this is a network test - and the servers have clearly been tested.</p>
<p>I've contacted Bandai Namco for further details.</p>
<p>Myself, Eurogamer's Ian Higton and IGN's Jesse Gomez were planning to stream the game but have cancelled due to the server issues.</p>
<p>Players have been sharing their experience on social media and calling for FromSoftware to extend the sessions.</p>
<p>This was my view for over an hour of trying:</p>

<p>The test will continue over the weekend for those who registered, we have all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-beta-test-dates-times-register">details of Nightreign session times</a>.</p>

<p>"As it stands, though, Nightreign provides a delectable hit of Elden Ring in a repeatable microcosm," I wrote. "It's got the difficulty, the levelling, the boss battles, and the sense of discovery, but all at high speed for a new type of challenge, while its grim enemy selection is like a best-of Souls mixtape I'm itching to replay."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/most-civilization-players-dont-finish-a-single-game-going-by-civ-6-data-and-perhaps-thats-the-best-way-to-play<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If your time with foundational PC strategy 4X game series <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> consists of exactly one save file that ended somewhere in the Middle Ages, don't beat yourself up, for you have plenty of company. When they got hold of detailed audience data for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a>, Firaxis creative director Ed Beach and executive producer Dennis Shirk were dismayed to discover that fewer than 40% of their players ever finish a single game. Hence, to some degree, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a>'s new Age system, which is designed to counter feelings of exhaustion by smashing the chronology up into more digestible chunks, with something of a Civ power level reset between Ages to stop you feeling like you're either hopelessly behind or so far ahead that ultimate victory is guaranteed.</p><!--more-->
<p>That 40% figure comes from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/arts/civilization-7-design-firaxis.html">an interview with the New York Times</a>, which pairs Firaxis insight with thoughts from academics and third party designers about Civilization's pretty well-rehearsed colonialist leanings. While the data refers to Civ 6 specifically, I'm pretty confident you can apply these findings to Civilization games in general. There's <a href="https://kotaku.com/nine-out-of-10-will-not-finish-the-game-they-are-playin-5832450">ample</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/17/gdc-most-players-donat-finish-games">evidence</a> to the effect that most video game players leave games unfinished, and 4X games in particular are arguably most fun at the outset while the world is still a mystery.</p>
<p>Among the NYT's interviewees is Indian game developer Nikhil Murthy, whose current project Syphilisation is both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nikhil-murthys-syphilisation-is-a-ferociously-in-depth-empathic-reworking-of-civilization-and-other-4x-games">a post-colonial critique of Civilization and an investigation of Civ play possibilities</a> buried by the mantra of Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, Murthy comments that Civilization's endgame-focussed "winner takes all" mindset has a flattening effect on all the fun you can have with its systems. New School professor McKenzie Wark elaborates upon Murthy's argument with the thought that the most intriguing Civ players are the "trifling" ones who don't really care about victory. "You're just interested in exploring the rule set," she told the paper. "So your civilization inevitably gets defeated, but you find little affordances as you go along."</p>
<p>The NYT piece is too brief to go into much detail here, sadly, but it reminds me of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/can-you-make-an-anti-imperial-empire-game">my own roundtable chat</a> about 4X design with Murthy, Paradox Interactive's Ryan Sumo and Civilization lead designer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jon-shafer">Jon Shafer</a> from 2023. At one point in that conversation, Shafer recalls that during his time at Firaxis, designers frequently heard that players enjoy "that first X-and-a-half, the exploration part and the initial expansion part, before you're really in competition".</p>
<p>Civ7 creative director Ed Beach also alludes to this in <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/dev-diary/ages/">a developer diary about the Age system</a>. "From our perspective, not finishing the game is a signal that players are hitting points where they're no longer having fun," he writes. "We want everyone to have a great experience from start to finish. We know that players often feel the beginning hours of Civ are magical, and we want to make sure that every part of the game feels just as epic and exciting as that initial rush."</p>
<p>I can't tell you whether Firaxis have succeeded in this with Civilization 7. Our review remains forthcoming. But I am certainly among the players who favour the early game and prefer tinkering about as a mid-rank Civ to assuming a position of monotonous economic, cultural or military dominance. How about you, reader dear?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">What happens to GTA Online when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> comes out? That’s a question a lot of GTA Online players have been asking ever since GTA 6 was announced. And now, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">GTA 6’s fall 2025 release date</a> approaches, they’re no closer to an answer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online">GTA Online</a> is Rockstar’s hugely profitable live service that continues to pull in players even now, well over a decade since launch. Its enduring appeal and ability to print money is thought to have influenced Rockstar’s decision to prioritize the live service over story DLC for Grand Theft Auto 5, much to the annoyance of some fans. But there is a more pressing concern looming over the horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When GTA 6 eventually comes out, it is expected to bring with it a new and improved GTA Online. Perhaps this will be GTA Online 2. Perhaps it will be called GTA Online, as before. Either way, players of the existing GTA Online have expressed concern that all their time, effort, and money spent in the current GTA Online will be left behind for a potential clean break later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why invest time and money into GTA Online now, in early 2025, when the new GTA Online is potentially due out in perhaps eight months or so? That’s a question IGN put to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick during a recent interview ahead of the company’s third-quarter financial report, and his answer makes for interesting reading.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Zenick wouldn’t be drawn specifically on any new GTA Online because it has yet to be announced, he did talk generally about Take-Two’s form when it came to NBA 2K Online, a free-to-play online-focused version of 2K Sports’ hugely successful basketball franchise aimed at the Asian market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NBA 2K Online launched all the way back in 2012, and then 2K Sports released NBA 2K Online 2 in 2017. Both games were maintained simultaneously, so fans of the first version could continue to play and invest their time and money safe in the knowledge they wouldn’t be left behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm going to speak theoretically only because I'm not going to talk about a particular project when an announcement hasn't been made,” Zelnick began. “But generally speaking, we support our properties when the consumers are involved with those titles. As an example, we launched NBA 2K Online in China, I think originally in 2012 if I'm not mistaken. And then we launched NBA 2K Online 2 in China in 2017. If I'm not mistaken. We did not sunset Online 1. They both are still in the market and they serve consumers and they're alive and we have this massive audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we've shown a willingness to support legacy titles when a community wants to be engaged with them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last line is of particular importance. It suggests — but doesn’t confirm at this stage — that if there is a GTA Online 2, it won’t come at the cost of GTA Online falling by the wayside. If people keep playing GTA Online, Zelnick is suggesting here, then Rockstar will continue to support it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that there’s still a huge amount we do now know about GTA 6, given all we’ve had so far is Trailer 1 and a release window. But if GTA 6 is definitely due out fall 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boss-of-gta-6-and-borderlands-4-owner-take-two-says-it-will-time-its-releases-to-respect-the-consumers-need-to-spend-a-lot-of-time-playing-these-hit-games-before-they-go-on-to-the-next">potentially after Borderlands 4’s just-announced September release date</a>, Rockstar will have to reveal more sooner rather than later. In the meantime, check out Zelnick's comments on whether <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">skipping PC for GTA 6's launch is a mistake</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Highlights included Housemarque’s reveal of its Returnal successor, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saros-is-housemarques-successor-to-returnal-arriving-in-2026">Saros</a>, and the long-awaited release date for Konami’s Unreal Engine 5 remake, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-finally-confirmed-officially-this-time">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>.

For others, the absence stung more than usual. March 24, 2025, marks the 10-year anniversary of Bloodborne’s launch on PS4, making this year feel like a now-or-never moment for PlayStation and developer FromSoftware to do... anything with the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloodborne remaster campaigners have slowly grown their numbers over the last five years, but hopes for an announcement took on a new form when Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-bloodborne-60fps-patch-says-sony-has-sent-him-a-dmca-takedown-but-why-now"><u>issued a DMCA takedown</u></a> to Lance McDonald, the creator of a popular Bloodborne 60fps mod for the action RPG, late last month. Sony was calling for links to the patch to be scrubbed from the internet, and only one week later, a PlayStation 1-style demake called Bloodborne PSX <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-the-bloodborne-psx-demake-becomes-the-latest-fan-project-to-suffer-a-copyright-claim-the-creator-of-bloodbornes-60fps-mod-has-offered-his-copium-official-remake-theory"><u>suffered the same fate</u></a>. It’s not exactly a surprise to see Sony taking action against community creations like this, but the timing had many, <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1886240572660457506" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>including McDonald</u></a>, raising their eyebrows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My copium theory is that Sony DMCAed the 60fps patch and the video about the Bloodborne demake so that when they announce a 60fps remake, Google searching for ‘Bloodborne 60fps’ and ‘Bloodborne remake’ won’t have collisions with our fan projects,” McDonald said. “Let me cope.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, just days after Sony moved to pull these fan-made projects down, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow-february-12th"><u>State of Play was announced</u></a>. After years of begging and nearly a decade since launch, this had to be it, right? Well, whether you were surprised or not, not one frame of Bloodborne found its way into the presentation, and fans haven’t been taking it well.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">another year no bloodborne <a href="https://t.co/XCB8LZ3Ds7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/XCB8LZ3Ds7</a> <a href="https://t.co/VVohE0C4gp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VVohE0C4gp</a></p>— ۟ (@scadutree) <a href="https://twitter.com/scadutree/status/1889809555003154451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">some of you clearly didn't watch amazon's secret level playstation episode when Sackboy turned to the camera and said, "We will NEVER remake or remaster bloodborne!" <a href="https://t.co/Y89LwShCVh" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Y89LwShCVh</a></p>— Gene Park (@GenePark) <a href="https://twitter.com/GenePark/status/1889814583868792917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/2BCcceRz2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2BCcceRz2z</a></p>— Micky D (@DeMickyD) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeMickyD/status/1889902996856947048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Driving the cleaver deeper was Sony’s promise to bring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/days-gone-remasered-revealed-with-april-2025-release-date">Days Gone Remastered</a> to PS5 owners in April. This re-release of Bend Studio’s post-apocalyptic narrative adventure arrives on the six-year anniversary of its original launch on PS4 and sees it joining a list of other first-party remasters that includes Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, The Last of Us Part I, and The Last of Us Part II Remastered. No-one outside Sony is sure on what qualifies a game to be deserving of a remaster. With so many players begging to return to Yharnam’s beastly streets and with FromSoftware titles more popular than ever, it’s hard not to walk out of a Bloodborne-less State of Play without a question mark above your head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, as quiet as Sony has been when it comes to Bloodborne content, fans haven’t been completely starved of an explanation from it or FromSoftware. Former Sony Interactive Entertainment executive Shuhei Yoshida, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-retiring-from-sony-in-january"><u>retired last month</u></a>, touched on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hasnt-sony-done-anything-more-with-bloodborne-playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-personal-theory"><u>his theory</u></a> as to why we’ve not seen more Bloodborne during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a recent conversation with Kinda Funny Games</u></a>. He suspects that director Hidetaka Miyazaki is too busy and too attached to the IP to let anyone else get involved other than himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I left first-party so I don’t know what’s going on,” Yoshida said in January, “but my theory is, you know because I remember, you know, Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, you know, what he created. So, I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy, so he doesn’t want, he cannot do himself, but he does not want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory.

You know, like the ones Scrooge McDuck uses to deposit his pocket change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But what if you aren't hoarding burlap repositories adorned with dollar signs? VGHF co-founder Frank Cifaldi, who spoke to Game Developer last week </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamehistory.org/vghf-library-launch/">following the launch of the VGHF's astounding digital library</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, says there are other (slightly more inexpensive) ways you can help.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Honestly, something that we often say is, if you are within a studio structure, we need more internal champions–for not only live preservation of that material, but also advocacy for access," says Cifaldi.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the years, VGHF has acquired an eye-watering amount of material ripe for cataloguing. Those donations often come from smaller companies or individual collectors, largely because they're less restricted by corporate red tape and legal concerns.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Courting titans of the industry like Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony remains an uphill battle. That's why it's vital people who feel strongly about documenting video game history (especially those within sprawling studio structures) find the strength to become vocal advocates.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We've been pushing forward invisibly behind the scenes and have started to dismantle some of the barriers around access to this material being scary," continues Cifaldi. "We have always been a fairly secretive industry, right? We're terrified of competitors knowing the secret sauce that went into a game, and we're terrified of the public actually knowing how that stuff actually gets made."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cifaldi hopes that mindset will shift when people see the positive impact that comes from initiatives like the VGHF Library, which includes materials such as artwork, press kits, design documents, video game magazines, production footage, and so much more. All text searchable, of course–which was another herculean challenge in itself.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Nobody is going to preserve you, but you&quot;">"Nobody is going to preserve you, but you"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a sentiment echoed by VGHF director Phil Salvador, who explains the benefits of cracking the safe on decades of video game history can be far-reaching–as evidenced by the Foundation's collaboration with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Myst</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Cyan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Cyan collection is a great example, because since we've opened up the collection the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Myst</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> community have been poring over it. They've even started identifying people in videos who maybe have never been credited in some of their games before," continues Salvador.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's having a positive effect, going back to the company itself. We hope this is a good case study for other companies to say 'listen, if you open these things up, it's not going to jeopardise you.' There is genuine interest in this stuff, and you can enable that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even if you convinced a handful of people at larger companies there's scant risk involved in showcasing their history to the world, you'd probably still need approval from legal. That, explains Cifaldi, is often a critical stumbling block.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Let's just say theoretically one of these companies–Ubisoft or EA–has a box of dusty old design documents they found," says Cifaldi. "You'd think that's an easy donation. Just send it over. There's nothing crazy in here. There's nothing incriminating. But from that company's perspective they have to think about things like 'do we actually legally own all of these?' or 'are we even allowed to own some of these things?'. 'Maybe we were supposed to have destroyed some of these and maybe there are third-parties we were contracted with that might sue us if we claimed to own this and then donate it?'</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The answer almost every time is 'no, it's fine,' but for a larger company that has a lot to lose it's a really difficult proposition to just hand things over. I think corporate structure makes it mandatory that legal has to sign off on that–and the cost of legal signing off on anything is often absurd."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If corporations are always going to be risk-averse, how do you flip the narrative? You hope there are key figures (shout out to any executives reading this) within those structures who believe in the cause. People with the power and motivation to bulldoze through the bureaucracy–or former leaders and developers who are perhaps unknowingly sat on a treasure trove of material just waiting to be donated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The truth behind almost any instance of historical preservation is that people just took stuff home–and maybe they weren't supposed to" says Cifaldi. "You know, I'll call back to my little speech at last year's Game Developer's Choice Awards and IGF and say nobody is going to preserve you, but you.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If there's a message to Game Developer's readers, I think that's it. You need to be the curator of your own story–but especially if you're within a larger corporate structure because nobody is going to do that for you. Someone like us can be the ultimate caretakers of that story, but you have to curate that yourself."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> studio Obsidian Entertainment has plans to make it to 100 years in the business, and will achieve this by staying "lean and invested".</p>
<p>Speaking during this week's <a href="https://www.dicesummit.org/">DICE Summit</a>, Obsidian VP of operations Marcus Morgan and VP of development Justin Britch said they expect the studio to make it to its 100th birthday, which will be in another 78 years time.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-plans-to-make-rpgs-for-100-years-by-not-trying-to-grow-aggressively-expand-our-team-size-or-make-super-profitable-games/">PC Gamer</a>, the team hopes to reach this milestone by keeping the company lean and holding onto the talent it has. It will also set realistic goals when it comes to sales expectations, the execs said, and won't go all-in on delivering huge profits. "Are we serious? … Yes," Morgan said.</p>

</figure>
<p>This strategy has meant Obsidian has refrained from opening multiple international offices, instead partnering with studios already in existence. This has reduced the risk of Obsidian getting too big and weakening the overall culture at the studio.</p>
<p>Additionally, Obsidian works on the assumption that any game it releases will simply be a "mild success", and this determines how much the studio will invest in a project before it gets given the greenlight.</p>
<p>Obsidian also plans to build institutional knowledge by aiming for "the lowest turnover rate in the industry". Meanwhile, the studio will continue to release the types of games it has become known for "not rushed, but often".</p>
<p>Obsidian's most recent game - Avowed - is available next week, on 18th February. We recently awarded the magical RPG four out of five stars.</p>
<p>"What Avowed lacks in gloss it makes up for with charm, depth and a playful heart. It's one of this year's most pleasant surprises," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in DICE news, during the event <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-backtracks-on-diablo-4-annual-expansions-next-due-in-2026">Blizzard announced Diablo 4's next expansion won't arrive until 2026</a>, marking a change in its annual plans.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Avowed may be officially slated for February 18, but owners of the Premium Edition can already play it. As such, a technical report is in order.</p>
<p>I played the game extensively pre-release <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the review</a> and immediately noticed the game's solid performance across the board. As far as Unreal Engine 5 games go, this may be one of the smoothest I've played to date.</p>
<p>Sure, it isn't the most taxing. It is not, after all, an open world title, although its zones are fairly large. It also doesn't path tracing like Black Myth: Wukong, although its ray traced reflections look great on water surfaces, and the ray traced lighting and shadows definitely augment the visuals. More importantly, the stuttering is minimal, especially when you add a frame rate cap. That's always a worry for Unreal Engine games.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Avowed-Shaders-Generation-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Thankfully, Obsidian has adopted the best practice of running shader generation when loading the game. It will take a while the first time, even with a high-end NVMe SSD like WD Black's SN850X. However, you'll only need to do it again after a driver update, otherwise the game will check them quickly and then load the main menu. The tradeoff is definitely advantageous compared to having the initial experience marred by stuttering.</p>
<p>During the review period, we didn't have access to NVIDIA DLSS 4 or Multi Frame Generation, as the game wasn't listed as supported on the NVIDIA app for the Override feature. Still, I ended up using the DLSS Swapper tool because subtitles were affected by ghosting. By default, Avowed uses a fairly old (3.5.10.0) version of DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. Updating to DLSS 4 easily fixed the problem, though Multi Frame Generation and DLAA were still unavailable.</p>
<p>That changed with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-game-ready-driver-572-42-is-optimized-for-avowed-indiana-jones-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's GeForce Game Ready driver</a>. You can now select the latest DLSS 4 transformer model for Super Resolution, the improved AI-based Frame Generation model, as well as force Multi Frame Generation and DLAA through the NVIDIA app.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed PC 4K@60 Gameplay - Max Settings, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen, GeForce RTX 5090, 9800X3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRv4UwAC4-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game features no built-in benchmark, so I had to come up with a custom solution. I decided to record performance with NVIDIA FrameView while roaming through Paradis, by far the largest city in Avowed with the most amount of NPCs. Of course, I used 4K resolution, and every setting was turned to the max (labeled Epic, as in most Unreal Engine games):</p>
<ul>
<li>View Distance</li>
<li>Shadow Quality</li>
<li>Texture Quality</li>
<li>Shading Quality</li>
<li>Effects Quality</li>
<li>Foliage Quality</li>
<li>Post-Processing Quality</li>
<li>Reflection Quality</li>
<li>Global Illumination Quality</li>
</ul>
<p>The testing rig is:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D</li>
<li>MSI MAG B650 TOMAHAWK WIFI</li>
<li>32GB DDR5 6000 MHz G.SKILL Trident Z5</li>
<li>2TB NVMe SSD Western Digital Black SN850X</li>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition</li>
</ul>

</figure>


<p>With DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation set to 4x, I had enough headway to run DLAA at 200 average frames per second. Dropping to DLSS Quality provided a 30% boost to the average frame rate, which averaged 260FPS when upscaling from 1440p to 4K. However, the stuttering time increased from 7.30% to 13.29%, likely because of the larger difference between the maximum and minimum frame rates. Indeed, when looking at the 0.1% Low, DLAA and DLSS Quality are nearly identical (118 and 123 FPS, respectively). On the flip side, latency is lower when using DLSS Quality, though the difference is just over 8 ms (40.9 ms with DLSS Quality, 49.1 ms with DLAA).</p>
<p>Keep in mind, though, that the frame rate variance would be far lower when capping the frame rate, which you should absolutely do when actually playing the game. Indeed, during the review period, I capped the frame rate with the in-game slider to 120FPS and had a very smooth experience even without Multi Frame Generation.</p>

<p>Graphically, Avowed received a lot of criticism before its launch. However, the final version is nothing to complain about. In fact, it is often rather beautiful, thanks to the striking biomes and the highly detailed characters and armors. Sure, facial animations may not always be great, but only a handful of studios have really mastered that part of character rendering. As you can see above, the ray traced reflections are very pretty, though it's usually Lumen's lighting that elevates the visuals.</p>
<p>However, I do have to criticize Obsidian for its lack of native High Dynamic Range (HDR) display support. In 2025, this is nearly inexcusable, especially when the Xbox version supports not only HDR10 but Dolby Vision, too.</p>
<p>I had to resort to the Unreal Engine 5 HDR workaround <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Engine:Unreal_Engine_5#High_dynamic_range_.28HDR.29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed on PC Gaming Wiki</a> to enable HDR. Basically, you need to add the following variables to the GameUserSettings.ini file:</p>
<p><em>[SystemSettings]</em><br>
<em>r.AllowHDR=1</em><br>
<em>r.HDR.EnableHDROutput=1</em><br>
<em>r.HDR.Display.OutputDevice=5</em><br>
<em>r.HDR.Display.ColorGamut=2</em></p>
<p>It's not nearly the same as having it natively supported and optimized, though. Hopefully, a patch can resolve this.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Avowed supports the DualSense Edge controller right away despite not having any PlayStation 5 version announced. Granted, you'll have the wrong icons and no Adaptive Triggers or Haptic Feedback, but regular rumble works just fine. Lastly, I had good results with my Dolby Atmos setup when upmixing via the Dolby Access app, which I take as a sign of great surround sound implementation. The game also features sliders for Field of View (from 90 to 105) and for motion blur.</p>
<p>When scrolling Avowed's credits, the game lists many supporting studios, including the Xbox Games Technology Group, which was created in 2023 inside The Coalition. The studio is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-coalition-shows-stunning-ue5-demo-running-on-xbox-series-x-nanite-allows-100x-detail-lumen-is-a-total-game-changer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among the foremost Unreal Engine experts</a>, and I have little doubt that they were instrumental in helping Obsidian achieve their objectives with their game. In this regard, if nothing else, having the support of Xbox's teams has definitely leveled up the experience compared to The Outer Worlds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-units-sold-40000/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Early Nintendo Switch 2 units are reportedly selling on the black market in China for an exorbitant amount of money.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit</a>, the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained last year a CAD model of the new Nintendo system and provided the first accurate look at its design before the official reveal last month shared a screenshot featuring a conversation with a black market seller saying that the system, complete with dock and Joy-Con controllers, costs 290,000 RMB, around $39,780. While no regular user would spend so much money to get the console, the Xiahongshu forums user is selling the opportunity to manufacturers to test accessories on a real unit, so they have something going on to earn back the money spent.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1ip50jr/chinese_cad_model_leaker_shows_a_screenshot_of/">Chinese CAD model leaker shows a screenshot of his DMs with a black market seller, saying the prices for the Switch 2 dock, joycons, and tablet will cost him $39,780</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy-ConcentrationC/">u/Icy-ConcentrationC</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/">NintendoSwitch2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While there's no way to really know if the Xiahongshu forums user really has an actual Nintendo Switch 2, it likely won't take long to learn if it is true, considering the user did share the CAD model online after acquiring it and how people are hungering to learn more about the system ahead of the dedicated Nintendo Direct that will air on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is scheduled to launch sometime this year. A release window has yet to be confirmed, but considering the preview events around the world will be hosted until late May, a release in the second half of the year is to be expected.</p>

<p>We return to Krat to battle more creatures and find out where everything began. The Lies of P Overture release is an extensive prequel with the DLC aiming to trace the outbreak’s origins back to its beginning.</p>



<p>Lies of P was one of 2023’s most surprising debuts. I hold my hand up and say I thought it looked like nothing but a Bloodborne clone—and a pale imitation at best. I have since gorged on humble pie and was utterly moved once I finally rolled the credits after a million and one deaths. </p>



<p>Lies of P is an unbelievable addition to the Soulslike genre, and the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lies-of-p-overture-prequel-announced-its-not-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lies of P Overture</a> prequel was music to my ears.</p>

<p><strong>Lies of P Overture is set to release during Summer 2025, but we don’t have an exact date to go with this timeframe.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Sony State of Play Event</a> is where we first caught a glimpse of Lies of P Overture. Again, it was surprising due to Lies of P’s ending. I won’t spoil anything, but it felt like the developers would likely be working on a fully fledged sequel.</p>



<p>Neowiz Games and Round8 Studio were actually working on prequel DLC! In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/lies-of-p-overture-launches-summer-2025-on-ps5-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Lies of P’s director discussed Overture and its goals.</p>



<p>“Do you remember the moment when you, as Geppetto’s most ambitious masterwork, woke up in the middle of the great Puppet Frenzy, a massacre that devastated the entire city around you? Now, you will venture back in time to experience the harrowing journey that birthed that fateful moment. Through Lies of P: Overture, we aimed to fully refine, forge and complete the story as we originally envisioned it,” said Jiwon Choi.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-lies-of-p-to-play-overture-prequel">Do You Need Lies of P to Play Overture Prequel?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, you need a copy of Lies of P to play the Overture prequel DLC.</strong></p>



<p>Many DLCs allow you to play the content without needing the base game. That’s 100% not the case here, and you need a working physical or digital copy of Lies of P.</p>



<p>What isn’t confirmed though is if this is post-game DLC, it can be started midway, or available from the second you boot Lies of P up for the first time. With Overture being a prequel, I’d lean toward the DLC being readily available, even if you’ve never played the base game of Lies of P before.</p>



<p>We’ll update this hub once we learn the accurate release date, as well as what’s needed to play Overture.</p>



<hr>



<p>Did the Lies of P Overture DLC announcement catch you off guard too? Did you play or finish Lies of P? What have you made of the early Overture gameplay footage so far? Let us know.</p>

<p>Days Gone 2 is a sequel many gaming fans have wanted for a long time. Its sales suggested the debut title was a success, but 6 years later, we’re still twiddling our thumbs, waiting to get our Freaker on for Days Gone 2.</p>



<p>I’m glad I get to write about Days Gone as I think it’s one of the most underrated games of all time. I played it when it first came out, and I’ll never understand the lukewarm critical reception it got. Freakers and hoards are utterly terrifying, the story is consistently engaging throughout, and it’s a rock-solid survival title from start to finish.</p>



<p>Rumors circulated in late 2024 that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-circulate-that-days-gone-is-getting-ps5-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone PS5 Remaster</a> was in the works. This finally happened at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s February 2025 State of Play</a>. Now, the Days Gone 2 discourse is hotter than ever.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-a-days-gone-2-sequel-happening">Is a Days Gone 2 Sequel Happening?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Could it be? Credit to Bend Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As it stands, a Days Gone 2 sequel is not in development, nor is it on the cards—and there’s a good chance it will never happen.</strong></p>



<p>It breaks my heart writing this, and I hope I get to backtrack on everything I’m writing one day. But we believe developer Bend Studio has moved on and was working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-layoffs-contractors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-service title before it was canceled by Sony</a>. This means outside of Days Gone’s Broken Road DLC—and now the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-remastered-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone Remastered</a> release—this may be all the <a href="https://www.bendstudio.com/game/days-gone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Days Gone</a> content we get.</p>



<p>Oh, and we also mustn’t forget its connection to Astro Bot—something <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">Days Gone’s dir</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/">ctor</a> wasn’t keen on.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-hasn-t-days-gone-had-a-sequel">Why Hasn’t Days Gone Had a Sequel?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s been widely reported Sony was not the biggest fan of Days Gone when it first came out, despite the game selling very well.</strong></p>



<p>Days Gone took a long time to develop and probably cost a decent amount of money to make and market. But <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/12/20/playstation-game-sales-bloodborne-days-gone-7-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game World Observer reported</a> in 2023 Days Gone had sold close to <strong>7.5 million copies</strong>—bettering Bloodborne and 2016’s Ratchet &amp; Clank—and by now, it’s probably closer to 8 million—with the Remaster sure to give it a boost.</p>



<p>Despite this, Jeff Ross—a senior member of the Days Gone team—had this to say on there being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-sequel-sony-never-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no sequel</a>: “A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence <strong>it will never happen</strong>. <strong>Sony higher ups like Hermen were never fans</strong>, so you won’t hear about it at the PlayStation State of Play today or ever.”</p>



<p>I think the only way we’re going to see a sequel is if there’s interest. The Days Gone remaster needs to sell well, and people need to show they want another game. Plus, if Bend Studio’s rumored live-service title has been stopped, it means they’re free. Maybe they have some time to develop a certain Zombie-game sequel?</p>



<hr>



<p>In short, if <em>you </em>want a Days Gone 2 sequel, support it by buying it. Post about it on social media, make videos, and everything in between. What are your memories of Days Gone? Is it scandalous we’ve never had a Days Gone 2?</p>

<p>"Each year, we plan out a bunch of themed sale events (Fests) that center around a rotating category of games, and we know that announcing those dates ahead of time is helpful to developers planning their overall participation for the year," Valve explained.</p>
<p>"This is especially true given that we sprinkle them throughout a year already marked with each of our four seasonal sales and three Next Fests!</p>
<p>"We announced the schedule for the first half of 2025 last summer, and are now sharing the themed Fests and their dates planned for the second half."</p>
<p>Here's the full list:</p>

<p>Developers are invited to register their games for the events, as well as the digital store's legendary seasonable sales, which take place four times a year.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-bans-all-steam-games-that-force-players-to-watch-advertisements">Valve re-emphasised its rules around advertising, explicitly prohibiting games that force players to watch in-game ads</a>.</p>
<p>The rules confirmed that whilst cross-promotion and product placement are permitted, games that force players to watch or engage with advertising in order to play are not. Nor should developers use advertising as a "way to provide value to players, such as giving players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Is this the best start to a year in gaming we’ve ever had? It feels as though we’re seeing massive, hugely enjoyable games appear on the daily, and this week it’s been my pleasure to play through<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/"> Avowed</a>, an early highlight on the calendar for RPG fans. I’m also diving into the Elden Ring Nightreign network test which started today, had fun with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/the-knightling-is-set-to-be-a-fantastical-shield-bearing-indie-hit/">The Knightling</a>, and a bunch of other stuff I’m not allowed to talk about that totally don’t feature large creatures in them.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has played the prerequisite amount of Destiny 2, while also finding time to review <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/11/robobeat-review/">Robobeat</a> which he grudgingly liked very much. <strong>Gamoc</strong>, meanwhile continued to tinker with Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 after our review, reiterating that it’s excellent, as well as Phasmophobia, Orcs Must Die 3, and a bit of Palworld.</p>
<p><strong>Aran </strong>has returned to us after an amazing trip to Japan, and he’s getting back up to speed by playing Citizen Sleeper 2 for review, while <strong>Jim</strong> finally saw the credits roll on Alan Wake 2. He told us, “I wasn’t too keen on the ending and felt like it meandered a bit too much without really offering anything diverse or satisfying with its combat gameplay. That said, I feel somewhat obliged to play through the DLC as it ties more into the wider Remedy universe.</p>
<p>“Not sure what my next game will be, either Plague Tale or Rise of the Ronin.” Any suggestions?</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> has had a quieter week than normal, working his way through Gears of War 5. He says, “It’s fine but suffers from serious modern-day gaming bloat compared to the original trilogy. I’ve also been pottering through some indie games for review.”</p>
<p>Having seen off Unicorn Overlord, <strong>Ade</strong> has immediately made a tactical move to another Switch title, “I needed a game to fill the horned horse-shaped hole in my life, so, I’ve started Fire Emblem Engage! I’ve also enjoyed accidentally blowing up pals in Helldivers 2, solving physics-based puzzles in Immortals Rise of Fenyx, and watching Laura build uni halls in the hilarious Campus 2.0.”</p>

<p>Last, but never the least, <strong>Tef</strong> has also been playing Avowed to help produce <a href="https://youtu.be/_PCSaHYOKoY">our video review</a>, complimenting this with some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/killing-floor-3-preview-beta/">Killing Floor 3 for a preview</a> of the closed beta, and is just getting started with the technical test of Exoborne, where he’s roping Miguel and myself in for some exosuit extraction. There’s some other bits and bobs that he can’t talk about yet, though…</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-ix-remake-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-are-still-in-active-development-%E2%80%93-rumor.1109397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-active-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite not having been announced yet, the Final Fantasy IX remake remains in active development alongside another unannounced series remaster, but both may not be released soon, according to a well-known insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, well-known and reliable insider NateTheHate replied to a question regarding the remake of the ninth entry in the series by Square Enix, saying that it remains in active development alongside another rumored remaster, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-playtested/">Final Fantasy Tactics remaster</a>. Unfortunately, it looks like it may be a while until we see how Zidane's adventure will get updated for modern gaming hardware, as the game isn't expected to be released in 2025, although, the insider highlighted, the fact that nothing has been heard about it doesn't mean that it won't release for sure before the end of the year. The Final Fantasy Tactics remaster also isn't expected to release this year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Both remain in active development. FFIXR isn't expected to see release in 2025. Maybe we'll see it launch in 2026.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1888418337790534097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Just because I haven't heard it... doesn't mean it's not coming this year, to be clear. I simply don't have a timeline of release on the game at the moment.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1889021467490136206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake, as mentioned above, has yet to be officially announced and was originally revealed via a huge GeForce Now leak a few years back. While multiple insiders have provided different details on the game, all have suggested that the remake will be quite <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/">faithful to the original and will have a more modest budget than the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy.</a> Final Fantasy XIV and XVI producer Naoki Yoshida also commented on a potential remake last year, acknowledging the demand and highlighting how it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-multiple-games/">difficult to remake the original with a single game</a>, although it's difficult to imagine Square Enix committing to another long undertaking with multiple games to remake a title that, while beloved by many, it's not as popular as the seventh entry in the series.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will get "additional playable characters and bosses" via DLC, according to an entry on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/">Steam page</a>. This isn't massively surprising, given that Nightreign is a multiplayer-focussed spin-off featuring preset Nightfarer heroes rather than custom RPG characters, as in vanilla <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. It also supports the idea that Nightreign is the foundation for a From Software Connected Universe of sorts, with characters and antagonists from the original Elden Ring, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> trilogy, Sekiro and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> reappearing in Nightreign via the Mystic Nexus of Monetisation.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The Steam page mention of DLC has since been removed, but not fast enough to evade the watchful harpies of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/elden-ring-nightreigns-steam-page-lets-slip-itll-have-dlc-bosses-and-player-characters/">Parsimonious Gamer</a>. The now-deleted entry didn't specify which characters or bosses, but it seems overwhelmingly likely that there will be some familiar faces. We already know that Nightreign features a few bosses from previous From Software games, including the first Dark Souls' Centipede Demon and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>'s dragon-riding solar warrior the Nameless King.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-talks-about-attacking-friends-for-their-own-good-and-other-new-elden-ring-nightreign-ideas/1100-6529380/">Gamespot</a>, From Software game director Junya Ishizaki has explained the return of Nameless King and other stalwarts as reflecting the need for variety in a battle royale-flavoured bossrush experience that thrives on creative match-ups. "We needed a lot to add to this mix, so we wanted to leverage what we deemed appropriate from our previous titles," he told the site, going on to note that "our players have a lot of affection for these characters" and that From are being careful to ground things in lore and ensure the bosses "make sense within the atmosphere and vibe of Elden Ring Nightreign".
</p>
<p>
I don't doubt Ishizaki's sincerity when he adds that "from a personal standpoint, I thought it'd be kind of fun", and I don't want to get too picky with the wording of an answer that presumably came via translator, but "leverage" is a word you tend to hear from publishers looking to squeeze more cash out of their established fictional worlds. If Nightreign finds an audience, I expect there will be plenty more leveraging. In this regard, From are of course following in the footsteps of modders, who've been porting bosses between games for yonks and even making them fight each other Salty Bet-style.
</p>
<p>
There are definitely some old From characters I'd love to see in Nightreign. It's interesting to consider how they might be adapted to the game's quickfire open world multiplayer format. Bloodborne's sorrowful cosmic being Ebrietas, for example, although that's partly because I didn't have the heart to attack her in the original game. Sekiro's many Headless varmints.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, though, I'm less interested in which characters might return than in how From Software might justify their presence at the level of environmental storytelling and backstory. While it's an angle I've overegged in the past, From's tales of overthrowing corrupted kings and being corrupted in the process can easily be read as a mythologisation of the pitfalls of prolonging a narrative franchise, stretching out stories till they become boneless and dissatisfying, and reviving characters who should have died or retired several iterations ago. 
</p>
<p>
In Dark Souls 3, for example, there is a cannibalistic monster who fights using the half-eaten husk of a character from the original game. It's interesting to place that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-dark-souls-3s-aldrich-is-2016s-best-boss">act of regurgitation</a> against what we know of Nightreign's update plans, which seem heavily informed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">the undead philosophies of live service games</a>. I wonder if the new game will end up being one big metaphor for seasonal update entropy?

It’s a success for the Ukrainian studio, a miracle, really, considering the harrowing circumstances that followed Russian’s full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. But Stalker 2 suffers from well-documented bugs and issues; chief among them A-Life 2.0.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A-Life was a key feature of the first STALKER game that governed AI behavior across the game world. At a high level, it is a system for simulating life in the Zone that works its magic seemingly independently of the player’s actions or whereabouts. It helps to create convincing AI and the emergent gameplay STALKER is famous for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GSC had said A-Life 2.0 would make the Zone feel alive as never before, that it would fuel emergent gameplay on a scale previously thought impossible. Indeed for some fans, A-Life 2.0 was STALKER 2’s biggest selling point. But when STALKER 2 actually came out players discovered that A-Life 2.0 didn’t work properly, with some questioning whether it was even in the game at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam"><u>GSC explained what went wrong with STALKER 2’s A-Life 2.0</u></a>, and vowed to fix the system. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-patch-11-is-a-big-one-adds-first-iteration-of-a-life-fixes">Patch 1.1</a>, released in December, was the first step on that road.
