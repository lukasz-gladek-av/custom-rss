            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/what-the-fuck-are-we-even-doing-here<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Scavengers Reign</em> is a sci-fi animated series that originally aired on Max in 2023 before moving to Netflix earlier this year. <a href="https://aftermath.site/you-wait-ages-for-a-bus-and-then-two-come-along-at-once" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was, and I say this without hyperbole, one of the most extraordinary works of animation I have ever seen</a>.</p><p>It was <em>wild</em>. Stunning on a technical level, breath-taking on a "look at these weird little guys level", with a story and cast of oddballs whose desperate attempts to survive on a hostile alien planet have haunted me for months. </p><p><em>Scavengers Reign</em> deserved to be seen and enjoyed by anyone who has even a passing interest in adult animation. And then it deserved to either continue with a second season or lead to a deal that allowed its creators the time and space to make something else. </p><p>But hey, this is 2024, so we're getting neither of those things. The show is, "as of right now", dead in the water, with co-creator Joe Bennett posting on Instagram:</p><p>In case that embed disappears or doesn't display properly, his post reads:</p><blockquote><p>As of right now, Scavengers Reign is not being renewed for a second season.</p><p>I wanted to let everyone know directly because I really love our fanbase, they’ve been such champions for the show, and I don’t want to leave everyone hanging.</p><p>We’ve had to fight tooth and nail every step of the way to get this show made, starting all the way back in 2016 with the Scavengers short film to the release of the first season last year.</p><p>It’s a case study for believing in something and persevering through a million and one hurdles. But, it got made, thanks especially to so many people who supported it along the way, in big and small ways. I want to thank some of those people, starting with my co-creator Charles Huettner <a href="https://www.instagram.com/charles.huettner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@charles.huettner</a> , Chris Prynoski <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chrisprynoski/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@chrisprynoski</a> and everyone at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/titmouseinc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@titmouseinc</a> , my home base at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/greenstreetpictures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@greenstreetpictures</a> , the writers, directors, and so many incredible artists who worked tirelessly on the show, and the folks at Max who were incredible partners to work with.</p><p>But this is not the end. There is more story to be told, we are ready to make another season, and we produced in-house at Green Street a teaser for what was going to come in the second season.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This is extremely disappointing on a singular level; I loved that show, and this teaser shows that the team's ideas for a second season looked just as crazy (and beautiful) as the first. </p><p>But it's even more disappointing in a wider sense. <em>Scavengers Reign</em> is one of the most remarkable achievements of modern animation. It had fans on Max, and then when it got shunted to Netflix it found even <em>more </em>fans. Did it <em>top the charts</em>? No, of course not, it's a cartoon about weird bugs and sad astronauts. But people watched it, it generated hype online, and it even managed to <em>win an Emmy</em>. </p><p>That should have been enough to ensure <em>some </em>level of success, but instead here we are, talking about a show that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/05/31/scavengers-reign-fans-launch-mission-for-season-2-on-netflix-after-max-cancellation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to beg its audience to partake in word-of-mouth marketing</a> when it switched networks just to keep it alive, and which has now been punted by Netflix presumably because it didn't make a line go up fast or hard enough. </p><p>I hope the team are able to find <em>somewhere </em>willing to help them out, if not to make a second season of <em>Scavengers Reign </em>then to at least make something similar. Because platforms like Max and Netflix have shown they're not just unfriendly to this kind of art, they don't deserve it. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible.1028463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In Nintendo's 'Corporate Management Policy Briefing', aligning with their recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-sales-nintendo-financials" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Sold 2.5m Copies in Four Days">second quarter fiscal release</a>, the company made several key announcements about their next console. The biggest of these is that the Nintendo Switch successor will be backwards compatible.</p>

<p>In a post on the social media platform <a href="https://x.com/nintendocoltd/status/1853972163033968794" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Nintendo Company Limited Post about backward compatibility">formerly known as Twitter</a>, President Furukawa shared the announcement stating:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span>At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch."</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>In their policy briefing, Nintendo further elaborates stating that, "consumers will be able to choose their next purchase from a broad selection of titles released for Nintendo Switch." While stopping short of promising that all titles will be purchasable on the new platform, it does indicate that there are plans for purchasing Switch games on their new console.</span></p>

<p><span>Additionally, Furukawa announced that Nintendo Switch Online will be on the Nintendo Switch successor, providing even further backwards compatibility of sorts. It presumably means that the games on Switch Online via emulation will also be available on their next console in this way.</span></p>

<p>As we near the end of the Switch's lifespan, we can expect to hear more about the Switch successor, as it will be announced by the end of the 2024 fiscal year, which for Nintendo ends in March 2025. Complementing this we can expect some celebratory stats about the Switch, as its sales are declining heavily, thus we are going to see more lifetime stats, even as Nintendo is predicting to sell 1m less Switch's than it predicted at the start of the year.</p>



<p>For example, Nintendo's corporate presentation shared that it has sold throughout its lifetime over 1.3 billion pieces of software, the most ever on a Nintendo console. Every year, over 100 million people are playing Nintendo Switch, with the last year having 127m players getting on the console at least once since October 2023, as counted by Nintendo accounts on devices.</p>

<p>Nintendo talks some more about their structure of business in console gaming going forward, which can help us see some of what the Nintendo Switch successor might be aiming to do. The first is the mention of merging of handheld and console, creating a unified ecosystem for Nintendo titles. This gets three separate slides in the presentation, and with the announced backwards compatibility seems extremely like to continue.</p>

<p>The second point is a focus on consumer touchpoints, such as dedicated Nintendo spots in retail (apparently in Japan only for now it appears), and providing more ways for users to digitally purchase software. One could see the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-music-app-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Nintendo Announces Bespoke Music Streaming App Nintendo Music">Nintendo Music App</a> as another way of this digital outreach. Another way is through free updates and DLC, which gets emphasized, including as a way to revitalize titles.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch Online is another example of this, with them sharing there are over 34 million Nintendo Switch Online members as of September 30th. While they have seen a decline in subscriptions, which they attribute to fewer new releases, they have seen more people opting to get the more expensive Expansion Pack part of the service as well.</p>



<p>Nintendo is preparing for the future without the Nintendo Switch as its main money maker, and setting up to match the other major consoles with the offer of backwards compatibility, and otherwise interoperablility between generations. Sometime, in the next five months, we can expect Nintendo to finally replace that question mark with an actual device and name.</p>

It wasn’t a complete surprise, however, as there had been some clues that everything on the existing hardware might carry over to the Switch 2.

At the same time, no one would have put it past Nintendo to do the unthinkable and buck the current expectations around taking your older game libraries into the future. </p><p>With Switch Online also being compatible with the next console, it seems like all of the emulation work Nintendo’s already done to make NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis games work on its modern platform won’t have to be repeated this time around when switching from one device’s virtual console to another.</p><p>But where does this leave the Switch 2's actual announcement? “Further information about the successor to Nintendo Switch, including its compatibility with Nintendo Switch, will be announced at a later date,” Furukawa added in his tweet. Many expected a reveal as early as September or October. Now, however, the window for a 2024 announcement seems to be closing fast, especially as the company prepares for its holiday blitz aimed at selling millions more of the existing Switch models. </p><p>Nintendo previously said it would announce the Switch 2, or whatever it ends up calling the successor console, before the end of March 2025. Despite the wait, the company reiterated that time-table today, saying nothing had changed. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo hasn’t announced its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Switch successor</a> yet, but we do know one thing for sure: it will be able to play current Switch games and have carryover for your Nintendo Switch Online services and account. The news was announced during Nintendo’s midyear policy briefing, with further information promised “at a later date.”</p><p>Nintendo also talked about numbers for the current Switch (<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">PDF</a>), noting that it sold 4.72 million units in the past three months, a drop of 31 percent compared to the same period last year but well above previous consoles eight years after they launched. </p><p>That adds up to 146 million Switch units sold and a new record for software sales on a Nintendo platform, which reached 1.3 billion units as of September 30th, 2024. It also noted that Switch Online subscriptions dropped slightly from last year to about 34 million members. At the same time, the number of people opting for the pricier version with the Expansion Pack library of games continues to increase.</p><p>According to the presentation, “More software has been played on Nintendo Switch than on any other Nintendo hardware.”</p><p>All three of the major console manufacturers have had spotty records with backward compatibility. Both the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782746/microsoft-xbox-backward-compatibility-76-new-games">Xbox Series X</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan">PS5</a> are mostly backward-compatible. But since the transition from the Wii U involved going from discs to cartridges, the Switch is not. Playing a game from previous Nintendo consoles at the moment is a function of optimism, involving the hope that either Nintendo releases a remastered Switch port or brings the game to its Switch Online library, but that won’t be the case this time around.</p><p>According to Nintendo, the Switch 2 (or whatever it’s actually called) is still on schedule to be revealed during this fiscal year, which runs until the end of March 2025, without interrupting Nintendo’s existing connection with over 100 million annual Switch players. </p><p>The conversation about backward compatibility isn’t just about player satisfaction but also video game preservation. A <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/14/23792586/classic-game-preservation-video-game-history-foundation-esa">report from the Video Game History Foundation</a> found that over 87 percent of games released before 2010 are “critically endangered” or unavailable for purchase. While Nintendo has brought some of its back catalog to the Switch, there are still a lot of inaccessible games. Nintendo also directly contributed to the increasing scarcity of older games by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/19/23269792/nintendo-wii-u-3ds-eshop-closing-date-2023">shutting down the Wii U / 3DS e-shop last year</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Update, November 5th, 2024:</strong> Added additional details.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Everybody loves arcade cabinets, but many people simply don’t have space in their home--or cash in their wallet--to dedicate to a full-size machine. If that’s the case, it’s worth checking out the long list of mini arcades up for grabs. These are designed from the ground up to <strong>fit onto desktops and countertops</strong>--some of which are just a few inches in size, and all of which are more affordable than full-size cabinets. They make great holiday gifts for retro gaming fans, though they’re also nice to have in your own office as a display piece (or as a way to take a break from your work).</p><p>Whatever the case may be, plenty of mini arcades are available. Some are even on sale ahead of Black Friday, giving you a chance to cross people off your shopping list before the busy holiday season. From Tiny Arcades to Arcade1Up, here’s a look at the best mini arcades.</p><h2>Tiny Arcades</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4394698-mixcollage-05-nov-2024-10-44-am-8825.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394698" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4394698-mixcollage-05-nov-2024-10-44-am-8825.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394698"></a><figcaption>Tetris and Atari 2600 Tiny Arcades</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4394698-mixcollage-05-nov-2024-10-44-am-8825.jpg"></figure><p>These Tiny Arcades take up practically no space, with microscopic 3.5-inch displays that can fit onto even the most crowded desk.

			<p>Posted by <a href="https://x.com/Stiven_SRB/status/1853933258112712918?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1853933258112712918%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user Stiven_SRB on X</a>, it's alleged that there is a Warcraft II Remaster in the works. Normally, it would be advised to take these sorts of posts with a huge pinch of salt, but due to the fact that Stiven frequently datamines Blizzard Games as a hobby, with people who are fans of the Blizzard Games seeming to rely heavily on the information released by him. It's also been leaked as of late that there are some huge updates coming for Warcraft III: Reforged, a game that has been quite controversial in the Warcraft community due to how it was handled and seemingly forgotten about. However, the Warcraft universe's 30th anniversary is fast approaching, with a special presentation taking place on <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-universe-turns-30-gets-anniversary-direct-on-november-13/">November 13</a>. This is where people will hear about content coming from World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, and Warcraft Rumble, as listed on the Blizzard Entertainment website. However, they have said there are plenty of surprises in store, so it's possible that this includes news to do with either Warcraft III or Warcraft II.</p>
<p>While the post from Stiven didn't offer much, he posted it with four pictures, which are supposed to be the key art of the game, including the logo for Warcraft II Remastered. If this is true, it seems that they will be learning from the mistakes that were made with Warcraft III: Reforged, as that game was meant to be a complete reimagining of the classic game. Warcraft III: Reforged wasn't all bad, and the gameplay improved, but for the most part, people didn't like the graphics of the new game.</p>
<p>If the news of a Warcraft II Remaster is true, it'll be interesting to see how they tackle the graphics and whether they will keep the graphics true to the original, which was originally released in 1995. The game went on to have some expansion backs, which led to a compilation of the game with the expansions named Warcraft II: The Dark Saga. However, it wasn't long ago that they added Warcraft II to Battle.net, allowing people to purchase it in the Battle.net shop. It's also available through GOG for those who want the classic experience. Because they've now made the original accessible, it seems a little bit more uncertain about how they will tackle a remaster of Warcraft II, or whether it's even in progress at Blizzard Entertainment in the first place.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-og-return-in-december/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been claimed by reputable insiders on social media that in December, Fortnite OG will return <strong>permanently</strong>. It’s expected that this will be announced during the upcoming Final event or The Game Awards in the first week of December. It gets better, though – it has also been suggested that every Chapter One season will return on a month-by-month rotation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-back-to-og">Going Back to OG</h2>



<p>Fortnite returned to OG a year ago and it was the most popular move Epic Games has ever made. In an instant, tens of millions of players poured into the game across all platforms, and records were broken worldwide. It was such a success that other developers have since leant on the idea of bringing back an original map as fan service.</p>



<p>Most recently, it was revealed that Apex Legends will be taking players back to their original map.</p>



<p>On social media, HYPEX and ShiinaBR, two reputable Fortnite leakers, corroborated claims that Fortnite OG is returning in December, but this time, it’ll be here to stay.</p>



<p>Per the claims:</p>



<ul>
<li>All Chapter One seasons (1 – 10) will return, with each one lasting a month</li>



<li>Only OG loot will be available and the map will support both Build and Zero Build</li>
</ul>



<p>This could be huge – but will it have the draw that OG Fortnite had last year when it was reintroduced for the first time? It’s possible. </p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed that Epic is partnering with footwear brands like Jordans to produce new, in-game cosmetics called Kicks. Also, several hip-hop artists including Eminem and Snoop Dogg were added to the game as playable skins and boss characters.</p>



<p>What do you think about this news? Are you stoked about Fortnite OG potentially coming back? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
Following a seemingly solid launch for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, there's probably a fair few series newcomers considering delving into the original trilogy. But anyone hoping for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-shares-detailed-breakdown-of-mass-effect-legendary-editions-extensive-changes">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition style remaster</a> shouldn't hold their breath; Dragon Age: The Veilguard creative director John Epler says the project "wouldn't be easy" because hardly anyone left at BioWare knows how the studio's old engine works.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</a> was well-received when it launched back in 2021, introducing the likes of improved performance and visuals, enhanced models, new lighting, gameplay tweaks, and more. It was a welcome finessing of a classic trilogy, and the kind of treatment most would probably agree BioWare's other beloved series deserves.
</p>
<p>
However, in a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/">recent interview with Rolling Stone</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/dragon-age-boss-says-a-legendary-edition-style-remaster-of-the-old-games-in-the-series-is-unlikely-because-theres-maybe-20-people-left-at-bioware-who-know-how-their-engine-works/">PC Gamer</a>), Dragon Age: The Veilgaurd creative director John Epler - who's been with BioWare since the original Dragon Age's release back in 2009 - noted that while he'd love to see the trilogy get the remaster treatment, it would be a challenge due to the games' proprietary engines.

<p>
Unlike the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> trilogy, which was developed in Unreal Engine 3, Dragon Age Inquisition was created using EA's Frostbite engine, while Dragon Age 1 &amp; 2, more problematically, were built using BioWare's own Eclipse Engine. "I think I'm one of about maybe 20 people left at BioWare who’s actually used Eclipse," Epler explained. "[Remastering Dragon Age is] something that's not going to be as easy Mass Effect, but we do love the original games."
</p>
<p>
But there's perhaps some small hope for Dragon Age fans, given Epler didn't entirely shut down the idea. "Never say never," he added, "I guess that's what it comes down to."
</p>
<p>
Of course, EA's interest in giving Dragon Age the Legendary Edition treatment - and indeed its continuing interest in the series as a whole - will likely hinge on the success of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-off-to-solid-start-on-steam">appeared to get off to a solid start</a> when it launched last week. The publisher hasn't yet trumpeted any official figures, but The Veilguard did manage an all-time peak of 89,418 concurrent players on Steam, setting a new record for a single-player EA game.
</p><p>
What that means for The Veilguard's future is unclear, but speaking ahead of launch, Epler said BioWare's "full attention... has shifted entirely to the next Mass Effect", meaning it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dlc-plans-unknown-as-bioware-shifts-full-attention-to-next-mass-effect-game">no DLC plans</a>, beyond "quality-of-life improvements and a handful of smaller content updates".
</p>
<p>
Regardless of what happens next, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a bit of a treat. "What BioWare has managed to accomplish here, in the face of all the pressure it's faced since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> came out 10 years ago, is extraordinary," Eurogamer's Robert Purchese wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">five star review</a>. "The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling. It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general. This is among the very best of them."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/talisman-alliances-review-work-together-for-even-harder-challenge<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Setting out on an adventure across the world of Talisman, in a quest for the Crown of Command, has always been a perilous and lonely one. With the release of <em>Talisman Alliances</em>&nbsp;Avalon Hill flipped the formula on its head turning <em>Talisman </em>into a cooperative experience where you'll party up with all other players to take on the game itself.</p>

<h2>What is in the <em>Talisman Alliances</em> box?</h2>

<p>Opening up the <em>Talisman Alliances</em> game box you'll immediately be greeted with a warning. This warning is to indicate to you that while there's a lot present in the box, you need to be following the instructions to not only ensure how to set up the game, but what you aren't allowed to look at.</p>

<p>The box comes with instructions, Doom tracker and token, Villain Strength and Craft tokens, as well as Adventure, Spell, and Villain cards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most interesting aspect of this box to inquisitive players will be the Trial 1 card, the sealed envelopes, and the small boxes that state "Don't Open Until You've Completed Trial X"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-alliances-instructions.jpg?itok=jtMG1PrG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-alliances-instructions.jpg?itok=SCWyMfz7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In order to be a good cooperative game the team at Avalon Hill haven't just created a way for a party of players to have a focus for their adventure, but they have built a narrative into the game. Each Trial has an introductory story, a relevant loose plot, and a conclusion that tees up the next adventure.</p>

<p>Each subsequent trial also has an increased difficulty and allows you to not only progress the story, but also unlock new characters for the base game. I won't go too far into the spoilers but after completing Trial 1 you unlock the ghostly Will Of The Wisp character adding new mechanics and an expanded way to play not just in the cooperative expansion, but as a way to further enhance the base game.</p>

<p>In this way, <em>Talisman Alliances</em> reminded me of what I've seen for examples of game progression in titles like Frosthaven.</p>

<h2>Changes To Setup</h2>

<p>The instruction booklet shows you exactly how you're mean to set up <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fd34cf48-e3d7-4dbb-ab3c-d2e1a4c191be" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/talisman-5e-review-fast-paced-high-fantasy-adventures"><em>Talisman 5e</em></a> to function as a cooperative adventure.</p>

<p>This process isn't entirely simple, requiring you to filter out a number of Adventure and Magic cards, sub in different cards from the expansion, and then add the Villain Cards in a very specific manner to the Adventure deck to allow for a better pace and balance.</p>

<p>While it might not be simple it does show how much planning went into how to take a game that has historically been very competitive and turn it into an entirely cooperative experience.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-alliances-active-play.jpg?itok=ZxjhcMQP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-alliances-active-play.jpg?itok=Ev1a3S3U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>How Does It Work?</h2>

<p>For<em> Talisman Alliances</em> the goal of the game is to complete each of the prescribed Trials. Each Trial has a sealed and an unsealed state. For example the first Trial has the players obtaining two Talismans, either from the Adventure deck or by completing the regular other Talisman-obtaining tasks, and burying those Talismans in two of the four corners of the map.</p>

<p>Completing this then unseals the Trial, flipping over the card you're now given additional instructions as well as the true villain of the Trial. While this does end up leading you to the center of the map in Trial 1 the rest of the trials take you to different objectives around the board.</p>

<p>Unsealing the Trial will also reveal the winning objective. This is a powerful creature that will have appeared somewhere on the board. Once you've built your strength up enough one, or multiple, members of the party can join up in battle to try to thwart this foe.</p>



<p>These boss fights are hard, progressing through the trials you'll see cases where these monsters aren't just stronger (with stats going into the mid to high teens) but they will also start to have additional mechanics or multiple lives. Cooperation doesn't just become a side effect of the game, but a necessity, as you start filling into certain RPG roles where you can.</p>

<p>If you were the type of competitive <em>Talisman </em>player before then interacting with the game in this way will force you to have just as competitive friends as some of these fights are a real uphill struggle.</p>

<h2>The Villains Who Try To Stop You</h2>

<p>The primary antagonists aren't the only thing getting in your way as you'll also have to deal with a number of Villains that will be roaming the board.</p>



<p>Villains act as a natural hazard around the game board, some are placed at the start of the game while others are revealed naturally as the Adventure deck is drawn from. Each of these Villains when pulled trigger a turn for the game's AI. Here Villains will progress around the board with simplistic movements until they reach a player and fight them.</p>

<p>It's in the best interest for the stronger players to try to seek out these encounters, while the squishier classes move out of the line of danger.</p>

<p>I played the Troll, a character that starts out very strong, but in a regular game of <em>Talisman </em>his low Craft and Fate would be a massive detriment. In <em>Talisman Alliances</em> where I didn't need to worry about other players preying on my weaknesses, but working to support them, it was a lot of fun coordinating attacks and grouping up to take on some of these terrifying Villain characters.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-alliances-troll.jpg?itok=4mXJqnrE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-alliances-troll.jpg?itok=SFjfccLs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Talisman Alliances</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I was very interested to try playing <em>Talisman Alliances</em> after my experiences, I wondered how a game build based on competitive competition would achieve this shift and they absolutely nailed it.</p>

<p>Sure there's extra legwork to assemble/disassemble it into it's competitive game mode but the goals to complete and the way you approach even character selection is so wildly different it almost feels like playing an entirely different game.</p>

<p>I do feel like the difficulty scale probably could have started a bit easier, but after a first loss it left my table rearing for another try now that we really understood how each of us had to fit our role.</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that the buy-in to this experience is not only <em>Talisman Alliances</em> but also the base <em>Talisman </em>game I'd definitely recommend trying the original first, but if the idea of playing that as a party against powerful enemies is up your alley then you'll have a blast.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/john-harper-announces-blades-in-dark-deep-cuts-ttrpgs-first-official-supplement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The creator of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/blades-in-dark-review-next-level-roleplaying" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Blades in the Dark</em></a> has announced its first official expansion. The expansion, <em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em>, contains new worldbuilding details for the game's setting and new alternative gameplay mechanics.</p>

<h2>The <em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the game's itch page, <em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em> is a 118-page supplement. The book is broken up into two parts. One part introduces new lore into the game's electropunk city of Duskvol. The second part contains new modular rules systems for players to use in their games.</p>

Players can choose from 100 new heritage and backgrounds to better flesh out their characters.</p>

<p>In addition, the book includes 13 new technological innovations to reflect the setting's ongoing industrial age advances. Those advancements include new rare and nefarious tech that Scoundrels can use in their next job.</p>

<p>For those wanting more dynamic elements, <em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em> introduces a new concept: Catalysts. A Catalyst is a world-shaking event that expands and alters the setting, providing new avenues for intrigue and new opportunities for every crew type.</p>

<p>As for the modular rules, the book includes six new ones. They include flexible Harm &amp; Trauma rules, and a modified Advancement system designed to customize character progress.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the book includes a revised Load and Action system. The former is more closely tied to the game's fiction while remaining simple. The latter streamlines the base game's action resolution mechanics. It is designed to empower players further and speed up the process of play.</p>

<p><em>Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts</em> is available right now in PDF form for $10.00. It is also sold in a bundle with the original <em>Blades in the Dark</em> for $27. There are currently no plans for a physical release.</p>

It’s the most recent game from the video game auteur Hideo Kojima, known for games like the genre-defining stealth series, <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> and it’s on sale on Steam at the moment! <strong>You’ve got till November 11 to pick up </strong><em><strong>Death Stranding Director’s Cut </strong></em><strong>for $20 on Steam, and I think it’s the perfect game for the moment.</strong></p><p>In <em>Death Stranding, </em>you play as Sam Porter Bridges, a sort of post-apocalyptic delivery man who’s tasked with trekking across the ruins of the United States of America, reconnecting the various cities and settlements you find via the erection of new infrastructure, and healing a fragmented nation. I don’t know exactly why, but something about that just feels so resonant and timely.</p><p>In <em>Death Stranding</em>, you literally walk across the country. It’s kind of abridged, because <em>that </em>version of this game would take even longer than <em>Death Stranding </em>currently is, but that is the literal goal here. There are alternative ways of traveling, including zipines that you can establish, as well as vehicles that you can eventually unlock, but the main thing you will do in <em>Death Stranding </em>is walk across plains, hike up mountains, and stumble into creeks and rivers. If you’ve ever wanted to touch grass from the safety of your bed or couch, this is the game for you.<br></p><p>When <em>Death Stranding </em>was first released in 2019, it wasn’t the most popular thing in the world. Many balked at the thought of Kojima making a game that’s essentially one big “walking simulator,” a term that’s been thrown around derogatorily for years. Though Kojima’s narratives and characters are often larger than life, <em>Death Stranding</em> appeared to steer more into the esoteric than fans of his were willing to entertain, with hokily named folks like Die-Hardman taking up significant space. Despite the fact that <em>Death Stranding </em>did feature stealth, combat, celebrities from film and TV, as well as some major set pieces, it didn’t land with the impact of a typical Kojima game, and was even viewed as a bit of a rogue move from the esteemed developer.</p><p>As always though, Kojima was simply a bit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/video-games-innovative-gta3-skyrim-1850976541&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/video-games-innovative-gta3-skyrim-1850976541">ahead of his time</a></span>. This is after all the guy responsible for countless prescient <em>Metal Gear Solid </em>titles, specifically <em>Sons of Liberty </em>and <em>Guns of the Patriots</em>. The year after <em>Death Stranding</em>—a game about the isolation bred from the increasingly polarized political attitudes in the world, as well as a pandemic-like cataclysm—COVID-19 upended the lives of everyone around the world, initiating a global shutdown and plummeting society into a deeply isolating and dark period in our history. As people began to note the parallels between our own nightmare of a reality and the world of <em>Death Stranding</em>, the game outgrew its oddball status, took on cult acclaim, and now there’s even a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-trailer-tgs-2024-panel-1851660760&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-release-date-trailer-tgs-2024-panel-1851660760">weird-ass sequel</a></span> on the way.</p><p>Now it’s timely all over again for, y’know, <em>other </em>reasons. Reasons for which it was also timely this time four years ago. Maybe we all ought to sit down with <em>Death Stranding </em>and learn a thing or two from Sam Bridges so that we can sidestep the cataclysms in our own lives.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They’re just deep<em> Harry Potter </em>fans, and we try to build authentic experiences to delight them.”</p><p> Those experiences include <em>Hogwarts Legacy 2</em>, which, while not officially announced yet, is a “one of the biggest priorities” for the publisher, and an HBO series that will give the original books the <em>Game of Thrones </em>treatment. Here’s an excerpt from the<em> Variety</em> piece:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Haddad says the games team has been coordinating some of the big-picture storytelling elements in the “Hogwarts Legacy” sequel with the storylines that will play out in the “Harry Potter” HBO series coming from Warner Bros. Television. He notes that the success of “Hogwarts Legacy” helped stoke confidence that the time was right to make a major Potter push: “The rest of the company was very curious about what we helped to unlock with ‘Hogwarts Legacy’ last year.”</p></blockquote><p>Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zazlav <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/harry-potter-tv-series-max-release-date-cast-1235323284/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/harry-potter-tv-series-max-release-date-cast-1235323284/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed earlier this year</a></span> that the plan was for the <em>Harry Potter </em>TV show to hit in 2026, with casting for main characters like Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley already underway. <em>Hogwarts Legacy 2</em>, meanwhile, seems unlikely to arrive until 2027 or 2028 at the earliest as big-budget games continue development timelines of 4-6 years and beyond. </p><p>The original game takes place in the 1890s, and while it’s not clear when a sequel would be set, it would likely be laying the groundwork for the particular flavor of <em>Hogwarts</em>’ history to be referenced in the TV remake, no doubt with Marvel-style easter eggs to pull fans from one to the other. </p><p>As for J.K. Rowling’s ongoing involvement in <em>Harry Potter</em>, Haddad said that while she is not directly involved in any planning related to the universe outside of the books, the controversy-courting YA author is still kept in the loop. “If we’re going to ever go beyond a canon conversation, we make sure that we’re all comfortable with what we’re doing,” Robert Oberschelp, Warner Bros.

<p>Activision has revealed that as the game passes its fifth anniversary, Call of Duty Mobile has surpassed <strong>one billion downloads</strong>, since 2019. This staggering figure makes Call of Duty Mobile the best-selling COD game ever, and it’s almost guaranteed that it’ll never be topped as long as we all live.</p>



<p>On November 6, the game’s tenth season went live, and hundreds of millions of players set about exploring another battle pass, new weapons, maps, modes, and more.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-best-selling-call-of-duty-game-ever-made">The Best-Selling Call of Duty Game Ever Made</h2>



<p>COD Mobile is the most accessible and universally appreciated Call of Duty game ever. It has a huge esports market and competitive ecosystem, and in some areas of the world, it’s the number-one Call of Duty game, even with the traditional premium releases coming around once a year.</p>



<p>In 2019, COD Mobile was released, and today, the developers are still adding more maps, modes, and operators, allowing players to earn COD points and unlock more to flesh out their free profile. While we’re on the topic, you can check out our guide to unlock <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-cod-mobile-points/">free COD Points</a> in COD Mobile.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-mobile-season-10-fifth-anniversary-celebration-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent blog post</a>, the Activision team made a small announcement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Happy 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>&nbsp;players! Thanks to you,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>&nbsp;has now reached over *ONE BILLION downloads worldwide since its launch in 2019*.</p>



<p>Join the celebration when Season 10 — 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Anniversary launches November 6 at 5 PM PT.</p>
</blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[Planet Coaster 2 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/planet-coaster-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/planet-coaster-2-review.1028319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/planet-coaster-2-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When we already have a theme park simulator as good as Planet Coaster, it can be tricky to imagine what a sequel might add. And Planet Coaster 2, most of the time, does feel pretty similar to the first one. That isn't necessarily a bad thing since I really liked the original. Adding water rides is exciting and refreshing, and even deeper visual customization is downright impressive, while equally daunting in how the options are presented. But this is still much more of a park decorating sim than a park management one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where the recent Frontier games (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/planet-coaster-review">Planet Coaster</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/13/planet-zoo-review">Planet Zoo</a>) have really excelled is in the nearly ridiculous amount of visual customization options available. Hundreds of modular pieces that can be recolored, resized, rotated, and overlapped allow you to create just about anything you can imagine. The terrain editor is more powerful than ever here, and the tools for carving my dreams into the landscape are pretty intuitive. It does feel a bit like being thrown into the deep end, though. I get decision paralysis from the sheer amount of choice, and risk getting bogged down in making each little decoration perfect.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Planet Coaster 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't find that level of fiddliness to be as enjoyable as designing rides or running a park, but the pre-made decor doesn't quite fill the gap to where I feel like I can skip that step and still get the theming I want. Plopping down an unadorned ride feels boring, and the pre-decorated ones don't have quite enough variety. What I really found myself longing for was something in-between the extremes of fussing over every handrail and accepting unthemed or pre-themed attractions. But thanks to Steam Workshop integration – always a great addition – I'm sure the community will have me covered after the true detail masters have more time to tinker.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where I do really like that fine control is when I'm building rides, and the coaster editor is more powerful and easier to use than ever. Creating banks, corkscrews, spirals, loops, and bends of all sizes feels intuitive and almost effortless thanks to the great UI. The option to automatically finish a track with one click when you're getting close to the end works really well this time around, too, and allowed me to skip the hassle of fishing for the right angle to bring everyone safely into the station.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sandbox mode presents a beautiful canvas for almost anything I can dream up.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite how much I enjoy the act of building my ideal park, the original Planet Coaster was neither challenging nor interesting as a management tycoon game, and that has unfortunately not changed. Even after messing with the difficulty settings, of which there are several, I found it almost mindlessly simple to generate infinite money with a small number of flat rides and a high entry fee. You can now sell what are basically Disney's Fast Passes as another income stream, in addition to charging extra for a pool pass on water rides. There are deeper systems for guest preferences and even things like sunburn in sunny climates, which is all neat in theory. But when I'm making so much money that I can basically ignore all of it, why would I care? Power management is also new, but why am I building generators in a theme park game? What theme park supplies its own electricity?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Staff management is still mostly hands-off, with some nice new quality-of-life features like being able to select from three different preset pay levels instead of typing in the numbers yourself. The annoying thing this time is that, unless I was entirely missing some core feature, the ride maintenance system seems to be broken currently. No matter how many mechanics I hired – at one point I had one per ride, plus a couple extra to cover breaks – I was constantly getting notifications about rides being in poor condition or breaking down. Once they <em>had </em>broken down, my staff was pretty quick to address the issue. But I'm not sure what they were doing the rest of the time. Am I supposed to manually dispatch them every time a ride drops below a certain repair level? Because they don't seem to pay attention to that until it's too late.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I couldn't really get my head around the scheduling screen, and the in-game tutorials are not much help. In fact, they seem to start from a point of assuming you already know how to play Planet Coaster, skipping over a lot of the basics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, the sandbox mode is still the star of the show for me, presenting a beautiful canvas on which to realize almost anything I can dream up. The underwhelming management layer doesn't detract from the joy of laying out everything with ease and total freedom, building whole attractions from scratch, and getting to ride my custom coasters in glorious first-person. All of the reasons I already loved the first Planet Coaster are not only alive and well here, they have all been improved in some way. So if I sound a bit down on this sequel, it's only because I don't feel the need to go back over every single thing that was already great about this series, but you can check out my review of the first Planet Coaster for a refresher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Customizable pools, flumes, splash rides, and even water coasters open up the opportunity to create totally new kinds of parks, which kept me from feeling like I was playing the same game again but a little bit prettier. I do wish the pool editor would simply let me paint a shape rather than fiddling with polygons and a somewhat iffy rounding tool. But getting the shapes I wanted was really just a matter of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a career mode that features a handful of increasingly complex scenarios and challenges to master. It does an okay job of introducing some new concepts, like those water rides, but I still think it's missing some major steps to onboard someone who might be new to the series. Also the dialogue is just… ugh. I think I would rather listen to cats dancing on stainless steel sheeting than these painful little skits that wouldn't pass muster in most modern childrens' cartoons.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Water rides kept it from feeling like I was playing the same game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What I did like about these scenarios, similar to those in the first game, was that they show off the kinds of things you can do with the tools available to you, serving as a source of inspiration for my own parks. I was never going to stick with them once I'd earned enough stars to move on (it's just not as fun to finish something someone else already started than it is to build from the ground up), but I definitely stole a lot of cool ideas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Performance is also very respectable. Even at 4K, I was getting 60+ fps on my RTX 4070 Super most of the time, though a bit below that in the absolute most elaborate parks. I was able to do really silly stuff like recreating the Erdtree from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">Elden Ring</a> using what must have been hundreds and hundreds of golden pyrotechnics, and the level-of-detail swapping refused to let my shenanigans, however ridiculous, banish my park to slideshow territory.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developer Creatures does share the odds of getting each card, with "rare packs" coming in at one in every 200 picks, and the rarer cards come in at just a small percentage of these.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures therefore doesn't intend for specific packs to have secret increased odds, but it's not impossible that some sort of bug connects these twisted packs with a rare card.

                <p>An upcoming indie game inspired by action films like The Raid looks to deliver on the brutal hand-to-hand combat the film is known for. It may even invoke some comparisons 2012's underappreciated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sleeping-dogs/" data-ref-id="5000-61973">Sleeping Dogs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/acts-of-blood/" data-ref-id="5000-631942">Acts of Blood</a>, and though it doesn't yet have a release date, it did recently receive a free demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3031890/Acts_of_Blood/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> that lets players fight their way through a portion of its main story. Players step into the shoes of an Indonesian college student named Hendra, who is seeking revenge after his father is murdered by a business rival. When the government's corrupt legal system protects the killers, Hendra takes justice into his own hands and looks to make them pay for their crimes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBC1PT6UrJ0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gBC1PT6UrJ0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">A look at Acts of Blood's gameplay shows off its quick and bloody melee combat, with Hendra able to swiftly swap from punches and kicks to wielding melee weapons like bats, knives, hammers, and machetes. There are firearms as well, though the emphasis looks to be on the brutally efficient hand-to-hand combat. The environment plays a big role in combat too, with Kendra able to use parkour to run, slide, and climb through levels, as well as ustilize destructible objects in the environment as weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Eksil Team, the developer behind the game, isn't shying away from the brutality of it all. In the game's mature content description on Steam, Eksil Team states the game includes blood, gore, and dismemberment, and that the violence is "frequent and integral to the gameplay experience, with detailed and realistic portrayals of combat injuries."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/VoyagersRevenge/status/1853604780247265500" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">This new Beat ‘em up game inspired by The Raid films combines 3rd person action with fast-paced martial arts, and brutal hand-to-hand combat.

If that wasn't clear from the blood-soaked fights, The Raid and its sequel, as well as Acts of Blood, all take place in Indonesia. But its focus on melee combat also brings to mind Square-Enix's Sleeping Dogs, another hand-to-hand combat-heavy action title known for its over-the-top environmental kills that was in turn inspired by Hong Kong action films. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sifu/" data-ref-id="5000-527647">Sifu</a>, a more recent beat-'em-up title, is another game Acts of Blood looks to be inspired by, though the 2022 game (despite its Mature rating) is far less blood-soaked than Acts of Blood.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to playing through some of its story, the Acts of Blood demo includes an arena mode so players can fine-tune their combat skills, as well as outfit customization that lets players tailor Hendra's look.

Not content with throwing load of <em>documented</em> new features into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> on mobile with this week's long-awaited 1.6 update, it turns out developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone also chucked in a pretty major unannounced one too; a secret experimental multiplayer mode is now available to mobile players, if they're feeling sufficiently brave.
</p>
<p>
Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853844270807175428">confirmed</a> the existence of Stardew Valley mobile's (now no longer) secret multiplayer mode in a message shared on social media, accompanying the reveal with a <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/mobile-multiplayer-guide/">detailed guide</a> on how to get it up and running. That process starts with the installation of this week's 1.6 update, available to download now, after which players will need to summon their powers of recollection and bash out the legendary Konami code - or most of it at least.
</p>
<p>
Eagled-eyed players should notice four leaves festooning Stardew Valley's title screen logo once update 1.6 is installed: the one top-right points up, the one bottom-left points down, top-left points left, and botton-right points right. With that in mind, players then need to enter the following code by tapping the corresponding leaves: up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right. After that, it's simply a matter of poking the question mark at the bottom of the screen to reveal the main menu's hidden co-op session button.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Let's Play Stardew Valley Multiplayer - BEERS FOR DAYS, MATES. BEERS FOR DAYS!" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytFkHZpAqh0?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">
<span>Let's Play Stardew Valley Multiplayer - BEERS FOR DAYS, MATES. BEERS FOR DAYS!</span>

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytFkHZpAqh0?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ytFkHZpAqh0?autoplay=1">

<p>
From there, players can choose to either join or host a new multiplayer game, but hosts will first need to set up a farm, while those joining will require the host's IP address, as detailed in Barone's instructions. Additionally, all participants must be on the same network or connecting to a player who is port-forwarding their game. It's not, then, the most straightforward of solutions, but it does have the benefit that mobile players can also join a PC-hosted game via IP.
</p><p>
Barone readily acknowledges the less-than-perfect nature of Stardew Valley multiplayer on mobile right now, noting connectivity issues "could make a multiplayer session frustrating, under certain scenarios". As such, he suggests the ideal way to play would be for mobile users to connect to a PC host using "high-end" devices on the same local network, rather than to, say, a mobile host attempting to play while on-the-go. He also warns the mode "might still have some bugs or issues", with a <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/mobile-multiplayer-guide/">few additional notes shared in his guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
Stardew Valley's massive 1.6 update finally hit mobile and consoles earlier this week after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">launching for PC back in March</a>. It adds, among other things, the ability to guzzle mayonnaise, a new farm type, new festivals, new crafting items, new dialogue, and, perhaps most importantly, hats for cats and dogs. It also includes everything featured in Barone's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-latest-update-adds-a-new-friend-to-retrieve-lost-items-and-more">recent 1.6.9 patch for PC</a>. All of which is to say, it's not too surprising to hear Barone <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-developer-has-not-touched-haunted-chocolatier-in-a-long-time-due-to-ongoing-update-work">hasn't done any additional work</a> on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, "in a long time".

			<p>Despite the Harry Potter franchise being incredibly dated at this point, it still has a considerable fanbase. As a result, more and more content within the IP continues to be released, with Hogwarts Legacy being one of the latest endeavors of Warner Bros. Not only have there been books, games, and movies, they are now branching out into a TV show, which is due to debut on HBO in 2026. However, it turns out that Warner Bros. has made Hogwarts Legacy a 'huge priority.' It's no surprise that Hogwarts Legacy ended up being the top-selling game of 2023 and has sold over 30 million units as of last month. With the success of Hogwarts Legacy, they've also released Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions and a remaster of the Lego Harry Potter games.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery's Chief Financial Officer has said that a direct sequel to Hogwarts Legacy is a goal for the development team moving forward. "Obviously, a successor to Hogwarts Legacy is one of the biggest priorities in a couple of years down the road," says WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels in <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/harry-potter-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-game-warner-bros-1236130719/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview</a> at the Bank of America's 2024 Media, Communications &amp; Entertainment Conference. Although Hogwarts Legacy was quite successful, that doesn't mean that every game recently released by Warner Bros. has been. The most recent big release for the studio was Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and that did not sell very well at all. It's been considered a "miss" by the company, and it seems that they are pivoting heavily into more Harry Potter content.</p>
<p>While they have released Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, it's worth noting that this game is in no way a sequel to Hogwarts Legacy, and is treated as it's own standalone title. However, it's been confirmed by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Haddad</a>, the President of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, that they are looking for ways to produce content within the Wizarding World.</p>
<p>"We have known for some time that fans are looking for more things in this world, and so we're spending a lot of time thinking about that. Our insights tell us that there are not huge distinctions between a younger version of a fan and an older version of a fan. They're just deep Harry Potter fans, and we try to build authentic experiences to delight them."</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this IP belongs to J.K. Rowling, it's been confirmed that she is not involved with the management of the franchise but is instead receiving updates via her literary agent. It's been stated that the game development team behind Hogwarts Legacy has been working on some of the big-picture storytelling elements in the sequel, with the storylines set to play out in the Harry Potter HBO TV series. Whether this means they are directly linked and are considered a canon event seems a little bit up in the air right now.</p>
<p>Harry Potter doesn't seem to be dying any time soon, with experiences being opened in the Universal Theme Park, new games consistently being in development or released, and many new ways to create content. Hogwarts Legacy is set to get a<a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/"> remastered version</a> in the future, adding extra content for players to explore.</p>

It might not be the easiest game to get through at times due to its tough themes, but it’s remarkable nonetheless and stands out as one of this year’s best games.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196215,196055" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Despite what <em>Mouthwashing</em>’s first sequence may suggest, this isn’t really a horror game that thrives on adrenaline pumping jump scares. After running through the twisting halls of a spaceship, chased by a horse mascot, the game turns into something much more surreal and narratively dense. You will be introduced to the five person crew of the freighter ship <em>Tulpar, </em>which has been stranded in space with no hope of rescue after the captain (Curly) nearly destroyed the ship in the midst of a mental breakdown. That leaves him and the four other crew members of the <em>Tulpar</em> left to deal with their own existential crises over the likelihood of their impending deaths. </p><p>This is, to say the least, a pretty big bummer of a plot. It’s also a set up for what becomes a surrealist trip through each crew member’s lives, hopes, and struggles. While the game loosely guides you through its walking simulator-esque structure, the writing sharply dissects each character and puts their insides on display for you. You’ll come to empathize with the nervous nurse Anya, the young intern Daisuke, and even the grouchy elder Swansea.</p><figure id="" data-id="ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-recommend-id="image://ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman sits at a table surrounded by mouthwash with on-screen text that reads &quot;Jimmy: You thinking about drinking that too?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman sits at a table surrounded by mouthwash with on-screen text that reads &quot;Jimmy: You thinking about drinking that too?&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Critical Reflex</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-recommend-id="image://ccae7fb1757c216bf5cc361aa128cb0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman sits at a table surrounded by mouthwash with on-screen text that reads &quot;Jimmy: You thinking about drinking that too?&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The two remaining crew members, Curly and Jimmy, will take up a majority of the game’s focus. Curly survives what appears to be a suicide attempt in the form of crashing the ship, but is now bedridden. Unable to speak or move, you interact with him only by giving him medicine. You do this in the shoes of JImmy, the co-pilot and current captain following the crash. Jimmy, at times, appears to be the only person on the <em>Tulpar</em> who still has some sanity. While the rest of the crew is coping with their imminent deaths in unique ways, Jimmy tries to hold the crew together. But <em>Mouthwashing </em>digs into Jimmy even further.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While not traditional horror, <em>Mouthwashing </em>still has hallmarks of psychological horror in its claustrophobic atmosphere and dark themes. In that way it evokes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482"><em>Silent Hill 2</em></a></span>. That comparison becomes even more apt when the truth about Jimmy becomes clear. Like <em>Silent Hill 2</em>’s James, Jimmy is not the hero he is made out to be. Rather, he is the root of the issues on board the <em>Tulpar</em>. By flashing between scenes prior to, during, and after the crash, <em>Mouthwashing </em>slowly reveals that Jimmy, not Curly, caused the crash in an attempt to kill the entire crew. This was in response to discovering Anya had become pregnant after he sexually assaulted her.</p><p>While Silent Hill 2 eventually forgives James for his crimes, and encourages the player to see him as a flawed but redeemable character, <em>Mouthwashing </em>takes no such approach with Jimmy. Despite living in his mind for the majority of the game, Jimmy is shown to be a disease amongst the crew who, even in his final moments, cannot take responsibility for his actions. As the game progresses, the slowly decaying state of the <em>Tulpar </em>and its crew members act as a reflection of Jimmy’s decaying mental state, which is further illustrated by the story’s structure becoming fractured and twisted as you progress. By <em>Mouthwashing</em>’s end, there is nothing that seems to be based in reality about Jimmy’s existence on the <em>Tulpar</em>. He cannot live with the reality of his actions.</p><hr><p>In a year of great games, many of them lengthy AAA RPGs that will take you dozens of hours to beat, <em>Mouthwashing </em>is a short but highly impactful title that you shouldn’t miss.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
