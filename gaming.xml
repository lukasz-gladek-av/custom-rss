		<p>Incoming Microsoft Gaming CEO Asha Sharma has spent a lot of the time since being announced and taking on the role trying to spread a positive message for the future of Xbox, giving reassurance to Xbox gamers by stating that she is committed to a “return to Xbox”, and also that the current Xbox strategy is under review.</p>
<p>“The plan’s the plan until it’s not the plan,” she said in <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty">an interview with Windows Central</a>, which is… helpful.</p>


<p>In her full quotes, she says:</p>
<p>“I think that our core Xbox fans and players have invested up to 25 years of themselves in these universes and our console. I want to make sure everybody knows I’m committed to Xbox, starting with the console. We’re going to keep meeting players where they are — the world continues to evolve and change. We’re going to make sure Xbox is a great place for developers and players. We want to invest in reducing the artificial divide between different types of devices that they want to use with us. I think that’s going to mean a lot more investment in breaking down the barriers, in helping developers build once and show up across different hardware experiences. For me, I believe Xbox starts with its fans, and we’ll grow from there. That’s what I wanted to signal with the “return” to Xbox.”</p>
<p>This seems to suggest that, console will remain a pillar for Xbox, but that Microsoft are still going to push ahead with more game streaming, more Windows gaming and cross-platform games.</p>

<p>Then again…</p>
<p>“Right now, I need to learn, candidly. About the ‘why’ of these decisions, what we were optimizing for, and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That’s the honest answer. I’m looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan’s the plan until it’s not the plan.”</p>
<p>So, maybe exclusivity is back on the menu?</p>
<p>Honestly, that’s probably not going to happen as soon as she’s able to look at the revenue breakdown per platform. Releasing games on PlayStation will likely provide a major revenue stream that Xbox cannot give back when their console player base is so far behind.</p>
<p>The problem from the outside looking in is that there doesn’t seem to have been a cohesive plan over the last few years. Outside of Call of Duty, there’s no way of knowing which games will be cross-platform on day one, which games will be held back from PlayStation for half a year, which for a year. Change the plan down the line, but maybe make it a bit clearer?</p>
<p>Booty also commented to say that gamers should not expect dramatic changes in the near future, while also saying that they still intend to be a first party platform holder.</p>
<h3>Further reading: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/24/hero-to-net-zero-what-is-phil-spencers-legacy-at-xbox/">Hero to Net Zero – What is Phil Spencer’s legacy at Xbox?</a></h3>
<p>As <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/20/phil-spencer-retires-from-xbox-with-coreai-exec-asha-sharma-taking-over-as-microsoft-gaming-ceo/">announced last week</a>, Asha Sharma has taken over as CEO, retaining Matt Booty in a slightly more senior role as Chief Content Officer, while Phil Spencer is retiring and Sarah Bond has quit as Xbox President. While Spencer has stated that he had decided months ago to retire and organised a succession plan with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, it was a snap change announced on Friday and taking effect on Monday.</p>
<p>Despite this supposed planning, Sharma is seemingly now engaging in a massive discovery tour. Not really being a gamer prior to taking on this job, and with her background as an AI division executive at Meta and Microsoft, she’s taken recommendations from social media for games to try. She’s also repeatedly stated that she is learning where the Xbox business is currently at… which, look… shouldn’t that have been taking place through the last few months? Or wouldn’t it have been better to announce a longer, more managed handover so this could take place? That’s clearly on Spencer and Nadella.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the year of the company's <strong>35th anniversary</strong>, <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> president <strong>Johanna Faries</strong> wants to usher in a new era for the revered game developer, and that includes <strong>the expansion of its franchises into cinema and TV</strong>. In an interview <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/blizzard-plans-updates-diablo-wow-overwatch-johanna-faries-1236670302/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Variety</a>, Faries stated:</p>



<p><em>We talk a lot about this. We’re not Blizzard Games, we’re Blizzard Entertainment. We want to be able to show up on every screen imaginable. We want to be able to create new fans who may not have been with us for the past 35 years. How we continue to engage Hollywood or film and TV in bigger ways is going to be, in the near term, probably a big part of that recipe. We also play in music. We also play in non-traditional spaces, beyond gaming, certainly.</em></p>



<p><em>I would confidently say that every one of our IPs could be some of the greatest linear media experiences that the world could experience. So more to come on the specifics. What I will say is that there are highly generative, proactive, near-term discussions across almost every one of our worlds right now, with respect to what can we do, what format works, who’s the right team to take that to new audiences in a high caliber way</em>.</p>



<p>It is indeed a bit strange that Blizzard didn't pursue transmedia opportunities more. Sure, there was the <strong>$160 million live-action Warcraft movie</strong> released in 2016 with a strong cast (Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Dominic Cooper, Clancy Brown, and Ruth Negga), but it didn't exactly earn a great critical or box office success. Beyond that, fans of the main franchises (<strong>Warcraft</strong>, <strong>Diablo</strong>, <strong>Starcraft</strong>, and <strong>Overwatch</strong>) were largely left wanting.</p>



<p>Faries is definitely correct that <strong>each of them could be a great source for adaptations</strong>. Ultimately, it all depends on the team behind the project. Historically, adaptations from game IPs haven't done that well, but that has changed dramatically in the last few years with the likes of <strong>Sonic</strong>, <strong>The Last of Us</strong>, <strong>Fallout</strong>, and <strong>Super Mario</strong>, thanks to filmmakers who understood the worlds they were adapting. Even the second and final season of the <strong>Halo</strong> TV show showed significant improvements, although the series was still ultimately canceled. Hopefully, other projects like the upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-two-seasons-shogun-director-to-direct-opening-episodes-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-hbo-series-announced-craig-mazin-creating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur's Gate 3</a></strong> series follow the same golden rule.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nacon Faces Closure After Filing For Emergency Insolvency]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nacon-faces-closure-after-filing-for-insolvency/</link>
            <guid>1445659</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nacon, a major French publisher and holdings company, has this morning revealed a dire situation. In a new press release, the company has revealed it has filed for insolvency after its parent company, Bigben, entered a period of financial difficulty.</p>



<p>In the release, it was stressed that Nacon will need to undergo a ‘rapid implementation of a financial restructuring’ to survive and has requested a judicial reorganisation review to facilitate this. Nacon’s ‘available assets’ are now substantial enough to meet its due liabilities, and it will now assess critical pathways out of this situation.</p>







<h2 id="h-nacon-could-shut-down-if-the-worst-happens">Nacon Could Shut Down If The Worst Happens</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nacon-CP-25.02.2026-English-Diffusion.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the new press release</a>, published this morning at 8 AM CET, Nacon’s representatives wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To date, the Company reports that its available assets do not allow it to meet its due liabilities. In this ucontext, the Company will, as of today, file for insolvency (“déclaration de cessation des paiements”) with the Court and request the opening of judicial reorganisation proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”). </p>



<p>The aim of this procedure is to assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the Company’s activity under the best possible conditions, protect employees, and preserve jobs, while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The company’s shares have ceased trading on the Paris market, and a court hearing has organised for early March to review the next steps for the firm.</p>



<p>Nacon was founded in 1981, dabbling in publishing, software, and peripherals over the years. It famously had a stint of distributing Sega’s Dreamcast consoles at the turn of the millennium. The company was originally known as Bigben Interactive, but it restructured in 2019, consolidating resources under the new ‘Nacon’ banner to bring together a dedicated gaming brand.</p>



<p>Bigben Group became the majority shareholder in Nacon, assuming control of more than 76% of shares.</p>



<p>This insolvency threatens a whopping 11 studios, including Spiders, Daedalic, Big Ant, Cyanide, and Kylotonn, all of which sit under the Nacon banner.</p>



<p>Cyanide is best known for the recent release of Styx: Blades of Greed. Big Ant is a studio focused almost exclusively on sports titles, Kylotonn most recently released Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, Spiders is the developer behind GreedFall, and Daedalic infamously developed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lotr-gollum-daedalic/" id="9681">The Lord of the Rings: Gollum</a> most recently.</p>



<p>The company is yet to deliver on the publishing and release of multiple games:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gear.Club Unlimited 3</li>



<li>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</li>



<li>Cthulu: The Cosmic Abyss</li>



<li>Endurance Motorsport</li>



<li>Edge of Memories</li>



<li>Dragonkin: The Banished</li>



<li>Hunting Simulator 3</li>
</ul>



<p>Nacon’s employees were notified of this news yesterday, February 24, and Nacon has promised to ‘keep the market informed as the situation and the proceedings develop.’</p>

Nacon this week alerted press to its annual showcase event, dubbed Nacon Connect, which was set for March 4. It is expected to show off the likes of Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, The Mound, Edge of Memories, and Endurance Motorsport Series. And just this morning Nacon launched the third major update for Dragonkin: The Banished, which is still in Early Access.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher just released Styx: Blades of Greed last week.

If it is successful, its existing liabilities will be frozen for a period that could last up to 18 months.

<p>Well, folks, after it was briefly teased at the end of last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> has finally arrived on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Yep, just in case you haven't picked this one up in the last decade, you now have <em>another</em> chance to do so (or an opportunity to simply pick it up again, we won't judge). The Anniversary Edition throws in all six official add-ons — Automatron, Far Harbor, Nuka-World, and the three Workshop expansions — and over 150 pieces of Creation Club content, so there's a lot to tuck into.</p>
<p>Of course, you're probably wondering how it all holds up on Switch 2. In the above video, we'll show you exactly that! The gameplay footage covers the opening section of Fallout 4, some open-world exploration, more than a dash of combat and even a cutscene or two. In short, there's a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>The good news is that it looks really rather good. Sure, the visuals are looking a little outdated today, but everything seems to be holding up nicely, performance-wise. Heck, after Bethesda's disastrous launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> on Switch 2, you can never be too careful.</p>
<p>We'll have our full review with you before long, so keep an eye out for that one. In the meantime, you can pick up Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Fallout-4-Anniversary-Edition-3016467.html">Switch eShop</a> for <strong>£52.99 / $59.99</strong>, or hang around until 28th April to get the code-in-a-box 'physical', if you want.</p>

            <p>Nacon - publishers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/robocop-rogue-city">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>, and Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown - have announced that they've filed for insolvency. The French company say they've asked for "judicial reorganisation proceedings" to kick off, with the goal of finding ways to keep the business going, "protect employees, and preserve jobs" while renegotiating with creditors.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All of this has been announced by Nacon via <a href="https://corporate.nacongaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nacon-CP-25.02.2026-English-Diffusion.pdf">press release</a> today, February 25th. "On February 20th 2026, Nacon announced that the situation of its majority shareholder, Bigben Interactive, which, following an unexpected and late refusal by its banking pool, was unable to make the partial repayment of its bond loan to its bondholders, was significantly affecting its own operations," the publishers wrote.</p>
<p>As a result, Nacon said, "rapid implementation of a financial restructuring with its creditors" is necessary to try and keep the company going. So, in filing for insolvency, Nacaon's aim it to allow themselves time to "assess all possible solutions" to make sure they can carry on operating in a manner judged to be sustainable, "protect employees", and "preserve jobs". In the meantime, the publishers will be "renegotiating with...creditors in a calm and constructive framework".</p>
<p>"This procedure will enable the Company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan," Nacon summarised, adding that organisations representing its employees - that would include unions - were informed on February 24th that these decisions had been made.</p>
<p>A court's expected to rule on Nacon's request to open judicial reorganisation proceedings in early March, and in the interim the company's share price will remain suspended.</p>
<p>In recent years, Nacon have published the likes of goblin stealther Styx: Blades of Greed, robo copper <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/robocop-rogue-city-review">RoboCop: Rogue City</a>, and critically panned racer Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown. They spent a long time publishing Solar Crown devs KT Racing's pretty good WRC rally games, and recently <a href="https://www.wrc.com/en/news/nacon-confirmed-as-wrc-games-publisher-from-2027-">re-acquired the series' license from 2027 onwards</a> after EA decided Codemasters should <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-arent-making-any-more-rally-games-but-there-are-alternatives">just stop making their own very good rally games</a>.</p><p>Earlier this week, Nacon announced <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/NACON-CONNECT-IS-BACK-ON-MARCH-4-2026">a showcase</a> set to take place on March 4th. That still looks set to go ahead and will feature updates on Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, The Mound, Edge of Memories, and Endurance Motorsport Series - potentially alongside announcements of new games.</p>
<p>Solidarity to workers at Nacon during what I'm sure are stressful times.</p>

<p>Pokémon Go offers a slew of content in the build-up to Go Tour Kalos, including some exclusive Timed Research that players must claim through code redemption.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" id="52102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a> Tour: Kalos takes place this weekend, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-tour-kalos-time-dates/" id="177591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 28 to March 1</a>, and comes off the back of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-day-presents-2026-date-time-length/" id="178159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Day on Friday</a>, where a slew of exciting news from the franchise is set to be shared.</p>



<p>If you want to make sure you don’t miss out on the Timed Research Codes in Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos, Insider Gaming has the crucial details you need.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-go-tour-kalos-timed-research-codes">All Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos Timed Research Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Debuts. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are several Timed Research Codes available to claim around Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour: Kalos, with Unown the featured Pokémon</strong> <strong>in each.</strong></p>



<p>Various Unown forms are the focus of the Timed Research during the Kalos Tour, including X &amp; Y, the games where Kalos first featured, and Z &amp; A, referencing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a-2/" id="3627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, where players returned to Lumiose City.</p>



<p>Timed Research codes, as the name suggests, are only available to complete and earn rewards for a limited time. The tasks are easy to complete, however, and you should be able to tick through them quickly while you focus your attention on all the other offerings during Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos. </p>



<p>All the Timed Research codes for Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos are shown in the table below, alongside the Pokémon they feature.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Code</th><th data-align="center">Featured Pokémon</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>6K343X373BDQM</strong></td><td data-align="center">Unown Y</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>2PKXPAT2RJXKL</strong></td><td data-align="center">Unown Z &amp; A</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-timed-research-codes-in-pokemon-go">How to Redeem Timed Research Codes in Pokémon Go</h2>



<p><strong>All Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Timed Research Codes must be redeemed on the Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go webstore, and cannot be redeemed directly within the app.</strong></p>



<p>While this isn’t ideal if you’re out and about, the redemption process is quick and easy, with rewards available in the app immediately once redeemed.</p>



<p>The precise steps to redeeming the Timed Research Codes in Pokémon Go are shown below.</p>



<ol>
<li>Head to the Pokémon Go webstore.</li>



<li>Sign in to your account.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Code Redemption’ option at the top of the page.</li>



<li>Enter the code and click ‘Apply.’</li>



<li>When successfully redeemed, a notification will appear from Pokémon Go on your device.</li>



<li>Open Pokémon Go and complete the tasks!</li>
</ol>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 25, 2026, Quordle is the #1493 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games because it requires you to guess four words at once correctly, and you can do so on the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You are shown four equal lines reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-quordle-daily-game">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 26.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

            <p>French video game publisher Nacon has filed for insolvency, after the company's majority shareholder Bigben Interactive failed to make the partial repayment of its bond loan to its bondholders. This, Nacon said, was due to "an unexpected and late refusal by its banking pool".</p>
<p>A company is insolvent when it can't pay its debts, meaning it is at risk of being closed down. Last week, the Styx: Blades of Greed publisher stated its situation "required the rapid implementation of a financial restructuring with its creditors in order to ensure the continuity of its operations". </p>
<p>This morning, Nacon subsequently announced its available assets "do not allow it to meet its due liabilities". As such, the company will now file for insolvency with the Court and "request the opening of judicial reorganisation proceedings".</p>

<p>The publisher stated its aim is to "assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the company's activity under the best possible conditions, protect employees, and preserve jobs, while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework".</p><p>Nacon said this procedure will allow the publisher to "continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan". It added the suspension of the company's share price which was first announced on 20th February will remain in effect for now.</p>
<p>In addition to the recently-released Styx: Blades of Greed, Nacon also handled publishing duties for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hell-is-us">Hell is Us</a> and RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business, to name a few. The publisher will be hosting its next Nacon Connect showcase next month, on 4th March. You can check out a little teaser for it below.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/styx-blades-of-greed-review">Jim recently awarded Styx: Blades of Greed four stars</a>, stating while it "isn't quite as well cut out as a fine piece of quartz", it is still "easily the best stealth game in years".</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Bungie has released another Marathon short cinematic trailer for one of its playable characters / shells, this time for Rook. All this only a few days prior to the game's scheduled Server Slam test.</p>
<p>Unlike prior trailers, which show off the combat prowess of the various types of shells players can use, Rook is a scavenger keen on looting scraps rather than taking on fights themselves. We see them temporarily turn NPC enemies friendly, only to be scared by one of the other shells they're looting and unloading their gun haphazardly.</p>
<p>This then turns the pacifism off from those NPCs, causing rook to run away with their ill-gotten goods. It's the classic loot goblin archetype from extraction shooters, for players keen on avoiding fights and being a bit of a vulture in-game. We even see alien vulture-like creatures throughout the trailer, hitting the point home.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this marks yet another character trailer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">ahead of the Marathon Server Slam</a>. Between the 26th February until the 2nd March. During this time, anyone interested in trying out Marathon will be able to do so for free, ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">the game's full release on the 5th March</a>.</p><p>In other Marathon news, the developers recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-outlines-marathon-networking-and-security-features">released information about the game's security features and anti-cheat initiatives</a>, stating there will be no second chances for those found cheating in Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter. The game continues to show signs of early popularity even before its released, sticking to the upper echelons of Steam's Top Sellers page prior to its debut.</p>

            <p>The live-action God of War series from Amazon and Sony has found its Baldur.</p>
<p>Ed Skrein has been cast as Baldur in the upcoming show. Skrein's previous roles include in Jurassic World Rebirth, where he played Bobby Atwater, and as supervillain Francis Freeman / Ajax in Deadpool. He also popped up in Game of Thrones' third season as Daario Naharis.</p>

<p>Fans of the games will of course know who Baldur is (yes, my butt got kicked and then some), but for those unfamiliar with the God of War antagonist, here's the show's official character description, as shared by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/ed-skrein-cast-baldur-prime-video-god-of-war-1236734596/">Deadline</a>:</p>
<p>"Baldur may be the youngest son of Odin, but he's his father's most dangerous weapon. Charismatic, unpredictable and armed with a razor-sharp tongue, Baldur lives by his own rules. As a boy, Baldur was cursed; this curse denied him the ability to feel pleasure and physical sensation. This fuels an insatiable anger and bloodlust in Baldur, who favors a brawling fighting style that blends his immense power with the raw impact of his fists.</p>
<p>"Above all else, he longs for an opponent that can truly match his prowess in battle. An opponent that can finally make him feel something." (Enter Kratos stage right.)</p>

		<p>French publisher <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nacon">Nacon</a> has filed for insolvency and suspended trading of the company’s shares, as its majority stakeholder and parent company, Bigben Interactive, is currently going through serious financial difficulties. This could make the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-_DHPUqRYw">Nacon Connect stream on 4th March</a> quite awkward…</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/bigben-interactive">Bigben Interactive</a> defaulting on a €43 million bond repayment has sent shockwaves through its subsidiary. Nacon is now looking for a way to regain its own financial liquidity, filing for insolvency with the courts and looking for a reorganisation to continue operating.</p>


<p>Separtely, <a href="https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/fb7bf5ba-1be7-4b4c-98d2-53fdfc9d28c9">Bigben is also filing to the courts</a> for an “amicable conciliation procedure” to enter into discussions with its creditors and restructure its debts.</p>
<p>This feels like a strange situation where Bigben is passing its troubles on through a bit of a shell game, though Bigben’s own stocks have taken a major tumble. We will just have to cross our fingers that things are able to be worked out, as unlikely as that feels, or Nacon’s studios and IP could end up being shut down or sold off.</p>
<p>The courts decisions are expected in the coming days of late February and early March.</p>

<p>Nacon is a merger of two Bigben brands, having previously published games under Bigben Interactive and sold gaming accessories as Nacon. It’s grown over the last decade to own around a dozen studios, from racing game specialists Kylotonn (who recently <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/nacon-regains-the-wrc-license-to-make-rally-racing-games-from-2027/">regained the WRC license</a>) to RPG studio Spiders who have a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/greedfall-the-dying-world-gets-a-march-release-date/">GreedFall</a> on the way in March, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx">Styx</a> developer Cyanide. The Nacon Connect stream taking place next week is expected to feature new game announcements and trailers for Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss, The Mound, Edge of Memories, and Endurance Motorsport Series.</p>
<p>The full statement reads:</p>
<p>In a video game sector marked by long investment cycles and significant transformations, on 20 February 2026, Nacon announced that the situation of its majority shareholder, Bigben Interactive, which, following an unexpected and late refusal by its banking pool, was unable to make the partial repayment of its bond loan to its bondholders, was significantly affecting its own operations.</p>
<p>The Company indicated on this occasion that its liquidity situation required the rapid implementation of a financial restructuring with its creditors in order to ensure the continuity of its operations, and that it was considering procedures intended to facilitate the restructuring of its debt under the supervision of the Court.</p>
<p>To date, the Company reports that its available assets do not allow it to meet its due liabilities. In this context, the Company will, as of today, file for insolvency <span><i>(“déclaration de cessation des paiements”) </i></span>with the Court and request the opening of judicial reorganisation proceedings <span><i>(“redressement </i></span><span><i>judiciaire”)</i></span>. The aim of this procedure is to assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the Company’s activity under the best possible conditions, protect employees, and preserve jobs, while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework.</p>
<p>This procedure will enable the Company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan.</p>
<p>The employee representative organisations were informed of this decision on 24 February 2026.</p>
<p>The Court, at a hearing expected in early March, will rule on this request to open judicial reorganisation proceedings <span><i>(“redressement judiciaire”</i></span>).</p>
<p>Pending this decision and given the uncertainties regarding the outcome of the proceedings, the suspension of the Company’s share price, announced on 20 February 2026, remains in effect.</p>
<p>The Company will keep the market informed as the situation and the proceedings develop.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

<li>Sorbet</li>



<li>Guava</li>

The low visibility brought about by the Hurricane makes it hard to get a good look at the lights, making it seem as though the Raider is watching two groups of drones moving quicker than normal. Watch again, and you’ll see those lights are attached to an enormous ship, gliding through the storm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The AI entity known as the Arc is capable of many things. Drones, death orbs, giant spider-like robots, and more are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to enemy types, but players haven’t seen anything quite like the UFO shown in the clip. Studying it hasn’t been easier either, as only a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdjr0s/arc_ships_soon_in_arc_raiders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>few</u></a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdtzgs/new_cloaked_arc_on_new_event/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>others</u></a> have managed to capture and share their sightings online while developer Embark Studios remains silent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It feels reminiscent of the time game developer Arrowhead Studios launched an update for Helldivers 2 that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-just-quietly-added-flying-bugs-ceo-insists-bugs-cant-fly"><u>quietly added flying bug enemies</u></a> without notifying players in its patch notes. As players spun a web of theories, that team denied that such creatures could possibly exist. Now, Embark seems to be following a similar strategy, leaving players to try and piece together what a building-sized UFO could mean for the future of Arc Raiders. Some even believe these sightings could be tied to the new large Arc <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026"><u>teased to arrive with the Riven Tides update this April</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Is that the f***ing mothership???” one player <a href="https://x.com/MartonPiller012/status/2026315685253583170?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>guessed</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No explaining the thing will be murdering people probably in April,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdgkdw/comment/o753bi6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>theorized</u></a>. “Who knows it could be the new ‘large arc threat’ they roadmapped.

In a new interview, Asha Sharma, a Microsoft executive who previously oversaw some of the firm's AI initiatives, kept things frustratingly vague, but did indicate that nothing is off the table when it comes to big decisions about recent controversial policies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Microsoft sent shockwaves throughout the video game industry when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-retiring-sarah-bond-out-matt-booty-promoted-as-microsoft-ai-exec-asha-sharma-named-new-xbox-boss-exclusive">it confirmed Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond were leaving Xbox</a>, with Sharma in place as new CEO of its gaming business. Fans are split, with some choosing to believe in the promised "return to Xbox," others expressing concern about the future of Microsoft's gaming business. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-is-being-sunsetted-seamus-blackley-one-of-the-creators-of-xbox-thinks-recent-shakeup-spells-the-end-for-microsofts-gaming-business">Even the ‘father of Xbox’ is worried about what happens next</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the big questions fans have for Sharma is whether Microsoft will reverse some of its recent policies, many of which have alienated the core Xbox fanbase. Fans have criticized Microsoft for leaving Xbox game exclusivity behind in favor of a multiplatform approach that has seen the company’s biggest brands — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-for-the-xbox-exclusive-but-in-truth-the-ps5-version-comes-as-no-surprise">including Halo</a> — make the jump to PlayStation.

About the 'why' of these decisions, what we were optimizing for, and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That's the honest answer. I'm looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan's the plan until it's not the plan."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does that mean? It’s hard to tell. It feels like a holding statement, the kind of thing you might say when you don’t want to commit to anything either way. But it’s hard to see Microsoft all of a sudden pulling out of multiplatform game releases, especially when its studios have put so much effort into making Microsoft's policy a reality, and in some cases seen great success on the likes of PlayStation. Halo is coming to PlayStation this year, and that’s unlikely to change.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/xbox-1772003073393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Microsoft's new gaming boss Asha Sharma.

<p>The Switch 2 Edition includes 4K and 120fps modes</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Inti Creates is kicking off the new year with the announcement of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/gunvolt-chronicles-luminous-avenger-ix-1plus2-dual-collection">Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX 1+2 Dual Collection</a></strong> for the Switch 2, Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>This "director's cut" will arrive on <strong>9th July 2026</strong> and comes loaded with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gunvolt_chronicles_luminous_avenger_ix">Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gunvolt_chronicles_luminous_avenger_ix_2">Gunvolt Chronicles: Luminous Avenger iX 2</a>. On top of this, it will include all of the DLC!</p>
<p>There will also be some new content in the 2D action games, including "Endless Battle" mode, where you'll take on a never-ending challenge and face off against an "onslaught" of random bosses. Inti Creates is even going to the extent of making some balance updates to upgrade the gameplay, making it sharper and more accessible than before.</p>
<p>Perhaps, most notably, the Switch 2 Edition of the game will be able to swap between a "high resolution (4K) display mode" and "high performance (120fps) mode". So you can expect a silky smooth and super sharp experience.</p>
<p>Physical releases have also been confirmed in Japan (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/02/gunvolt-chronicles-luminous-avenger-ix-12-dual-collection-announced-for-ps5-switch-2-switch-and-pc">thanks for the heads up, Gematsu</a>). There'll be a standard edition and a limited edition featuring an official art book and a four-disc complete soundtrack. If we hear any significant updates about the physical releases, we'll let you know.</p>

<h2 id="block-e2995432-719e-4ed6-8fad-a1db37670203">How To Play Strands</h2>



<p id="block-da980997-0420-4527-946e-b66c49bf3d07">Strands is a daily word search that challenges you to find words with a common theme. There’s also a Spanagram that reveals the deeper theme behind the words.</p>



<ul id="block-d0bea02d-4b9f-4991-b9db-3b35778ff3bf">
<li>Words that are three letters and under do not count.</li>



<li>Words that reveal the correct theme appear in blue.</li>



<li>The Spanagram turns yellow when found.</li>



<li>Finding three words that don’t fit the theme will reveal a hint to help you find the proper words.</li>
</ul>



<p id="block-5e597b53-af1c-4c06-a00c-6c5a4694e9e0">The goal is to string together as many words as possible. Every letter on the grid gets used! Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a popular online trend.</p>



<p id="block-cd7aaa7f-9491-4ad0-b994-72d0102c5bed">Strands can only be played on the New York Times website. You can also play on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NYT Games app.</a></p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/bandai-namco-might-have-accidentally-revealed-its-new-dragon-ball-game</link>
            <guid>1445554</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">

<p>You guessed it...</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last month, Bandai Namco announced a new Dragon Ball project titled "<strong>Age 1000</strong>" which is currently set to arrive in 2027.</p>
<p>Fans already had multiple theories about what this new project might actually be, and in an update, it seems it's arguably the most obvious one! Bandai Namco's official Southeast Asia YouTube channel recently added the Age 1000 trailer to a new playlist titled... "<strong>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 3</strong>".</p>
<p>It was spotted by many Dragon Ball fans before the same Bandai Namco YouTube account removed it. As highlighted on social media, it's even got the same artwork revealed alongside "Age 1000".</p>

<p>Of course, Bandai Namco hasn't confirmed Age 1000 is Xenoverse 3 just yet and the official game title was intended to be revealed at a later date, so it's probably best to treat this as a rumour for now until it's officially announced.</p>
<p>According to last month's announcement, this is a "brand-new" Dragon Ball world featuring "never-before seen" characters by series creator Akira Toriyama, who passed away in 2024. It's been in development for "about 6 to 7 years now including the initial concept phase" and more details will be shared at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in April.</p>
<p>Although no platforms have been announced for this new title, Bandai Namco previously released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_xenoverse_2">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a> on the Switch.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved communication stability during online play.</li>
<li>There was a problem in the Checklist where the number of events, machines, riders, etc. would not be counted correctly in applicable tasks. This has been fixed so that even if the issue has already occurred, players can restore counts to the correct number by restarting the game.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Checklist where rewards for completing all the tasks for Air Ride, Top Ride, City Trial, and Road Trip could not be obtained.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Checklist where the task “Hit 2 riders with Kaboombs in a single race” would not be considered accomplished in an online match, even if conditions were met.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where multiples of the same legendary-machine parts would sometimes appear during online matches in City Trial.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Air Ride course Cyberion Highway where riders would sometimes go off course after getting off the grind rails and be unable to return to the course.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, by performing a Quick Spin on a grind rail just before a specific rider’s Special would end, the Special would not end.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Air Ride course Crystalline Fissure where riders could go at abnormally fast speeds when jumping out of the ground of the half-pipe using the Drill Copy Ability.</li>
<li>There was a problem with Taranza where spider silk could be produced even when in a frozen state from something like a rival’s Freeze Copy Ability, so the frozen state could be quickly lifted. This issue has been fixed so that Taranza cannot produce silk when frozen.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where headwear was not reflected when riders were randomized in Local Play.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, if a player-controlled Scarfy was near when a Transform Star placed in a garage transforms, Scarfy could end up entering angry state.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Air Ride course Checker Knights where the appearance effects of the jump ramps that appear and disappear were sometimes out of alignment with their actual position.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with Transform Star where it would sometimes not accelerate if a Boost Dash was performed when a mode switch finished.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where certain Copy Abilities wouldn’t work properly after Scarfy’s angry state ended while the Copy Abilities were activated.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the thumbnails for My Machines would, in rare instances, be incorrect.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in City Trial where items would sometimes not appear when destroying crystals in the underground area with Knuckle Joe’s automatic attack.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Free Run where, after recording a Personal Best with Transform Star (star mode or bike mode), the Best Run data could not be loaded when trying to start a race in a different mode from the one in which the Personal Best was recorded in.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where online-events records could sometimes be used as a reference value for the “High Score” search condition in Spectate.
<ul>
<li>Since records that could not be produced in normal play were sometimes used as a reference value, all reference values for “High Score” have been initialized in this latest update.</li>
<li>“High Score” search results will temporarily not be displayed until players race with and on the corresponding machines/courses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the game would stop progressing if the course was randomized during a Top Ride Series in a paddock.</li>
<li>Made several other miscellaneous gameplay fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>A tiny patch addressing "several issues"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has already released an update for the Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> this year, and it has now rolled out another one. So, if you like staying on top of your game updates, consider this a PSA and get downloading!</p>
<p>This new update follows on from Version 3.1.0 (which added Polish as a supported language) and bumps the latest build of the game up to <strong>Version 3.2.0</strong>. According to Nintendo's official patch notes, this patch addresses "several issues" to "improve the gameplay experience".</p>
<p>If we find out what exactly has been adjusted behind the scenes after this latest update, we'll be sure to let you know. Based on the information provided, it's just ironing out some issues.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Donkey Kong Bananza was followed by the paid DLC <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a> in September last year. This DLC includes special in-game events, where you unlock statues to display on DK Island, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/donkey-kong-bananzas-next-dlc-in-game-event-starts-today">latest event has just wrapped</a>.</p>
<p>There's also a demo for Donkey Kong Bananza available on the eShop, so if you haven't already tried it out, this is a great way to jump in. In some other Switch 2 update news, Nintendo has released a new patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> this week.</p>

<p>Sharma's opening message to players has been all about how she wants to bring about "<em>the return of Xbox</em>," and in a new interview with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty">Windows Central</a>, she reaffirms that commitment and tries to explain more of what she means. She also drops another hint towards when we'll hear about new Xbox hardware, though it's nothing more than saying we'll learn more about the company's hardware plans "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>For me, the spirit of 'Return to Xbox'</em> <em>is about returning to the spirit that the team was founded on. It's that spirit of surprise, it's the spirit of building something nobody else was willing to try - I've heard 'renegade,' 'rebellion,' and 'fun,' used. That's what I was thinking about when I wrote that</em>," Sharma explains.</p>



<p>Sharma continued by explaining she understands that people have "<em>thousands of dollars</em>" and "<em>25 years of themselves</em>" into the Xbox platform. She adds, "<em>I want to make sure everybody knows <strong>I'm committed to Xbox, starting with the console</strong></em>," before also saying that as the world continues to evolve, Xbox will "<em>keep meeting players where they are</em>" and "<em>invest in <strong>reducing the artificial divide between different types of devices</strong>."</em> She also says she believes Xbox "<em>starts with its fans</em>."</p>



<p>She also provides some insight into the question of whether we'll start seeing Xbox have more exclusive titles, and it seems like, at least for the short term, nothing about Xbox's plan to put its games on all platforms, even if they are timed console exclusives on Xbox, will change.</p>



<p>"<em>I am committed to 'returning to Xbox,' and that starts with the console, that starts with hardware. You will hear more about that soon, we'll have some announcements coming up. You will see us collectively investing here. We also know that there <strong>are a lot of players who aren't on console or our hardware, and I want to deliver great games to them too.</strong></em> <em>I need to learn more about what that can look like, what decisions were made, what we need to do going forward, and <strong>I want a little bit of time and space to do that."</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Matt Booty</strong>, as the new chief content officer, chimed in to say that the studio's system is "<em>fully built around being first-party</em>. <em><strong>We're not built to just be a publisher</strong>,</em>" which feels like a pointed statement, considering how it has seemed like Xbox would lean into just being a publisher with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reports-a-9-overall-drop-in-xbox-revenue-for-q2-fy26-hardware-down-32/"><strong>consistent decline in hardware revenue</strong></a> recently and a heavier focus on its software and services. "<em>We're committed to being a first-party games publisher in partnership with our first-party platform team,</em>" Booty adds.</p>



<p>On the point of Xbox's struggles, Sharma concludes her comments by saying she will use her experience and the leaders around her to grow the business and "<em>make sure that we have an incredible next 25 years.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em><strong>I will listen, I will learn, I will communicate what we're seeing, and what we're doing. I think from here, the work is proof over promise</strong>. Matt and I are in it, every hour of every day of every night, I am <strong>fully in this thing</strong>. This team has brought it back before, and <strong>I'm here to help us do it again</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Ultimately, Sharma's words are nothing more than that right now. They are words from someone who has everything to prove. Her statement that "<em>the work is proof over promise</em>" going forward is probably the most genuine comment she makes in the whole interview, because that's exactly right. These are just promises yet to be fulfilled right now.</p>



<p>One thing's for sure, she's definitely doing her best to try and combat those who might agree with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-founder-thinks-new-xbox-ceo-will-sunset-division-ai-business/">Xbox founder <strong>Seamus Blackley</strong>,</a> who believes her role is that of "<em><strong>a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night</strong>.</em>"</p>



<p>We'll see where things stand once Sharma has spent some serious time in the role.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Xbox CEO On Company Strategy: “The Plan’s The Plan Until It’s Not The Plan”]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asha-sharma-xbox-future-plans-roadmap-2000673378</link>
            <guid>1445515</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In her introduction email to Xbox employees, Asha Sharma, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">new CEO of Microsoft Gaming</a> and former president of Microsoft’s CoreAI, promised a return to Xbox. This, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nothing-about-the-big-xbox-shakeup-makes-sense-2000672914">among many other things</a> about the announcement, raised some questions, with perhaps the most relevant being, “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/phil-spencer-asha-sharma-microsoft-xbox-options-whats-next/">What does that even mean?</a>”</p> <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty"><em>Windows Central</em></a> sat down with Sharma and new CCO Matt Booty to ask just that. Instead of clarifying her plans, Sharma offered vaguely positive-sounding platitudes that amounted to little of substance. “For me, the spirit of ‘Return to Xbox’ is about returning to the spirit that the team was founded on,” Sharma said. “It’s that spirit of surprise, it’s the spirit of building something nobody else was willing to try—I’ve heard ‘renegade,’ ‘rebellion,’ and ‘fun’ used. That’s what I was thinking about when I wrote that.”</p>

 <p>Sharma did, at least, acknowledge that she has a lot of work to do before making any big decisions, but it’s bizarre that Microsoft would just set her loose for interviews when she admits she still has so much to learn about Xbox. When asked about Xbox getting rid of game exclusives and whether or not that policy might be revised, she said, “Right now, I need to learn, candidly. About the ‘why’ of these decisions, what we were optimizing for, and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That’s the honest answer. I’m looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan’s the plan until it’s not the plan.”</p> <p>On the subject of AI, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087">Sharma reiterated</a> that she wouldn’t “flood [the Xbox] ecosystem with slop,” and said she stands by what she wrote in her introduction email. Booty jumped in with further clarification, adding, “We’ve got no pressure from Microsoft, there are no directives on AI coming down.”</p>

 <p>Overall, the interview is light on concrete details about Sharma’s vision for Xbox. As she said, “I think from here, the work is proof over promise.” We’ll just have to wait and see what that work actually looks like.</p>

Now, players will need the component, as well as two Arc motion cores and an explosive compound, to make just one Wolfpack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The changes fall in line with a series of new adjustments to resource requirements, which see Arc components also added to the recipes for the Deadline mine, Trailblazer, Showstopper, and Vita Spray. It’s the Wolfpack tweak that has Raiders up in arms, though, mostly because Rocketeer Drivers are infamously rare and hard to collect. The most consistent way to find one of these epic items is to kill a Rocketeer – a task that currently takes two Wolfpacks to accomplish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rditsw/hot_take_wolfpacks_were_too_easy_to_craft_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some believe the change is understandable considering the previous recipe asked relatively little from players</a>, much of the community online has already started voicing their concerns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Let me just kill a rocketeer to get 1 wolfpack that can half kill another rocketeer,” one Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdd2f7/comment/o746rwv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teased</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t even want the blueprint anymore,” another player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74jteq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First time I’ve said this but if they keep going in this direction people will stop playing,” a X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/gmanskiyoutube/status/2026377384056725559?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. “It’s hard enough to gather some of these resources.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Doesn’t quite add up <a href="https://t.co/1KLOMIWnQe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1KLOMIWnQe</a></p>— ARC Central (@TheARCcentral) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheARCcentral/status/2026389327081578664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 24, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The grenade can’t lock on to other players but can tear through hordes of small Arc, making it one of the best PvE tools Raiders have at their disposal. It can also quickly dismantle the armor featured on large Arc, such as the Matriarch, Queen, Leaper, and Bastion, but it’s the math asking players for two Wolfpacks to kill one Rocketeer that has fans questioning Embark's judgement. While showing concern about how update 1.17.0 asks players to work harder for crafting materials, some have started chiming in with their own recommendations for how to fix the issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If rocketeers start consistently dropping more than 1x driver, we can talk,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74eo6f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They need to up the drop odds on drivers,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74ffry/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. “Right now you’re lucky if you get two.

      <p><a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-phil-spencer-retires/"><u>The big news of leadership changes at Xbox last week</u></a> understandably has everyone searching for answers, an explanation as to why so many key decisions were made all at once, seemingly out of nowhere. In our rush for that clarity, though, it's important to remember that just because we <em>want </em>to know the whole truth behind something as quickly as possible, doesn't mean we <em>can</em>.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-phil-spencer-retires/"><div><p>So Long, Phil Spencer. You Will Not Be Missed</p><p>Spencer, retiring from Xbox next week, played a lot of games and oversaw the layoffs of even more people</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure><p>Which brings me to<a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>The Verge's piece from earlier this week, by Tom Warren, headlined "Inside Microsoft’s big Xbox leadership shake-up"</u></a>. That's a headline suggesting it's going to provide the exact answers everyone has been looking for: why is Phil Spencer retiring now, what's gone wrong inside Xbox over the last few years, why did his apparent successor Sarah Bond leave the company entirely, and why the hell did Microsoft appoint<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeffgerstmann.com/post/3mfdtqu5wjk2x?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a natalist AI-loving weirdo</u></a> as the head of their video games division?</p><figure><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Inside Microsoft’s big Xbox leadership shake-up</p><p>Microsoft has a new gaming CEO</p><p><span>The Verge</span><span>Tom Warren</span></p></div></a></figure><p>Instead we get a story that spends its first half taking shots at the departed Bond, as "more than a dozen current and former Microsoft employees" line up to criticise her efforts at the company, particularly her role in the disastrous "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>This Is An Xbox</u></a>" marketing campaign. It then spends its back end airing internal misgivings about Asha Sharma, which is hardly unique since <em>everyone </em>has misgivings about her.</p><p>Microsoft is an enormous company. Xbox itself is a huge division, and loads of people are and have been responsible for everything that happens there, from the boss on down. When you consider that Xbox has been in terminal decline since the moment the Xbox One was revealed over 15 years ago, a sequence of interwoven events and trends that are the result of countless people's missteps and ineptitude, it sure seems weird to dedicate so much time in the story to the legacy of a single Black woman.</p><p>Unless, of course, you recognise the story for what it is: a chance to vent about Bond, orchestrated not by Warren (who is simply serving as the messenger here), but by every source inside Xbox who was so willing to speak to The Verge so soon after the events of last week. Gamers may not be entirely familiar with this kind of story, but if you're a sports fan, you'll know them all too well.</p><p>Here's a recent example of what I'm talking about: last year<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/12/tottenham-confirm-appointment-thomas-frank-new-manager?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Tottenham announced the signing of former Brentford boss Thomas Frank to be the club's new manager</u></a>, and they couldn't speak highly enough of him. Even as Spurs struggled through 2025 and into 2026, sliding ever closer to the relegation zone,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6891062/2025/12/15/thomas-frank-tottenham-future-lewis/?source=bsky_uk"> <u>club leadership publicly supported him</u></a>. Then, when results became untenable and the board finally decided it was time to sack him, well. Suddenly a deluge of stories hit the major sports papers, all purporting to explain just why Frank had been so terrible and why getting rid of him was such a great move, like<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1r1vgjo/one_source_told_telegraph_sport_on_thomas_frank/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>this pathetic expose in The Telegraph</u></a>, claiming Frank's "bizarre obsession" with rivals Arsenal "sealed his fate".</p><p>Spurs are a club that, one hilarious trophy win last season aside, have been on the slide for years now. Ownership has been useless, the board even more so. Their transfer dealings have been poor, meaning no matter how many players they sign or how many managers they go through, they've found themselves having slipped from regular Champions League contenders just a few years ago to<a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/13511026/tottenham-relegation-from-premier-league-a-real-possibility-after-north-london-derby-thrashing-by-arsenal?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>facing the serious threat of relegation from the Premier League</u></a>. The problems at Spurs run far deeper, and have been going on much longer, than the tenure of Thomas Frank.</p><p>Yet the second he was out the door, along came those stories, each claiming to have the inside scoop, to satisfy everyone's desire for scapegoats and answers, when all they were really doing was providing a chance for disgruntled insiders to air some dirty laundry, and for a failing institution to take advantage of the media to lay some blame at the feet of someone who was already out the door, instead of at their own.</p><p>I've little doubt there was frustration inside Xbox at Bond's tenure, and I've <em>no </em>doubt that folks are concerned about the new boss. But for the sources in the story to be so focused on Bond while sparing Spencer or anyone else tells you more about what's been happening behind the scenes at Xbox than the contents of the piece ever could.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tom Rothman, CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group, told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RIBjgm-DdY"><em>The Town with Matt Belloni</em></a> that Sony’s Spider-Man Universe isn’t dead, but it is, as Belloni put it, getting a “fresh reboot” with “new people.” This comes after the box-office and critical bombs of <em>Morbius</em>, <em>Madame Web</em>, and <em>Kraven the Hunter </em>over the last three years.</p> <p>The backlash to <em>Morbius</em> and <em>Madame Web</em> alone was enough for <a href="https://kotaku.com/kraven-the-hunter-spiderman-jc-chandor-1851707831"><em>Kraven the Hunter</em> director J.C. Chandor to plead before the film’s release</a>, “People have got to give us a chance and come out and support this film, and literally try to wash away some of the other stuff that’s happened. Give our film a chance.” But <em>Kraven</em> turned out to be just as bad as the others. Even the most successful films of the bunch, <em>Venom</em>, <em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/venom-last-dance-knull-explained-spider-man-marvel-1851647953"><em>Venom: The Last Dance</em></a>, have been embraced more for their unintentional camp than their actual quality.</p>

 <p>The reboot strategy is one that Sony has tried before with their Marvel characters, and it didn’t go particularly well last time. After producing three well-regarded Spider-Man movies directed by Sam Raimi between 2002 and 2007, the studio brought Marc Webb on to helm a reboot series in 2012. Only two out of the planned three movies were ever made. After that, Sony collaborated with Disney to bring Spider-Man into the massively successful Marvel Cinematic Universe, even though Sony owns the film rights to the character. It was, as Belloni said in the interview, “kind of a tail-between-the-legs moment to have to go to Disney and say, ‘Listen, we kind of ran this into the ground, we need you to bring this back.'”</p> <p>Rothman disputed Belloni’s accounting of how the Disney deal went down, arguing that the MCU crossover has been hugely successful for Sony, but it’s hard to ignore the evidence that Sony has struggled to figure out how to make a good comic book movie on its own. Rothman didn’t share any other details about what a rebooted SSU might look like.</p>
