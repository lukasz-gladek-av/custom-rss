			<p>Vendetta Forever is a VR shooter that immediately draws comparisons that land it somewhere between <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/07/19/superhot-vr-review/">Superhot VR</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/rhythm-action-game-pistol-whip-will-be-released-on-psvr-this-summer/">Pistol Whip</a>. It’s got the fast shooting and score hunting of the latter mixed with intense, almost bullet hell slo-mo of the former. But there is, of course, much more to it than that oversimplified description.</p>
<p><iframe title="VENDETTA FOREVER Countdown Trailer | nDreams | Meta Quest &amp; PS VR2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xcPuxt1ilMc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Shoot to kill, and kill to move. That’s the real ethos running through Vendetta Forever. You don’t move freely around the environments in Vendetta Forever, but instead have to action movie you way through. Shoot someone and you can grab their gun, quickly moving you to their position to shoot whomever is next. You’ll feel like John Wick as you make your way down a train carriage, grabbing guns and knives out of the air to keep moving, staying of the way of incoming fire as you go, spinning around and shooting at surrounding enemies. It’s the closest to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U02E2sjwlLM">Gun Kata</a> you can get in a game.</p>


<p>Meatspace Interactive have taken that core concept and had as much fun as possible with it. In one level you’re falling down the centre of a spiral staircase, spinning in the air as you shoot enemies that are on the stairs. In another, there’s a duel – as in, turn on three and shoot – whilst another is basically the lobby scene from The Matrix. There are western themed levels with cowboys shooting at you from balconies as you blast your way through a town, or a race against a fuse as you try to put it out and save some hostages. There’s something for every persuasion here, provided it involves shooting people in increasingly stylish ways. It’s great.</p>


<p>You aren’t limited to just pistols and throwing knives. There’s uzis, miniguns, sniper rifles, even a rocket launcher showing up depending the level. Then there’s a katana which is perhaps the only way to move without grabbing a gun, as it lets you dash at enemies and slice them up. Not to mention the daft way that you have to either pluck throwing knives and shurikens out of the air as enemies throw them at you, but if you don’t quite manage to catch or dodge them, you can always pluck them out of your face and throw them back in a display of vengeance that is truly incredible both in its absurdity and sheer satisfaction.</p>
<p>This isn’t an easy game and there are quite a few things to think about while playing. There’s enemies literally all around you, making both quick real life movement as well as snap-to-turn with the analogue stick essential – I typically use smooth turning in VR, but snapping is just so much quicker. You’ll also need to play standing up and the game requires roomscale for your play area.</p>

<p>Within the game, you’ll want to be quick about grabbing guns when you shoot baddies, as they despawn sometimes when left alone – though curiously not all the time, so I’m not certain how intentional this is – and if there’s no gun to grab you simply can’t move. It’s kind of a puzzle shooter in the same way Superhot was, but here you need to pick a route and order in which to shoot enemies, then use that route quickly or lose it. It’s made much harder by all the bullet dodging and shooting you’re actually doing, of course.</p>
<p>I’m in two minds about the movement system, as when you’re moving through a level smoothly it’s very satisfying, but having nowhere left to go ruins the flow state the game tries to get you into. It’s not the end of the world, especially as you can cycle back through positions you’ve already been in on an attempt and, if you’re lucky, you’ll spot a gun or an enemy you’ve missed.</p>
<p>The game’s visuals are kept nice and simple – not quite as minimalist as Superhot and Pistol Whip, but still with a toned down aesthetic. That’s for the best considering how quickly you’ll need to recognise enemies in order to shoot them before they do the same to you. It has it charm though, with the stripped down aesthetic still more than capable of communicating when you’re in a western or The Matrix, whilst still ensuring you can spot everything you need to easily enough.</p>

<p>I have to mention my favourite levels, both of which are what I have decided to called “Daredevil levels.” In these, it’s pitch black except for when there’s sound. You begin in darkness and can see the footsteps of an enemy nearby as a circle radiating outwards from its source, but when you shoot enemies know where you are. Of course, you can grab an enemy’s weapon, zip to their position and all the living enemies will lose track of you until you make some noise, but because they just fired at your last position, you can see their locations for a few seconds. Stand still for a moment and everything goes pitch black again, but you can throw a gun to make a noise as it clatters against a wall so enemies fire at it, giving their positions away. This is one of the most unique shooter and VR experiences I’ve had and it is thrilling. It’s phenomenally cool and I would play a full game of it without hesitation.</p>
<p>On top of all this there is a selection of mutators to modify the game, whether you want it to be more forgiving by enabling what’s effectively an invincible mode to take the pressure off and enjoy the over the top nature of the game, or whether you want to turn off aim assist, which makes the game unbelievably difficult to handle, naturally. If you’re a real glutton for punishment, there are higher difficulty levels for you test your skills on as well.</p>
<p>Once you’ve finished the levels – and there’s quite a few, even if each one is quite short once you’ve perfected your run – you can always go back and compete on the online leaderboards to extract some more longevity. Just in case you get tired of just playing the lobby scene from The Matrix in VR over and over and over…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-cursed-expedition-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Expedition, and if you felt like last month's update was a little too sedate for your tastes, then this one is definitely for you.</p>
<p>Back in September, Hello Games launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-aquarius-update">the Aquarius update</a>, which introduced a chilled-out fishing mechanic to the sandbox space sim. Now, though, the studio says its latest update "couldn't be more different" to Aquarius, and that The Cursed is "embracing the spookier side of the&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>universe".</p>
<p>For the titular The Cursed Expedition, you'll be journeying to a mysterious twilight realm in which you won't be able to access your hyperdrive, meaning you'll have to rely on an "ancient portal network" in order to get around.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-mans-sky-the-cursed-expedition-portal-network.jpg?itok=4H-QmJ-T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-mans-sky-the-cursed-expedition-portal-network.jpg?itok=P7mwYWBj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Expedition will take away your hyperdrive capabilities.</figcaption></figure><p>While you'd normally be battling against the likes of temperature, atmospheric toxicity, and other hazards in&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>, the new The Cursed Expedition will instead have you grappling with "the weakening of the boundaries of reality".</p>
<p>Your suit will be equipped with an Anomaly Suppressor, which you'll have to maintain if you want to make it through the Expedition unharmed. As your Suppressor weakens, Anomalies will start to gather and become hostile, and "time will begin to behave in non-linear ways".</p>
<p>In order to get through the Expedition, you'll have access to a variety of new Elixirs to help you sustain boundary strength and discover portals, and if you do manage to make it through, a variety of rewards await you.</p>
<p>These rewards include new decorative posters, new customization options, and even a brand new starship, as well as an adorable (well, I think it's adorable) "gelatinous and luminescent" companion creature.</p>

<p>There's lots of other stuff to look forward to in this new Expedition. You can check out the full patch notes for The Cursed <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/10/expedition-sixteen-the-cursed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>
<p><em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/no-mans-sky/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

<p>Video game hardware sales <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/us-video-game-hardware-sales-fell-drastically-in-august-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continue to fall</a> in the United States, and not by just a little. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l76mgp4syn2z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Circana</a> released the latest US data on Wednesday, and it shows yet another month of falling sales numbers.</p>



<p>Hardware spending fell from $445 million to $251 million, or 44%, year-over-year. The fall represents the lowest amount spent on hardware sales in September since 2019 where revenue was $242 million.</p>







<p>The drop in sales was felt across the board as sales of the Xbox Series systems fell 54% year-over-year followed by a 45% drop in PlayStation 5 sales. The Nintendo Switch, which is set to be replaced within the next year, saw a 23% year-over-year decline. </p>



<p>In total, year-to-date hardware sales are down 30% compared to last year. It’s worth mentioning, however, that sales have still brought in $2.5 billion in 2024.</p>



<p>Moving on to accessories, there was actually a 1% increase from September 2023. Accessory sales rose to $217 million for the month thanks to the sales of the PlayStation Portal, which remains the best-selling accessory in dollar sales for the year. It’s owned by 3% of PlayStation 5 owners.</p>



<p>What do you think of the video game hardware sales continuing to fall in the US? Let us know down below, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>The United States video game sales data for September 2024 has been released, and there’s a new name at the top of the list of the best-selling games for the month. According to new data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l76mf4ygfc2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, EA Sports FC 25 was the best-selling game in the US for September. </p>



<p>The PlayStation 5-exclusive Astro Bot finished second. </p>



<p>It’s the third-straight month an EA Sports title was the best-selling game after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-25-was-the-best-selling-game-in-us-for-august-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 25 topped August’s sales</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-tops-july-2024-and-year-to-date-best-selling-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">College Football 25 led the way</a> in July.</p>



<p>As far as other new games on the list, seven games made their debut in the top 20. Those games include Astro Bot, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, NBA 2K25, NHL 25, Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.</p>



<p>Four other games returned to the top 20 after being off the list, including Dead Rising, Final Fantasy 16, God of War: Ragnarök, and Age of Mythology. There were 11 games from August that fell off. Helldivers 2, Mario Kart 8, MLB: The Show 24, and Gran Turismo 7 are just a few of the games that find themselves outside the top 20 for the month.</p>

Instead, interstellar travel can only take place via the ancient portal network.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Haunting voices, leaking through from another dimension, will provide guidance, information, strange blueprints… and mystery. It is up to you to decide who these voices belong to, where they are coming from, and if they are to be trusted.</p><p>In regular <em>No Man’s Sky</em> play, Travellers must steel themselves against a variety of environmental hazards such as extreme temperatures, radioactivity, and toxic atmospheres. The Cursed, however, pits you against a single, more insidious threat: the weakening of the boundaries of reality. Your exosuit comes fitted with a specialised Anomaly Suppressor; maintain it to stay firmly in this reality.</p><p>Spectral anomalies—ghostly creatures drifting across the boundaries—will gather to watch Travellers moving through their domain. Most of the time, they are simply there to observe, but be warned: as your suit’s Anomaly Suppressor weakens, time will begin to behave in non-linear ways, and these anomalies may turn hostile.</p><p>Travellers will need to prepare a number of otherworldly concoctions to navigate through The Cursed. Sustain boundary strength with the Elixir of Glass, reveal the location of portals with the Elixir of Quicksilver, and prise open the gateways with the Elixir of Blood. For those that reach the end of the journey, its final trial will require a drink from the Elixir of Water—and the consequences thereafter.</p><p>The Cursed expedition begins today, and will run for approximately two weeks. Travel beyond the boundaries, and fortify your mind against spectral anomalies—or succumb to the call of the world of glass.</p><p><strong>■ The Cursed Expedition Rewards</strong></p><p><strong><a title="Games > Boundary [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/boundary">Boundary</a> Anomaly, Portal Breach and Glyph Posters</strong></p><p>Remember your journey across the boundaries with these decorative posters: warnings to all those who would venture into the tunnels of the portal network.</p><p><strong>Anomaly Seal Base Part</strong></p><p>During The Cursed, the spectral energy radiating from this ancient artifact protects nearby entities against catastrophic reality breaches.</p><p>In a more stable universe, the Anomaly Seal serves as a decorative souvenir from beyond the boundaries.</p><p><strong>Ink-Stained Jetpack Trail</strong></p><p>An exclusive jetpack customisation.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> team has released an appropriately-timed spooky update for its life-simulation game, which focuses on the afterlife, and allows us to once again get down and dirty with the Grim Reaper.</p>
<p>This base game update is available across platforms, and also lets you create ghost characters (from child upwards) in the Create A Sim menu. Here, you can choose how your Sim died, with different deaths giving "unique abilities" to ghosts.</p>
<p>These spectral Sims will have a new set of needs, different to those of live Sims. These needs include: Goo Waste, Ethereal Sustenance, Otherworldly Slumber, Spooky Diversions, Ethereal Bonding, and Apparition Cleansing. If a Sim should die during gameplay, you will have the option to keep the Sim as a playable character, or make them a "freeroaming" ghost instead.</p>

<p>Sticking with the death theme, Sims now also have unique reactions to another Sim's passing. This includes plenty of tears if the deceased Sim was someone near and dear, or just straight up retching if the relationship isn't strong.</p>
<p>And, if a Sim does pass and the game's ever reliable Grim Reaper shows up, you can now WooHoo with the soul collector again.</p>
<p>Full details on this The Sims 4 update - which also includes a new Merfolk Urn and Tombstone for those players with the Island Living expansion, as well as a number of bug fixes and more - <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-10-22-2024">can be found via EA</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this month,  EA lifted the lid on its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-4-gets-embalming-grim-reaping-reincarnation-and-naked-moon-rituals-in-new-life-death-expansion">Sims 4's Life &amp; Death expansion</a>, which is set to arrive on 31st October. This upcoming expansion will add everything from new neighbourhoods where the boundaries between the living and the dead are especially thin, to a new grim reaper career and the ability for ghosts to WooHoo in objects small and large.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Following reports yesterday, Ubisoft has confirmed that the team behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> has been disbanded, with its employees at Ubisoft Montpellier being moved along to other projects. This will be hugely disappointing news to fans of the Metroidvania twist on Prince of Persia.</p>
<p>The news came yesterday from French reporter Gautoz in their show on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HgkIyq0emY">Origami YouTube channel</a>, with Ubisoft reportedly making the decision to allow for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-mask-of-darkness-is-a-near-essential-dlc/">DLC</a> and cosmetics roadmap to be released for the game, but end support there and not greenlight a sequel or any further expansions. The decision went so far as to say this was so as not to “cannibalize” long term sales of the game.</p>


<p>While the specifics of the reporting haven’t been confirmed by Ubisoft, the general gist has been. Abdelhak Elguess, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown senior producer said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-development-team-disbanded">a statement to Eurogamer</a>:</p>
<p>“I’m extremely proud of our team’s work and passion at Ubisoft Montpellier to create a game that resonated with players and critics alike, and I am confident in its long-term success.</p>
<p>“Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is now at the end of its Post-Launch roadmap with three free content updates and one DLC that released in September. We are now focusing on making the game available to more players: it was recently launched on Steam, and will be available on Mac by this winter.</p>

<p>“Most of the team members who worked on Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown have shifted to other projects that will benefit from their expertise.</p>
<p>“We know players have a love for this brand and Ubisoft is excited to bring more Prince of Persia experiences in the future.”</p>
<p>Sadly, it seems that it simply didn’t sell well enough for Ubisoft’s liking – roughly 1 million copies, per Insider Gaming – when Ubisoft is looking to really maximise sales amid a string of disappointment bigger budget titles. Perhaps part of the problem was having a higher price point when compared to indie metroidvania standouts – The Lost Crown was $50 – and not releasing on Steam would have hurt PC sales as well.</p>
<p>Ubisoft Montpellier is the lead studio on Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, which has been in development for what feels like forever. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/">Insider Gaming reports</a> that the team has been spread across BG&amp;E2, Project Ovr, which is the next Ghost Recon game, and Project Steambot, a&nbsp;Rayman remake in development with Ubisoft Milan.</p>
<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown launched in January and was an early highlight of the year. “Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is one of the finest metroidvanias I’ve ever played,”<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/11/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review/"> Ade wrote in our review</a>, “and a fantastic way to start 2024. Thrilling and kinetic platforming, thumping combat, and a vast game world that demands exploration, and makes it a joy to do. It’s time to kick nostalgia firmly in the unmentionables; this is the best Prince of Persia ever.”</p>

			<p>Today, Hello Games has announced and released a new update for its ever-evolving open galaxy game No Man's Sky. This update is titled The Cursed and is obviously meant to be a creepy one, much like many of the Halloween events that are being launched across live games this week.</p>
<p>According to Hello Games, The Cursed is a new Expedition in which players struggle to keep a grip on reality while being haunted by visions and voices from another dimension. It is set in a twilight universe straddling the line between realities. Here, time can shift unexpectedly as day turns to night at an unnatural pace.</p>
<p>Players will employ the new Boundary StarShip while traveling this haunted universe. This StarShip is a flying saucer, the first available in No Man's Sky, and the team described it as a 'Giger-esque coil of tubes, pipes, and engines.'</p>
<p>In The Cursed, players must protect themselves from the eroding boundaries of reality. The player exosuit's regular hazard protection has been replaced for the occasion with a special Anomaly Suppressor, the key to survival as the universe collapses around you.</p>
<p>As players explore these haunted worlds, they may encounter ghostly beings that drift across the boundaries. Sometimes, these spectral anomalies will be merely observant; on other occasions, they can become much more hostile. These encounters will introduce players to new, challenging enemies and boss battles on an unprecedented scale in No Man's Sky.</p>

<p>While playing The Cursed Expedition, travelers won't have access to hyperdrive technology, meaning no warping between star systems. Instead, interstellar travel requires careful planning and the use of an ancient portal network. Moreover, from another dimension, players will hear haunting voices offering guidance, information, strange blueprints, and secrets. Players must reflect on who these voices belong to, where they come from, and whether they can be trusted. Completing The Cursed will provide players exclusive spooky rewards, including exosuit customization inspired by Cthulhu-esque, bioluminescent pets, and the UFO-like Boundary Herald starship. This No Man's Sky Expedition begins today and lasts approximately three weeks.</p>

<p>Hello Games also said in the press release that the previous update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-aquarius-update-finally-adds-fishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aquarius</a>, which introduced fishing to the game, was yet another success. Overall, 2024 is shaping up to be one of the biggest years for No Man's Sky in terms of popularity, and the British studio has promised 'several more surprises' in the remaining weeks before the end of the year, including the PS5 Pro enhancement patch available at launch on November 7.</p>

					<p>In most RPG mythology, the legendary heroes are folks to be revered and their stories tell of hope and a positive future. However, in Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven, those same Seven Heroes hare instead left behind a legacy of revenge and vile fiends roaming the land. It’s a narrative that brings some contemporary charm to an otherwise all-too-familiar mythology and this full 3D remake presents this groundbreaking JRPG in a whole new light.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Romancing-SaGa-2-Revenge.png"></a></figure>

<p>Following the passing of a family member at the hands of one of these legendary Seven Heroes, the Emperor (or Empress) of Avalon vows revenge against these heroes and to cleanse the world of their influence. From humble beginnings of a small empire nestled away in the northwest corner of the world, the player will see Varennes grow into a global superpower by ridding the world of these Seven Heroes one by one and bringing countries rid of their troubles under one united flag.</p>
<p>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven promises an open-ended adventure and has some interesting ways to make good on that promise, while the limitations of the original Super Famicom release are still present in how the narrative is shaped. Guided by little more than a rumor or piece of advice from your chancellor at the start of each generation, players can venture out into the world however they see fit once news of some sort of goings-on is brought to the player’s attention. Players only need to journey through dungeons and open fields once to reach a new city before it’s added to the list of fast travel options. All of these paths tend to converge at the same end, so regardless of which order the world is liberated and which of the Seven Heroes are dispatched, there’s a very similar design to how these paths intersect.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Romancing-SaGa-2-Combat.png"></a></figure>

<p>While not completely possible to see everything in a single playthrough, players can still complete a good 90-95% of the available quests in Revenge of the Seven during a single run if they so choose. I had somehow neglected to check up on an active volcano in an earlier generation and went back a generation or two later to see how things were going, only to discover another natural disaster awaiting a nearby village. Had I gone sooner, I would have been granted the opportunity to learn about Dark Magic if I followed a very specific story path. Alas, the island itself was saved and this critical quest was locked away for the remainder of the playthrough.</p>
<p>Note for note, bar for bar, Revenge of the Seven is largely a familiar retelling of this experimental JRPG throughout in spite of the overhaul that’s been done to the game’s mechanics. Familiar story beats follow the same narrative journey as players solve the issues plaguing the world left in the wake of the Seven Heroes taking their own form of revenge and unleashing hordes of demons unto the world. Pick up any strategy guide penned for the PlayStation 4/Vita pixel remake from 2016 and you’ll be able to at least follow the story along even if all of the treasure chests and maps have been overhauled for this full 3D remake.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Romancing-SaGa-2-Final-Emperor.png"></a></figure>

<p>Despite the non-linear nature promised in Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven, there’s a sort of guarantee to the flow of progression. Finding new places to explore or quests to undertake often takes little more than chatting up the bartender at a local tavern or speaking with the common people around each town. There isn’t much mystery as to where to get a new quest as eligible NPCs all have the same telltale question mark icon to indicate they have something to offer. Most every other NPC can be readily ignored unless the player wishes to get a little more flavor text to the world and the troubles ailing them.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes of Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is an invisible timer that counts down the end of one generation and the beginning of the next. It’s not the number of hours or minor quests completed that leads to the passage of time but rather world-shaping events and defeating any one of the Seven Heroes. Typically, three major quests are the sweet spot to undertake as the current Emperor before the throne must be abdicated, 150 or so years pass by, and a new Emperor is selected to ascend to the throne of Avalon. This same formal transfer of power also proceeds if the entire party is wiped out, rather than forcing the player into a Game Over scenario.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Romancing-SaGa-2-Scattered-Petals.png"></a></figure>

<p>In this transfer of responsibilities, players are given a pool of six or so heroes that can assume the title of Emperor and lead the expansion of Varennes. These options are pulled from any available quest that’s been unlocked with a few notable selections. For example, the marionette puppet Coppelia can only be selected for a single generation before she is passively discarded (if you do happen to come across her, a hidden rendition of Wipe Your Tears plays and you’re rewarded with her signature ability, Poker Face, which renders whoever is equipped with the ability complete immunity to status effects). Because of the random nature, there’s no guarantee that you’ll receive an option that comes with the weapon skills you’ve previously been leveling or even the right class to complete a particular quest. No matter how much I tried, I couldn’t get the Corsair as an available option, thus leaving one specific quest incomplete as I was unable to have the maritime experience necessary for traversing the open seas.</p>
<p>Combat in Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is perhaps its most notable and welcomed change from the original releases. Kawazu and his team have updated the battle system to be more in line with recent SaGa titles such as Minstrel Song and SaGa: Emerald Beyond. Fights take place on a shared timeline where individual Speed stats determine the turn order rather than moving as one complete unit and the timeline can provide insight as to when an enemy’s turn may be coming up or if they’re preparing a brutal attack. Save for a few key weapon skills or formations, there’s little that can be done with manipulating the timeline outside of buffing/reducing a character’s Speed stat. Magicks require no casting times, so they can be issued the same as regular attacks and Techs. Striking an enemy’s weakness fills a separate Overdrive gauge that serves as this SaGa entry’s form of a combo system. Once filled, heroes can tag the next party member in line to do a combined pair of Tech/Spell attacks pulled from a random list.</p>
<p>There’s some rhyme and reason to how these combinations are pulled out, typically with how weapon types or elements are used in tandem. It wasn’t uncommon for my Martial Artist-specialized Emperor to tag in the next party member to do a matching attack. For most of the adventure, players will be limited to just two players being linked together, but by way of finding the hidden Mr. S collectibles and adding more regions under the Empire’s banner, players can link together more party members and even gain a second Overdrive Gauge (which carries over between battles, so it can be beneficial to grind just a little bit before tackling a dungeon boss). Precious BP used to cast Tech and Spells alike is typically only recharged through one-time use checkpoints before boss encounters or by resting at an inn, although there are rare BP-restoring items that can be purchased or found in treasure chests. Romancing SaGa 2 isn’t like Persona or Metaphor where there’s a strict calendar dictating your movements, so returning to town to restock is often a viable option.</p>
<p>True to previous SaGa titles, Revenge of the Seven is not a JRPG where grinding is intended. While it is more lenient than its successors, there is still a persistent Battle Rank that ticks up as players progress the narrative and undergo a certain number of battles. This Battle Rank will affect the enemies that players come across, so while grinding in one spot might sound like a good idea initially to learn a few new Tech or raise a weapon’s skill, grinding too much can have the adverse effect of introducing enemies that are too challenging to defeat given the player’s current equipment and skills.</p>
<figure>
<div>

</figure>


<p>There’s no true leveling system in Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven and this holds true for either SaGa titles as well. In lieu of a stated character level, winning a battle will typically raise one of three stats for a character: their HP, their BP, and whatever Weapon/Spells they used (or if they didn’t have a chance to act, whatever they used in the last fight). Any other stat, such as Defense or one of the five core attributes, is instead increased through equipped gear. Using a particular Weapon or Spell Skill will not only raise the amount of damage done but also unlock the opportunity to have a sudden spark of inspiration, or ‘Glimmer”, and discover a brand new attack on the battlefield. Each Weapon type comes with its own unique list of Tech attacks to learn, most branching from one skill or another once the right conditions are met (typically the character’s Weapon Skill in combination with the enemy’s strength).</p>
<p>Glimmering one of these Techs not only adds it to that character’s list of skills but also can be passed along to future generations through the Empire’s Training Hall. All of that passive knowledge in the form of Weapon Skills and Techs is recorded in the imperial records, so that as time passes and a new generation begins, the cumulative knowledge is carried forth and the next generation might have the power needed to defeat one of the Seven Heroes. By the time I inherited the title of Final Emperor and was ready to finish the adventure, I had just under 1,000 HP, a Martial Arts skill around level 60, and could easily hit for 15-20,000 from a single GuanYin and much more if it was a critical hit or used in an Overdrive combo.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2455640/Romancing_SaGa_2_Revenge_of_the_Seven/">Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven</a> features the same narrative and core gameplay under the hood, this 3D remake turns the influential JRPG into a brand new experience. For players who rightfully enjoyed Kawazu’s non-linear storytelling in prior SaGa titles, Revenge of the Seven is a must-play. Just make sure to dust off one of those old Super Famicom strategy guides if you plan to see all of the tourism and fiends that Avalon has to offer.</p>

<p>One of Akitoshi Kawazu's most experimental titles from the Super Famicom, Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven shows that a classic JRPG can be given a complete overhaul to turn into something brand new while still retaining its unique quirks and charm.</p>

<p><em>The Sims 4</em>'s latest expansion&nbsp;<em>Life and Death&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-sims-4-expansion-pack-life-and-death-revealed">set to launch on Halloween</a> (because of course it is), and a free update has been released ahead of that launch to prepare&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>for a spooky time.</p>
<p>First up, Sims can now react to other Sims' deaths "based on traits and relationships", so you might see your Sim weeping for the death of a loved one, for instance, or even "retching at a stranger's death". Charming.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sims-4-update-life-and-death-reaper.jpg?itok=y3rS8kZ6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sims-4-update-life-and-death-reaper.jpg?itok=ZMGhrxPD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>update is here, and it's all about death, ghosts, and other spooky things.</figcaption></figure><p>You can now create Ghost Sims during the Create a Sim process, and once a Sim has passed on, they'll become a Ghost Sim with a new set of needs including the likes of "Goo Waste", "Spooky Diversions", and "Apparition Cleansing".</p>
<p>If a Sim that's married to another Sim dies, they'll be widowed, but the Sims can ask to stay married in order to reinstate their marriage status if you wish them to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, per the patch notes, "Sims can WooHoo with the Grim Reaper again", so all you freaky&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>players who've been wanting to show Death how you really feel, this one's for you.</p>
<p>Tons of other changes have been made as part of this update, so you can read <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-10-22-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the full patch notes here</a> if you want to know everything that's changed.</p>

<p>This update comes not long after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5">an announcement</a> regarding the&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>franchise's future back in September, wherein EA revealed that it had no plans for&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5&nbsp;</em>anytime soon.</p>
<p>Instead,&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>will continue to be supported and updated with regular patches like this one, as well as expansions like&nbsp;<em>Life and Death&nbsp;</em>and new Creator Kits made by community figures.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222670/The_Sims_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/the-sims-4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PS4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-sims-4/c08jxnk0vg5l" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>. Naturally, it's also playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S thanks to the wonders of backwards compatibility.</p>

"With this in mind, we have decided to temporarily suspend work on Escape Factory and postpone it until a more appropriate time."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>After careful analysis and discussion with the team, we have decided that our Escape Factory project has not generated enough interest.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fntastic is now allegedly working on Items, an action horror prop hunt game. "Your wishes are very important to us," it said. "This is exactly what many of you have been waiting for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Kickstarter was announced but Fntastic said it may return to the crowdfunding route "or explore other options" once a demo for the game is made. Development will "require significant resources" so Fntastic has "decided to release mobile games" to support the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"All funds generated from these apps will go directly into development," it said. "We believe this will help us create the game of your dreams."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The term "dream" was often used in Fntastic's marketing for The Day Before. "We hope that after the game's success, we’ll give people faith that in this life, if you persevere toward a dream, it will come true, despite all the obstacles and doubts," Fntastic told IGN in January 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Day Before launched to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-review">an almost impossibly rare 1/10 in IGN's review</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-studio-fntastic-announces-closure-just-days-after-early-access-launch">its shutdown was announced</a> just four days after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-player-count-drops-almost-90-in-4-days-enters-steams-10-worst-reviewed-games-list">it launched in Early Access</a>. It was one of the most controversial and catastrophic game launches in recent memory (now joined by PlayStation 5's Concord) as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-accused-of-copying-other-games-again">what was touted as the "next generation of post-apocalyptic MMO open-world survival games"</a> was released as a barebones and broken extraction shooter.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Strange Saga of The Day Before</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once Steam's most wishlisted game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-strange-saga-of-the-day-before">suspicion mounted around The Day Before and Fntastic</a> as time went on. It announced delay after delay amid revelations <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-developer-steam-most-wishlisted-game-defends-unpaid-volunteers">the studio used unpaid workers to develop its games</a>, then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-strange-saga-of-the-day-before">a trademark dispute caused more issues</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Allegations the entire game was a scam then emerged from the disgruntled fanbase, made worse by the myriad copycat accusations against Fntastic. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-accused-of-copying-other-games-again">Shots in its trailers and screenshots lined up almost perfectly with other games</a> such as Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Cyberpunk 2077, and Grand Theft Auto 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, a trailer for The Day Before used the phrase: "Welcome to the next generation of post-apocalyptic MMO open-world survival games like never before. Immerse yourself in The Day Before." Alongside not making grammatical English sense, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/cyberpunk-2077-world-explainer-gameplay-trailer">Cyberpunk 2077's Official Gameplay Trailer</a>, published years earlier in 2020, used the very similar phrasing: "Welcome to the next-generation of open-world adventure. Immerse yourself in Cyberpunk 2077."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/red-dead-redemption-2-official-gameplay-trailer">Red Dead Redemption 2's Official Gameplay Video</a>, published even further back, used the phrases "...to make combat deep and engaging at all times. Each weapon has unique characteristics, with realistic reload and recoil." A trailer for The Day Before used: "...to ensure that combat remains deep and engaging at all times. Each weapon boasts unique characteristics, as well as realistic reload and recoil mechanics."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are just two examples of myriad accusations with similar weight, but Fntastic denied any wrongdoing, leaned on the "fake news" defence, and implied the accusations were just an attempt at attention seeking. "We all live in a time of disinformation and lack of fact-checking," it said following the second wave of accusations. "Anyone can say anything for views, and everyone will believe it," it said. "Disinformation needs to be dealt with."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fntastic has put out plenty of disinformation and blatant lies of its own, however, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-devs-say-delay-was-planned-before-trademark-dispute">saying the aforementioned trademark dispute caused a delay</a> when one was planned all along, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-studio-fntastic-announces-closure-just-days-after-early-access-launch">saying the studio was shutting down</a> before announcing another game just months later. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-dev-promises-refunds-tells-customers-st-happens">"S**t happens," it told fans</a> who were frustrated with the misleading information and failure of The Day Before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Now, Blizzard has found a way to bring a little touch of darkness from the game into the real world by allowing people in Los Angeles and New York to have evil flowers delivered to the special frenemies in your life.</p><p>This sinister Vases of Hatred floral arrangement was designed by celebrity florist Dead Flowers and inspired by the events of the expansion.

news for those who prefer DRM-free PC games. The sale is less robust than what's on offer at other Fanatical and other retailers, but the upshot is you own your games and can play without the need for launchers like Steam. GOG also offers the "Game of the Year" or "Ultimate" editions of newer Fallout games, which are not discounted at other outlets.

            <p>
We've only just said farewell to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-gets-reel-in-new-aquarius-fishing-update">fishing-themed Aquarius expedition</a>, but already there's another here to take its place - and this time it's a special, spooky themed event straddling the boundary between one reality and the next.
</p>
<p>
No Man's Sky's The Cursed expedition starts today and runs for a comparatively brisk three weeks, taking space explorers on an adventure that'll see them navigating a collapsing reality where time can shift unexpectedly, "day spinning to night at a vertigo inducing rate".
</p>
<p>
And that's not the worst of it; as players journey across this twilight universe and the boundaries of reality weaken, they'll be haunted by visions, voices, and spectral entities - some benign, others considerably less so - from another dimension. Developer Hello Games teases "enemies and boss battles at a scale not seen before in No Man's Sky."

<p>
To survive this spectral onslaught, players must maintain their Anomaly Suppressor - which replaces their Exosuit's usual hazard protection - and stay safe in their Boundary Starship, a new Giger-inspired flying saucer. And with no hyperdrive technology to rely on, they'll also need to traverse the cosmos using No Man's Sky's ancient portal network.
</p>
<p>
"Haunting voices leak through from another dimension, providing guidance, information, strange blueprints... and mystery," Hello Games teases. "Players will have to decide who these voices belong to, where they are coming from, and if they are to be trusted..."
</p>
<p>
By completing The Cursed expedition's various milestone objectives, players can unlock a range of exclusive rewards, including a Cthulhu-esque Horror Exosuit customisation, bioluminescent pets, and their very own UFO-like Boundary Herald Starship. Full patch notes for today's update can be <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/10/expedition-sixteen-the-cursed/">found on Hello Games' website</a>.
</p><p>
Additionally, the studio confirms there's still more in store for No Man's Sky, including "several more surprises" due "in the coming weeks". One of those is an update specifically designed to take advantage of PlayStation 5 Pro at launch in November, but we've also yet to hear more about the Worlds Part 2 release teased alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">massive Worlds Part 1 update</a> back in July, so perhaps that'll also rear its head before the year is through.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/23/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake">Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake</a> presents one of the series’ strongest instalments for both a new generation of strategy gamer and long-time fans, supercharging the PS2 original with new content and features. For those completely new to ROTK, it’s a grand strategy series that’s been around since the 1980s and takes place during the Three Kingdoms era in Ancient China – around the third century CE – in a time of nationwide turmoil that gives rise to stoic heroes and treacherous villains all vying for power.</p>
<p><iframe title="Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake - Second Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Febv7UPopIw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Publisher <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> has a well-established affinity for this historic setting. <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> – arguably the company’s flagship franchise – is also based on the somewhat fictionalised Romance of the Kingdoms, though it couldn’t be any more different than <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei">Koei’</a>s strategy games. Where Dynasty Warriors focuses purely on high octane, button-bashing action, ROTK immerses players in a dense web of menus and dialogue exchanges that steer you on the path to conquest and unification.</p>


<p>In Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake, you can tackle a number of historic campaigns, selecting from a host of different factions, ranks, and characters to play as. At one end of the scale you can act as a ruler, with full military and political control. At the other end, you can become a free officer who, as the name implies, is free to wander Ancient China, aligning with whoever they wish, or potentially gathering their own army and territories. There are plenty of officer roles that fall in between the two, offering different privileges based on your rank and influence within a faction.</p>


<p>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake is menu-heavy from the word go. That’s pretty much a staple for any game that falls under the grand strategy banner, though thankfully there are plenty of helpful tutorials on hand and Koei does a great job of easing players in without completely bombarding them, gently gesturing in the right direction without any obnoxious guard rails. There are a myriad of moving parts though it won’t take long for lapsed strategy fans and newcomers to get a grip on how everything works.</p>
<p>From slandering a rival officer and hosting banquets to increasing public order, you’ll have a limited number of points to spend on actions per turn. Then, by resting, time will progress to the next month, with each three-month season punctuated by a meeting of parliament (if you are aligned with a ruler). This is where more impactful decisions are made such as forging alliances, conducting espionage, or even marching to battle. These choices are made by high-ranking officers, of course, though even as a small retainer you can still have your say and put your name forward. Saying that, playing ROTK at the bottom of the ladder seems like a strange choice and one that leaves you fairly powerless until you gradually work your way through the ranks.</p>
<p>Compared to more recent entries in the series, ROTK 8 focuses on characters building relationships between one another. Although there’s plenty of planning, and politicising, you’ll spend most of your time simply getting to know your fellow officers, forging bonds that have a multitude of positive effects. Upon meeting certain conditions, you’ll also unlock Tales – character interactions that feed into a bigger, overarching narrative, usually reflecting what happened during specific points in history.</p>

<p>With the game having originally launched in 2001, there has been a significant visual overhaul from top to bottom. For a start, the city and campaign maps are far more dynamic and easier to navigate without shedding their charming ROTK aesthetic. Each officer is brought to life through gorgeous character artwork that transitions into 3D whenever you engage in the Duel and Debate mini-games, adding a welcome layer of immersion.</p>
<p>As for the battle system, there’s nothing overly complex. After deployment, armies will take it in turns to move their units, engage opponents, and activate stratagems. The outcome of most battles can usually be determined by who has the bigger army, though there is scope to tactically outmanoeuvre your foe, making use of the different unit types and arranging them in formations that confer morale bonuses. Table-turning stratagems can also come into play as well as emergent events such as having an enemy general challenge you to a one-on-one duel.</p>
<p>Through achieving dominance, both on and off the battlefield, you’ll eventually expand your territory and solidify an inner circle of confidents including a spouse and sworn siblings. Needless to say, the road to either total conquest or reaching any of the historical campaign victory requirements will take a very, very long time with many meandering paths depending on how you want your story to play out.</p>

                <p>Asus has revealed its new smartphone, the ROG Phone 9. Like the previous models, this is a gaming-centric Android smartphone that packs an impressive amount of technology inside its frame, and Asus says it'll be released on November 19.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4389212-asus-rog-phone-9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389212" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4389212-asus-rog-phone-9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389212"></a><figcaption>Asus ROG Phone 9</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4389212-asus-rog-phone-9.jpg"></figure><p>The new model will be powered by the SnapDragon 8 Elite chipset, and it's one of the first smartphones to utilize this new hardware. This mobile platform also includes a second-generation Qualcomm Oryon CPU and the enhanced Adreno GPU, which theoretically, will make for smooth gaming experiences on the ROG Phone 9. Asus has also confirmed that the phone will continue to have a gamer-centric design, as it showed off a device with sharp angles that match the general aesthetic of other Republic of Gamers devices.</p><p>There's also a dot-matrix display on the rear with this model, which isn't unusual to see on Asus hardware. Several of its ROG laptops sport a customizable panel and Asus also makes a controller that includes a tiny OLED panel that can be used to convey useful information when you're playing games.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple has just released its new line of<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iphone-16-has-hardware-accelerated-ray-tracing-and-native-support-for-aaa-games/1100-6526379/" data-ref-id="1100-6526379"> iPhone 16 smartphones</a>.

The third-party audio tool is built into Black Ops 6's settings menu, and will also be coming to Warzone with Season 1.</p><p>A screenshot of the audio menu was shared by COD content-creator <a href="https://x.com/Omeqa_/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Omeqa</a> on X (formerly Twitter), showing a pop-up offering a free trial for Embody's Immerse spatial audio. The service creates a personalized spatial audio profile based on players' head and ear shape, and costs $20 for five years.</p><p>The paid service is part of the Enhanced Headphone Mode setting, for which a <a href="https://x.com/Omeqa_/status/1848487292010434833" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">follow-up screenshot</a> is displayed prominently in the game's audio options. The setting uses a universal profile by default, with the option to pay for a personalized one.</p><p>Black Ops 6 isn't the only game to offer personalized spatial audio through Embody, but it's one of only a few to currently partner with the company. Final Fantasy XIV has offered personalized audio through Embody for a few years, while Cyberpunk 2077 added the option earlier this year.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1744664584" data-promo-id="0"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rayman-remake-prince-of-persia-team/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Rayman remake is currently in the works, and members of the recently disbanded Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown development team are said to be working on the game alongside the series' creator, Michel Ancel.</p>
<p>As reported today by&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rayman-remake-team-prince-of-persia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, this remake, known internally as Project Steambot, is getting put together by a team located primarily at Ubisoft Milan, the studio behind many successful projects, including the Mario + Rabbids series.&nbsp;<span>Members of the recently&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sequel-isnt-happening-due-to-low-sales-ubisoft-disbanded-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disbanded Ubisoft Montpellier studio</a>, the team behind the latest entry in the Rayman series, Rayman Origins, and Legends, are part of the development team, and the series creator, Michel Ancel, is also on board as a consultant.</span>&nbsp;His presence, however, is causing concern among the development team members due to his toxic leadership, which came to light in 2020 following the abandoning of the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 development.</p>
<p>As Ubisoft has yet to confirm a Rayman remake is indeed in the works, we have to take everything revealed by Insider Gaming today with a grain of salt. The outlet proved to be extremely reliable in the past, however, so there's a very good chance that the classic platform game series is indeed coming back in the future.</p>
<p>The disbanding of the Ubisoft Montpellier team is definitely disappointing, given how Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is among the best Metroidvania games released in the past few years, but it is good to know that some of its team members are possibly working on this Rayman remake. You can learn more about the team's excellent final game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/">review.</a></p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 system software update is now live, introducing Activities improvements, among other things.</p>
<p>The 24.07-10.20.00 system software improves the console's Activities feature. From now on, each activity will display In Progress, Not Started, or Completed, depending on its current status, with spoilers continuing to be hidden even after these changes. The new system software also brings the usual unspecified performance and stability improvements and enhanced messages and usability on some screens.</p>
<p>The previous major PlayStation 5 system software update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-3d-audio/">update 24.06</a>, was released last month. It introduced some new features to the system, such as the Welcome hub, personalized 3D audio profiles, Remote Play improvements, and more. The Welcome hub is a personalized space on the console's home screen that can be customized with different widgets that display the console's storage, battery levels for accessories, online friends, trophies, and more. The Remote Play improvements include the option to enable Remote Play for select users on the system.</p>
<p>The latest major PlayStation 5 system software update also introduced some changes that impacted several games, such as Final Fantasy XVI, requiring Sony to release another<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-24-06-10-01-00/"> firmware update to address the issue.</a></p>

It features a variety of mechanics from multiple genres, including base building, exploration, combat, animal taming, multiplayer mode, and more. When offered the chance to get a more in-depth look at the gameplay and learn about the inspiration behind&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>, I jumped at the chance. Though the preview was hands-off, my excitement is piqued and I cannot wait until it launches.</p>
<h2><em>Towers of Aghasba&nbsp;</em>Preview Introduces Exciting Features</h2>
<p>To kick off the preview, Dreamlit Games CEO Khang Le dove into the inspiration behind&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba.</em>&nbsp;Inspired&nbsp;by Studio Ghibli movies, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2f103da7-e1c4-4b2e-b0ff-a20e181b64c1" href="https://techraptor.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons"><em>A</em><em>nimal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a>, and various African tribes, the game blends multiplayer cooperation with expansive city building, exploration-driven adventure, and environmental restoration. What you get is a responsive world that differs from other players depending on two key locations.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-colossal-seed-tree.jpg?itok=Yb5M93Gv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-colossal-seed-tree.jpg?itok=kx4Z4e-m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You play as a member of the Shimu people as they return to their ancestral home. Having been promised a paradise, the land is laid barren due to the Withered, a disease that sent your people fleeing from the island years ago. There are pockets of desert where you can build your base, but the most important thing to do is plant a colossal seed.</p>
<p>Unlike most open world crafting games,&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>&nbsp;doesn't give you a plethora of resources to harvest at the beginning or your adventure. You have to start restoring the environment if you want materials to craft with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where your island will start to become different from your friends. Depending on the location you plant the seed, the animals that return to the area, as well as the plants that grow, will be different. Plant it near the ocean and you'll get more sea creatures. Plant it at the top of a cliff, you could end up with more birds.</p>
<p>This also gets impacted by the different biomes you grow your seed in. The desert will produce different flora and fauna than a swamp. At the start of Early Access, there will be three biomes to choose your starting location from and restore.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-base-building.jpg?itok=QF-l3r8D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-base-building.jpg?itok=xhZe4XLZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Thanks to this mechanic, sharing resources with your friends and other players can be extremely important. Trading for materials you don't have available on your island is just one way to utilize multiplayer.</p>
<p>You can also party up and explore Withered areas, which are populated with Withered enemies. These corrupted creatures are aggressive and you can be killed. Adventuring through these zones is the only way to learn the cause of the disease. If you're looking for a relaxing experience, you can visit your friend's islands and go for a tour of their city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another ecological focus of&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>&nbsp;is caring for animals and sustainable hunting and gathering. Instead of stockpiling meat, leather, or feathers, there are significant consequences to overhunting a species of animal.</p>
<p>Pushed to the extreme you can cause a creature to go extinct, which impacts the whole ecosystem in that area. Instead, caring for wounded animals, harvesting what you need, and attempting to farm resources in a non-lethal manner are rewarded. There are over 40 creatures that can spawn in your environment and 120 plants that can grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you do have enough materials you can start to build your base. The location you choose can impact what type of city you create, even though there are over 150 decorative elements to choose from. There are different focuses, such as a farming or mining city, that will differentiate your creation from others. While you can put as many crafting items in one place, picking from one of the three types of cities can allow more efficient production.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-withered-combat.jpg?itok=KSNR5wdb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-withered-combat.jpg?itok=xDPPRuSq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It may seem like taming animals, growing plants, and building a city are all there is to do in&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>, but you'd be wrong. There are other activities, like collecting ancient relics, fishing, swimming, and gliding around the world. These are all available at the start of early access, with a roadmap of what's to come in the future becoming available when the game launches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a die hard <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e2fac55-7c08-4df9-8cd3-a855c0dff7df" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/survival-games-why-we-keep-on-coming-back-for-more">survival crafting</a> game fan, I am super excited to get my hands on&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>. Not only is the world gorgeously produced with hand-painted backgrounds, but the unique spin on many of the "expected" survival and base building mechanics has me seriously interested.</p>
<p>I can't wait to see how restoring the world of the Shimu people looks in real time and how these changes can impact other games being developed in the genre.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/sunderfolk-gm-anjali-bhimani-explains-how-she-voices-multiple-characters<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/anjali-bhimani-talks-with-us-about-lady-amangeaux-and-dimension-20-ravening-war">Anjali Bhimani</a> is an actor, writer, TTRPG player, and recently announced GM for <em>Sunderfolk</em>, a unique title that makes board-game night more accessible for family and friends, Bhimani takes on the role of narrator as well as voicing all the NPCs. Reaching out for her thoughts on the experience, I was able to chat with her about <em>Sunderfolk</em>.</p>
<h2>Reinventing Game Night with <em>Sunderfolk</em></h2>
<p><em>Sunderfolk</em>&nbsp;is a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b94efb2d-271e-4538-9184-818a6bdea666" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/in-ttrpg-rolling-dice-or-not-doesnt-matter">TTRPG</a> video game with a fully voiced cast of characters, different classes to pick from, and a focus on storytelling. Developed by Dreamhaven, the studio created by Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime, it's the first internally created title to be announced. The team includes numerous former Blizzard devs, including&nbsp;Chris Sigaty who was the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ef33aa60-a7ad-4324-adbf-4ca288d1e741" href="https://techraptor.net/games/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty"><em>StarCraft II</em></a>&nbsp;executive producer and&nbsp;is heading up the&nbsp;<em>Sunderfolk</em>&nbsp;project.</p>

<p>The dev team isn't the only all star working on&nbsp;the project.&nbsp;Bhimani is a veteran actor with both on screen and voice-over credits. She's deeply committed to the tabletop community. She's played&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>&nbsp;since she was a child with her brother, as well as board games with her family.&nbsp; A regular guest on&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story">Critical Role</a>, she's also a member of DesiQuest, has appeared on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/zac-oyama-talks-fantasy-high-junior-year-gorgugs-development-and-how-elmville-is">Dimension20</a>, and runs her own charity campaign, Puppy Roll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There's a connection you can have with people through game playing that doesn't necessarily come in other places."</p>
<p><i>Sunderfolk </i>is&nbsp;not a traditional tabletop game, however. Before diving into the specifics of her role as GM, Bhimani gave me more details on the game itself and how it differs from what's currently on the market.</p>
<p>"The barrier to entry to a lot of TTRPGs is the amount of stuff you have to learn. Trying to bring more friends into that world is sometimes challenging," Bhimani lamented.</p>
<p>Depending on the system, prospective players can spend hours reading lore, learning what different dice rolls mean, creating a character, and actually setting up the space to play. The barrier to entry for many TTRPGs is so high that people don't even bother to learn about another game system, try to find faster ways to play, or continue to show any interest at all in the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My feeling, much like what they've done with&nbsp;<em>Sunderfolk</em>,&nbsp;is that as long as you know how to have fun and tell a good story, that should be it. That's all it is, as long as you're there to have a good time and share in this experience with your fellow players."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sunderfolk-town-screenshot.jpg?itok=nsXLkJN7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sunderfolk-town-screenshot.jpg?itok=HqLf-Yjs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When it comes to bringing more people to the world of tabletop,&nbsp;<em>Sunderfolk</em>&nbsp;is on the right track.</p>
<p>"I was really, really taken by both the quality of the work they had already put together, even before we started, the deck, and the art. And the deep love that they clearly had, not just for the tabletop community, but for the essence of how gaming brings people together."&nbsp;</p>
<p>This focus on bringing people together for game night to tell a good story is what prompted Bhimani to join&nbsp;<em>Sunderfolk&nbsp;</em>as the GM, voicing the narrator for the game as well as all the various NPCs.</p>
<p>"The work I do as an actor has played into that. Also knowing that, much like you'd want to do in a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="taxonomy_term" data-entity-uuid="ea988cf8-aaa8-4b3e-839c-a01fc3d3270b" href="https://techraptor.net/topic/voice-acting">voice over</a> situation, if I was in an animated series and I was doing all the different voices and it was only audio like a podcast, you would need to hear the difference to know who was talking," Bhimani stated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diving in more on&nbsp;<em>Sunderfolk </em>itself<em>,</em>&nbsp;there are a number of NPCs that are ready to steal the show. From a button mushroom to Sinclair the mole and Amaia the penguin, there are plenty of characters to interact with in the narrative-heavy game.</p>
<p>The great part is there's no prep, and if your party can't get through a quest or need more time, you can pick the game up right where you left off. It's also child friendly, making it an easy addition to a family game night.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sunderfolk-amaia-dialogue.jpg?itok=wO8eE1OA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sunderfolk-amaia-dialogue.jpg?itok=XytsgDek 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Sunderfolk</em>&nbsp;takes a story and puts it on a shared screen. All the tools needed are at your fingertips on your phone or mobile device. "There's nothing like it, so I don't specifically know what to compare it to," she explained. Once you get your friends and family together, just turn on the game to start adventuring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bhimani then expanded on the feel of <em>Sunderfolk</em>. "There are sections that will feel a little bit like a storybook that are similar to cutscenes that we see in certain video games. Then there are also sections that are just full-on gameplay grid situations where you will be in battle or encounter of some kind."</p>
<p>The Dreamhaven team have created an access point for many new to TTRPGs that want to learn more about that genre,&nbsp;experience a different kind of game night, or are too busy to put together a campaign.&nbsp;<em>Sunderfolk&nbsp;</em>is looking to become a bridge between video game enthusiasts and TTRPG players. With an experienced GM helming the storytelling, it could shake up the industry.</p>
<p>Before wrapping up the interview, I briefly touched on Bhimani's other work, especially her charity efforts with live-play campaigns like Puppy Roll.&nbsp;Puppy Roll is a finalist in the Sustainability, Environment, and Climate category of the Anthem Awards for 2024 due to it raising money for animals.&nbsp;Noting that playing TTRPGs is fun, she also wants to have an additional benefit aside from entertainment.</p>
<p>"When we get a chance to create something that is super fun to watch and to play and to create and we get to make a difference in the world, it's really lovely that that effort has been noticed," Bhimani said.</p>

            <p>
Cast your mind back a month, and you may remember a promising-looking open-world sandbox popping up in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-sonys-playstation-state-of-play">Sony's September PlayStation State of Play</a>. That game was Towers of Aghasba, and it now has an early access release date for PC and PS5: 19th November. 
</p>
<p>A mix of sandbox survival in a land of big beasts, and an overarching quest of refertilising and rebuilding its ruined open world, Towers of Aghasba stood out as offering a larger gameplay arc than simply rubbing a few sticks together and sticking up a couple of wooden shacks. 
</p>
<p>Here, the emphasis is on renewing Aghasba's world (presumably, named Aghasba), returning its dusty ruins to grassy fields and then growing crops or encouraging animal life. You can hunt said animal life for quick rewards, or take the slower, kinder approach and... well, the trailer below shows you getting some kind of colourful hearts in return.</p>
<p>The whole thing looks a treat too, which always helps, even if you can spot its various gameplay influences a mile off. Here's an extended look at what Towers of Aghasba's early access has to offer:</p>
