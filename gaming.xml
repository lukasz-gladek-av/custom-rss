            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199957/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-coming-soon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a new community update, Larian Studios <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4240783699885624491">has shared a brief overview</a> of all the things it’s working on for the next <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> patch.</p><p>Larian has previously announced that patch 7, due out in September, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles">will include the release of official mod support</a> and the introduction of a toolkit that will allow players the ability to create their own mods. According to Larian, the toolkit supports the creation of new items, classes and subclasses, races, and more.</p><p>I’ve been modding my games since the days of <em>World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade</em> and <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>. However, I’ve always been intimidated by the idea of creating my own mods, even for games I adore. I’m definitely interested to try out the mod toolkit for myself, especially since a lot of the comments Larian shared from modders attest to its ease of use. If the toolkit allows me to create new narrative content, essentially allowing me to re-create my fanfictions in the game, you will never hear from me again.</p><p>In addition to mod support and the toolkit, patch 7 will also add a nifty dynamic split-screen co-op feature. Instead of co-op games being permanently bifurcated in split-screen mode, players will have an option that will merge the two screens into one if players are close to each other. It looks pretty dang cool in action.</p><p>On the narrative side, patch 7 will add tweaks and updates to companion stories, dialogue, and romance content. Larian’s also adding new cinematics that reflect some of the game’s more evil endings for origin and dark urge characters. </p><p>Though this forthcoming update feels like Larian’s final goodbye to <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24108773/baldurs-gate-3-larian-dungeons-and-dragons">moves on to other projects</a>, the studio reaffirmed that patch 7 isn’t the last update for the game. Cross-play and photo mode are also on the way. In the meantime, it’s offering players the chance to try out patch 7 before it releases in September in a closed beta you can register for on the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1086940%2FBaldurs_Gate_3%2F"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-allegedly-canceled-according-to-developer-resume/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New information spotted online suggests that The Sims 5, also known as Project Rene, has been allegedly canceled. Instead, the team is shifting their focus to working on The Sims 4, where content is consistently produced for the game. Lovestruck is the latest upcoming expansion for The Sims 4 and is due to be released on July 25.</p>
<p>Project Rene was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-next-gen-project-rene-revealed-customization-cross-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first shown off</a> in a "Behind the Sims" summit in 2022. Audiences were told that this would be the next installment in the franchise. Since The Sims 4 was released, audiences have been very vocal about features they'd like to see re-added to the popular simulation game.</p>
<p>Maxis had <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-to-get-inspiration-from-animal-crossing-making-multiplayer-experience-more-interactive/">plans to include the open-world feature</a> in the next game and snippets of gameplay from the project were also shown at the summit. However, multiple rumors are beginning to emerge that The Sims 5 has been canceled.</p>
<p>The rumor first appeared on r/GamingLeaksandRumors, suggesting that developers who were working on The Sims 5 have returned to focus on The Sims 4 instead.<a href="https://imgur.com/a/sims-5-cancelled-rumor-LRAnJbv" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Multiple screenshots</a> have since emerged, suggesting that key members of the team for The Sims 5 have since left.</p>
<p>The Senior Game Designer for Project Rene has shifted their efforts to The Sims 4, with the Lead Character Artist leaving their EA job entirely. In what seems to be a screenshot of their LinkedIn page, it shows that The Sims 5 is marked as canceled.</p>
<p>For the time being, these comments and screenshots are all speculation, as Electronic Arts hasn't officially made a statement claiming that Project Rene is canceled. However, those dedicated fans of the franchise are not happy to hear the news.</p>
<p>Compared to the other iterations of the franchise and even the spin-offs, The Sims 4 is not quite a fan favorite. It is disappointing that they may be working on it for another 5-10 years, adding more DLC.</p>
<p>For example, there is the upcoming expansion pack Lovestruck, and plenty of free updates have been added to the game. These updates add sprinkles of new content and some new traits and furniture that can be unlocked by logging into The Sims 4 daily. This was another feature created that didn't go down well with the audience, as not everyone has the time to log in to The Sims 4 daily, meaning they will miss out on the exclusive items and traits added to the game.</p>
<p>Until Electronic Arts releases an official statement on The Sims 5, we can only hope and pray that it's actually still in development. We'll update this story when and if the publisher provides a comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/how-should-we-talk-about-the-trump-thing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here in America, we continue to live in the most precedented unprecedented times, where decades of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/03/27/ar-15-facts-what-we-learned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gun violence</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c977njnvq2do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horrifying political strategy</a> have converged around the weekend’s shooting at a Trump rally, which left <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce586kxjvnyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one spectator dead and three people injured</a>, including Trump, who was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/possible-shots-fired-at-trump-rally-in-butler-pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit in the ear</a>. Some Republicans have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/trump-rally-shooting-conspiracy-theories-flourish-online-rcna161752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spread conspiracies</a> blaming the left (the shooter’s motives remain unclear, though officials are investigating it as an assassination attempt). Democrats have been quick to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/reactions-shooting-trump-rally-pennsylvania-2024-07-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offer condolences</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/after-trump-assassination-attempt-biden-campaign-pauses-ads/story?id=111930384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pull Biden’s campaign communications</a>. And, in peak “one of these things is not like the other,” comedy band Tenacious D <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/jack-black-cancels-tenacious-d-tour-trump-assassination-kyle-gass-1236073486/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled their tour</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Tenacious D, a band fronted by actor Jack Black and Kyle Gass, was on tour in Sydney, Australia when Gass, as part of making a birthday wish on stage, said “Don’t miss Trump next time.” The backlash was swift. Some Australian wacko politician Luke had to teach me about <a href="https://x.com/senatorbabet/status/1813028533998133257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanded the duo’s deportation from Australia</a>. And Black, the other half of the creative duo, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9e5msPpC3y/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=950c251c-cd6d-4924-aefb-4341ce29df7a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he was “blindsided by what was said at the show on Sunday. I would never condone hate speech or political violence in any form. After much reflection, I no longer feel it is appropriate to continue the Tenacious D tour, and all future creative plans are on hold.”</p><p>I haven’t thought about Tenacious D since 2006, so I don’t have any skin in the game on the canceled tour or the future of the band. But they’re a unique meeting point for the messy discourse following the assassination attempt. They’re famous enough to be scolded by those who believe in civility (or at least want to perform it), and famous enough to cave to the scolding and issue a generic Instagram statement. But they’re also minor enough to say, or feel they can say, what regular people might want to say as complicated humans living through intensely fucked-up times.&nbsp;</p><p>Black <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hPUM01nuis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared to laugh</a> at the joke on stage, suggesting the canceled tour is less a reflection of an earnest commitment to compassion or civility and more a PR move, especially in light of his career in voice acting. And while you could read Gass’ joke as an incitement to violence about which people should be concerned, there’s no denying it’s an expression of the way lots of regular people are feeling right now, which is one of the functions of art. Canceling their tour feels like the as-yet weirdest example of how much everyone—both public figures and regular folks like you and me—are struggling to figure out how to talk about what happened to Trump.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the field. In terms of people you would expect to be obligated to say something about all this, Democrats have long prioritized <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainTheJoke/comments/14n08xq/what_is_this_referring_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their vision of civility</a> over actually achieving anything politically, so their responses, as well as their strategic silences, aren’t a surprise to me. It has not been lost on many that <a href="https://x.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1812268746574020870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nancy Pelosi sent Trump her love</a> even though Republicans <a href="https://time.com/6226946/paul-pelosi-attack-gop-response-political-discourse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mercilessly mocked</a> the attack on her husband in 2022. “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/20/us/thoughts-and-prayers-florida-school-shooting-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thoughts and prayers</a>,” one of America’s leading exports, has taken on a new cast since Saturday. And while taking the high road might sometimes be laudable for everyday humans, we’ve seen, time and again, that Democrats’ “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/michelle-obama-on-famous-catchphrase-when-they-go-low-we-go-high.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going high</a>” has simply been met by more “going low” from their opponents. By retreating when so many eyes are on the national stage, they’re simply handing the conversation over to one side, and I don’t think it’s fatalist to say that doesn’t lead anywhere good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So far, Republicans have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/trump-rally-shooting-republican-reactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largely filled</a> the space with sympathy for Trump and the killed and injured attendees, though also with blame for Biden and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/13/trump-shooting-rally-witness-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press</a>. J. D. Vance, now Trump’s Vice Presidential nominee, said on <a href="https://x.com/JDVance1/status/1812280973628965109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination.”</p><p>Much hay has also been made over the widow of Saturday’s victim <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/15/us-news/corey-comperatores-widow-reveals-his-final-words-before-he-was-killed-at-trump-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refusing to speak</a> to Biden when he called her, as well as the fact that Trump <em>hasn’t</em> called her. Whatever this says about civility in politics or the rabid commitment of Trump’s base, I think it’s fair for someone grieving the death of their husband to talk to or not talk to whoever they want. She might find herself in the spotlight, but she’s not a public figure under any particular obligation.</p><p>Which brings us to all the rest of us. For us regular people, following the assassination attempt Saturday, social media was abuzz with jokes similar to Gass’, and then just as abuzz with people warning other people not to say stuff that could get them investigated by the feds. This is good advice, and many people are rightly worried about the consequences of being publicly anti-Trump if he wins in November.&nbsp;</p><p>But let’s remember that life does not take place solely on social media, which brings me to a question I—and maybe you—have been wrangling with since Saturday: how should you talk about all this?&nbsp;</p><p>In the privacy of your own life (and, if you’re <em>really</em> concerned about opsec, far away from your phone), you can believe and think and say whatever you want. Is it wrong to wish for the death of someone who has been very clear they wish for your death? Is the assassination attempt the Right’s violent rhetoric looping around to bite them in the ass? And should a <em>comedy rock band</em> play by regular person rules, or by public figure rules?&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the fact that I personally am religious, I don’t believe it’s my job, or the job of any regular people, to dispense a unique grace to Trump or his powerful allies in this instance. A bad thing happening to a bad person doesn’t make that person good, or mean that they are owed a pass on their harmful words and actions. You and I are not under the same obligation Democrat politicians and <em>Tenacious D</em> seem to think they are to pivot our priorities or press “pause” on our causes. We are under an obligation to make our world a place worth living in, whether we define that through our faith or our politics or our art or whatever values guide us. We can hold a lot of different ideas in our brains and hearts at once. Tenacious D might cancel the tour, but we don’t have to.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Supermassive Games' narrative-focused single-player Dead by Daylight spin-off, The Casting of Frank Stone, launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 3rd September.
</p>
<p>
Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-narrative-game-the-casting-of-frank-stone-revealed">last December</a>, The Casting of Frank Stone's story begins in Cedar Hills, Oregon, in the summer of 1980, when a group of young filmmakers travels to an abandoned steel mill in order to shoot their horror movie, Murder Mill. Unbeknown to the teenagers, however, a dormant evil lies waiting, and the group ends up capturing far more on camera than it bargained for, creating a "soon-to-be cult classic with an insidious influence."
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, The Casting of Frank Stone follows the interactive horror movie template Supermassive has been steadily refining across the likes of Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and 2022's The Quarry. By making choices as the branching cinematic story unfolds, players can shift the narrative, influencing the direction of the shoot, affecting characters' relationships, and even their fates.

"Change reality with your choices, unlock new paths with your actions, and discover what horrors your final cut may hold," explains publisher (and Dead by Daylight developer) Behaviour Interactive. "In a story where every move matters, actions can speak louder than words. Explore a cinematic nightmare, testing your wits as you solve environmental puzzles and react to Quick Time Events. Guide your cast of characters through eerie locations and search for clues that hide the bigger picture."
</p>
<p>
The Casting of Frank Stone's 3rd September release date is just one of several announcements made during Behaviour Interative's Dead by Daylight 8th anniversary livestream. As well as highlighting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-lara-croft-coming-to-dead-by-daylight">arrival of Lara Croft</a> in its asymmetrical multiplayer horror game, the studio has also confirmed it's releasing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCumCxtPTew">new 2v8 game mode</a> on 25th July, enabling eight survivors to face off against two killers across five classic maps.
</p>
<p>
Maps have been expanded to accommodate the increased player count, and the number of generators has also doubled, with survivors (who'll now be sent directly to cages if downed) needing to repair eight out of 13 to escape. Other changes include a new survivor class system, which ditches Perks in favour of clearer player "roles", and Power alterations for killers, including a new team-based ability that can be unleashed as a duo.
</p>
<p>
And finally, Behaviour Interactive has confirmed cross-progression is coming to Dead by Daylight on 22nd July, enabling players to share their progress, inventory (excluding platform-exclusive items), paid currency, and DLC between owned versions of the game on PlayStation, Xbox, Steam, the Epic Games Store, and Windows Store  using a Behaviour Account. On Switch, however, things are little more convoluted.
</p>
<p>
Progression and inventory can still be shared between platforms via Switch but paid currency and DLC bought on Nintendo's console can't be shared elsewhere. However, paid currency and DLC bought on a different platform <em>can</em> be used on Switch, and if that sounds excessively confusing, Behaviour Interactive has <a href="https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/sections/6714025818260-Behaviour-Account-Cross-Progression">released an FAQ</a> to clarify some details.

Effectively, beginning with the upcoming 22nd season, battle passes will be split into halves and players have to pay the price of a regular season for half of one now. The justification from EA and Respawn was that players would receive more content by paying for each of the splits, but it seems that the publisher—which has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/did-these-horrible-deeds-clinch-eas-spot-as-americas-wo-452564685&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/did-these-horrible-deeds-clinch-eas-spot-as-americas-wo-452564685">repeatedly</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/04/09/ea-voted-worst-company-in-america-again/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/04/09/ea-voted-worst-company-in-america-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked</a></span> at the top of the world’s worst companies—is just trying to squeeze its community for more money.

The latter happens to be the case here.</p><p>As you can imagine, most of the criticisms being levied at <em>Apex</em> <em>Legends</em> in its Steam reviews chiefly take issue with the battle pass changes, not the gameplay itself. One review reads, “Now with the new battle pass system, I’m deleting the game, as well as most players, bye!” Another cuts right to the point, reading, “Ea as usual destroying a fun game with a ridiculous amount of over monetization. Classic greedy EA.”</p><p>Per the last comment, a lot of folks don’t seem all that surprised that EA, a company known for its numerous microtransaction-riddled titles, might try a move like this. “EA EA EA why do u have to destroy every game u create at some point,” reads one disgruntled review whose writer seems to have been in this position before.

                <p>EA Sports College Football 25 is the ultimate way to immerse yourself in the world of the NCAA, all from the comfort of your couch. Dynasty mode is the pinnacle of that glory, allowing you to take the role of a coach and build the school of your choice. Choosing your coach backstory is a key decision when entering the mode, and we've got the rundown on how to pick the best coach type for you in CFB 25.</p><h2>Choosing Coach Role</h2><p>The first decision you'll need to make when selecting your coach for dynasty mode in EA Sports College Football 25 is what your role is going to be. You can choose Head Coach, Offensive Coordinator, and Defensive Coordinator.</p><p>The Offensive Coordinator and Defensive Coordinator are in charge of their respective sides, meaning you'll only recruit and play in the game as one or the other. Head Coach means you're responsible for both sides of the ball, both on and off the field.</p><p>It is also worth noting that you'll have specific goals presented to you throughout the year based on the role you chose. Meeting those goals and your overall position/stats relevant to the side you manage affects how well you're graded at the end of the year.</p><h2>Existing Or Custom Coach</h2><p>The next choice is to decide whether you want to use a pre-existing coach or create your own. Existing coaches come with their own preset skills, schemes, and strategies, giving you an advantage in that they are already leveled up.</p><p>Creating a new coach lets you customize your own, though you'll have to grow them each game. The benefit of this is that you'll be able to customize your strengths and weaknesses as you go, instead of being locked into pre-made archetypes and skills.</p><h2>Which Coach Backstory Is Best?</h2><p>The final and arguably most impactful decision is choosing which of the three backstories you want to go with:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1841/18416792/4335480-coachtypebackstory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335480" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1841/18416792/4335480-coachtypebackstory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335480"></a><figcaption>College Football 25 coach backstories</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1841/18416792/4335480-coachtypebackstory.jpg"></figure><ul><li><strong>Motivator</strong> - Get your players to play their best by boosting their rating and composure. Nobody has it better than us.</li><li><strong>Recruiter</strong> - Jimmys and joes, not Xs and Os. You scout faster and recruit better than any other type of coach.</li><li><strong>Tactician</strong> - Boost your player's rating on gameday. Scheme up the big plays and let the visor fly.</li></ul><p>While there is no wrong option, a <strong>Recruiter seems to be the best option across the board</strong>, as it'll help you build your school in the long term thanks to the ability to scout faster and recruit better. Regardless of what you select, you'll earn coach points in each game that go towards buying skills that impact both on and off-the-field actions.</p><p>Once you sign your contract, you'll need to live up to the hype. Contracts and expectations are based on the school's historical records. The bigger the school, the more chance you may get fired and have to find another down the line.</p><p>College Football 25 is one of the biggest releases of the year.

Despite the early access review period underway, EA Sports's long-awaited return to College Football video games is pulling some solid early numbers. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now there’s over 700,000 people online on College Football 25 <a href="https://t.co/r1q5XRtd8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/r1q5XRtd8E</a></p>— Bordeaux (@bordeauxyoutube) <a href="https://twitter.com/bordeauxyoutube/status/1813028634359439629?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Several users on X/Twitter were reporting how many players were online right now playing College Football 25. YouTuber and X/Twitter user Bordeaux <a href="https://x.com/bordeauxyoutube/status/1813028634359439629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted an image</a> on his official account that over 700,000 people were currently playing College Football 25, an impressive number considering that only accounts for people who bought the Deluxe Edition and MVP due to the three days early access pre-order incentives. </p><p>Of course, this number only accounts for players connected to their Xbox Live or PSN account and does not include offline players. This uptick in player count days before its worldwide release also caused <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25s-servers-are-getting-crushed-before-its-even-fully-released">College Football 25 servers to struggle</a> to keep up with the high player count last night. </p><p>More interestingly, X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/Welfare_JBP/status/1813045727578272096" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Welfare_JBP posted a screenshot</a> from Walmart that over 1,000 Xbox Series S consoles were bought at Walmart yesterday. At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Microsoft-Xbox-Series-S-1TB/2814750651?athbdg=L1102&amp;from=/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walmart's listing for the 1TB all-black Series S</a> model shows the same banner: over 1,000 units were bought yesterday, and over 200 people have the console in their shopping cart. The Xbox Series S is one of three platforms College Football 25 is available on as EA Sports opted not to release it on either PC or the eighth-generation consoles. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Yeeeah EA College Football is absolutely for sure, positively a console mover.</p><p>Xbox Series S is never touching +1000 today at Walmart otherwise, outside a price cut.

The more interesting part of that note is that this happened on the same day that the MLB's Home Run Derby was held and "right after" San Diego Studio released a massive content update for MLB The Show 24. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Phew.

                <p>Gaming keyboards are all the rage these days, and for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a>, you can score a big deal on 8BitDo's excellent line of retro-themed devices. These are available in several variants, but the standout deal here is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYSQWYZP?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo C64 keyboard</a>, as not only do you get a device that pays homage to the Commodore 64 with its color scheme, but big action buttons <em>and </em>a joystick, all for just $88. Considering it normally costs $110, this is quite the bargain. If those colors don't catch your eye and you're not too concerned about losing out on a free joystick, you can also check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCP6HLZR?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Famicom</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCP8KYGG?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NES-inspired</a> keyboards for sale.</p><h2>8BitDo Prime Day Keyboard Specials</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYSQWYZP?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo C64 Edition mechanical keyboard</a> -- $88 ($<strike>110</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCP6HLZR?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Fami Edition mechanical keyboard</a> -- $80 ($<strike>100</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCP8KYGG?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo N Edition mechanical keyboard</a> -- $80 ($<strike>100</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Supports-Calculator-Bluetooth-Gaming-Console/dp/B00PN9S6JU?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo mechanical keyboard numpad</a> -- $45</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4332574-8bitdo-c64.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332574" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4332574-8bitdo-c64.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332574"></a><figcaption>8BitDo C64 Retro Mechanical Keyboard</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4332574-8bitdo-c64.jpg"></figure><p>So what makes these keyboards so great? First, they're wireless TKL mechanical keyboards with a very durable design, options to use them in a wired mode, and hot-swappable PCB for easy customization without soldering. Like other 8BitDo products, they have a high level of customization through the company's custom software for the price point. The included Dual Super buttons on a separate gamepad are also great, as you can map different functions to them.</p><p>If you'd like to pair a numpad with this and do your taxes, 8BitDo has an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Supports-Calculator-Bluetooth-Gaming-Console/dp/B00PN9S6JU?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official mechanical numpad</a> that recently launched. Priced at $45, it can easily pair with your keyboard or you can switch it to calculator mode and marvel at the cool red LED display on it.</p><p>These keyboard deals won't be available for long. Prime Day only runs July 16 and 17, and this deal is sure to end--or even sell out--before then, so grab them while you can.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> remains one of the most popular and influential games out there, and it's no longer just a game, but instead a platform of sorts for all manner of different types of games and experiences. Epic's Tim Sweeney believes Fortnite is basically an early version of the metaverse, and he recently spoke about this belief and how he sees the game growing and evolving over time.</p><p>"It's going to evolve a lot," Sweeney said. He <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/sweeneystephenson" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spoke to researcher Matthew Ball about this recently</a>, ahead of Fortnite's seventh anniversary in August.</p><p>Fortnite as it exists today is limited by the available technology with which to build it. For example, Sweeney said the game's battle royale mode is limited to 100 people because "computers in the data center were just too slow" when the game released. And Fortnite is divided into a number of different islands for a similar reason: The technology stack required to create one seamless experience is not there.</p><p>"So a lot of the things you see in there are not the permanent end state of what we see this medium being, but are just current crutches that we're using to hobble by as we work towards the ultimate capabilities of the thing," he said.</p><p>Sweeney said players can look forward to "really significant changes" to come, one of which is an "interoperable economy" that spans games beyond Fortnite. This will be "really freeing for people," Sweeney said, though he didn't elaborate on any potential partnerships or how this would work.</p><p>He went on to say that the Fortnite networking model today is "extremely limited," saying the model from Unreal Engine 5 today is "remarkably similar" to what it was for Unreal Engine 1 in 1997. It has been improved over time, of course, but it still has tons of room to grow, Sweeney said.</p><p>"A Fortnite battle royale session is 100 players. There might be at peak hundreds of thousands of these servers running and there might be at peak over 10 million concurrent players online all at once, but they're each in their own separate sharded copies of the world and they can't see each other in that space. They can't go anywhere to find each other all at once," he said.</p><p>For Unreal Engine 6, Sweeney said a major aim is to improve the networking model to help support lots of concurrent players and the ability to move players between servers seamlessly. The scale could support a billion concurrent players in the future, Sweeney predicted.</p><p>"That's got to be one of the goals of the technology. Otherwise, many genres of games just can never exist because the technology isn't there to support them," he said.</p><p>The end result for the user could be a "much larger simulation" for players than exists today. This could in turn lead to a combination of Fortnite's existing content into "a seamless world as players want."</p><p>"Some experiences will be better by themselves. If you want to build an awesome bespoke story-driven, single player or a co-op game, you might build it off in its own little corner of the world, no connections to the outside, but an awful lot of what we're doing would be a whole lot better if it were all seamlessly connected," Sweeney said.</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4335467-screenshot2024-07-16at3.22.15pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4335467" data-ratio="0.59259259259259" data-width="999" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4335467-screenshot2024-07-16at3.22.15pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4335467"></a><figcaption>Fortnite continues to grow and evolve</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4335467-screenshot2024-07-16at3.22.15pm.png"></figure><p>He likened this to Disney's theme parks, which are connected by transport systems but exist in one big world. "You can go anywhere in this connected world and participate in any experience there. And what are creators doing instead of creating their own little isolated islands? They're taking over a portion of space in the world and they're defining the game roles there in different parts of space," Sweeney said. For what it's worth, Epic recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-disney-persistent-universe-tied-to-fortnite-is-in-the-works/1100-6520900/" data-ref-id="1100-6520900">invested $1.5 billion into Epic to create... something in Fortnite</a>, and fans are intrigued to see what that could be.</p><p>What's more, Sweeney said he would like to see Fortnite embrace actual game code written by fans. "Things become really interesting when every creator's code can interoperate with every creator's code," Sweeney said. "Everybody's out creating their own really interesting objects and creating them using protocols that are provided by the system to enable them all to work together. So you might be riding a mount or an animal built by one creator and your friend might be driving a car built by another creator. You might be carrying a weapon built by a third creator, and you might be in a world maintained by dozens of other creators, and you might be moving seamlessly from place to place with all of these interactions happening."</p><p>Sweeney said Epic could have achieved some of its goals already if it adopted Roblox's setup where there are a "bunch of sharded islands deployed as quickly as possible." However, Sweeney said Epic's aim is to "build for the long term," noting that he believes "an awful lot" of his vision for Fortnite will come to fruition by 2030.</p><p>Sweeney also spoke about Epic's aim for Fortnite to contribute to the creation of a bigger and more robust metaverse. Fortnite of course has already done numerous crossovers with characters and people from other franchises, and things will only accelerate further, Sweeney believes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4335466-screenshot2024-07-16at3.22.34pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4335466" data-ratio="0.53665158371041" data-width="1105" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4335466-screenshot2024-07-16at3.22.34pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4335466"></a><figcaption>The band Metallica recently came to Fortnite</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4335466-screenshot2024-07-16at3.22.34pm.png"></figure><p>"It's going to take on a life of its own and really quickly transcend what it is today. It's become very clear over the past few years that we're in this steep growth curve that's being driven by that," he said. "This medium is emerging at an astonishing rate, and I think people have no idea how awesome it's going to be by the end of this decade. But when you look at all the best capabilities of the top game engines, look at all the work being created for top movies in the film industry, all the work of all the car makers and of all the other storytellers and creators of all different kinds of games, and envision what the world is like when all of that comes together into a socially connected united economy which everybody can participate in, that's going to be a whole new world. And that's what we're very excited about."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/sweeneystephenson" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full interview</a> is packed with loads of interesting insights from Sweeney, along with Neal Stephenson, the author who coined the term metaverse in his book Snow Crash.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-start-date-leaks-and-rumors/2900-5569/" data-ref-id="2900-5569">rundown of Fortnite Chapter 5, including the start date, leaks, rumors, and more. </a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/16/xbox-360-blades-interface-returns-as-dynamic-background-ahead-of-digital-store-closure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>The Xbox 360 digital store <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/08/17/the-xbox-360-store-is-shutting-down">shuts down later this month</a> on July 26. Amid a wave of price reductions and other end-of-life updates, nostalgic fans can relive the console's earliest days via a new dynamic background modeled after the old “Blades” interface.</p>

<p>For those too young to remember or didn’t get an Xbox 360 until years later, the Blades interface was the console's first dashboard design. It was the first thing players saw from the console’s launch in 2005 until it was updated to an entirely different interface in 2008. Navigating it felt smooth as butter, and some diehards still believe it's the best UI of any Xbox console.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although it's less detailed, and you can’t flip through the Blades of this dynamic background and hear that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZYhri2tsM4">satisfying “whoosh” sound</a>, it’s nice to see Microsoft acknowledge the 360's like this. Here’s how you to make the Blades your Xbox background:</p>

<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">Press the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Navigate to Profile &amp; system &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Personalization &gt; My background &gt; Dynamic backgrounds.</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Choose Xbox 360 Blades under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Select the background art you want using the A button.</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/focus-entertainment-release-statement-on-space-marine-2-leak/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/focus-entertainment-release-statement-on-space-marine-2-leak.928899/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/focus-entertainment-release-statement-on-space-marine-2-leak/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/full-dev-build-of-warhammer-40000-space-marines-2-leaks-online/">a dev build</a> of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 appeared online. It was a relatively finished build, with minimal assets missing and just some placeholder assets instead. It was fully playable, and binaries were available to allow for co-op. Since the release of this dev build, Focus Entertainment has come out with <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1813264114988294223/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> to speak on the issue.</p>
<p>Focus Entertainment has expressed its gratitude for the love and support from the community eagerly awaiting the release of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Additionally, they have requested that anyone who comes across the dev build doesn't engage with it. If they have or do choose to engage with it, they have politely asked that they do not spoil the game for those who want to go into a fully polished version of the game.</p>
<p>The dev build that went live is said to be roughly a year old by the time Space Marine 2 officially releases. While it is tragic that the dev build was released, it spells good news for those waiting for the official launch, as it means that the game will be significantly more polished and have much more content than was in the dev build.</p>
<p>Luckily, for those who are dodging spoilers from the dev build, you won't have to wait much longer. The official release date for Space Marine 2 is September 9, where players will experience the fully polished game and uncover many secrets that Focus Entertainment has been trying to keep concealed.</p>
<p>At the moment, it doesn't seem to be known who leaked the dev build, whether it was someone from Focus Entertainment or an outside source. According to the tracker where the dev build was uploaded, over 500 people downloaded it to play for themselves. Combining this with the footage that has been uploaded of the Space Marines 2 dev build, it gained way more traction than anyone would have thought.</p>
<p>Since the gameplay videos gained traction, they have been removed from YouTube. Several attempts have been made to re-upload the gameplay footage, but they have all been removed quickly.</p>
<p>Focus Entertainment's last message in the statement was to ask people not to look into the dev build nor spoil the game for those excited. "Space Marine 2 will launch on September 9, and the best way to support our teams' hard work is to play the game as they've always intended."</p>

You can buy Caliber from the in-game store in packages that range from the lowest of 250 to the highest of 5,750. The more you purchase, the more expensive the package.

To access this method, you must upgrade the free Battle Pass to the Premium Battle Pass, which unlocks additional rewards not included in the free Pass. And one such reward you’l;l unlock every few levels is more Caliber. If you’re going to spend money on Caliber for anything, start by trying out the Premium Battle Pass.</p><figure id="" data-id="0353e48dff5c326458af656e1924ea38" data-recommend-id="image://0353e48dff5c326458af656e1924ea38" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shot of the game's store shows the battle pass rewards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen shot of the game's store shows the battle pass rewards." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nexon / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0353e48dff5c326458af656e1924ea38" data-recommend-id="image://0353e48dff5c326458af656e1924ea38" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shot of the game's store shows the battle pass rewards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Caliber rewards deal out small denominations of 25 Caliber per reward level, but it adds up if you complete the entire Pass.
