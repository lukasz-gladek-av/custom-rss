<p>FaZe Clan’s representatives have taken to social media to reveal a rebrand that includes giving the organisation a new logo for the first time in years. It’s not a <strong>huge </strong>change, but it’s a reworking of one of the most recognisable images in content creation and competitive gaming.</p>



<p>Along with the new logo is a fresh ‘FaZe Camo’, a new stylisation of the name, and a fresh colour palette.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-year-new-faze">New Year, New FaZe</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/FaZeClan/status/1874532461608411160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On social media</a>, the FaZe team posted a series of images uncovering the new organisation’s iconography, including a gaudy ‘distorted’ camouflage that will be applied to everything from company branding to merchandise:</p>



<figure><figcaption>This isn’t a glitch, that’s the camo print created by FaZe Clan</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a short video uploaded by FaZe Banks, the organisation’s CEO, the reasoning behind the overhaul was explained. He showcased a transparent, behind-the-scenes look at group chats established to discuss and plan the rebrand, highlighting why certain creative decisions were made.</p>



<p>To ring in the new year, the organisation, which has been through many tribulations of late, posted a video looking back on the recent history of the brand, stating: ‘New Year, New FaZe. Bigger Than Ever.’</p>



<div><article><p><span>New Year, New FaZe. Bigger Than Ever.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Beyond the rebrand, nothing else has been confirmed for 2025. There are high expectations for the organisation, which has taken some huge leaps forward in the last few months since the control of the company was handed back to the ‘OGs’ that founded it.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-transition-bug-fixed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/latest-escape-from-tarkov-update-fixes-%E2%80%98transition%E2%80%99-bug.1072407/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-transition-bug-fixed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has rolled out a sudden update in Escape from Tarkov, patching a few issues in the game. One of the most major changes is a fix for the bug that was causing players to ‘transition’ between maps with enemy players, understandably causing quite a stressful situation upon loading into the next raid.</p>



<p>To answer the issue, BSG temporarily switched off transitions, blocking a few tasks and longer raids from taking place. Now, in a snapshot update, the team has fixed this issue – and a dozen others.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-free-to-move">Free to Move</h2>



<p>The ability to transition in Escape from Tarkov is a relatively new feature. It was added a few months back, and it allows players to jump between maps almost seamlessly, logically continuing their raid and pushing into a new environment to keep up the action. It’s the foundation for many of the game’s newest tasks, too.</p>



<p>When the latest wipe hit Tarkov, transitions went awry, with many players encountering a bug that saw them transition with enemy players. The moment they loaded in, all hell broke loose and they started gunning each other down, prompting Battlestate Games to lock the feature down.</p>



<p>In a recent post <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1874583477141536818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a>, the team at BSG confirmed that the following fix has been applied to Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed all known issues where players transitioning between locations could enter a raid with players outside their group</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, the following adjustments have been made:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player has been teleporting in place without being able to move in any direction on various locations</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where kills from Aklys Defence Velociraptor .300 Blackout did not count towards progress of Punisher. Part 2 quest</li>



<li>Reduced the sales limit for 7.62x51mm BCP FMJ rounds to 100 (120 for owners of The Unheard Edition) per restock</li>



<li>Harris “S-BRM 6-9” bipods moved to Skier LL2</li>



<li>BT10 V8 Atlas Bipods moved to Mechanic LL2</li>



<li>NVG-57E night vision device added to Prapor LL1</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates for barter items in the pockets on Scavs and player Scavs</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates and conditions for armour and armoured rigs on Scavs and player Scavs</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates for ammunition on player Scavs</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates for backpacks on Scavs.</li>
</ul>



<p>The changes have been coming thick and fast since Escape from Tarkov wiped just under a week ago. Many have attributed this cadence to the Unity engine upgrade performed by Battlestate Games alongside the global reset event.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/will-gta-6-be-delayed-history-tells-us-it-will/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With 2025 finally here, one big question is on everybody’s mind: is 2025 the year we finally get a GTA 6 release? Outside of the wild fan conspiracies we saw in 2024, it’s been relatively quiet for GTA 6 since its initial reveal in December 2023, with no official announcements from GTA developer Rockstar Games. It’s led to many rumours and rumblings that GTA 6 has already been internally delayed, with a delay announcement rumour to be coming soon.</p>



<p>The biggest and latest rumor of a delay came in September 2024, with the lack of official announcements seemingly making the rumor more valid. It eventually prompted Take-Two Interactive to squash the rumor in its Q2 earnings call in November 2024, which was the most significant amount of information we received since the game’s initial announcement. At least at the time of the earnings call, the publisher confirmed that the game was still to launch in Fall 2025.</p>



<p>At face value, Take-Two’s comments are reassuring, but history has told us that Rockstar Games tends to postpone its games, and it won’t be the first time that Take-Two has had to adjust its financial forecasts due to such a delay.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-history-of-delays">A History of Delays</h2>



<p>Rockstar Games’ last two major title releases, GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 saw significant delays from their initial announcement to their final release date.</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2, Rockstar Games’ latest major title saw two delays from its announcement trailer to its final release. Announced on October 18, 2016, the game was initially planned to be released in the second half of 2017 but eventually released on October 26, 2018, with Rockstar Games saying that the game needed additional development time for polish.</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 saw a delay, too. From its planned Spring 2013 launch, the game would eventually launch in September 2013. Although it was a small delay, Rockstar Games asserted that it was needed due to polish. In fact, it’s been a recurring theme for Rockstar Games in the past 15 years, with almost every one of Rockstar Games titles, from GTA 4 to the original Red Dead Redemption, seeing delays. While GTA 6 has yet to meet the same fate, it isn’t difficult to imagine that Rockstar Games will continue its trend, especially in the games industry’s current climate. </p>



<h2 id="h-take-two-s-packed-lineup-in-2025">Take-Two’s Packed Lineup in 2025</h2>



<p>It’s already been widely discussed, but another point to consider is Take-Two’s already-packed lineup for 2025, even without a GTA 6 release. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, Civilization 7, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-mafia-the-old-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, and annual releases like NBA 2K and WWE 2K make 2025 arguably one of Take-Two’s most stacked years of all time, and that’s without what will be the biggest game release in the past decade.</p>



<p>So why is having its most stacked game release lineup ever an issue for Take-Two? Well, unfortunately, it boils down to revenue and investor expectations year-over-year. Investors expect continuous growth, and piling so many big releases into one year could be an eyebrow-raising decision for investors, especially if Take-Two’s 2026 lineup is on the weaker side of big game releases. Of course, we all know that Take-Two’s money-maker will be GTA Online for GTA 6, but if that will come on launch or not is currently unclear.</p>



<p>But from a purely financial point of view, would Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country sell millions more copies if GTA 6 is delayed into 2026? It’s a question that investors will likely be pondering. While a GTA 6 delay will undoubtedly cause Take-Two’s share price to fall by a few percent, Take-Two’s financial year will still be strong, and with the prospect of GTA 6 having a cemented release date, its share price will continue to rise.</p>



<p>Although I think that Take-Two will ultimately let Rockstar decide if more polish is needed, it’s certainly a point to be raised that this is, at its core, a business, and GTA 6 is going to make the company billions over the years to come. An additional six-month delay isn’t the end of the world for Take-Two, and if the extra polish is needed, well, I don’t mind waiting a bit longer, either.</p>

                <p>One of the best feelings in a roguelike is when the pieces all come together to create a perfect run. In Hades it's a powerful combination of powers, in Dead Cells it's a perfect set of weapons, and in Balatro it's all about getting the right combination of Jokers. With the right set of Jokers, a run in Balatro can feel almost easy at times. You have so many Joker effects happening that the game starts to speed up the animations and your score catches on fire because you aren't about to just win the round--you are about to blow past it, making the score you need to reach seem trivial in the process.</p><p dir="ltr">These runs are amazing in Balatro and in other roguelikes, but that's because it's not how every run goes. In fact, that's how very few runs usually go. Most runs in Balatro, including many of my winning runs, have me barely beating out each round with my final hand. Every shop or bonus for skipping a blind becomes deeply important, because I need another boost in chips or multiplier; otherwise my run is about to crash and burn. This scrappiness is what makes Balatro special, and there are multiple mechanics that let you take some of the chance out of these runs, making it just as viable to fight tooth and nail to win a run as it is to break the game entirely with your build.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Balatro lets you control your fate (mostly)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413185-balatrojokerlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4413185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413185-balatrojokerlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4413185"></a><figcaption>Balatro's iconic Jokers can drastically change how each hand plays out.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413185-balatrojokerlarge.jpeg"></figure><p>While it's not uncommon for roguelikes to allow you to influence the powers or weapons you might receive in a run, Balatro consistently provides you the opportunity to make risk-versus-reward assessments. Each ante has three blinds, two of which can be completely skipped. You won't earn any money or get to visit the shop, but you will get something else. Sometimes it's as simple as a pack of cards to add to your deck, or it can guarantee a Joker of a certain rarity or with a specific bonus type. Importantly, the reward is never a specific Joker--only certain modifiers or rarities. There is never any point where you can guarantee yourself the exact Joker you need, which puts an emphasis on working with whatever Jokers you do get.</p><p dir="ltr">One of my favorite decks to run is the Plasma deck, which combines and then averages your chips and multiplier whenever you play a hand, turning 50 chips with a two multiplier into 26 times 26. While that might sound like it's easier to win a round--and it certainly is the first ante or two--this deck also doubles your target score, making it much harder to hit. A quick way to run up your total using this deck is by drastically increasing your chip total, since that number can be easier to inflate compared to the multiplier.</p><p dir="ltr">That means a foil Joker, which automatically adds 50 chips to each played hand, can offer a pretty big increase to your score in the short term, even if the Joker itself doesn't work with a run. A guaranteed foil Joker is one of the rewards that can appear for skipping a blind, offering what is essentially an easy way to keep a run alive. Even if the Joker's effect doesn't help your build and you might have to dump it later, it can still get you through more rounds, which means you have more chances to get the right items in the shop.</p><p dir="ltr">This sort of influence over your rewards, however small, is incredibly important in Balatro because it's a game about math. In an action-focused roguelike, you can make up for a few bad rolls with skill, so long as you have the skills to dodge or parry consistently. By contrast, you can't win rounds of Balatro through pure skill--you have to work with the materials offered to you. This design feels purposeful, based on other aspects of how the game works.</p><p dir="ltr">When you reach a new ante, Baltro presents you with a ton of information. You can see exactly what you need to score in all three blinds to win, what your rewards are for skipping either of the first two blinds, and what the special condition is in the third blind. You might not know exactly what's going to be in the store, but you do know there will be two packs, two card slots that could be Jokers, Tarots, or Planets, and a voucher. You also have a pretty good idea of how much those items all cost, and how much money you will win for each blind beaten.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this information is important, because it allows you to make decisions based on both the short-term and long-term impacts of each item. Sure, the first Joker in the shop might not be one you want long term, but any amount of multiplier can help. A foil Joker adding 50 chips could be a huge boost right now, even if the Joker itself is focused on straights when you're building around two pairs. Even as you move up the stakes and the game becomes harder and more complex, with the addition of eternal Jokers that can't be sold or destroyed or perishable Jokers that stop working after five rounds, having this information lets you put together scrappier runs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413186-balatrootherlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4413186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413186-balatrootherlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4413186"></a><figcaption>It's not uncommon to have strange Joker combinations early in a Balatro run.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413186-balatrootherlarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">What you can do with this information and the small amount of influence Balatro offers you is the ability to adapt. The limitation on how many Jokers you can have at once makes runs more dynamic. It's common in roguelikes, especially deck builders, to have no limit on powerful items like Jokers, with their power stacking on top of each other. The catch though is that you typically can't get rid of these items easily. While you might have a limited number of slots for Jokers, you are rarely stuck with one, letting you dump any conflicting Jokers in an instance, allowing greater flexibility. The Joker that gains one multiplier when you play a hand but loses one when you discard might sound good at first, but if you find yourself needing to discard to play the hands necessary to win, you can easily dump it for something else at the next shop.</p><p dir="ltr">These runs don't sing the way that the game-breaking ones do, where you score so much that it starts getting displayed in exponentials instead of numbers. Despite that, they do feel just as satisfying, albeit in a different way. Overcoming a rough start, bad Joker rolls, and special blinds that feel targeted at your specific build is its own kind of magic, creating the kind of run that makes up most of my time playing Balatro. It's much easier to let yourself have just one more run when you always feel like you can throw together a combination of Jokers and cards that is just good enough to get by, instead of your run crashing because you didn't get the perfect combination of items.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this comes together to create a roguelike experience where I never feel compelled to abandon a run. Every run feels like it can succeed, right down to the moment where the game over screen appears and even in that moment, I'm sure I could have had it if I had if I had made better choices. That feeling makes it easy to immediately boot up another run again and again, which is perhaps the highest compliment you can give a roguelike.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for January 2025 have been announced, and Sony has chosen to start off the new year with… well, with Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Also some games that weren’t commercial and critical flops.</p>

<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 7th January.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/"><strong>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</strong></a> (PS5)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-remastered-review/"><strong>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered</strong></a> (PS4)</li>
<li><strong>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</strong> (PS5 | PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most celebrated game here is The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe, a game that’s all about&nbsp;office worker Stanley discovered all of his co-workers had disappeared and wandering around to try and figure out what’s going on. All his actions (as controlled by you) are narrated by the Narrator, voiced by Kevan Brighting, in humourous ways as Stanley encounters weirder and weirder scenarios. The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe expands upon the original game with more content, choices, and secrets. The graphics have also been updated to take advantage of newer technology. It’s a brilliant game and well worth playing, whether for the first time or revisiting over a decade on from its original 2013 release.</p>

<p>Another game from the remaster/remake pile is Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered. This was the first game in the series helmed by Criterion, and it really showed off that studio’s arcade racer chops in style. Back in the day on PS3 and 360 it was only at 30fps, but with the remaster, the game’s running at a much better feeling 60fps.

<p>And that brings us around to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Released after years of delays, it failed to hit the heights of Rocksteady’s Batman: Arkham series. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/">Suicide Squad review</a>, Gamoc said, “Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a perfect example of how live services can sap all the energy out of a game experience. The story, the character and gameplay all range from good to fantastic, but the missions grow stale before too long, the loot system’s few bright spots are tarnished by the chore of everything else you earn, and the story and characters all but evaporate once you reach the endgame.”</p>
<p>The game was one of the biggest flops of 2024 – probably neck and neck with Sony’s own Concord – and has recently been included in Steam sales for just £3, while Warner Bros. and Rocksteady have confirmed that its seasonal content will be ending <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/">as soon as its pre-announced 1 year content roadmap has completed</a> with an update in mid-January. On the positive side of things, they’re patching in an offline mode, and PS Plus subscribers will be getting the game at its most content-filled…</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the December 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab December’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 7th January, so make sure to grab them while you can! They are:</p>

<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance is the newest free game on the Epic Store. The medieval RPG can be redeemed between today and tomorrow at 13:00 BRT.</p>



<p>This is the perfect way to get hands-on with the franchise before Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 arrives on February 4, 2025.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/pt-BR/p/kingdom-come-deliverance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Redeem here -&gt; Kingdom Come: Deliverance on the Epic Store</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>As the second game will serve as a sequel to the story of Henry, the protagonist, having prior knowledge of the story and gameplay systems are key aspects to getting the most out of Warhorse’s new game.</p>



<p>Check out the plot for the first game:</p>



<p><em>“Thrust into a raging civil war, you watch helplessly as invaders storm your village and slaughter your family. Narrowly escaping the brutal attack, you grab your sword to fight back. Avenge the death of your parents and help repel the invading forces!”</em></p>



<p>The game is widely regarded as the perfect game for anyone who loves the Middle Age. Unlike traditional RPGs, Kingdom Come provides a more immersive experience that comes slightly closer to a simulator, even though it’s not one.</p>

<p>The PS Plus Essential games for January (2025) <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">have been revealed</a> and, well, there was certainly a better way to start the year. The three games awarded to subscribers in the lowest tier are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</li>



<li>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered</li>



<li>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-the-games-from-ps-plus-essential-january-2025">The games from PS Plus Essential: January 2025</h2>



<p>The list certainly isn’t going to fill anyone’s eyes, after all, we’re talking about one of the biggest flops of 2024 and two old games. The games will be available starting January 7th.</p>



<h3 id="h-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-ps5-nbsp"><strong>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League | PS5&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Take down The Justice League yourself in single-player or team up with friends in multiplayer co-op in this genre-defying, action-adventure third-person shooter from Rocksteady Studios, creators of the critically acclaimed Batman: Arkham series. Featuring an original narrative set within an expansive open-world city of Metropolis, the game puts the four DC Super-Villains on a collision course with an invading alien force and DC Super Heroes who are now laser-focused on destroying the city they once vowed to protect.</p>



<h3><strong>Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered | PS4&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Feel the thrill of the chase and the rush of escape in Need for Speed Hot Pursuit. Unleash a savage sense of speed both as an outlaw and a cop in the world’s hottest high-performance cars. Outsmart the heat or take down lawbreakers with the tactical weaponry at your disposal in a heart-pumping, socially competitive racing experience. Updated with enhanced visuals, cross-platform multiplayer – including the asynchronous competition powered by Autolog – plus all additional DLC content, this is the ultimate edition of Criterion Games’ critically acclaimed Need for Speed debut. It’s time to reignite the pursuit.</p>



<h3><strong>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe | PS4, PS5&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is an expanded re-imagining of the critically acclaimed, award winning indie game The Stanley Parable from 2013. Everything that was in the original Stanley Parable is here, preserved just like it was back in 2013. But The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe also dramatically expands the world of the original game with new content, new choices, and new secrets to uncover. The labyrinth has just gotten bigger. In addition, the game has been visually upgraded to reflect modern technology while faithfully preserving the tone of the original game. Accessibility features have also been added to the game, including localization of in-world text, colorblind options, and content warnings. And just as before, the impeccable voicework of Kevan Brighting will accompany you every step of the way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-games-coming-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Happy new year! Welcome to 2025, and congratulations for living through yet another complete rotation around the giant firey gas ball we call the sun. The start of a new year is as good a time as any to take a look at what games are currently on the horizon, so here are the biggest game releases of 2025 that we know about right now!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">January 2025</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/dynasty-warriors-origins-biggest-games-2025-1734608245107.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On January 17, Tecmo Koei’s flagship musou series returns with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dynasty-warriors-origins"><strong>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</strong></a>, its first full-fledged entry since 2018. It will, of course, take full advantage of current gen hardware to flood your screen with enemies that you can plow through while yelling the titular battlecry, “DIE, NASTY WARRIORS!” It'll be available on PS5, Xbox Series consoles, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you prefer to make warriors die in nasty ways from really far away, on January 30 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sniper-elite-resistance"><strong>Sniper Elite: Resistance</strong></a> continues the long-running and long-range gratuitous-Nazi-castration-simulator series. This latest installment doesn’t seem to be shaking up the formula too much, but it’s hard to complain about that when the formula involves shooting the private parts off of fascists. Did I mention you can shoot Nazis in the junk? Because you can. That’s on all the Xboxes and PlayStations, plus PC.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">February 2025</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-biggest-games-2025-1734608337081.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Well, none of the above, but it is technically a bohemian rhapsody - <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii"><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</strong></a> picks up where the first sprawling historical RPG left off, continuing the adventures of Henry of Skalitz, a poor boy with no need for sympathy. And while KCD2’s immersive and historically grounded simulation of 14th century Bohemia is by no means easy come or easy go, the deep role-playing mechanics and massive open-world means you can take Henry any way the wind blows. Doesn’t really matter to meeeeeee. That’s on current gen consoles and PC, launching February 11.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like simulated history on a much larger scale and even larger timeframe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii"><strong>Sid Meier’s Civilization 7</strong></a> drops that same day. When a game franchise has had 7 installments over three decades, it really shouldn’t need much in the way of introduction, but in a nutshell: you’re in charge of seeing a society and guiding its progress through history by Exploring, Expanding, Exploiting, and a 4th X word as needed, which unsurprisingly, can get a bit complicated. That’s out for basically everything, including Linux, but excluding mobile - but that’ll probably come later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 14, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows"><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</strong></a> sends Ubisoft’s flagship open-world series into the much-requested setting of feudal Japan. If you can’t decide if you’d rather be a ninja or a Samurai, we have great news: this one lets you do both, thanks to its dual protagonists. That’s on current gen and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re feeling lonesome on Valentine’s day, there’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/date-everything"><strong>Date Everything!</strong></a>, a sandbox dating simulator where you may in fact be able to date an actual sandbox - and if not, there’s 100 other anthropomorphized inanimate objects with which you can become romantically involved, from the windows to the walls - or the floor, anyway - and they’re all fully voice acted. That’s on PS5, Xbox series consoles, Switch, and PC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/monster-hunter-wilds-biggest-games-2025-1734608417854.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Monster Hunter Wilds</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 18, Obsidian’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed"><strong>Avowed</strong></a> hits Xbox series consoles and PC. This is set in the same fantasy universe as the studio’s isometric Pillars of Eternity games, but this time offers a whole new point of view thanks to its first-person perspective and realtime action combat. It may look like Skyrim, but don’t expect an epic timesink - the devs have said it’s more comparable to their previous sci-fi RPG, The Outer Worlds (which takes around 40 hours to do the main quest and sides), which is great news for anyone who sucks at finishing games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of timesinks, if you think it’s time to sink some ships and terrorize the high seas, well you’re in luck because <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii"><strong>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</strong></a> is… well, I feel like the title really covers its bases there. This’ll see Goro Majima, the fan-favorite foil and frenemy to the series' usual protagonists, taking the wheel - somewhat literally - after he gets amnesia and decides to explore a new career as a pirate. Classic Majima. That’s on the Xboxes, PlayStations and PC on February 21.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pirate Yakuza actually moved its release date up a week to get the hell out of the way of one of the biggest games of the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a>, which comes to Xbox Series, PS5 and PC on February 28. Again, it's one of those series that requires little introduction, especially after how many new players got hooked on Monster Hunter World last gen. With Wilds, Capcom is aiming to refine and improve the core experience in a way that satisfies longtime fans and newcomers alike, but also introduce new features that take advantage of current hardware to keep things interesting. Oh yeah, and it also needs to be accessible enough to attract more new players - so, if you’re wondering why this game has taken so long… that might have something to do with it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">March 2025</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/split-fiction-biggest-games-2025-1734608469506.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Split Fiction</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On March 6, it’s time to buddy up for another co-op adventure from Hazelight, the studio behind It Takes Two and A Way Out. This time it’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction"><strong>Split Fiction</strong></a>, which sees a sci fi and fantasy author getting stuck in virtual reality and undergoing a bunch of bizarre adventures, including but not limited to getting turned into pigs who are subsequently turned into hot dogs and cooked on the grill - though the hot dogs are still playable. Best of all, buying one copy lets two people play online together. That’s on PC and current gen consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On March 25, you can experience the upper-middle-class corner of upper-Middle-earth with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game"><strong>Tales of the Shire</strong></a>, a cozy life sim that focuses entirely on ordinary hobbit life. You know, for regular hobbits who just like to garden and smoke pipes and drink brandy and have petty rivalries over trivial neighborhood bullshit, not going on long hikes to throw jewelry into volcanos. Honestly, sounds lovely. Be a shame if this Shire were to be ruthlessly scoured by ruffians in the thrall of Saruman. Anyway, that’s on PS5, Xbox series consoles, Switch, and PC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/atomfall-biggest-games-2025-1734608548699.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Atomfall</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d prefer to explore a version of the Shire-like pastoral English countryside that’s been doused in radioactive particles, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/atomfall"><strong>Atomfall</strong></a>, which as you’ve hopefully put together is taking some cues from Fallout - though as this one leans a bit more into survival than role-playing, I’d say the Stalker influence is also pretty strong. Plus, this is also showing an alternate future in which a major real nuclear disaster went a whole lot worse. That’s coming to everything but Switch on March 27.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To me, DNF has always been short for “Did Not Finish” or “Duke Nukem Forever,” (which they probably shouldn’t have finished.) But to a few million people, it’s shorthand for Dungeon &amp; Fighter, the multimedia universe stemming from the 2005 South Korean multiplayer beat-em-up that was released stateside as Dungeon Fighter Online. In any case, that universe gets a little bigger with the single-player action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-first-berserker-khazan"><strong>The First Berserker: Khazan</strong></a>, which hits the Xboxes, PlayStations and PC on March 27 as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On March 28, the potential Sims-killer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/inzoi"><strong>Inzoi</strong></a><strong> </strong>hits PC, another South Korean joint which is hands down one of the prettiest video games I’ve ever seen. If this one delivers, I could very easily see it being one of the biggest games of the year. Something tells me that after 11 years, 12 game packs, and 17 expansions for The Sims 4, Sims fans might be in the market for something new and different. And there are <em>a lot</em> of Sims fans out there. That’s on PC at launch, with current gen console versions in the works for later.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">April 2025</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-biggest-games-2025-1734608667320.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On April 24, Fatal Fury gets its first new game this century with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves"><strong>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</strong></a>. And while Terry Bogard, Mai Shirunai and company have kept busy with appearances in other fighting game series like King of Fighters, Street Fighter, DOA, Tekken and Super Smash Bros, this’ll be the first mainline Fatal Fury since 1999’s Mark of the Wolves. Hopefully it’s worth the wait - that’s on both PlayStations, Xbox Series, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of writing this article, those are all the major games that have official release dates. But that's not every game slated for 2025 - there’s plenty more that we’re expecting over the coming year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo and Switch 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">By April, we’ll almost definitely know when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know"><strong>Nintendo’s next console</strong></a> will be released, but as of right now we don’t even know what it’s officially called. Nintendo has announced that details will be revealed sometime before the end of March 2025, and based on some leaked product listings for third-party accessories, there’s some speculation that it’s targeting a summer release window. Again, this is completely unconfirmed at this point, but it makes sense. The original Switch was revealed in October 2016 and went on sale the following March, and the organic buzz generated by gamers and early adopters made it a must-have item by the time the holidays rolled around.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/01/switch-time-to-buy-1714545882432.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Will Nintendo's successor to the Switch launch in 2025?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever this new thing is called, it’ll launch with at least a few games. The original Switch had about ten games available on day one, which sounds underwhelming until you remember one of them was The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Another dozen or so games were released over the three month “launch window” following the Switch's release. Bear in mind, a lot of people were skeptical of the Switch at the time of its launch, including publishers who’d been burned by the Wii U. The Wii had been such a hit that there was initially a ton of support for its successor, and the Wii U’s launch lineup was almost three times the size of what was out for the Switch on day one. Considering the Switch has outsold the original Wii by almost 50 million units, and is currently the third best-selling console of all time, it’s safe to assume that a LOT of publishers will want to get in on the ground floor for whatever’s next - so I have a hunch there’ll be a lot of Switch 2 games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a couple bigger Nintendo games we’re expecting to drop this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond"><strong>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</strong></a> was basically just a logo for the better part of a decade, and presumably it’ll actually be a video game at some point in the near future, which is exciting. That’s coming to Switch, but I wouldn’t be surprised if that was one of the big flagship launch titles for the new console, as well - and even if it’s not, the new hardware is supposedly backwards compatible, so I’m sure plenty of people will be playing it on there either way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong></strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a"><strong>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</strong></a> is slated for 2025, which is another entry in the open-world action RPG side-series - Pokémon Legends Arceus took some big swings, but it also made the Switch show its age in some places, so hopefully that can benefit from more powerful hardware - or at the very least, improve on the groundwork laid by Arceus.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Grand Theft Auto 6</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/17/screenshot-445-1705507701395.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Theft Auto 6</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A rising tide raises all ships, and new Nintendo hardware will definitely help keep the games industry afloat a bit, but the other big 2025 release that’s sure to make some waves is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><strong>Grand Theft Auto 6</strong></a>. I don’t need to tell you how much excitement there is for this game. GTA 5 is the second best-selling game of all time, and after a twelve year, three console generation wait, people really, really want to see what Rockstar does next with its signature series. I'm calling it right now: it’ll probably be the best-selling game of the decade, and almost definitely the best-selling game of 2025 - assuming it does in fact come out in 2025. It’s worth noting that practically every major Rockstar release, GTA and otherwise, has been hit by a delay or two. So, fingers crossed we get GTA 6 on time, but also, ya know, expect disappointment and you’ll never be disappointed. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">TBC 2025</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/11/ss-b63fda5d26ec95f8e12d78f5d23cb19484c73bf5-1920x1080-1731327995850.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now it’s time for the big huge pile of games we’re expecting at some point in 2025, but which don’t have specific release dates yet. This makes it really hard to figure out what order to put them in, and also chances are by the time you’re reading this list a few will have been given release dates or maybe even delayed a year. So just keep in mind this is all subject to change in some way and please don’t be mad at me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hideo Kojima fans are eating good in 2025, or at the very least, eating snakes. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater"><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</strong></a>, the full modern remake of the fan-favorite third entry in the tactical espionage action series, will be coming to current gen consoles and PC. While Hideo Kojima has had no involvement with it (aside from directing the original) it seems like a lot of care is being taken on Konami’s part to not fuck it up. This showed up in a PlayStation promo that dropped last January showcasing big 2024 releases, and a November 17 release date was briefly leaked by GameStop, but was apparently that was all inaccurate. Nontheless, it <em>seems </em>like we’ll be getting it sooner than later. That’ll be on PS5, Xbox Series consoles, and PC.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">PlayStation Games 2025</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/04/ghostofyotei-historialdetails-blogroll-1728055835122.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ghost of Yotei</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Kojima’s next big thing is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach"><strong>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong></a>, which drop anchor on PS5 at some point in 2025, and will presumably wash up on PC, Xbox, and maybe even Mac and iOS later on, if the first game’s rollout is anything to go on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other big PS5 exclusive we know about right now is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei"><strong>Ghost of Yotei</strong></a>, Sucker Punch’s next open world Samurai game. While many games target fall release windows, Sony has the tendency to drop major first-party games earlier in the year. For instance, Ghost of Tsushima was a July release, The Last of Us Part 2 and Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart were both June releases, and God of War 2018 was an April game. Saying that, God of War Ragnarok came out in November, so go figure.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox Games 2025</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/09/gppjsauwcaar3dw-1717955347068.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fable</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s been playing stuff annoyingly close to the chest, but we have a better idea of what Xbox has in the works. There’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fable"><strong>Fable</strong></a>, which is dusting off the beloved fantasy RPG series from a few console generations back. This time Playground Games has been given the keys and taken the wheel, if you’ll pardon the expression. Playground is the studio behind the Forza Horizon series - as in, that’s literally all they’ve publicly done, so I’m dying to see their spin on an RPG. I don’t give a shit about racing or cars and can barely drive one in real life, but I somehow sunk 120 hours into Forza Horizon 5 - so if they can make me enjoy something I don’t care about that much, I’m dying to see how they handle an epic fantasy game with wizard stuff and fart jokes and large frogs. That’ll be on Xbox Series consoles and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another game that probably involves some other large swamp creatures and magic is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-of-midnight"><strong>South of Midnight</strong></a>, which is a southern gothic fantasy action-adventure from the studio behind We Happy Few. That’s hitting PC and Xbox Series consoles.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/09/screenshot-2024-06-09-135501-1717959501795-1717970052853.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Doom: The Dark Ages</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey you know what game looks hella sick? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages"><strong>Doom: The Dark Ages</strong></a>. I want to specifically call out that gun that grinds up skulls and shoots them at stuff, because that is <em>so metal</em> it’s just hilarious. And there’s also a shield with sawblades on it, and you can ride a dragon - and Doom guy has a little fur coat? I just love what they’re doing over there at id Software, and each new iteration feels like a more evolved form of the shit I was angrily scribbling in the margins of my math homework in fifth grade. Obviously that’ll be coming to PC and Xbox Series consoles but it’s also going to be on PS5 as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Xbox-published games coming to PS5, you can expect <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle"><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</strong></a> to finally make its way its way to the console with a circle button in the spring. And speaking of Xbox-published games based on Disney-owned intellectual properties, there’s also chance we’ll see Arkane’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blade-arkane"><strong>Blade</strong></a><strong> </strong>game at some point in 2025. That is admittedly a big if - game development is arguably an even slower and more difficult pursuit than ice skating uphill, so I wouldn’t be surprised if the daywalker doesn’t see the light of day until 2026.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Multiplatform Games 2025</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/20/marvel-1943-1710952738469.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Marvel 1943: The Rise of Hydra</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And hey, Blade is not the only Marvel game in the works - there’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra"><strong>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</strong></a>, which is slated for 2025. This is from Skydance New Media, the studio being run by Amy Hennig, who you may know for her work on Uncharted, Legacy of Kain, or Michael Jordan Chaos in the Windy City. This game will see Captain America teaming up with the Black Panther during world war 2 - specifically, Azzuri, who’s the grandfather of T’Challa. This isn’t to be confused with the other Black Panther game being developed by Cliffhanger Games, which seems like it’s probably a lot further out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A bunch of long-awaited sequels or otherwise new installments in established series are dropping in 2025. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4"><strong>Borderlands 4</strong></a> is the first numbered entry in Gearbox’s looter shooter since 2019, and hopefully a new game generates more interest than that movie adaptation did. That’s on new gen and PC. If you prefer grindrails to loot grinds, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/skate"><strong>Skate 4</strong></a> is finally expected to enter early access this year - though they actually dropped the number entirely. It's just Skate now. It's cleaner. Before you get too excited, thogh, it’s worth noting it's going to be a free-to-play live service title published by EA, so adjust your expectations accordingly. Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crazy-taxi-new"><strong>Crazy Taxi</strong></a> is getting a similar treatment, and Sega’s arcade/Dreamcast classic is being reinvented as an open world MMO. There have been some rumors it’ll drop in 2025. At least one of these games better have The Offspring on the soundtrack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like sand, well, get excited because we got a couple literal sandboxes on the horizon. There’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dune-awakening"><strong>Dune: Awakening</strong></a>, the survival RPG based in Frank Herbert’s spicy sci-fi universe - or rather, on the titular planet of Arakkis. Then, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert"><strong>Crimson Desert</strong></a>, the single player action game set in the universe of Black Desert Online. Based on all the trees and greenery, Crimson Desert doesn’t actually seem to take place in a desert, but maybe it’s more of a state of mind.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/eldenring-nightreign-01-4k-1734054366417.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Elden Ring Nightreign</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, one game that’s set in the opposite of a desert is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/subnautica-2"><strong>Subnautica 2</strong></a>, which will surface in early access in 2025. It’ll have been over a decade since the first game entered early access, and it’s attracted its share of admirers since then, so hopefully the sequel floats their boat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you prefer stacking the deck to swabbing it, there’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/slay-the-spire-2"><strong>Slay The Spire 2</strong></a>, the follow-up to the hit roguelike deckbuilder that debuted way back in 2017. If you’d rather slay some big scary monsters and whatnot, there’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hell-is-us"><strong>Hell is Us</strong></a>, which looks like a soulslike, but the jury’s out on whether or not it actually is. It is a third-person game with melee combat and exploration that’ll probably be a good diversion for Soulsborne fans waiting around for whatever arcane fuckery FromSoft is currently cooking up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey would you believe I started writing this article before The Game Awards had aired? Because as it just so happens, the arcane fuckery FromSoft has been cooking up on is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign"><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign</strong></a>, a standalone co-op multiplayer roguelike game due out relatively soon. Basically, it’s swapping the plodding grind of the main game for a more streamlined dash to gather runes and gear on a remixed and shuffled map of The Lands Between that gets even freakier when the sun goes down. Oh, and there’s also a rapidly shrinking circle of acid rain to contend with - or <em>ring </em>if you will. So, yes, it’s a little bit Fortnite - but also clearly something else entirely. As much as I love how FromSoft has gradually refined that core Soulsborne experience, this feels like a direct response to the creative ways players have been approaching their games - you know, doing speed runs with DDR mats, or beating the game without jumping or levelling up or whatever, or making mods where every enemy has been replaced by Malenia and stuff like that. Not sure if it’s something I will personally enjoy playing, but I’m dying to see what other people do with it. That’s coming to all the PlayStations, Xboxes and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bioshock fans have been waiting for a new installment even longer than GTA fans, and while it might not be an official entry in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/judas"><strong>Judas</strong></a><strong> </strong>is very clearly a spiritual successor, and it’s being overseen by Ken Levine, the man who first took us to Rapture and Columbia. We’ll supposedly be seeing that in 2025 at some point - and of course, there’s also the possibility that 2K unveils an official <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bioshock-next"><strong>Bioshock</strong></a><strong> </strong>as well, which we’ve been hearing rumors about for a cool minute now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of GTA, if you think Rockstar’s open world crime epic has too much twerking and Tiktok and you’d like your crime a bit more organized, there’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country"><strong>Mafia: The Old Country</strong></a> - this looks to be expanding on the Olive Garden’s core philosophy of “When you’re here, you’re family” in a big turn-of-the-century Sicilian sandbox. Look for that on new gen and PC sometime this summer. Capisce? </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/outerworlds2-blogroll-1734053829914.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Outer Worlds 2</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like silly first-person RPGs in space with realtime combat and an Arabic numeral 2 in the title, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2"><strong>The Outer Worlds 2</strong></a> is exactly that, which is coming to Xbox series and PC. If you like serious isometric RPGs in fantasy realms with turn-based combat that faithfully recreates D&amp;D’s 5th edition ruleset and a Roman numeral II in the title, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/solasta-ii"><strong>Solasta II</strong></a> is also exactly that, which is coming to PC and probably consoles at a later date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you thought No Mans Sky had too much sky and not enough mans, well, Hello Games has been hard at work on their next ridiculously ambitious project, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/light-no-fire"><strong>Light No Fire</strong></a>, which swaps the deep-space interplanetary exploration for a fantasy realm you can wander around. Oh, and this fantasy realm just so happens to be set on a planet that’s literally the size of <em>Earth </em>(as in, the big rock you're currently living on), which is still a very large place. If you don’t believe me, go play Flight Simulator. Or just go outside, whichever. Light No Fire’s currently only listed for PC. Oh and hey, if this game isn’t everything you hope it is at launch, maybe give it a minute. If No Man’s Sky has proven anything, it’s that Hello Games will deliver in time, so don’t send death threats if there aren’t enough dragons of something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re light on zombie parkour games and dying for a new one, well, great news because <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light-the-beast"><strong>Dying Light: The Beast</strong></a> is a standalone adventure set in Techland’s undead universe which is slated for a 2025 release as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If dying stuff makes you sad and you’d prefer a game with a whole bunch of immortals, you’re also in luck - is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/33-immortals"><strong>33 Immortals</strong></a> enough? If three’s company, thirty three co-op players is a crowd, but that’s what’s going on in this chaotic multiplayer roguelike from the studio behind Spiritfarter and Jotun. That’ll be on Xbox and PC at some point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might have noticed that we haven’t really covered any remasters or re-releases, which was deliberate, but we’re making one exception for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lunar-remastered-collection"><strong>Lunar Remastered Collection</strong></a>, which dusts off and polishes up the Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete and Lunar 2: Eternal Blue, which originally released on the Sega Saturn almost 30 years ago. Why are we making this exception? Because Lunar is the all-time favorite game of Amanda Medina, who produced the video version of this article that you can see at the very top of the page. When you produce these videos, you can bend the rules and pick the games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Long Awaited Games That Might Drop in 2025 if We're Lucky</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/ark-2-biggest-games-2025-1734609056332.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ark 2</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a handful of games that may come out someday, but which have been getting kicked down the road so many times that it’s sort of a boy who cried wolf situation. In one case, somewhat literally, with Telltale’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-wolf-among-us-2-a-telltale-series"><strong>The Wolf Among Us 2</strong></a>. That was announced back in 2019, and last we heard it would be out in 2024. But it wasn’t, so maybe it’ll come out in 2025. Or maybe it won’t come out at all! Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ark-ii"><strong>Ark 2</strong></a> was revealed in 2020, and it initially had a 2022 release date, but it obviously didn’t hit that. And finally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2"><strong>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</strong></a> was originally supposed to be out in early 2020. I did an interview about that game at E3 2019, which feels like a lifetime ago at this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of lifetimes, we’re not getting any younger, so I’m gonna call it there. And yet again, let me emphasize that these are by <em>no means</em> all the games coming out in 2025. And I guarantee you at least one of the games I mentioned will <em>not</em> come out in 2025. If you want more comprehensive and up to date updates on what’s coming out, we make videos about what games are releasing monthly. The second I finish writing this, I’m gonna get started on the script for January’s big games, so keep an eye out for that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, also, if you really want to stay up to date on what’s coming out, go check out <a href="https://playlist.ign.com/" data-cy="styled-link">IGN Playlist</a>. It’s like Letterboxd or Goodreads, but for video games. It has a dedicated app where you can keep tabs on what you’ve played, what you’re playing, and what you want to play someday. Thank you to Logan, who manages the huge database of games that IGN Playlist pulls from. Every time a new game gets announced, he has to update it, and I think this year’s game awards may have killed him. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Trailblaze Mission in Amphoreus will be released in two parts across eight versions, from 3.0 to 3.7, making it the largest story arc in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> to date. This update brings not only new world storylines but also multiple maps and rich gameplay features waiting to be explored. Get ready to embark on the “Hero’s Journey” with new playable characters—Aglaea, The Herta, and the Trailblazer: Remembrance!</p><p>Leaving Penacony the Planet of Festivities behind, the Astral Express embarks toward Amphoreus under Black Swan’s guidance, seeking both to replenish Trailblaze Fuel and uncover the mysteries of this celestial body. From the outside, Amphoreus appears as a chaotic vortex, its existence impossible to detect or understand. Similarly, its inhabitants remain completely unaware of the outside universe. Unlike other worlds, they do not know of the concept of “Aeons,” instead worshiping deities known as “Titans.” According to legend, twelve Titans created Amphoreus: Three who wove fate, three who shaped the heavens and earth, three who molded life, and three who brought calamity. In Amphoreus, gods and miracles are tangible existences rather than mere myths. Yet this realm’s history is steeped in tragedy. In ancient times, the arrival of three Titans—“Strife,” “Death,” and “Trickery”—sparked a civil war among the gods. Soon after, a mysterious force known as the “black tide” swept across the world. None know its origins, but all life touched by it loses sanity, with even the mighty Titans proving vulnerable. Over millennia, between the black tide gradually consuming Amphoreus and the gods waging endless war, the world fell into eternal night. Now, in humanity’s final sanctuary—the Holy City of Okhema—only the protection of Kephale, the Worldbearing Titan, stands as the last barrier against the black tide.</p><p>The Astral Express, arriving as an unexpected force from beyond this world, is destined to change the course of Amphoreus’s fate. Upon entering Amphoreus, the Trailblazer and Dan Heng first descend into a region known as the “Abyss of Fate.” Legend says three Titans—Time, Passage, and Law—once wove here the threads of time, space, and rules that would govern Amphoreus, determining the fate of all creation. Now this land lies in eternal night, with only emptiness echoing through its grand architectural remains. As the story unfolds, the Trailblazer’s group will return to the Abyss of Fate, pierce through the mists, delve deep into the temple, and finally gain audience with Oronyx, the Titan of Time. Through this encounter, the Trailblazer embarks on the Path of Remembrance, gaining the ability to “draw strength from the past.”</p><p>Meanwhile, players will meet a new companion who, due to their mysterious origins and tendency to only make “Mem” sounds, is temporarily named “Mem.” Beyond their adorable appearance, Mem plays a crucial role in combat. The Trailblazer can summon Mem during battles, where it gradually charges Energy. Once fully charged, it provides Mem’s Support that allows a designated character to immediately takes action and deal additional True DMG, turning the tide of battle. Together with Mem, the Trailblazer will surely overcome the various challenges that await in Amphoreus.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Following the winding path beyond the Abyss, players will reach Okhema, the Holy City built into the mountainside. Bathed in the eternal dawn light of the Worldbearing Titan’s protection, this city will serve as a crucial base for the trailblazing expedition through Amphoreus. Among its most distinctive landmarks stands the Marmoreal Palace, a grand baths. More than just a place for bathing and relaxation, it functions as the city’s heart, a public gathering space fostering daily social connections among residents. In these times of eternal night and chaos, Okhema, sheltered under the Worldbearing Titan’s protection, remains humanity’s final sanctuary and beacon of hope. Local legend tells a romantic tale: Kephale shall one day open their eyes, leading humanity to triumph over the black tide and forge a new world. From beneath this holy city, a group of human heroes known as the Chrysos Heirs embarks on a quest for flame, shouldering the mission to reclaim the twelve Titan Coreflames and restore Amphoreus to glory. In future stories, the Trailblazer will join their journey, fighting alongside the Chrysos Heirs in this legendary expedition.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_936700"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Trailblazers will also have a chance to explore the unique city-state of Castrum Kremnos. It was named after the Blade of Fury that dangles high above the city, and it is also where the Strife Titan resides, thus making it the place where the seventh Coreflame slumbers. In the second half of the Trailblaze Mission, players will borrow the power of the Oronyx to return to the past and experience Castrum Kremnos during its golden age. There, they will discover one of the mechanisms the Trickery Titan Zagreus left behind: The Hand of Zagreus. This mechanism can be used to lift heavy obtains, pick up items, smash open pathways, and obliterate enemies easily in special circumstances. It serves as a major aid to exploration. During this time, the players will enter Castrum Kremnos alongside the Chrysos Heirs and travel through the ruin stronghold to face the fallen and maddened Strife Titan in battle to take back the Coreflame of Strife.</p><p>Version 3.0’s last map is the starting point for the entire world of Amphoreus: The Vortex of Genesis. This is the grand sanctuary for the 12 divine Titans, and it is also the prophesied place where the Miracle of Genesis occurred. Every time a Chrysos Heir overcomes a Titan and takes its Coreflame, they will return the Coreflame here. In the void, every constellation that is lit represents a journey walked by one’s predecessors. The long Flame-Chase Journey has already undergone centuries of tribulations, with much work done, and the remaining labors require the Trailblazer to work hand-in-hand with the Chrysos Heirs to accomplish.</p><p>Version 3.0 will also invite two new and powerful 5-star characters to join the player’s teams. The first is the esteemed#83 member of the Genius Society, an Emanator of Erudition: The Herta. Since Herta first debuted, she made a deep impression via her unique Herta puppets and idiosyncratic behaviors on the space station. It is said that her true self resides in a place on the Cosmos’ edge, and she rarely reveals herself to others. It is only today that she has finally shown herself. The Herta is an Ice-Type Erudition character that is skilled at AoE DMG. In battle, she can apply Interpretation on enemies, and ally characters attacks can also further apply Interpretation. With the increase of Interpretation stacks, The Herta’s abilities can increase powerful hits of DMG based on their high Interpretation stacks on specific targets and multiple enemies besides. Additionally, The Herta’s Ultimate can also Transfer the highest Interpretation stacks to Elite or stronger enemies, before dealing Ice DMG to all enemy targets. </p><p>The second character making her debut is Aglaea from Amphoreus. She bears the divine authority of “Romance,” and is one of the earliest Chrysos Heirs to embark on the Flame-Chase Journey. As Okhema’s dressmaster, Aglaea isn’t just a legendary hero of Amphoreus, but she is also a major figure in recruiting new Chrysos Heirs to embark on the world-saving journey after the Flame-Chase Journey was interrupted prior. As the first limited 5-star Remembrance character, Aglaea can summon her memosprite Garmentmaker in battle to fight alongside her. They demonstrate a duet dance aesthetic in combat. Additionally, through their cooperation, Aglaea and her Garmentmaker can synchronize attacks on enemies. This new joint attacking mechanism not only increases the Garmentmaker’s SPD, and also adds a new layer of rhythm and variability to combat, allowing an exquisite dance for two to unfold at a charming cadence.</p><p>In addition, in the first half of Version 3.0, there will also be a special Warp event. Limited 5-star characters Lingsha, Feixiao, and Jade will be making reruns. In the second half, the 5-star characters Boothill, Robin, and Silver Wolf will also be making a limited return. These characters will serve stronger reinforcements, walking side by side with Trailblazers to embark on a journey across Amphoreus. Aside from this, March 7th will gain a Preservation outfit. It can be claimed after unlocking the “Characters” function and logging in during the Version 3.0 period.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,617 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,060 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

After several months of updates and new characters being added to the game's roster, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasonal-updates-ending-with-offline-mode-coming-soon/1100-6528327/" data-ref-id="1100-6528327">its final season went live in December 2024</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit/" data-ref-id="5000-78253">Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit</a> is widely regarded as one of the best entries in EA's racing game series, and its remaster, released in 2020, added several neat enhancements.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-lives-again-thanks-to-krafton/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed down</a> Tango Gameworks alongside Arkane Austin, Alpha Dog Games, and Roundhouse Studios (the latter was actually rolled into ZeniMax Online Studios), the industry did not hide its displeasure.</p>
<p>The Japanese developer didn't deserve such a fate, especially after delivering the universally acclaimed rhythm action game Hi-Fi Rush, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-wins-navgtr-goty-marvels-spider-man-2-and-hi-fi-rush-win-7-and-6-prizes-respectively/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won several awards last year</a>. On Wccftech, the game earned a 9 out of 10 score from reviewer Ule Lopez:</p>
<p><em>Hi-Fi Rush is a fantastic game that combines two very popular genres and makes a wonderful and innovative game with a low skill floor but a high skill ceiling. The game is both accessible to newcomers to rhythm games and very challenging for veterans looking to be tested in several other areas that don't necessarily have to do with just rhythm games. The combat is varied, the combos you learn are great to execute, and the music is a joy to listen to. Overall, a great success.</em></p>
<p>It was even more baffling because Microsoft had previously stated they wanted to add more Asian developers to their first-party roster. Regardless, it was not the end for Tango Gameworks, as PUBG maker Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swooped in</a> to acquire the studio and the Hi-Fi Rush intellectual property. In September, Krafton CEO Han 'CH' Kim said they know a sequel probably wouldn't sell a lot due to being a niche genre, but they would still try to do their best for fans.</p>
<p>Today, at the dawn of the new year, Tango Gameworks has r<a href="https://x.com/TangoGameworks/status/1874259495783981205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">esumed social media communications</a> with the following message to all its fans:</p>
<p><em><strong>A New Start </strong></em><br>
<em>Tango Gameworks studio has been reborn as Tango Gameworks Inc., proudly joining KRAFTON Inc. </em><br>
<em>We're excited to continue crafting games that bring joy to players around the world. </em><br>
<em>Thank you for your continued support as we embark on this new journey!</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, the Japanese studio previously also released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-evil-within-review-lackluster-horror-forgotten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Evil Within</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-evil-within-2-good-not-scary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Evil Within 2</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghostwire-tokyo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghostwire: Tokyo</a>. Those franchises have stayed with Microsoft for now, but they don't appear to be&nbsp;used for the time being. As such, it's not inconceivable that Tango might ask for the license at some point in the future, though the current focus is undoubtedly on Hi-Fi Rush 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare-has-hit-one-million-sales-in-early-access.1072116/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-early-access-one-million-sales/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Gray Zone Warfare, the realistic tactical shooter (with extraction elements), continues to turn heads since entering early access in April 2024. It launched to a boom that saw the game sell 500,000 copies in just four days, with many players familiar with games like Escape from Tarkov getting in on the action.</p>



<p>Since being released in early access, Gray Zone Warfare has maintained a steady course, with developer MADFINGER Games working to polish the product and push out a major update, Night Ops. Recently, the team confirmed that the game has sold one million copies – and a further 500,000 ‘edition upgrades’ have been secured.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>MADFINGER transitioned into the tactical shooter space a while ago, producing Gray Zone Warfare in April 2024 as the fruit of its labour. The game is years in the making, and it offers an unparalleled open-world tactical shooter experience, casting players into the dangerous, fictional world of Lamang and forcing them to survive against all odds.</p>



<p>It was one of the best-selling games on Steam in 2024, where it’s exclusively available. The ongoing performance of the title allowed it to hit the one million sales milestone relatively quickly, notching up the number just eight months after launch. That’s not bad going for a game with no pre-existing fanbase made by a company new to the genre.</p>



<p>I sat down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with MADFINGER’s CEO at Gamescom</a>, learning about what’s next for the game. He has preached multiple times that the game is ‘only 20% finished’ and that there’s plenty on the horizon, and being privy to some of those plans, I can say for sure that there’s a lot in the pipeline for this tactical shooter.</p>



<p>If you’re not enjoying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-flea-market-locked-for-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest Tarkov wipe</a> or if you want a more unique extraction experience mixed in with a persistent world, unbound by timers, then check out Gray Zone Warfare – you won’t regret it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-pictures-leaked-on-the-web/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Unsurprisingly, the first leak of the year is related to the Nintendo Switch 2. Three pictures of the upcoming console's motherboard have allegedly leaked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hqu83a/switch_2_motherboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>The memory appears to be SK Hynix LPDDR5 48Gbit. The leaked images also show NVIDIA's logo, which is again entirely expected given that previous leaks all pointed to the Nintendo Switch 2 once again being powered by NVIDIA hardware. More specifically, it will use the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tegra 239 System-on-Chip (SoC)</a>, which is based on the Orin SoC family. The CPU has eight cores and 12x ARM Cortex-A78AE cores, while the GPU, based on NVIDIA's Ampere architecture, includes 2048 CUDA Cores. The hardware reportedly supports Deep Learning Super Sampling Super Resolution and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ray Reconstruction</a>, the latter's inclusion confirming hardware ray tracing support.</p>
<p>According to previous leaks, it won't feature built-in Frame Generation. However, several console games have shipped with AMD FSR Frame Generation, and on PC, it is possible to mix DLSS Super Resolution with FSR Frame Generation. We might see that again from some developers making Nintendo Switch 2 games as a way to extract more performance.</p>
<p>DLSS Ray Reconstruction might be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-superiority-ray-reconstruction-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only real advantage the hardware has over PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X</a>. Otherwise, experts concur that the new console will be much weaker than even the Series S, and it is rumored to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-4k-30-fps-only/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited to 4K resolution and 30 frames per second when docked</a>. Then again, it's nothing new for Nintendo fans - the last competitive console in this regard was the GameCube, which also flopped pretty hard from a sales standpoint.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hqu83a/switch_2_motherboard/">Switch 2 motherboard</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MHN1994/">u/MHN1994</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/">NintendoSwitch2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will once again try to attract a large audience with its seamless combination of handheld and home console that worked so well for its predecessor. The Switch just <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-surpassed-playstation-2s-lifetime-console-sales-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> the lifetime sales of Sony's PlayStation 2 in the United States. Globally, the PS2 is still ahead, but Nintendo's console might get very close before all is said and done.</p>
<p>The increasing pace of the leaks suggests a reveal might be really close. A previous rumor points to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 8 unveiling</a> by Nintendo, while the accessories are <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-launch-on-march-28-says-italian-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be available on the market starting on March 28.</p>

<p>Robin ‘ropz’ Kool has officially left FaZe Clan after three years on the organisation’s Counter-Strike roster. On social media, the superstar competitor penned an emotional message to fans and followers as he departed on amicable terms from FaZe Clan.</p>



<p>The Counter-Strike pro player’s next steps are undefined at present – or at least, they’re unconfirmed to the wider public. Most recently, the 25-year-old player found a second-place finish at the Perfect World Shanghai Major, falling in the grand final against Team Spirit in an emotional series.</p>

<p>Ropz <a href="https://x.com/ropz/status/1874247750922977693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">took to social media</a> to post an emotional message, prompting responses from hundreds of his peers across the industry:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a 12 year old boy who dreamt of being in FaZe. That boy was me. Fast forward a decade, I am proud for not only reaching that dream, but also creating history within it. </p>



<p>Today I am officially leaving FaZe to start another journey. It was an absolute joy and pleasure to represent this team alongside all the amazing people, who became like family to me. Memories for a lifetime, one of the best 3 years of my life. </p>



<p>No words will do justice to how much this meant for me and how special everything was, this was a decision I made against my heart and a part of me will always love this team and organisation. </p>



<p>Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a relatively short time, ropz became one of Counter-Strike’s winningest players, racking up approximately $1.5 million in winnings since entering the scene in earnest with mousesports in 2017. His first big win was at the ESG Tour in Mykonos, Greece in 2017, where he netted a $120,000 prize with mousesports after defeating Team Liquid in a close GF.</p>



<p>Following that win, the player was instrumental in both mousesports and FaZe Clan’s success, storming to victory in the likes of:</p>



<ul>
<li>Intel Grand Slam</li>



<li>PGL Major Antwerp</li>



<li>IEM Cologne/Katowice</li>



<li>Thunderpick World Championship</li>



<li>ESL Pro League</li>



<li>CS Asia Championship</li>
</ul>



<p>Except for a BLAST Premier event, ropz has claimed almost every prize possible in the Counter-Strike space. He has ranked in the HLTV Top 20 Players seven times and has picked up half a dozen MVP awards for his efforts. </p>



<p>And it all began when ropz kickstarted a career as a Call of Duty content creator.</p>

<p>As 2024 came to a close, one final awards ceremony concluded – The 2024 Steam Awards, hosted by Valve. The community-picked winners were awarded their trophies after several days of voting, but for the most part, the awards handed out were mostly predictable.</p>



<p>For instance, Black Myth Wukong secured Game of the Year, after soaring to lofty heights and shattering player count records on the platform earlier this year. It couldn’t be Astro Bot, so why not have Black Myth Wukong pick up the prize?</p>



<p>Read on to see all the winners from The 2024 Steam Awards.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-the-winners-from-the-2024-steam-awards">All The Winners From The 2024 Steam Awards</h2>



<p>Here’s the full breakdown you’re looking for:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Game of the</strong> <strong>Year: </strong>Black Myth Wukong</li>



<li><strong>VR Game of the Year: </strong>Metro Awakening</li>



<li><strong>Labor of Love Award: </strong>Elden Ring</li>



<li><strong>Best Game on Steam Deck: </strong>God of War Ragnarok</li>



<li><strong>Better with Friends Award: </strong>Helldivers II</li>



<li><strong>Outstanding Visual Style: </strong>Silent Hill 2</li>



<li><strong>Most Innovative Gameplay: </strong>Liar’s Bar</li>



<li><strong>Best Game You Suck At Award: </strong>Black Myth Wukong</li>



<li><strong>Best Soundtrack: </strong>Red Dead Redemption</li>



<li><strong>Outstanding Story-Rich Game: </strong>Black Myth Wukong</li>



<li><strong>Sit Back and Relax Award: </strong>Farming Simulator 25</li>
</ul>



<p>Black Myth Wukong cleaned up at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards/2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The 2024 Steam Awards</a>, continuing an award spree that was most recently fuelled by two wins at The Game Awards, hosted by Geoff Keighley early in December. It beat Space Marine II, STALKER 2, Balatro, and Helldivers II to the ultimate prize.</p>



<p>There were some deserving wins here, though. Metro Awakening winning the VR Game of the Year award is a solid shout – it might not be the ‘next game’ in the series that fans were hoping for, but as a standalone VR title, it’s nothing short of stellar and deeply authentic.</p>



<p>Elden Ring’s Labor of Love award was handed out mostly because of Shadow of the Erdtree, which was so popular upon release earlier this year that it became a contender for Game of the Year awards at The Game Awards (and other showcases). </p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption’s Best Soundtrack trophy seems strange when compared to the competition, but it’s a popularity vote at best. It wasn’t a good year for gaming OSTs, it looks like.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/russia-gaming-consoles-putin-cant-compete/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/russia%E2%80%99s-gaming-consoles-can%E2%80%99t-compete-with-xbox-and-playstation.1072095/</guid>

<p>Earlier this year, it was revealed that Putin had ordered Russian tech manufacturers to work on ‘homegrown’ gaming consoles. The goal is for the country to compete against PlayStation and Xbox in the home console stakes, but it seems that things aren’t going as planned. </p>



<p>In a recent update posted by Habr.com, it was stated that the ‘Skolkovo Foundation’, tasked with developing the core foundation of the consoles, is having some technical issues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-something-truly-breakthrough">‘Something Truly Breakthrough’</h2>



<p>In a quote <a href="https://habr.com/en/news/869822/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picked up by Habr.com</a> (and circulated by Tom’s Hardware), it was said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I hope that my colleagues will approach this task with full responsibility and come up with something truly breakthrough. After all, it is obvious to everyone: Elbrus processors are not yet at the stage of development that would ensure equal competition with PS5 and Xbox, which means that the solution must be non-standard.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was a quote taken from Anton Gorelkin, the Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy. His reference to ‘Elbrus’ is a nod to a Russian-developed processor unit. The transparency of the statement confirms that the tech the country has created isn’t yet on par with the hardware created by Xbox and PlayStation.</p>



<p>The Elbrus processor has been pieced together by the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies, but it’s not a patch on the hardware being created by the likes of Intel and AMD. </p>



<p>Gorelkin repeated the desire to create something sovereign, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/putin-russia-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per Putin’s wishes</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This platform should primarily serve the goals of promoting and popularizing domestic video game products, expanding their audience beyond PCs and mobile gaming.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The most recent reports suggest that the Russians are working on two consoles, one a ‘not very powerful’ device and the other a cloud-based streaming-focused unit with a $45 price tag. In a first-look image published just days ago, it was revealed that the $45 unit features an Xbox-styled controller with a small remote and a USB dongle.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/27/12/2024/673f81ca9a79477d7dd76e72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">article by RBC.ru</a>, the goal of the hyper-cheap gaming solution was detailed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The MTS console will operate on the principle of cloud gaming on its own MTS Fog Play system — a platform for so-called foggy gaming. The system was originally designed to allow owners of “weak” computers to play games with high system requirements.&nbsp;</p>
