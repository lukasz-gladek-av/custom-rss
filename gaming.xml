		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/24/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-spin-off-announced-at-tgs/">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> on the horizon, Sega is releasing upgraded versions of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review/">Yakuza 0</a>, Yakuza Kiwami &amp; <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/23/yakuza-kiwami-2-review/">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> on PS5, XSX|S &amp; PC on 8th December. Now they’ve announced that they’re offering them at significant discounts, and even as free upgrades for existing owners of the digital versions of the game.</p>
<p>Sadly this does mean that owners of the games on disc are being left out in the cold, and if the games have been obtained via <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, you also aren’t eligible for the upgrade. There is also the caveat that these are new platform specific releases of each game, so save data does not carry over between versions of the game, and upgrade pricing is only available for purchases prior to 8th December at 8:59AM PST.</p>


<p>With three games, there are three quite different upgrades from last gen to new, and varying fees. Across the board there will be resolution and performance improvements on the newer consoles – Kiwami 2 will now run at 60fps, per<a href="https://faq.sega.jp/hc/ja/articles/52406594943769--NSwitch2-%E9%BE%8D%E3%81%8C%E5%A6%82%E3%81%8F-%E6%A5%B5%EF%BC%92-Switch2%E7%89%88-PS5%E7%89%88-Xbox-Series-X-S%E7%89%88%E3%81%AE%E9%96%93%E3%81%A7%E3%81%AE%E4%B8%BB%E3%81%AA%E9%81%95%E3%81%84%E3%81%AF%E4%BD%95%E3%81%A7%E3%81%99%E3%81%8B"> a Japanese FAQ</a> – &nbsp;but Sega has spent time adding text language localisation for French, Italian, German, Spanish, Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, and Russian.</p>
<p>Yakuza 0 is becoming Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut across PS5, XSX|S and PC, and is gaining the Red Light Raid mode that debuted with the Switch 2 release, and the Bubble theme song that wasn’t in the original western release. For this reason, the upgrade price is £11.99/€14.99, and full game price is £44.99/€49.99.</p>
<p>Yakuza Kiwami’s upgrade is £1.70/€1.99, while the full game price will stay at £15.99/€19.99. This is seemingly a nominal fee to offset the international licensing of the songs&nbsp;Receive You [Reborn] and Bleed that weren’t in the original western release.</p>

<p>Yakuza Kiwami 2 has no additional songs, so the upgrade is free for existing digital owners, and the full game price will also stay at £15.99/€19.99. From a gameplay perspective, this will actually be the biggest upgrade, as the original PS4 release topped out at 30fps, compared to the 60fps of the older game engine in Yakuza 0 and Kiwami.</p>
<p>It’s a generally nice move from Sega to make these upgrades free or low cost, though it is a shame that the largely throwaway Red Light Raid mode from Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut comes with such a premium for that game.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/corsair-void-v2-max-wireless/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/corsair-void-v2-max-wireless-hands-on-%E2%80%93-the-differences-that-actually-matter.1365091/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It’s been a couple of months since I reviewed the original Void Wireless V2, and it’s still the headset I grab when I want something light that just works across everything I own without fuss. Corsair has now launched the Void V2 Max at around $149 (currently on sale for $119.99), and after running the two side-by-side for the last few weeks, the upgrades are clear but not drastic.</p>



<p><strong>Build &amp; Comfort</strong></p>



<p>Physically identical: 303 g, same mesh ear cups, same 90-degree swivel, same flip-up mic. The Max adds slightly denser foam and a bit more padding around the drivers for better passive isolation, enough that background noise fades a touch more in quieter game moments. Everything else (clamping force, glasses compatibility, heat buildup) is the same. If you already like the V2 fit, the Max feels like the same headset with a marginally better seal.</p>



<p><strong>Audio Performance</strong></p>



<p>Same 50 mm drivers on paper, but the Max gets a proper Dolby Atmos tuning pass and a bundled Sonarworks SoundID license. Imaging is wider and more precise, mids are a little cleaner, and the personalised EQ profile from SoundID is surprisingly effective once you run the quick test. The original V2 could do Atmos through Windows or the Dolby app, but it never felt this intentional. Mic quality is effectively identical—clear for comms, nothing special for streaming.</p>



<p><strong>Battery, Charging &amp; Platform Switching</strong></p>



<p>Battery life remains excellent on both (~70 h on 2.4 GHz, 120+ h on Bluetooth). The Max adds proper fast charging: 15 minutes for roughly six hours of use. What still sets the entire Void V2 line apart—and what I genuinely appreciate every single day—is that one dongle and one headset cover PC, PlayStation 5, and now Xbox Series X|S (with the Xbox-specific variant of the Max) without ever touching a switch on the dongle itself. No A/B sliders, no mode buttons, no re-pairing. Plug the dongle into whatever platform you’re on, and it just connects. Then, if you need to hop to your phone or Switch, hold the power button two seconds and you’re instantly on Bluetooth. Hop back to the console or PC and it reconnects to the dongle in under a second. The pairings are permanent; the switch is seamless. The Max is a hair faster on the reconnect, but the standard V2 was already miles ahead of anything else in this price bracket. One headset, one dongle (or none on Bluetooth), zero hassle across Xbox, PlayStation, PC, Switch, phone—whatever. It sounds basic until you’ve lived with competitors that make you choose a platform and stick to it.</p>



<p><strong>Price &amp; Recommendation</strong></p>



<p>The original V2 now sells for $110–120. The V2 Max is $149 (and cheaper during sales). You’re paying the difference for:</p>



<ul>
<li>Properly tuned Dolby Atmos + SoundID</li>



<li>Fast charging</li>



<li>Slightly better passive isolation</li>



<li>Continued best-in-class single-dongle multi-platform support (now officially including Xbox on the dedicated variant)</li>
</ul>



<p>If you already own the V2, keep it—95 % of the experience is identical. If you’re buying new and you bounce between consoles and PC (or just want the cleanest Atmos implementation Corsair has ever shipped in this line), the Max is the obvious pick. Same ridiculously versatile wireless ecosystem, just refined where it counts.Solid, common-sense evolution. That’s exactly what I want from a “Max” version.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Pokémon Company has trademarked the name ‘Celebration Collection’ in Japan, under full English, in the same terms as trademarks have been previously used for set names.</p>



<p>2026 marks the 30th anniversary of the Pokémon franchise, with the history of the TCG likely to be referenced in a special set, and it appears the name for next year’s anniversary set has been unveiled.</p>







<h2 id="h-celebration-collection-trademarked-by-pokemon">Celebration Collection Trademarked by Pokémon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Another anniversary. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Revealed by <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/11/celebration-collection-set-name-trademarked-for-the-pokemon-tcg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokebeach</a>, the trademark of Celebration Collection hints at what a holiday set in mid-2026 could entail, suggesting that a similar path to 2021’s Celebrations may be followed.</p>



<p>Celebrations had a main set of holo cards featuring a 25th anniversary stamp, alongside a subset of classic cards from the TCG reprinted with the same anniversary stamp—including the likes of Charizard, Blastoise, and Venusaur from Base Set.</p>



<p>It’s not clear yet whether a similar approach will be followed in 2026, but it’s pretty much a guarantee there will be an anniversary set of some kind based on Pokémon’s history with previous anniversaries.</p>



<p>In 2016, for the 20th anniversary of the Pokémon franchise, the TCG introduced the Generations set and XY Evolutions, a reprint of Base Set, along with several stamped promo cards featuring the 20th anniversary logo.</p>



<p>No release window for Celebration Collection has been stated, though the standard format for the TCG means it’s likely to come in mid-2026 in English as the second holiday set of the year, following on from Ascended Heroes.</p>



<p>Japan, as always, will see the set released first, but there are several TCG sets on the agenda before Celebration Collection emerges on the scene, with trademarks uncovered for Munikis Zero, Ninja Spinner, Storm Emeralda, and Abyss Eye—expected to showcase the likes of Mega Zygarde, Mega Greninja, Mega Rayquaza, and Darkrai.</p>

            <p>One of the biggest challenges The Chinese Room faced when taking on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> was, simply, the name, and the expectations that came with it. If the game was called Bloodlines 2, players would expect a sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-vampirebloodlines-pc">the scruffy but ambitious - and fondly remembered - Troika role-playing game from 2004</a>. But The Chinese Room, which inherited the troubled project from Hardsuit Labs, knew immediately it wouldn't be able to make that.</p>
<p>"The tricky question around it was Bloodlines 1," Dan Pinchbeck, the game's former creative director, told <a href="https://youtu.be/iyWDyNLAo1E?si=H6x-u7AFGCe4F7Hz">the Goth Boss podcast</a> - "are you making a sequel to Bloodlines 1? We used to sit there and have these planning sessions of how do we get them [publisher Paradox] to not call it Bloodlines 2? That feels like the most important thing we do here, to come at this and say this isn't Bloodlines 2. We can't make Bloodlines 2; there's not enough time, there's not enough money.</p>
<p>"Bloodlines 1 came out at a really interesting period in game development," Pinchbeck went on to say, "at the same time as games like Stalker and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a>, when you could ship a really ambitious game that was full of bugs and holes, was totally flawed, but the ambition was really exciting. And a lot of those games, they're real cult games now, but they really weren't very good when you broke them apart and analysed them. Great ideas, wonderful ideas, players love them, but you couldn't get away with it now.</p>

<p>"Trying to recreate that magic in a different environment felt wrong-headed. No one would be happy. You wouldn't make the people who liked Bloodlines 1 happy, and you wouldn't make the people who didn't know about Bloodlines 1 happy, because they'd never get Bloodlines 2 and they'd always get a flawed game that was built too fast with not enough money."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-pulls-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-from-dev-cans-pre-orders">Paradox pulled development of Bloodlines 2 from originating developer Hardsuit Labs</a> - and a team made up of some of the people who'd made Bloodlines 1 - back in 2021. Hardsuit's version of the game was unveiled to the world in 2019; Martin Robinson saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-a-darkly-fascinating-immersive-sim">a hands-off demo of Bloodlines 2</a> at GDC 2019, and talked to the team making it.</p>
<p>That original version of the game featured a more traditional RPG set-up: a sort of zero-to-hero idea whereby you'd play as a recently turned vampire, who would then rise slowly through the ranks of the Seattle-based vampire society. The Chinese Room's eventual idea fast-tracked that, hemming the game into a more linear action-based shape whereby you play from the beginning as a super-powerful elder vampire. As I discovered in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">my Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 review</a>, the game lacked breadth and character development.</p>
<p>So why not keep the original idea? There's a few points to make here. One, The Chinese Room didn't snatch the project out of Hardsuit Labs' hands. "It was being taken off Hardsuit [Labs]," Pinchbeck said. "That was done and dusted. I know that a lot of people were like, 'How could you take another studio's work?' Nobody took another studio's work - that had already happened. The publisher was going, 'We want to try and keep this thing alive; we want to find a studio.'"</p>

<p>Pinchbeck liked Vampire: The Masquerade, the role-playing game, and it represented an opportunity for The Chinese Room to transition into triple-A game development. "I'd been pitching around a triple-A that I really wanted us to make and we were getting a lot of the 'but your team haven't made a triple-A yet' kind of response," he said, "even though our team was basically made up of triple-A veterans. So I was like, 'Okay, we need a stepping stone.'"</p><p>The Chinese Room was also a studio that had a reputation for producing original games, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dear-esther">Dear Esther</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture">Everybody's Gone to the Rapture</a>, so Pinchbeck was fundamentally opposed to simply finishing off someone else's idea. Before he'd even seen the Hardsuit Labs build of the game, he told Paradox: "The only way we're going to want to do this is if we are able to... We'll take everything that's there and use as much as we can, but we don't just want to finish someone else's game. And if you want someone to finish someone else's game, that's fine, that's just not us. And they said, 'We don't; we want to really pull it apart and put it back together again."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We can't make Bloodlines 2, we can't make Skyrim, but we can make Dishonored"</em> </blockquote>
<p>The final point to make is the project The Chinese Room inherited from Hardsuit Labs was a fractured thing. The engine was dated, ideas were unfinished. It wasn't something that simply needed finishing. "So in some ways it was like working on an original IP," Pinchbeck said. "And you could feel the frustration in the game of a team who were desperately trying to finish something and really make their mark on it. But it had just gone south."</p>
<p>With time and resources against Pinchbeck's team, The Chinese Room made a difficult but understandable choice. "We approached it from that point of view of: what can we do with the time and money that's available? We can't make Bloodlines 2, we can't make Skyrim, but we can make <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>," Pinchbeck said. "And if we look at something that's not an RPG and not a fully open world, but is really tightly focused and true to the mythos, and it's a good ride, we get a Bloodlines title out in the world."</p><p>Only then could The Chinese Room and Paradox potentially look to the future of the IP and to making something that would more closely constitute a proper sequel to Bloodlines 1. "Then we [could] start talking about 'what would the next big Bloodlines game look like after that?', if that happened," he said."</p>

<p>Dan Pinchbeck created a new direction for Bloodlines 2 and wrote most, if not all, of the story for it, but he wouldn't see development through. He left the studio he co-founded in 2023 as a result of intense burnout, it sounds like. "Priorities change," he said, "and you look at things and go, 'This is what's going on outside; I'm killing myself at work, I'm working stupid hours, I'm working seven days a week, I'm trying to keep multiple projects afloat.' The clock was ticking. You leave before you collapse."</p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 was released at the end of October and, even with a tighter, more linear focus, struggled to impress. Generally, it was a hollow-feeling experience, although there were some wonderful characters and performances in it - it wasn't without redeeming qualities. Nevertheless, the game seems to have commercially flopped, casting a fairly impenetrable shadow of doubt over the future of the Bloodlines series.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's to other games, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-new-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-different-to-that-classic-cd-projekt-red-game-in-one-big-way-it-doesnt-have-a-main-quest">the upcoming The Blood of Dawnwalker</a> - a part-human, part-vampire RPG being made by former Witcher developers - we should look instead.</p>

			<p>The sequel to the critically acclaimed soulslike<em> </em>Lies of P will not disappoint players, according to director Choi Ji-won.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/i-will-not-disappoint-you-lies-of-p-director-promises-the-most-fun-as-neowiz-prepares-a-sequel-to-one-of-the-best-soulslikes-ever-made-says-the-overture-dlc-was-treated-almost-as-a-sequel-anyway/">GamesRadar+</a> after winning the <em>"Best Game Expansion"</em> award at The Golden Joystick Awards 2025, the director of one of the best soulslike ever released, not developed by FromSoftware, commented on the future of co-developers Round8 and Neowiz, assuring players that what's in the works will not disappoint.</p>



<p><em>"You can expect the most fun that we can achieve within the game,"</em> Choi Ji-won said, asking fans to <em>"please stay tuned for it; we are working really hard, and I will not disappoint you at all."</em></p>



<p>Although the director did not specifically discuss the sequel, the timing and context of the recent award naturally draw attention to the continuation of the Lies of P<em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> </em>series, rather than <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-making-lies-of-p-sequel-but-also-making-another-new-soulslike-new-narrative-rpg/">the other projects in development at Neowiz</a>. The expansion, released earlier this year, was developed as if it were a sequel, so it will be very interesting to see what the next entry in the series delivers and how it achieves the level of fun Choi Ji-won teased.</p>



<p>The Lies of P: Overture DLC definitely deserved the<em> "Best Game Expansion" </em>award at The Golden Joystic Awards 2025. Although it doesn't feel significantly different from the base game, it masterfully expands its core features to deliver an engaging experience that makes it easy to overlook its sometimes unfair challenge level.

			<p>This morning, the Embracer Group <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-divests-arc-games-and-cryptic-studios-while-several-key-rights-are-retained-within-the-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the divestment of developer Cryptic Studios and publisher Arc Games, which are being acquired by a new company called Project Golden Arc, Inc., thanks to funding from XD Inc. Project Golden Arc, Inc., is owned and led by members of the Arc Games management team. Cryptic Studios is a Californian developer known for MMORPGs like City of Heroes, Champions Online, Star Trek Online, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/magic-legends-missed-the-mark-and-will-shut-down-on-october-31st/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defunct Magic: Legends</a>, and Neverwinter, which just received the new Red Harvest Part II - The Soul Collector module.</p>



<p>The sale is expected to generate net cash proceeds of $30 million for the Embracer Group. Additionally, the parties have stipulated that the Group will maintain the publishing rights for the Remnant franchise, which are being transferred to the internal label THQ Nordic, which already owns the Remnant IP rights and the development studio, Gunfire Games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/darksiders-4-announced-will-feature-all-four-horsemen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently busy with Darksiders 4</a>). </p>



<p>Moreover, the publishing rights of the 'MODA (Multiplayer Online Dungeon Adventure' game Fellowship are being transferred from Arc Games to the Embracer Group's Coffee Stain division, which is expected to be spun off from Embracer and listed on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market in Stockholm, with the first day of trading planned for 11 December 2025. Arc Games will continue to be listed as co-publisher of the game.</p>



<p>Developed by the Stockholm-based studio Chief Rebel, Fellowship was released on PC via Early Access on October 16, 2025. Chief Rebel will continue to develop the game, with a team of around 35 people working towards the full version, which is expected to launch in the first half of 2026. You can read our exclusive interview with the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-hands-on-and-qa-a-game-all-about-mmo-like-dungeons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>Fellowship is currently 20% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> through December 4.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Excitement levels continue to rise for the Pokémon TCG’s Ascended Heroes holiday set, due to release early next year, and more card reveals have emerged in Japan’s Mega Dream ex.</p>



<p>Mega Dream ex is the Japanese version of the Ascended Heroes set, and releases on Friday, November 28, with the majority of the cards included combining with new cards in the Start Deck 100, releasing next month, to create the Ascended Heroes set list—and the biggest chase cards have now been revealed.</p>







<h2 id="h-mega-dream-ex-secret-rares-revealed">Mega Dream ex Secret Rares Revealed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>As reported by the likes of <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/11/mega-dream-ex-secret-rares-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokebeach</a>, Mega Dream ex features 20 Art Rares and a new card rarity, Mega Attack Rare, which are drawn in a comic book style. The Japanese set has English words in the text, while the English set will feature Japanese writing.</p>



<p>The reveal of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-ascended-heroes-release-date-products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ascended Heroes</a> set has already stated there will be “more than 30” Pokémon and Trainer cards with special illustrations, with the set highlighted by the likes of Mega Gengar, Mega Dragonite, and the return of Trainer’s Pokémon that were initially brought back to the TCG in Journey Together earlier this year.</p>



<p>While the Mega Dream ex Secret Rares drop a major hint of what the Ascended Heroes set will include, not every card will be included, with some likely to be pulled to feature as promo cards, and they could be cut entirely and used to increase the number of cards in a future set.</p>



<p>For example, N’s Zekrom is an Art Rare in Japan’s Mega Dream ex, but is featured as the promo card in the Ascended Heroes Elite Trainer Box.</p>



<p>The table below highlights all of the revealed cards for Mega Dream ex, their set number, and the card type.</p>

            <p>Developer 1047 Games has announced Splitgate 2's current beta will come to an end next week. A relaunch for the game will then take place later in the month.</p>
<p>Splitgate 2 released earlier this year, but soon after its debut, the studio and its founder Ian Proulx admitted they had taken the game out of beta too soon. "We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew," a statement in July read. As such, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">the shooter returned to beta</a>, and layoffs were made at 1047 Games.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Now, four months down the line, the studio has plans to fully relaunch Splitgate 2 once again. "Thank you to everyone who participated in the Splitgate 2 Beta," a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/590662508143970096">the game's Steam page</a> begins, before adding:</p>
<p>"On December 4th, the Beta Season and active Battle Passes will be ending, alongside your seasonal 'rank' progress."</p>
<p>While the studio did not provide a date, it said once the beta servers go offline on the 4th December, it will be preparing for the game's relaunch "later" in the month.</p>
<p>"We're excited to share more soon," it closed. You can <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/our-final-beta-playtest">find more information on Splitgate 2's final beta playtest here</a>.</p>

<p>Splitgate 2 has not had a smooth run of things. Along with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-developer-1047-games-lays-off-small-group-of-valued-staff">two rounds of layoffs at 1047 Games</a>, Splitgate 2 was also lambasted by players when the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash">released a cosmetic bundle priced $80 USD, supposedly discounted from $145</a>. In response, the studio slashed it to $40 and reduced prices across the store, pledging to "double down on being community first and listening to you guys".</p>
<p>Will this second go at things be the time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-director-apologises-for-causing-division-following-controversial-summer-game-fest-appearance">Splitgate 2 makes FPS great again</a>? We will see. </p>

			<p>Stellar Blade developer SHIFT UP has announced the signing of a publishing deal with Tencent's Level Infinite for their upcoming game codenamed Project Spirits.</p>



<p>The press release mentions that this will be a cross-platform game developed on Unreal Engine 5 for PC, consoles and mobile. It is being co-developed between SHIFT UP and Yongxing Interactive, an affiliate of Tencent. </p>



<p>This partnership marks the second global collaboration between Level Infinite and SHIFT UP, following the successful global release of GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE. Both companies are committed to achieving even greater synergy with Project Spirits than with their previous venture and, as part of this process, Level Infinite and SHIFT UP have reportedly strengthened their strategic partnership to encompass publishing and joint development.</p>



<p>The South Korean studio's first hit was indeed the mobile game GODDESS OF VICTORY: NIKKE, but it was Stellar Blade that propelled it to global renown. </p>



<p>Last week, SHIFT UP <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the sequel would be a multiplatform release that launches on multiple consoles, unlike the first installment which was published by Sony Interactive Entertainment on both PlayStation 5 and PC. The original game earned a 9/10 score on Wccftech:</p>



<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve off-putting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach has been listed for PC, bringing closer the moment in which you and I can learn why exactly Troy Baker is a glam rocker, why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a> director George Miller (it's not actually him) has a cat demon, and why Turkish-German screenwriter Fatih Akin has become a living doll. Sony have yet to announce the PC version of Hideo Kojima's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> courier fantasy or give it a release date, but the Entertainment Software Rating Board have <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">a page up now</a>. Go on, Sony - call them liar liar, pants on fire.
</p>
<p>Which leads us neatly into the detail of said ESRB ratings page - it warns that you will encounter "a man set on fire in a fantastical manner" in Death Stranding 2. Possibly the man was being deceitful? A social stealth game featuring self-combustion would be neat, actually, and is absolutely the kind of brilliant garbage Kojima would develop. The ESRB further caution that "the word 'f**k' is heard in the game." Well, that's me out. I was already iffy on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-death-stranding-2-trailer-features-a-familiar-bandana-and-a-weapon-to-legally-surpass-metal-gear">the flagrant Snake bait</a>. I don't want to hear not-George Miller swear.
</p>
<p>I found the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> a mixture of unbearable and fascinating, with the balance shifting towards fascinating as I revisited the game after review and made connections between its portering and path-beating mechanics and my own experiences of getting horribly lost in the vicinity of Kettlewell. It was also one of RPS's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-games-of-2020">favourite games of 2020</a>, with Katharine (RPS in peace) calling it "a walking simulator in the very best sense of the word".
</p>
<p>The sequel remains one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">most anticipated games of 2025</a>. There's still time for a surprise end-of-year release. Come to think of it, isn't there some big industry awards show round the corner in December? In other news, Hideo Kojima has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hideo-kojima-has-learned-so-many-ways-to-kill-people">learned so many ways to kill people</a> and we really should hurry up and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/someone-please-just-send-him-up-there-already">send him to outer space</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Envy has become the third major organisation to pull out of Marvel Rivals’ Esports scene, with an announcement stating a decision to pause “competitive operations in Marvel Rivals.”</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals’ Esports scene has grown significantly in the year since launch, with competition including the Ignite Mid-Season Finals in Guangzhou, China, offering a $500,000 prize pool, but the scene has been hit by the departure of major teams in recent months.</p>







<h2 id="h-envy-follows-sentinels-100-thieves-out-of-marvel-rivals">Envy Follows Sentinels, 100 Thieves Out of Marvel Rivals</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Departure. Image via Envy</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a statement on Twitter, Envy’s decision to halt operations in Marvel Rivals Esports was confirmed, but, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sentinels-announce-marvel-rivals-esports-exit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similarly to the Sentinels</a>, the door has been left open for a return in the future.</p>



<p>The statement read: “Today, we’re announcing that we will be pausing our competitive operations in Marvel Rivals. We’re incredibly proud of the effort and passion our roster brought to the game, and grateful for what we were able to build together during our time in the scene.</p>



<p>“As of today, all our players are free to explore new opportunities, and we wish each of them success in what comes next. As the Marvel Rivals competitive ecosystem develops, we hope to see the return of Envy Rivals.”</p>



<p>With Envy, Sentinels, and 100 Thieves all announcing their exit from the Rivals Esports scene, which comes free of the Ignite Grand Finals in Atlanta that culminated earlier this month, there is major uncertainty about the future heading into the second year of Esports competition.</p>



<p>NetEase have not commented on the departures from the Esports scene, but a recent post on the <a href="https://x.com/RivalsEsports/status/1993356509611168183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Twitter account</a> of Marvel Rivals Esports said 2025 was “just the beginning,” and that “in 2026, that spark becomes something even greater.”</p>

            <p>Remember Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2? The Ubisoft game last seen publicly at E3 2017, coming up on seventeen years of development? Well, believe it or not, it's still actively being worked on. In fact, Ubisoft is hiring new staff to work on it.</p>
<p>This is proven by a <a href="https://hitmarker.net/jobs/ubisoft-technical-sound-designer-m-f-nb-beyond-good-evil-2-montpellier-1584708">hot new job listing for a technical sound designer</a> popping up overnight, a role that'll explicitly be working at Ubisoft Montpellier on the infamous sequel. The job description also provides an up-to-date description of what Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 will actually be.</p>
<p>This description reads: "Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is an action-adventure open world game set in a captivating space opera universe and the direct prequel to the 2003 cult classic. Based on a breakthrough technology driven by the proprietary Voyager engine, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 aims to offer a seamless experience of exploration and space piracy across a solar system full of exotic locations, colorful characters and mysteries to uncover, solo or with friends. So, if you are ready for an adventure like no other, come join forces with us to build System 3!"</p>

<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has gone through the ringer when it comes to development, as you'd expect given how long it's been in Ubisoft's oven.  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director">The game got a new creative director last year</a>, with original creator Michel Ancel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2s-troubled-development-due-to-passionate-managers-not-getting-along-says-creator-michel-ancel">saying the troubled development came down to "passionate managers" not getting along</a>. The anniversary edition of Beyond Good &amp; Evil, released last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evils-new-anniversary-edition-content-demands-bge2-is-made">included new cutscenes that further pointed to the sequel's existence</a>. So in spite of all the messiness, there does seem to be a relatively recent push to get this game made.</p><p>Ubisoft has been going through a drastic shift in structure and focus recently. Earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">it established Vantage Studios with Tencent, a new subsidiary that now owns many of Ubisoft's major franchises</a>. Montpellier, and Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, did not move over to this new gaming venture.</p>
<p>Then there's the recent AI push, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-believes-generative-ai-is-as-big-a-revolution-for-games-as-the-shift-to-3d-as-tech-is-embraced-company-wide">with Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot stating that he believes generative AI will be as big a revolution for the video game industry as the leap to 3D</a>. Worth noting is that generative AI software isn't mentioned in this Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 job post.</p>
<p>So there we have it, a sign of life from Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 yet again. Though after a while, one would hope you'd stop seeing signs of life and actual life itself. This decade, hopefully!</p>

The long-in-the-works series is being helmed by Roberto Patino (DMZ, Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Homecoming, The Killing), who will serve as creators, showrunners, and executive producers on the show. Filming is currently reported to be starting next year, in Italy.</p>

<p>According to the official blurb for Netflix's take on Assassin's Creed, the series will be "centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions - one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny".</p><p>Once upon a time, Die Hard writer Jeb Stuart was attached to Netflix's Assassin's Creed project. However, in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-assassins-creed-adaptation-loses-die-hard-writer-jeb-stuart">Stuart stepped away from the series due to differing visions between himself and the show's executives</a>. Meanwhile, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-anime-announced-by-netflix-castlevania-creator">Assassin's Creed anime was announced by Netflix in 2017</a> from Adi Shankar, creator of the popular Castlevania animated series. However, the project ultimately failed to materialise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div data-nosnippet="">
		
		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>Two Bungie leakers have come out publicly to say that Bungie has begun work on Destiny 3. The first to do so <a href="https://x.com/Bungie_Leaks/status/1993425004281639083" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was Bungie_Leaks</a>, a former leaker who stopped posting leaks a few months ago to avoid legal troubles with the developer. However, in this case, they are reposting information that was originally shared by another X user, <a href="https://x.com/starsiza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starsiza,</a> whose tweets are protected (meaning they can only be seen by those who have been approved). Beyond the Destiny 3 rumor, the tweet also mentions that 'something like a Destiny 2 classic game' has been greenlit, which the leaker claims is also the reason the D2 roadmap was recently delayed.</p>



<p>Around five hours later, trustworthy Bungie leaker Colony Deaks/Deakstiny <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993498863764672752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corroborated the report with the following tweet</a>:</p>



<p><em>Yes, Destiny 3 is in extremely early development. Some of you may have seen a tweet early this afternoon that mentioned that. We have been sitting on the info for a few weeks now and wanted to wait to talk about this seeing as it is in such an early state, and it just sucks to see others post about it carelessly for free internet points. We plan to share more info in the coming months as we wait on the larger scale things to develop and take shape. Sit tight.</em></p>



<p>When a follower asked about the other part of the original rumor (the one about a Destiny 2 Classic), Colony Deaks <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993526382517985702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a> that they currently have a lot of info on that front but are still working to confirm it.</p>



<p>Clearly, though, the big rumor here is Destiny 3. It's no secret that Destiny 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been registering all-time low players on Steam</a> after the launch of the Edge of Fate expansion. A couple of weeks ago, Bungie owner Sony even <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-selling-worse-than-expected-sony-records-impairment-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a $204 million impairment loss caused by lower-than-expected Destiny 2 sales.</p>



<p>Perhaps this convinced both the developer and its parent company that the only way to reignite interest in the sci-fi franchise is to create a brand-new installment. Indeed, this seems to be the dominant sentiment within the community, with many former players vowing to only return if and when Bungie launches a new entry.</p>



<p>Granted, this is not the first time we've heard rumors about Destiny 3. The first ones stretch all the way back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-starting-development-destiny-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2018</a>, and then again <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-unveils-prismatic-subclass-destiny-3-leak-seemingly-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year</a>, just ahead of The Final Shape expansion that concluded the ten-year-long Light and Darkness saga. Just a few months later, however, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-was-never-in-development-bungie-will-now-be-run-by-playstation-studios-head-say-insiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that a third chapter was never in development up to that point. Bungie had been working on a different Destiny experience codenamed Payback, with original Destiny creative directors Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy leading, but that got canceled and the two developers left the studio. Bloomberg's report also said that the new strategy was to release smaller 'experience packs'. However, by now it's quite clear that this is not working, which might have forced them to reconsider. </p>



<p>Even if Destiny 3 is now really a thing that's secretly starting to take shape at the developer, it'd have a long road ahead of launch, given the current average triple-A game development cycle. We might not hear anything concrete for three, four, or even five years, so Destiny 2 is likely to keep going for a while longer.</p>



<p>On that note, Destiny 2 is getting the Star Wars-inspired Renegades expansion on December 2, and Bungie has just released a ViDoc and a launch trailer, as covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-destiny-2-renegades-expansion-ahead-of-launch-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pc-version-rated-esrb-published-by-sony/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pc-version-rated-by-esrb-will-be-published-by-sony.1365025/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The PC version of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB)</a> in the United States, suggesting that its launch is near. An official announcement may well come at The Game Awards, Geoff Keighley's show which features both awards for the best games of 2025 but also plenty of announcements for upcoming and existing titles. The Game Awards 2025 airs on Thursday, December 11.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the ESRB rating also reveals that Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be published by Sony Interactive Entertainment on PC, just as it was for the PS5 version. It's a change from the first game, which was published on PC by 505 Games. This is also surprising because Kojima Productions bought the publishing rights back from Sony and could have technically self-published this sequel. However, it may be that the studio doesn't yet have the necessary expertise or resources to self-publish, and as such, they are still relying on their partner, Sony. It'll be interesting to see whether the game ever makes it on Xbox like the previous installment and if so, if SIE will still publish there.</p>



<p>The ESRB rating is M for Mature (17+) with Blood and Gore, Partial Nudity, Strong Language, and Violence highlighted by the board. It's the same rating as the PlayStation 5 version, although that's not a surprise, as the content is likely to be identical.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launched on June 26, 2025, for PlayStation 5, <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-estimated-to-have-sold-1-4-million-units-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling an estimated 1.4 million units in June</a> and earning more widespread acclaim than its predecessor. In the Wccftech review, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is a world of both the familiar and the alien, of trails well-worn yet frontiers to be explored. So much of what made Kojima Productions’ first title such a unique experience is here, with something brand new to explore. Those looking for a comfortable walking simulator to transport goods by food and explore nature have exactly what they’re looking for, while those who come to Hideo Kojima’s works for the off-the-wall narrative and memorable fight scenes will also walk away satisfied with plenty to chat about online.</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-26-899/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s time for a bit of midweek madness; hopefully, your streak can keep up with today’s NYT Connections puzzle! That’s right, I’m here with the latest NYT Connections hints to get you through this midweek lull and keep pushing towards the inevitable weekend. It’s almost the festive window, but for now, we’ll wait to celebrate until you’ve smashed today’s puzzle.</p>



<p>Read on for today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-26">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 26)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #899:</p>



<ul>
<li>CAN</li>



<li>DEB</li>



<li>COULD</li>



<li>JAN</li>



<li>MAY</li>



<li>KAT</li>



<li>MIGHT</li>



<li>SUE</li>



<li>APR</li>



<li>FLOW</li>



<li>CFO</li>



<li>GOD</li>



<li>IRA</li>



<li>MAR</li>



<li>SEC</li>



<li>TAB</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Words that hedge or allow something, often before a main verb.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Common nicknames that stand in for longer given names.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>You’ll see these on statements, filings, and in boardrooms.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Animals that feel a little backwards,</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 26:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-26-899">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 26 (#899)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CAN, COULD, MAY, MIGHT</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DEB, JAN, KAT, SUE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – APR, CFO, IRA, SEC</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – FLOW, GOD, MAR, TAB</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>If you're having trouble keeping up with the successive updates, the studio has now put out a handy blog post of the title's first month in the garden.

<p>"Hey Lawn Legends! It’s been almost a month since PvZ: Replanted sprouted onto your screens, and we’ve been busy tending the lawn ever since.

            <title><![CDATA[Leaker Claims Destiny 3 Is In Development]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-3-possible-leak-twitter-bungie/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/leaker-claims-destiny-3-is-in-development.1364971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a <strong>credible leaker on Twitter</strong>, <strong>Destiny 3 is currently in development at Bungie</strong>. While not much is said, it seems <strong>the project is very early</strong> in the process.</p>



<p>The Destiny series is a much newer franchise, starting in 2014. It received plenty of acclaim for its great FPS gameplay and multiplayer aspects. Then, in 2017, Destiny 2 was released and has become one of Bungie’s biggest games. Even today, the game continues to get new updates and expansions, including with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-star-wars-collaboration-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars</a>. </p>



<p>While it hasn’t been without controversy, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-copyright-lawsuit-destiny-2-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent copyright lawsuit</a>, fans still flock to the titles for a good time with friends for raids and such. Bungie is currently working on Marathon, set to release in 2026, but, as one credible source posted on social media, the company is returning to the space opera once again.</p>







<h2 id="h-destiny-3-in-early-development-claims-credible-bungie-leaker">Destiny 3 In Early Development, Claims Credible Bungie Leaker</h2>



<p>The claim in question comes from <strong>Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Colony Deaks</a></strong>. In previous years, the insider has leaked several Bungie-related information regarding Destiny and Marathon. In <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993498863764672752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the tweet</a>, they state,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yes, <strong>Destiny 3 is in extremely early development</strong>. </p>



<p>Some of you may have seen a tweet early this afternoon that mentioned that. We have been sitting on the info for a few weeks now and wanted to wait to talk about this seeing as it is in <strong>such an early state</strong>, and it just sucks to see others post about it carelessly for free internet points. </p>



<p><strong>We plan to share more info in the coming months</strong> as we wait on the larger scale things to develop and take shape. Sit tight.<a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993498863764672752/photo/1"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite their credibility, <strong>there has been no official confirmation from Bungie</strong>, so <strong>take the leak with a big grain of salt</strong>. It’s also important to note that, since the project is claimed to be in early development, there’s no telling just how far it is. </p>



<p>Sometimes, early development is story building or maybe just even a pitch board. Even still, likely, it’s likely that fans won’t hear much about a possible Destiny 3 for a long time, even if the leak is true. Regardless, it would be nice to see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-mobile-game-destiny-rising-announcement-may-arrive-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Destiny</a> done for newer consoles and with all the new advancements.</p>







<p>What do you think of the Destiny 3 leak? Do you think Bungie is working on it? When do you think it’ll come out? Leave your thoughts down in the comments and in <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>Alongside the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-nes-and-game-boy-library-with-four-more-titles">return of multiple retro games today</a>, Nintendo has rolled out a new update for the Game Boy app on the Switch and Switch 2, bumping it up to Version 3.0.0.</p>
<p>Apart from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/kid_icarus_of_myths_and_monsters">Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/bionic_commando">Bionic Commando</a>, this major update also comes with some cool new easter eggs. If you missed the boot screen of the Game Boy era featuring the 'Nintendo' logo (or 'Game Boy' one) and iconic sound, the good news is it's back!</p>
<p>It works <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/switch-onlines-gba-app-has-been-updated-version-3-0-0">the same as it does on the GBA</a>. Once you've installed the update, boot up the app and hold the left analogue stick, and you'll see the original Game Boy start screen appear. What's also neat is it's different depending on your 'game screen' settings in the app's options menu.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rvkzli&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>So, you'll get whatever screen filter you've got the game screen set to: Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket or Game Boy Color.</p>

<p>One last thing, the sound when booting up the Game Boy - Nintendo Classics app has also been changed from the Game Boy boot up noise to a coin block sound from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a>. If you want to see the boot up of each screen in motion, <a href="https://youtu.be/txjFcpHTmN4">Vooks.net has shared a video</a>.</p>
<p>According to multiple player reports, this latest update has also added the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/psa-you-can-now-remap-nintendo-classics-nes-and-game-boy-controls">ability to remap Game Boy controls</a> in this app. You can find the 'View/Change Controls' setting in the game options menu.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A <strong>PC port of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</strong> has <strong>leaked ahead of any official announcement</strong>. The leak comes from <strong>an ESRB rating</strong>, which has been registered for <strong>Windows PC</strong>.</p>







<p>As one of 2025’s best titles, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-script-was-changed-midway-through-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> continues the legacy of the original 2019 Death Stranding. Crafted by Kojima Productions for PlayStation, the ‘Strand’ game has taken players cross-country delivering packages and building back a broken world. The sequel has garnered much acclaim for its storytelling, music, and direction by Hideo Kojima of Metal Gear fame. At The Game Awards 2025, the title is up for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of the Year</a>, as well as six other categories. While only available for PlayStation 5, it seems it’s coming to PC, if the ESRB is anything to go by.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-pc-port-of-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-has-been-leaked-by-the-esrb">A PC Port of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach Has Been Leaked by the ESRB</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An ESRB rating for Death Stranding 2: On The Beach has emerged online ahead of an official announcement.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As mentioned above, <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official ESRB site</a> has leaked a <strong>Windows PC version</strong> of <strong>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</strong>. No official announcement of a PC port has come out yet, making this a pretty huge leak. Still, until then, take it with a grain of salt. Its rating, M (Mature), matches its PS5 counterpart. The description for its rating also includes some in-depth references, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-esrb-rating-confirms-a-battle-guitar-melee-weapon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the guitar weapon</a> and robotic samurai. As of writing, the page has not been taken down.</p>



<p>The original Death Stranding didn’t go to PC until July 2020, a few months after its first release. With it being rated, it’s likely that Death Stranding 2 is coming to Windows PC sooner than we thought. Interestingly enough, The Game Awards are in two weeks, so perhaps Kojima was planning to reveal it there. Either way, the leak seems rather legit and, if true, means players will get to play one of the year’s best titles in a whole new way.</p>







<p>What do you think of Death Stranding 2’s PC leak? Do you think it’s legit? When do you think it’ll be announced? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cricket 26 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/cricket-26-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cricket-26-review.1364947/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I fired up Cricket 26 for the first time and hopped into a quick five-over game to get my eye in, I was pleasantly surprised by how substantially smoother it all seemed in contrast with the messy launch state of 2023’s Cricket 24. Cricket 26’s lighting and player models all really pop, the inputs feel far snappier, and the fielders all seem like they actually know there’s a game being played – unlike the dawdling doofuses in Cricket 24 who all seemed to stand around with their hands in their pockets. Then my match between the Mumbai Indians and the Delhi Capitals crashed at the change of innings. At which point I reloaded it, and it crashed again. And again. In fact, the longer I played Cricket 26, the more obvious its numerous technical flaws became, to the point that I’d have to say that my experience with Big Ant Studios’ latest has been a bit like playing on a cricket pitch in Perth – the grass looks greener on day one, but it’s not too long before the cracks start to show. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there’s no question that when it works, Cricket 26 presents a much more enjoyable representation of the sport than Cricket 24 was ever capable of. Batting, in particular, feels far more responsive and natural – whether you’re using the arcade-style button controls or the more intuitive dual-stick setup. For the first time in a long time with this series, I feel like I’m able to consistently direct my strokes where I actually intend them to go, unlike Cricket 24 which often felt a bit predetermined in the way I’d keep knocking off-drives straight to the same cover fielder no matter where I aimed or how well I timed it. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cricket 26 Review Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say that scoring runs has become too easy, however, and I’ve found myself playing down the wrong line and getting beaten on the inside and outside edges of the bat, which also feels far more true to life. Even on the default difficulty setting, batting in Cricket 26 has provided an absorbing challenge for the most part. I’m yet to feel the need to dig deep into the menus to painstakingly fiddle with the various timing and physics sliders in an effort to make it feel more realistic like I did with Cricket 24, which takes a lot of the trial and error out of the experience.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bowling, on the other hand, hasn’t changed quite as much but it still feels engaging. I had hoped that the wobble seam delivery would have been added to Cricket 26, especially given that it’s become such a common variation these days that Pat Cummins has basically made it his stock ball, but sadly that’s not the case here – and the floaty knuckleball that a number of Indian pacers have added to their arsenals over the past decade or so hasn’t been included either. However, while the delivery types themselves remain the same, there has been some added nuance introduced in the form of the effect of wind on the ball. An arrow on the edge of the pitch map indicates the direction and strength that a gale is blowing, and that can be used to enhance the amount of swing on a delivery (or if you’re batting, how much further a lofted shot will travel should you aim it downwind). It’s a thoughtful addition that brings some extra strategy to each ball you face or deliver.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Cricket 26 presents a much more enjoyable representation of the sport than Cricket 24 was ever capable of.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s clearly been a lot of work put into player animations too, especially as far as unique bowling actions are concerned. It’s great to see Nathan Lyon’s signature right-handed flick to the side as he leaves the top of his mark, or Mitchell Santner’s shark fin-like front hand carving through the air above his head as he’s about to release the ball. Some of these unique bowling actions aren’t just for show, either – I’ve found facing Jofra Archer to be noticeably more awkward than other fast bowlers, not just because of his speed on the ball but also the way he seems to lumber in so casually before suddenly exploding through the crease. It’s kept me more conscious of making subtle adjustments to my shot timing as the opposing team rotates from one bowler to the next. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, fielding has been substantially overhauled, although certain frustrating quirks still remain. There’s now much less of a delay between a fielder gathering the ball and making a return throw, and there are some new catching animations that see them diving and sliding around in a more agile fashion than they ever did in Cricket 24. However, the slow-motion runout system almost always makes me throw to the opposite end that I intended, and wicketkeeper behaviour is erratic. One moment they’re stubbornly refusing to swipe the bails off during a genuine stumping chance, the next they’re taking a superhuman catch around their ankles down the leg side. Yet, by and large, Cricket 26’s fielders display a level of alertness that more closely resembles the real thing, and it’s nice to see them run in pairs for relay throws or dive towards the rope for a tap-back. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Un-urned</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that it’s been branded as ‘the official game of the Ashes’, you’d think that Cricket 26’s special mode dedicated to the freshly reignited Australia-England rivalry would have been given extra attention from the developers to ensure that it really capitalised on what has been one of the most hyped test series in recent memory. However, there appears to have been about as much thought and effort put into it as England’s approach to batting on day two of the recent first Ashes test. Sure, you do get to play all five test matches in the series in all of the relevant Aussie venues, including a day-night pink ball test at the Gabba, but there really is little else here to distinguish the mode from just building a series yourself using the tour creator that returns from Cricket 24.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are no practice matches to play for the touring side, although given English coach Brendon McCullum’s ‘it will be alright on the night’ philosophy for player preparation, perhaps that’s true to life. Instead, the build up to each of the five matches in the series goes like this: you press a button to travel to the city hosting the match, complete a fairly modest and non-tailorable training minigame that involves bowling precisely three deliveries and a handful of batting strokes, select your final 11 from your squad of 16, mindlessly spam your way through painfully generic answers in a press conference, and then play the match itself. Repeat that four more times and you’re done.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There appears to have been about as much thought and effort put into [the Ashes mode] as England’s approach to batting on day two of the recent first Ashes test.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a team confidence meter to maintain, and optional match objectives to complete as well, but it all feels a bit nebulous. Team confidence fluctuates depending on match results, success or failure in the training minigames, and your responses to press conference questions, but it’s all applied so inconsistently and absolutely none of it seems to have a measurable effect on anything. I failed my first training session and my team confidence took a dive, meaning I went into the opening test at Perth with my Australian team seemingly flagging at 55% confidence. It clearly didn’t make much of a difference, though, since I still ended up smashing England inside three days. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pre-match press conferences are particularly hard to engage with, given that the questions you have to field are often factually incorrect. I kept getting asked about how I felt about securing a draw in a previous match, even though I’d won it, or I’d be asked to reflect on my performance at a certain venue even though I hadn’t played there yet. It feels less like facing a press room full of proper sports journalists and more like being punked by a crowd of teenage TikTok pranksters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Successfully completing optional match objectives also gives team confidence a boost, but these goals seem to veer wildly from the realistic to the ridiculous. In one match I was tasked with scoring 64 combined runs with the tail, which was tricky but ultimately attainable, while in another my objective was to bat at above eight runs an over, which is an insane demand for a test match innings. You could field a team of 11 Harry Brooks and still struggle to score at that rate. You couldn’t field a team of 11 Brendan Doggetts, though, or even a single Brendan Doggett for that matter, given that he’s disappointingly absent from Australia’s Ashes squad in Cricket 26 despite making his international debut last week. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Armchair-man of the Board</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So the Ashes mode is more slapdash than fierce clash, and Cricket 26’s only other new mode of note, the management career, is equally as half-baked. To be honest, I’m typically not one to dabble in the front office side of sports simulations, so perhaps I’m not best equipped to evaluate this series’ first crack at allowing players to run a cricket club. However, after investing several hours into this fairly superficial squad management sim let’s just say I’m unlikely to become a convert any time soon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s just not an enormous amount to it. You don’t get to manage the budget for player salaries, or hire a coaching staff, for example. You basically just pick your team and either play the matches or simulate them, not unlike the existing player career mode minus the training minigames and net sessions in between. It also seems a shame that there’s no option to watch a generated highlights package when you simulate the result like you can in the Football Manager series. Unless you want to be fully hands-on with each match, your only exposure to the team’s performance is via static scorecards and text-based match reports that pop up in your email inbox, which feels pretty dry.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you do opt to play the games yourself, there doesn’t appear to be any management options during a match that make it feel any different to the general gameplay featured elsewhere. You can’t, say, run tactical team instructions out to the middle with the 12th man during a drinks break, or send a substitute fielder on because your ageing opening batsman injured his back playing a golf tournament the day before the game. Strangely enough it also doesn’t seem to factor in the unavailability of players with national team duties either. I was able to steer the NSW Blues to the top of the Sheffield Shield, largely because the likes of Australian test team stars Steve Smith, Pat Cummins, and Mitchell Starc were inexplicably available to be picked for every match of the domestic summer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cricket 26’s management career just feels underdone and, in some aspects, partially broken. You can adjust training schedules for each of your players, like assigning them recovery sessions to reduce fatigue or team bonding sessions to boost their individual morale meters. However, I struggled to really get a feel for the impact of these options given that the training section of the management menu often just completely failed to load. I also encountered a bug that would cause Cricket 26 to crash everytime I tried to finalise my line-up. The irony that the design of Cricket 26’s dedicated management mode appears to have been somewhat mismanaged certainly isn’t lost on me. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The irony that the design of Cricket 26’s dedicated management mode appears to have been somewhat mismanaged certainly isn’t lost on me.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Cricket 26 possesses most of the same feature set as Cricket 24, from the largely unaltered player career mode to the microtransaction-riddled card collecting of Pro Team – with the latter featuring a new mode called Centurian. At the time of writing this just has a ‘Coming Soon’ message posted on it, leaving me completely in the dark as to what it might actually entail. The robust suite of customisation tools for everything from players to bats to stadia remain present and useful, while the actual number of licensed teams stays more or less the same. On the upside, all but one of the 10 IPL teams are now officially included, but on the downside you still need to rely on the talents of community creators to import Indian and South African squads into Cricket 26, and New Zealand’s Dream11 Super Smash competition has seemingly been ditched entirely.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Patches Fix Matches</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In every area in which Cricket 26 excels, though, the shine is regularly taken off it as though it’s been polished with a piece of 60 grit sandpaper pinched from David Warner’s kit bag. It feels exhilarating to setup a batsmen by pushing a few straight balls across him before pulling the trigger on a hooping in-swinger than cannons into his pads, but it’s infuriating to slave away in search of a wicket only to watch a thick edge sail into the keeper’s gloves and have it given not out for no clear reason, with no option to challenge the umpire’s decision (at one point, this happened to me three times in the space of one over). It’s satisfying to swivel-pull a short ball into the crowd for six, but absolutely deflating to hook it down to deep backward square and get caught on the boundary, only to watch the fielder very clearly step on the rope, and still be given out anyway. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I like that matches can now be affected by rain and outcomes can be decided by the Duckworth-Lewis method, but so far my only exposure to it came when I was a mere three overs into the first innings of a T20. Without warning, the game was abruptly called off due to rain and my team was declared the winner – even though I was the only one who’d had a chance to bat. This is not to mention the regular crashes I’ve experienced during the 20 hours or so I’ve invested into Cricket 26 on the PlayStation 5 so far, or the many UI glitches – like the scoreboard for The Hundred that seems to be a placeholder hastily cobbled together in MS Paint. Or the many unrealistic AI behaviours, like bowling a bunch of short stuff in the opening over of a test – or indeed opening the bowling with one of its batsmen. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The shine is regularly taken off it as though it’s been polished with a piece of 60 grit sandpaper pinched from David Warner’s kit bag.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, and as has long since become customary with Big Ant’s cricket games, the in-game commentary is about as accurate as often as a broken wristwatch. I welcome the presence of cricket luminaries like David Gower and Adam Gilchrist to bring their insights to the game, but not when it seems like they’ve been blindfolded and spun around in a circle before they entered the commentary box like they’re playing a verbal game of pin the tail on the donkey. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In spite of these issues, I find myself far more invested in Cricket 26’s future because the core experience out in the field is such a major step up from the previous game that I’m willing to live with the noticeable rough edges. Assuming that Big Ant can stamp out most of the bugs, this could yet turn out to be one of the best cricket simulations the Aussie developer has ever produced. Yet even though the developer does have a track record of providing plenty of post-release support to its cricket games – and there have already been four patches for the PlayStation 5 version in the first week since launch – it’s hard at this point to be confident that it will rectify all of my complaints. As if to justify my slight pessimism, I fired up Cricket 24 this week to compare it side by side with Cricket 26, only to discover that Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett’s facial textures had disappeared completely. I know the English batting order has a tendency to lose their heads, but this is ridiculous – and then my test match crashed before I could even bowl a ball. To be clear, that’s <em>after </em>more than two years of post-launch patching.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/cricket-26-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you've been wondering what's next for the Switch Online's 'Nintendo Classics' service, the November update is now available.</p>
<p>This latest update includes NES and Game Boy titles, with a total of four more games added to the service today. On the NES, there's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ninja_gaiden_ii_the_dark_sword_of_chaos">Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/battletoads">Battletoads</a>, and on the Game Boy, retro enthusiasts can look forward to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/kid_icarus_of_myths_and_monsters">Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/bionic_commando">Bionic Commando</a>.</p>
<p>Switch Online's Nintendo Classics service for Japan has received the same four titles in this week's update. Here's the rundown of each game (via Nintendo's Japanese website):</p>
<h3><strong>Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"This title is an action game for family computers that was released in 1990. A year after Ryu Hayabusa defeated the Evil Demon King and prevented the resurrection of the evil god in the previous work "Ninja Gaiden". The man who was controlling the Evil Demon King behind the scenes, the Fierce Demon Emperor Ashtar, starts moving on his own. In this game, you can climb up and down after being held on to a wall, or attack by consuming ninjutsu power while holding on to a wall, increasing your freedom of action. In addition, the "Alter Ego Technique" appears, in which up to two alter egos appear that follow Ryu and attack at the same time as Ryu. By successfully guiding the alter ego, Ryu's attack range will be greatly expanded."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Battletoads</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"This title is an action game for family computers that was released in 1991. Rush and Jitz, the strongest and most trained frog warriors in the Battle Toad, will defeat a host of enemy monsters, navigate through traps, and rescue Princess Angelica and her fellow Pimples from their rescue. Fight through all 12 stages with a variety of variations, including side-scrolling, vertical scrolling battle action, and high-speed action on air bikes and space boards, using techniques tailored to each stage."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The title is an action game released in 1991 in North America for the Game Boy (unreleased in Japan). A new mission given to the angel pit by the goddess Palutena is to fight the bosses in the three worlds and obtain the "Three Sacred Weapons". As you defeat enemies that stand in your way and jump to jump, the pit will travel through a vast world. In "Hades" and "Sky", where the tower is set, it moves upwards, and in "Earthly World", it moves horizontally. Inside the stage, there are various rooms, such as a shop where you can buy items and a room where you can train and get weapons."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Bionic Commando</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"This title is an action game for the Game Boy that was released in 1992. The main character, "Rud Spencer", who is equipped with a gun in one hand and a special wire in the other, challenges the Dreise army to a battle. There are several types of guns, such as the Wide Range Rifle that shoots bullets in three directions and the powerful Grenade Launcher. And the elastic wire is essential for capturing the fortress. It exerts great power when moving, such as shrinking the hooked wire to climb to a high place or jumping with momentum like a pendulum. In the communication rooms in each area, you can talk to allies and eavesdrop on enemy conversations to obtain valuable information."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To access these titles, you'll need to have an active base-tier Switch Online subscription. This update for the Nintendo Classics library follows the arrival of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> for the GameCube app in October.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-saros-10r-crashes-600-off-22-000-pa-suction-with-self-emptying-station-hits-all-time-low.1364905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robot vacuums range from basic bump-and-go models that randomly wander your floors to sophisticated machines that map your home with surgical precision, and Roborock always positioned itself at the premium end with innovations that justify higher price tags. Each new model brings features that push the category forward, but that innovation typically costs serious money, with the flagship Saros 10R normally demanding $1,599 from your wallet.</p>
<p>The great news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/">Amazon’s Black Friday deal slashes $600 off that price to bring it down to $999 (38% off)</a> hitting an all-time low that makes this ultra-premium cleaner actually accessible instead of just aspirational. This discount transforms the most advanced robot vacuum on the market into something you can justify buying, and once it starts handling your cleaning routine, you’ll wonder how you ever tolerated doing floors manually.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Engineering That Solves Real Cleaning Problems</h2>
<p>The <strong>ultra-slim 3.14-inch profile lets this robot slip under furniture</strong> that standard vacuums can’t reach, thanks to the StarSight Autonomous System 2.0 that eliminates the raised LDS dome making most robot vacuums too tall for low-clearance spaces. You get cleaning coverage under beds, sofas, and cabinets where dust bunnies normally live undisturbed for months because your regular vacuum can’t fit.</p>
<p><strong>3D sensing technology maps your home with precision</strong>, even in tight spaces under narrow-legged furniture, while the VertiBeam system navigates around cables without getting stuck or needing you to pre-clean your floors before the robot can do its job. Improved algorithms recognize and adapt to 108 different obstacle types, so it handles everything from pet toys to chair legs without calling for help every five minutes.</p>



<p>The <strong>22,000 Pa HyperForce suction pulls dirt, pet hair, and debris</strong> from hardwood, tile, and carpets with enough power to handle embedded mess that weaker vacuums just push around. Combined, the <span>Zero-Tangling DuoDivide</span> main brush and anti-tangle omnidirectional wheels mean you never spend ten minutes cutting hair wraps off the roller bar-which, if you have long hair or pets, is basically the worst part of owning robot vacuums. The <strong>FlexiArm side brush and mop automatically extend to reach corners</strong> and edges that circular robots typically miss, sweeping along baseboards and into tight spots where crumbs accumulate.</p>
<p>The AdaptiLift chassis <strong>climbs over obstacles as high as 4 cm</strong> and tackles thresholds and furniture legs that stop lesser robots dead in their tracks and turn your open floor plan into an actual open floor plan rather than a series of isolated zones. The dual-spinning mops automatically lift when carpets get detected to avoid getting your rugs soaked while still making thorough mopping possible on hard floors.</p>



<p>The Multifunctional Dock 4.0 does the dirty work you would avoid by automatically washing mops in 176°F hot water and drying them with 131°F hot air to prevent mildew and smell. <strong>Auto dust collection works for 60 days before needing attention</strong> while auto tank refilling and detergent dispensing mean the robot maintains itself between the occasional check-in you give it.</p>
<p>At $999 instead of the usual $1,599, you’re saving $600 on a machine that brings flagship features reserved for people with unlimited home automation budgets. This Black Friday price opens up the most advanced robot vacuum technology to households wanting exceptional cleaning results without compromise on coverage, power, or convenience.</p>

<p>Four iconic NES and Game Boy games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online’s Classics catalog for November 2025. Two of them, in particular, are some deep-cut, difficult titles.</p>







<p>As a benefit of Nintendo Switch Online, the Classics catalog offers many nostalgic games from Nintendo’s past. There are plenty of titles to choose from, like Donkey Kong and Metroid 2: Return of Samus. While the Expansion Pack adds Nintendo 64 titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/luigis-mansion-nintendo-switch-online-halloween-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luigi’s Mansion</a>, there’s still plenty of new additions to the base catalog. Now, there are some iconic games making their way to the Classics lineup that are sure to unlock some fun (and frustrating) memories. </p>



<h2 id="h-battletoads-kid-icarus-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online-tomorrow">Battletoads, Kid Icarus Coming to Nintendo Switch Online Tomorrow</h2>

<p>In the video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wZZI8a4uDI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, we see four nostalgic games coming to the Nintendo Switch Online Classics Catalog for November 2025. Those games are <strong>Battletoads, Ninja Gaiden 2: The Dark Sword of Chaos, Bionic Commando, </strong>and <strong>Kid Icarus: Of Myths and Monsters</strong>. The titles <strong>will be available</strong> starting tomorrow, <strong>November 26th</strong>, for all Nintendo Switch Online players.</p>



<p>If you were an avid Nintendo fan in the 1990s, you know how difficult Ninja Gaiden 2 and Battletoads are. The iconic Turbo Tunnel level in Battletoads has left many with good and bad memories, depending on perspective. For Capcom lovers, Bionic Commando is a welcome sight, as the last time we saw the series was 2009’s controversial reboot. Then, Kid Icarus, who has yet to get another entry since 2012’s Uprising, can now complement the original, which Of Myth and Monsters is a sequel to.</p>







<p>What do you think of the new November 2025 Nintendo Switch Online lineup? Any games you remember from back in the day? Excited to try them out? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-t7-ssd-goes-for-pocket-change-now-2tb-drive-selling-68-off-original-price-2000647374</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-t7-ssd-goes-for-pocket-change-now-2tb-drive-selling-68-off-original-price.1364884/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung earned its reputation as the <strong>most reliable brand for SSDs</strong> through years of consistent performance and the T7 has been an iconic model in portable storage since its launch a few years back. Traditional external hard drives (HDD) feel painfully slow once you experience the speed difference that solid-state technology delivers, and even more as <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/">this T7 model just hit a record low at $168 instead of the usual $187 (and $399 at launch!) for Black Friday on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Most color options already sold out completely</strong> which leaves only the gray version in stock so you’ll need to move fast if you want one before inventory disappears entirely. This<strong> drive transfers files at speeds up to 1,050MB/s</strong> which means copying a full 4K movie takes under a minute instead of the 5+ minutes you’d spend waiting with an old spinning hard drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Forget Your Old HDD</h2>
<p>The USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface pushes<strong> read speeds to 1,050MB/s and write speeds close behind</strong>, which gives you transfer rates that actually match modern file sizes and project demands. You can edit 4K video directly from the drive without pre-copying footage to your computer’s internal storage, saving time and preserving precious laptop SSD space for applications and system files. With a <strong>total capacity of 2TB, you’ll have room for approximately 500,000 photos</strong>, 50 hours of 4K video, or your entire game library plus room for new titles.</p>



<p>Measuring <strong>smaller than a credit card and weighing only 58 grams</strong>, the compact design disappears into any bag pocket without adding noticeable bulk or weight to your carry. The metal construction provides shock resistance that protects your data against drops from as high as 2 meters-though you obviously shouldn’t test that limit on purpose, just because the specs say it can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>Efficient thermal management</strong> keeps the drive cool during extended file transfers, preventing performance throttling when you’re moving massive amounts of data for longer periods. <strong>Password protection and AES 256-bit hardware encryption</strong> secure your files in case the drive gets lost or stolen, providing peace of mind that your client projects or personal photos will not end up in random hands.</p>



<p>Cross-platform compatibility works <strong>seamlessly across Windows, Mac, Android devices</strong>&nbsp;and gaming consoles without requiring reformatting or special drivers for basic use. The<strong> included USB-C to C and USB-C to A cables</strong> cover connection to virtually any modern device, though you’ll want the C-to-C cable for maximum speed with newer computers. Samsung’s Magician software provides drive health monitoring, firmware updates, and performance optimization tools that help maintain peak performance over the years. <strong>The three-year limited warranty</strong> backs up Samsung’s confidence in the drive’s reliability, covering manufacturing defects and giving you recourse if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>At $168 for 2TB of fast and reliable Samsung storage, you’re getting the brand’s proven track record at one of the lowest prices this model has ever seen which makes it the right moment to upgrade from slower storage solutions. This Black Friday deal delivers great portable storage at a price that finally makes sense for people who need speed and capacity without emptying their wallets.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-offloads-65w-3-port-block-charger-2-pack-selling-for-4x-cheaper-than-one-apple-charger-2000647316</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying official chargers from tech companies feels like highway robbery when you see Apple charging $59 for a basic 35W single-port USB-C adapter which makes you wonder if they think everyone has unlimited money to burn on accessories.</p>
<p>The <strong>Baseus 2-pack 65W charger bundle</strong> flips that equation completely by <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5748/">giving you two three-port chargers for $28 total, dropping from the usual $49 price tag</a> to hit an all-time low for Black Friday on Amazon. Each charger pushes 65W when you plug in a single device which means you can actually fast-charge a MacBook Air at full speed instead of watching the battery percentage crawl upward like a lazy snail. You get <strong>six charging ports total across both units</strong>, and that’s the kind of flexibility that solves the eternal problem of fighting over outlets.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5748/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>65W, Two Chargers</h2>
<p>The intelligent charging technology inside these blocks automatically figures out how much power each connected device needs and <strong>splits the 65W accordingly</strong>&nbsp;so you’re not manually calculating wattage or worrying about frying your phone because you plugged it into the wrong port. You can charge your laptop, phone, and earbuds simultaneously from a single charger without everything slowing down to a frustrating trickle, though connecting<strong> three devices does divide that 65W among them</strong> based on what each one can handle. It also operates on a <strong>92% energy conversion rate thanks to the GaN chip technology</strong>&nbsp;which means less wasted electricity and noticeably cooler operation compared to older, silicon-based chargers that get hot enough to cook an egg.</p>



<p>The compact size is <strong>41% smaller than Apple’s original 65W brick</strong> and matters more than you think once you’re trying to fit chargers into already-stuffed laptop bags or tight outlet spaces behind furniture. <strong>Foldable prongs</strong> collapse flush against the body so they won’t snag on clothes or scratch other gear rattling around in your backpack.</p>
<p>You can fast-charge an<strong> iPhone 17 from 0 to 50% in about 30 minutes</strong> or power up a Dell laptop without the need for its original, bulky charger. The <strong>USB-A port handles older devices</strong> that haven’t made the USB-C jump yet and saves you from having to carry separate adapters for wireless headphones, older tablets, or that one weird gadget that just refuses to adopt modern standards.</p>



<p>The <strong>lower operating temperature</strong> keeps these chargers safe to touch even after hours of continuous use, unlike some cheap alternatives that get concerningly hot and make you nervous about leaving them plugged in overnight. Each port delivers consistent power without the voltage fluctuations that can damage batteries over time, protecting your expensive devices while they charge.</p>
<p>At $28 for two 65W three-port chargers, you’re spending less than half what Apple charges for their wimpy 35W single-port adapter, and you’re getting roughly six times the functionality in return. This Black Friday price works out to $14 per charger which is basically impulse-purchase territory for accessories that’ll get daily use for years.</p>
