<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi has confirmed card game Queen's Blood will make a return for the third part of the remake trilogy.
</p>
<p>
Hamaguchi was speaking at the Otacon anime convention in America as part of a panel with producers and voice actors from the game.
</p>
<p>
The director was asked by a fan if he could make the card game in real life. "Actually I've been receiving so many requests," he replied. "Right now we are preparing a revamped or even better version of Queen's Blood for the next title of this series. So I hope to be able to share more in the near future."

</figure>
<p>

Later in the panel, the group discussed their favourite minigames from Rebirth and Queen's Blood was a popular choice. It's no wonder, then, it's set to make a return.
</p>
<p>
Queen's Blood is a new card game created for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth to rival the likes of Triple Triad and Tetra Master from previous games. The original Final Fantasy 7 did not include a card game, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> included plenty of new minigames for the remake.

</p></div>
<p>
Little else is known about the third part of the trilogy, although it's expected we'll be able to fly over the open world and Rocket Town - missing in the second part - will feature.
</p>
<p>
In the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Ultimania book released back in April, creative director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-could-include-something-very-important-that-was-not-in-the-original-game">Tetsuya Nomura confirmed the story for the third part was complete</a>, voice recording could start soon, and "something very important" was teased that wasn't in the original game.

</p>
<p>
We also know series composer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-composer-uematsu-returning-for-remake-trilogy-finale">Nobuo Uematsu will return with a new main theme</a>.

 </a>

<p>
What's more, with the changes made to the story in the first two games, there's plenty of speculation as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aeriths-fate-in-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-the-trouble-with-remakes">where the story will go next</a> and differ from the original.

</p>
<p>
Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-underperforming-says-industry-analyst">said to be underperforming sales-wise</a> despite positive reviews. Still, it was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-fourth-top-selling-game-in-the-us-this-year-but-reportedly-remains-far-behind-remake">fourth highest-selling game in America this year</a> back in May.

			<p>There’s a minimalist approach to storytelling that a lot of metroidvania games traditionally take, letting their world speak for itself and typically telling the rest of the story through text boxes and an occasional character sprite. Frontier Hunter: Erza’s Wheel of Fortune aims for loftier narrative goals with a load of fully animated cutscenes that place the characters and their adventures on equal footing with the importance of the side-scrolling exploration and action. Unfortunately, these moments are so rough and shoddy that they ultimately bring an otherwise decent gaming experience down several notches.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frontier Hunter Erza’s Wheel of Fortune Official Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ESY7OF9EJzs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Frontier Hunter: Erza’s Wheel of Fortune is a mish-mash of fantasy and sci-fi tropes run through an anime filter, and that grab bag honestly leads to some interesting ideas. Your protagonist is Erza, an Imperial Hunter aboard a cruising skyship heading to an unexplored region. Despite her calm &amp; cool appearance, her introductory cutscene has her livestreaming from her bedroom about planet ecology to her fans and getting embarrassed when her dad shows up in the stream chat. Alongside her, you also get to play as minigun-wielding and Erza-obsessed fangirl Ciara as well as masked fighter Nia.</p>


<p>Hot-swapping between three playable characters at any time adds a lot of fun new layers to the metroidvania action that I was really impressed by. Each character has their own specialisation, and plenty of new weapons to equip and abilities to unlock that help diversify their playstyles even more.</p>


<p>I struggled to lose myself in the fun of these characters and the multi-biome sprawling map they explore, though, because of how frequently the game comes to a halt to dish out an unremarkable cutscene. While character models in Frontier Hunter: Erza’s Wheel of Fortune look fine enough from afar, they’re much less impressive to look at in dynamic, close-up cutscenes, and their animation is distractingly robotic. It’s hard enough to care about these moments when they look so rough, but a lot of the writing in them isn’t anything memorable either – for some players, the heavy reliance on goofy and fanservice-y anime tropes in these scenes won’t do them any favours either.</p>
<p>Lackluster cutscenes aside, there’s a comfortable, cheesy charm to Frontier Hunter: Erza’s Wheel of Fortune that I really do appreciate. Attack animations are far sharper than what you witness in story scenes, and while some of them lack weight or oomph, the sheer volley of wild particle effects and glowing projectiles that sputter out every time you land an attack or dish out a super move are just fun as hell.</p>

<p>Plus, the wealth of customisation in the game really helps make it worth seeing things through to the end – from equipment-enhancing orbs dropped by enemies to new abilities that grant access to locked parts of the map, and even a huge variety of costumes for each character, it always feels like you’re unlocking something new and shiny that helps keep your attention even through the lowest points of the game.</p>
<p>Frontier Hunter: Erza’s Wheel of Fortune isn’t setting a new bar for metroidvanias by any means – but it’s gaming comfort food that’ll feel easy to sink your teeth into if you’re a fan of that kind of atmosphere. Even the most patient of corny game enthusiasts will likely be put off by how frequent, unpolished, and often unskippable the cutscenes in this game are though.</p>

            <p> One of the neat things about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norland">Norland</a>'s fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having "wise conversations". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like "manners" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rimworld">Rimworld</a>-meets-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings</a> catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"[Teachers] will now pass on their knowledge to the children they teach," say the developers in a brief <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1857090/announcements/detail/4363509960714741937">post about the patch on Steam</a>. But they also note that "at the same time, wise conversations with children will no longer be possible... On the one hand, this will reduce micromanagement for those familiar with the Wise Conversation tool. Conversely, it will ease the knowledge transfer between generations for new players."</p>
<p>In other words, you won't have to keep spamming the command for people to talk to one another in the vain hope that they might share some insightful nugget on pig farming. That'll probably make catastrophic loss of knowledge less likely for newer players who don't yet know that the passing on of knowledge is a major factor in a settlement's success.</p><p>There's another small fix too: "Ambitious kings should no longer uncontrollably and sharply increase the number of their troops in the late game." That's probably useful. But I've not made it to that "late game" yet. My first playthrough <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-set-a-bishop-on-fire-in-norland-and-the-sicko-loved-every-second-of-it">ended in disaster thanks to a lusty bishop</a> who kept having sex with my lords and then insisting those lords seek absolution for that "sinful act" for the low-low price of six silver rings. The absolute shyster. </p>
<p>Norland developers Long Jaunt have been steadily and reliably patching the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management game</a> since its release into early access in July. This is the 14th patch so far. Previous patches include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1857090/view/4363509326754862110">adding "lesser" lords</a>, fixing a somewhat <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1857090/view/4344368567405445795">broken definition of "monogamy"</a>, and tweaking an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1857090/view/4344368567396759579">overzealous fleshwolf attack</a> so that it would no longer wipe out half your village. It's the kind of steady and frequent updating that hopefully keeps long-term players happy. I still haven't gone back to the ruins of my village quite yet (everyone got depressed and eaten by wolves, thanks <em>bishop Ingo</em>). But it's good to know that, if I ever do, the lordly children will be slightly more capable.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warcrow-winds-from-the-north-review.944709/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warcrow-winds-from-north-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the world of Lindwurm, the star known as Warcrow passes once a millennium causing the cycles of magic and increasing the potency of the mineral&nbsp;orichalcum that sits beneath the earth's surface. This increasing change, whether they feel it or not, has caused the world's factions to seek out victory for themselves. The Orcs of the Northern Tribes now battle with the armies of the Hegemony of Embersig, the Black Legion, as the Northern Tribes stray beyond their boundaries and the Hegemony seeks to find out why.</p>
<p><em>Warcrow</em> is a fantasy wargame by Corvus Belli, the creators of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/infinity-codeone-guide"><em>Infinity</em></a>. <em>Warcrow</em> initially launched with a dungeon crawler adventure game, <em>Warcrow Adventures</em>, and now expands into a full tabletop wargame with the launch of its first starter box, <em>Warcrow Winds from the North</em>.</p>

<h2>How Does Warcrow Play?</h2>
<p><em>Warcrow</em> uses a mix of mechanics from 2 of Corvus Belli's other games, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/infinity-codeone-guide"><em>Infinity</em></a>, their Sci-Fi wargame, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/aristeia-and-aristeia-prime-time-review"><em>Aristeia</em></a>, the board game battler set in the Infinity Universe, but it feels very different from both.</p>
<p>Each unit in Warcrow comes with a stat card that details its abilities, and the dice it rolls in attack and defense. Warcrow uses custom dice which contain a mix of successes, blocks, and special symbols. There are 2 types of rolls that the game calls for, simple and face-to-face. Simple rolls require the player to roll the number and colors of dice shown on the unit's stat card for that action, requiring a single success to achieve.</p>
<p>Face-to-face rolls allow your opponent to cancel out your successes with their blocks, making them harder to achieve. The special symbols on the dice enable you to activate unique abilities, known as switches, which can be anything from increasing damage to activating effects and giving states to units.</p>
<p>Combat with large units is streamlined by increasing and decreasing stats, depending on the number of troops left in the unit. For example, the Black Legion Bucklermen roll 1 red and 3 orange dice in attack when they have 3+ troops, but 2 orange and 2 yellow when they have 2 or fewer troops left.</p>
<p>Characters can also join units, and their stat card has 2 elements to keep this straightforward too. The top half of a character's stat card has their full stats when they're functioning as a solo character, but when they join a unit, their cards sit under the unit's card and only uses the bottom half of their stat card, which details the stats they modify for the unit (rather than using their own while part of the unit) and what abilities they can use whilst part of it.</p>
<p>Warcrow also uses a Turn Counter to track in-game effects. The game is split over several rounds, and each round consists of a number of turns indicated by the scenario. During each turn, both you and your opponent can activate 1 unit. An end-of-round counter is placed on the turn tracker, and scenario events, and the duration of magical effects are also tracked using it.</p>

<p><em>Warcrow Winds from the North</em>&nbsp;is the launch box for Warcrow and contains everything that 2 players need to start playing. Included in the box is:</p>
<ul><li><em>Warcrow</em> Learn to Play Booklet</li>
<li>7 Northern Tribes miniatures</li>
<li>7 Hegemony of Embersig miniatures</li>
<li>Gaming Mat and Bakhlia Farm Scenery Pack</li>
<li>18 Custom Dice</li>
<li>Measuring tools, tokens, and markers</li>
</ul><p>The full rules for <em>Warcrow</em> are available for free online and can be found under Resources on the <a href="https://warcrow.com/en/games/warcrow">Warcrow website</a>. You will use these rules after playing through the scenarios in the Learn to Play booklet, and it can be used straight away if you want to try out the game.</p>
<h2>What Are The Two Factions Included In Warcrow Winds From The North?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Made up of the orcs and varank that have populated the inhospitable Boreal Lands since ancient times, the Northern Tribes have forged an alliance that terrorizes humans, dwarves, and elves the whole world over.</p>
<p>They are the Tribes of the North and they have descended from the cold northern lands to sow panic in the world, lop off heads and drown the earth in the bloody entrails of their enemies; in order to reconquer what belongs to them and continue living in a manner that is faithful to their own nature. They are the orcs and varank, and woe betide anyone foolhardy enough to stand in their way!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The box contains 7 Northern Tribes miniatures:</p>
<ul><li>Alborc / Wraithmane</li>
<li>Evoker</li>
<li>Wisemane</li>
<li>4x Orc Hunters</li>
</ul><p>The Northern Tribe's characters in the box are more expensive than the Hegemony's, which means that points for points are hard to balance against the Hegemony, but at this lower points game, the Hegemony tends to do better, with the Northern Tribes relying on other units from other sets to make the most of their characters (Alborc's Warg and the Crow ability, for example, needs a Varank unit which aren't release yet). The Orcs in Wind From The North are faster than their human opponents and come with more wounds and they hit harder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most illustrious Hegemony of Embersig is a young, dynamic, diverse and expansionist empire. Armed with the iron fist of its Black Legion, the world’s most powerful and well-trained army, wrapped in the silk glove provided by its skilled diplomats and spies, the Hegemony has grown into a power without equal.</p>
<p>The word “Embersig” describes, in the Maghar language, the concept of “all people” which includes, not only humans, but also elves and dwarves. Thus, the Hegemony is a melting pot that synthesizes the best of each culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The box contains 7 Hegemony of Embersig miniatures:</p>
<ul><li>Dragoslav Bjelogric / Hetman</li>
<li>Frostfire Herald</li>
<li>War Surgeon</li>
<li>4x Black Legion Bucklermen</li>
</ul><p>The Hegemony units in Winds from the North, while looking weaker stats-wise, have a brutal combo with the Bucklermen and the War Surgeon, who can roll against their willpower to stop damage to the unit when attached to them, and when they rest, they heal all wounds. This makes them extremely durable against the Orc Hunters, who can have a hard time removing them from the battlefield in the lower points introductory scenarios. This is compounded by the Bucklermen also adding a Block symbol into their rolls, even when attacking.</p>

<p>Following the same format as Corvus Belli's <em>Infinity</em>, the next set for Warcrow will be a Beyond Winds of the North set, that will add 3 miniatures each to the Northern Tribes and Hegemony of Embersig.</p>
<p>The Hegemony gets Lady Telia, a ranged warrior who can target characters attached to units, which is extremely powerful for weakening units with strong support characters. Accompanying Telia are two Pioneers, another ranged unit that can target enemies without having line of sight to them.</p>
<p>The Northern Tribes get Njord the Merciless, who's extremely fast, and hard-hitting in combat. Also included for the Northern Tribes are 2 Skin Changers, who pick a Totem at the start of the battle which can either give them scout or reduce their movement slightly and give them an extra wound. The Skin Changers are Varank warriors, so can benefit from Alborc's ability which will increase his value.</p>
<p>Further products for the Warcrow line haven't been announced yet, but if it's anything like Infinity's release roadmap, we'll see a few more units for the current 2 factions, before we get another Battle Box introducing the next 2 factions.</p>

<p>Winds from the North is a great introductory pack for <em>Warcrow</em>. It gives a good taste for the styles of the first 2 factions, but they could be better balanced against each other, even if it was stat cards just to use in the narrative campaign that's included, before moving into the full stat cards.</p>
<p>It's quite deflating to have some raging Orcs just rebound off a unit of humans because they have a healer with a crowmask. It's easy to see that in larger point games (full games are advised at 250 points and the battlepack has 120/130 points for the 2 factions), the Northern Tribes will have a lot going for them as they load up states on enemy units, and Alborc allows a free activation chain with a Varank unit (not included in this set).</p>
<p>Some of the rules in the Introductory booklet aren't super clear, and the turn counter initially seems overly complicated before you play a few games and get into it. Making sure you move the tokens on the tracker is essential, and even missing one turn on it can make tracking events and tokens complicated to fix. The tutorial and the narrative campaign do a good job of onboarding before progressing to the full rulebook though, even if some of it isn't super clear on first read-through.</p>
<p>The custom dice and the way unit combat works make the game very streamlined. Character insertion into units also keeps this seamless nature, adding dice and abilities rather than having to work out multiple combats for different units involved. I like the way the game flows as well, and once you get used to the turn tracker, it has a nice pacing to it with alternating activations, and the face-off rolls for combat.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy Warcrow Winds From The North?</h2>
<p>If you're looking for a new fantasy wargame, then Warcrow has a very interesting setting, and the mechanics work well for a great-paced game. With the limited products (2 factions with not enough units for a full game yet), games may become stale after you've played with both factions through the campaign and initial scenarios.</p>
<p>How Corvus Belli paces their releases will be key to keeping interest. Details of several other factions are mentioned in the lore, game details, and on the Warcrow website, but we don't know when they're planned for release. Winds from the North does have a great narrative campaign (that's not in the online rulebook or the full printed rulebook with lore details you can buy separately), but the balance of the 2 included factions is off, so make sure any beginner players get the Hegemony, who are a lot more forgiving to pay with than the Northern Tribes.</p>

            <p>Flippin’ heck, what a journey it’s been for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, eh? It seems just yesterday I was getting very jealous at Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-review-early-access">getting to preview</a> the sequel to my beloved Shadows Of Amn. Fast forward several turns, Larian’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> banger is officially one year old since release, and there’s now a much higher chance that strangers at pubs will understand why my failed romance with Jaheira as a youth was such a deeply heartbreaking experience.<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii"> Baldur’s Gate 3</a> itself looks to be done and dusted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/delayed-baldurs-gate-3-patch-notes-reckon-youve-all-been-eating-too-much-delicious-irresistible-soap">following the upcoming patch</a>, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LarianCFH">YouTube channel</a>, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Following the naming convention of their sporadic Panel From Hell hype-casts, The Channel From Hell is <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1819750333779767386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1819750333779767386%7Ctwgr%5Ee32a70e5dd17dea17c21004c8bd3321e42faee8e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pushsquare.com%2Fnews%2F2024%2F08%2Fanticipation-as-larian-preps-fresh-channel-from-hell-baldurs-gate-3-marks-first-anniversary">pitched as an anniversary celebration</a>. It currently sits barren, although vids are supposed to be on their way soon. They’ve said it’ll be community focused, so part of the channel’s purpose could well be to showcase some of the wild mods that are sure to follow the release of Patch 7’s modding toolkit. I wouldn’t be surprised if they end up running some sort of “thirstposts of the week” segment either - surely, an endless well of content if I ever saw one.</p>

<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>Elsewhere, Larian are currently at work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two new games</a>. Back in May, they announced the opening of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larians-new-polish-studio-is-a-match-made-in-heaven-for-the-baldurs-gate-3-developers-upcoming-rpgs">new Polish studio based in Warsaw</a>, as an addition to their 24 hour dev cycle. “Our plan for the Polish studio is very simple,” said CEO Swen Vincke. “Build a team that can work on our two - very ambitious - new RPGs and enjoy the fruits of their labor.”</p>
<p>"The machine is meant to make large games," Vincke <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/i-call-it-chaos-at-scale-for-the-first-anniversary-of-baldurs-gate-3-we-spoke-exclusively-to-swen-vincke-about-the-past-present-and-future-of-larian-studios/">recently told</a> PC Gamer. "We actually know what we want from our gameplay systems, how to evolve them, how to do new things … and they're all big." In the same interview, Vincke spoke about how this approach - one that it sounds as if they’re carrying forward from Baldur’s Gate 3 - is only really possible because of the studio’s independence.</p>
<blockquote>"If you see it, it'll scare you, as a shareholder, as a publisher, the very first thing you will try to do is get it under control—you will try to scope it, you will try to box it, you will try to control it, which is exactly the opposite of what we want to do. Because it's like, why are we spending a million dollars on a dragon, which nobody's ever going to see, except like five people who made that obscure choice? Because if they see it, they have to be happy too. So that's why I put the bloody dragon there, because that's the logical consequence of the things that they've done."</blockquote>
<p>While many of us I’m sure would have loved to see a full on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition">Throne Of Bhaal </a>style expansion for BG3, it’s clear that moving on to these new projects has reinvigorated a studio on the verge of burnout with the Dungeons And Dragons setting. Vincke tells PC Gamer that he doesn’t think “as developers, we ever felt better,” since deciding to move on. "Honestly, you really cannot explain or express it, how liberated we are. So morale is super high, just because we're doing new stuff again. We're doing our own thing again, we're not rehashing, we're not trying to convert rules from 50 years ago into something new."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A project related to the Half-Life series known as White Sands is currently in the works, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by well-known Valve leaker Tyler McVicker, based on datamined information obtained from Source 2-powered games like Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2, a new project related to the series and to the HLX codename datamined a while back is in active development. This White Sands project seems to be a PC-only project at this time, has elements of the Half-Life series, such as an HEV suit charger plug, and won't be a VR project like Alyx. The leaker speculates that this project, which has been in the works for a while, could be Half-Life 3, although there isn't any evidence at the moment to back this.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Half-Life 3 Leaks We’ve Been Waiting For" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/36gF6eiCsqU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is the aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-alyx-8k-ultra-settings-rtx-4080/">Half-Life Alyx</a>, a VR game that can also be played without a headset thanks to the incredible NoVR mod, which also preserves some of the VR interactions to provide players with an accurate experience even on a flat screen.</p>
<p>Despite being in the works for some time, it may take a while to hear more about this Half-Life White Sands project. We will keep you updated as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>I write this week's list of new PC games in a spirit of terror, for a strange man is at my window with a ladder. Has Santa Claus come early? Have Sony's goons found me at last, after swearing vengeance for that 8/10 I handed God Of War 3 as a cub reporter? Does the motion detector on the light over the apartment block door need fixing? There is no time to enquire and certainly no time to flee, for there are video games we must discuss.</p><!--more-->
<p>On Monday 5th August, a gentle start in the shape of RPG life sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2142790/Fields_of_Mistria/">Fields Of Mistria</a>.

On Wednesday 7th August, pied piper simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creatures-of-ava">Creatures Of Ava</a>.

<p>As ever, all of this is sponsored by the original Man in the Window, the Maw - an enveloping and esurient entity from realms beyond ken, always hungry for another helping of video game news, always threatening an interdimensional invasion if left unfed for too long.

            <p>HBO has released its first teaser for the second season of The Last of Us.</p>
<p>The teaser is short, but gives us a look at some returning and new faces coming to the second season. New faces include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">Catherine O'Hara's still to be named character</a> (although previous rumours suggested her character will be called Gail).</p>
<p>You can check out the teaser below, towards the end of HBO's latest sizzle reel. It starts at around the 01:15 mark. After the trailer, I will be breaking down a few bits I noticed, so <strong>please be aware of spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 (the video game) below</strong>.</p>

<p>The first clip we see is panning down on a party scene, lit up by fairy lights. The back of a girl's head can be seen, as she watches out over the dance floor.</p>
<p>This is Bella Ramsey's Ellie, and the scene shown here is basically a carbon copy from that same moment in the game.</p>

<p>While the above footage is playing, we hear a woman's voice asking "Did you hurt her?", to which Pedro Pascal's Joel replies: "No." The trailer then pans to Ellie's scarred arm, and her tattoo.</p>
<p>In the game, it is revealed that between the events of The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part 2, Ellie covers her bite mark (which she received in the shopping mall with her friend Riley during the series' DLC, Left Behind) first with a chemical burn and later, by getting her ex-girlfriend Cat to tattoo over the area.</p>
<p>The moment shared in HBO's teasers appears to be Ellie getting the tattoo, suggesting that we may meet Cat during the show's second season (or, this is just a brief flashback scene and Cat's hands may be all we get to see).</p>

<p>After seeing Ellie's arm, we get to see the lady who was speaking to Joel, and it's Catherine O'Hara's character. I previously wondered if O'Hara would play either a member of the WLF or a Seraphite, but she appears to be a Jackson resident given her seemingly close relationship with Joel.</p>
<p>O'Hara previously said she had filmed scenes with both Joel and Ellie, so I now wonder if she will try and act as a mediator between the two during the Jackson scenes (those who have played the game will know there is friction between Joel and Ellie after the events of Part 1).</p>
<p>My other theory is she is some kind of resident therapist that Jackson's community confides in. Her role in the series was previously said to be an all-new character, so that would fit. The first season did also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-discuss-joels-panic-attacks">address Joel's trauma and mental health</a>, so this could be the next evolution of his journey.</p>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Right now, I am not exactly sure what is happening in this next scene. Ellie can be seen screaming as someone slightly off screen tries to hold her down on a bed of sorts.</p>
<p>First, I wondered if this was a traumatic dream Ellie was having, and she is picturing herself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-explain-joels-john-wick-moment-as-a-god-mode-power-up">inside the Firefly hospital unable to stop Joel from his killing spree</a>.</p>
<p>I then wondered if this was someone else pouring the chemicals on her bite scar, and Ellie screaming in pain. This would suggest that Ellie and Joel had confided in several other members of the Jackson community, though, so I am not sure how likely this is. Thoughts welcome!</p>

<p>We are back outside for the next brief clip, which shows a snowy landscape with a large walled structure - Jackson - being stormed by a large horde of running assailants. While we can't see their faces, it is fair to assume that this is a horde of infected runners.</p>
<p>The next clip show's Gabriel Luna's Tommy using his gun to shoot out into the snow, I assume at these very runners, defending Jackson. In the game, Jackson's residents regularly patrol the surrounding areas to defend the settlement from infected.</p>

An image of Wright also appeared online, and appeared to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-casts-jeffrey-wright-reprising-his-role-as-isaac">suggest we will be learning more about Isaac's backstory when season two airs</a>.</p>

<p>At last, we now get our first very quick glimpse of Dever's Abby. This image is again almost a carbon copy of the same moment in the game. We see Abby wearing a dark beanie hat fleeing from a swarm of infected.</p>
<p>She is on the cusp of being overcome by the swarm, with a wired fence being pressed down over her as she tries to crawl through the snow to safety.</p>

<p>The final few images from the teaser show a horseback ride in the snow (something we again see in the game).</p>
<p>We also see Ellie and Dina in a subway running from a clicker. I am going to suggest this represents The Last of Us Part 2's 'Tunnels' section, where the two make their way through train cars while fighting off enemies.</p>

<p>The final shot from the teaser shows Joel, a tear rolling down his cheek, telling O'Hara he saved Ellie. At the start of The Last of Us Part 2, Joel confides in his brother Tommy. He may well still do this in the series, as well, but I wonder if this tête-à-tête between Joel and O'Hara's character will be what opens the season. </p>
<p>The teaser then ends.</p>

<p>So, what do you think so far? I would have loved to see more of Abby, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">and the WLF</a>, but this really was just a teaser so I am sure we will see more of them in the coming months.</p>
<p>The second season of The Last of Us is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-now-confirmed-for-2025-release">due to air in 2025</a>. It will not cover the entirety of the second game, but will have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">"a lot more infected" than in the first season</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Gavin Verhey’s Friday announcement of <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/announcing-mystery-booster-2">Mystery Booster 2</a> — the follow-up to one of 2019’s most sought-after products in the world of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/magic-the-gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a> (MTG) — came as a welcome surprise.</p>
<p>But what are Mystery Boosters, why are they so popular and are they coming to Magic Online or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mtg-arena">MTG Arena</a>?</p>
<h2><strong>What are MTG Mystery Boosters</strong></h2>
<p>The original Mystery Booster was released in 2019 as a way of playing purely random Magic. Each pack contains 15 cards from a pool of <a href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/index/MB1#paper">1694 cards of equal rarity</a>.</p>


<p>That means you had equal chance to open a Mana Crypt or Rhystic Study as you did an Earth Elemental or Dead Reveller. Two of those cards are incredibly powerful (and expensive). Two of them are not.</p>
<p>But if you’re opening Mystery Booster, you’re not doing it for the monetary value — you’re either doing it to play purely random Magic or you’re doing it get your hands on one of those all new, sweet-looking Playtest Cards.</p>

<h2><strong>What are MTG Playtest Cards?</strong></h2>
<p>The brains behind Magic the Gathering test cards as they design them. Sometimes things get powered up or powered down. Sometimes they never see the light of day — they could be too powerful, too difficult to make work within the game’s rules or simply they’re just too silly.</p>
<p>The Mystery Booster Playtest Cards take this idea and brings it to the public to enjoy.</p>
<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmb2/13/stack-of-paperwork">Stack of Paperwork</a>, for example, changes the rules of the game to ‘put damage on the stack’ — a rule that was removed in 2010 to simplify the game and make certain decisions a lot more meaningful. Obviously, while this card will make the old guard laugh and look back with nostalgia, reintroducing that rule now would makes things a lot more difficult. As such, each Playtest Card comes with the following disclaimer at the bottom: “Test card — not for constructed play”.</p>
<p>But not all Playtest cards add wonky rules. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmb2/45/one-with-death">One with Death</a> simply kills you and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmb2/102/slivdrazi-monstrosity">Slivdrazi Monstrosity</a> is so powerful it would simply get immediately banned. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmb2/96/personal-decoy">Personal Decoy</a> would just be annoying to play against.</p>
<p>This theme continues in Mystery Booster 2, which bring a whole bunch of meme-y Playtest Cards for fans to enjoy. One new card even changes the rules on the spot so that you’re no longer playing best of three, but best of one.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here's a card I think <a href="https://twitter.com/bbrode?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bbrode</a> might marvel at the potential of:<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wotcstaff?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#wotcstaff</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mtgmystery?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#mtgmystery</a> <a href="https://t.co/LhtkAu2Vaf">pic.twitter.com/LhtkAu2Vaf</a></p>
<p>— Gavin Verhey (@GavinVerhey) <a href="https://twitter.com/GavinVerhey/status/1819797814102118684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It also brings white-border cards back and occasionally uses the Future Sight frame — treatments that different parts of the community will love.</p>

<p>The short answer is no.</p>
<p>The long answer is that there are a couple of issues holding Mystery Boosters back. First and foremost are the Playtest Cards. While they are great fun, their rule-bending nature means that while they’re perfectly intuitive to play in real life, the amount of coding required to get them to work properly on MTGO or Arena is probably just not worth the effort, as far as Wizards of the Coast (WotC) is concerned.</p>
<p>This is why we’ve never had the jokey ‘Un’ sets on either client. They’re great fun, but they fundamentally break the rules in ways that the game engine cannot cope with.</p>
<p>Since Playtest Cards are a big part of Mystery Boosters, putting everything expect those online would probably have people kicking off. But that’s not the only issue.</p>
<p>The second — and possibly bigger — issue is that WotC simply doesn’t want to put Mystery Boosters online.</p>
<p>WotC could conceivably add the boosters to MTGO without the Playtest Cards — since the set is all reprints, these cards are already all on the client. The issue is that these boosters were designed as convention-edition packs, to play in real life. They’re not even going to be available to buy in your local game store.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">MB2 is meant to be a special experience for players at conventions. These will be at cons of all types (MagicCon and more!) long term, like MB1. There will be lots of it!</p>
<p>As an extension of the con experience, they'll also be in Festival in a Box, available online. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wotcstaff?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#wotcstaff</a></p>
<p>— Gavin Verhey (@GavinVerhey) <a href="https://twitter.com/GavinVerhey/status/1819809131772969147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So while WotC could easily bring the cut-down booster to MTGO, it seems they just don’t want to.</p>
<p>As for Arena — a client with a much smaller, more controlled card pool — the idea of getting any sort of Mystery Booster is sadly a bridge too far.</p>

<p>Recently, a low-tier, grassroots esports league was revealed for XDefiant, Ubisoft’s all-new competitive FPS built around the company’s ecosystem of brands and franchises. This is one of the first such competitions to emerge, and while it’s relatively unassuming, it’s a bold step in the right direction, as there are predictions that XDefiant will one day host a thriving esports scene.</p>



<hr>

<p>The ‘XDefiant HP League’ is being dubbed as EU and NA’s biggest XDefiant league, and soon, the European branch of the tournament will kick off. This news was broken first by <a href="https://esports-news.co.uk/2024/08/04/xdefiant-hp-league-launches/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Esports News UK</a>, with the site’s Dom Sacco sitting down with Ace, the owner of the HP League:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve built and designed this league for everyone, not just the players. I want to inspire greatness from the community and provide a platform for everyone to be able to thrive off – and start showcasing the beauty of amateur esports!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This full-fledged tournament boasts a board of casters and a production team, and it’s expected that the first EU portion of the competition will feature more than 64 teams spread across six divisions. It has been noted that the prize pool will exceed £10,000 ($12,000). </p>



<p>These grassroots tournaments are the bedrock of the esports scene for any game, as the only way to go from here is up. I caught up with Ubisoft at the recent BLAST R6 Manchester Major and learned that the official competitive scene for XDefiant won’t be launched until at least the second year of the game, as Ubisoft first needs to add a slew of features including spectator tools and a solid private and custom-based match system.</p>

<p>Another champion has been crowned at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, with Alliance winning the Apex Legends category and securing the $600,000 grand prize. In an intense showdown that lasted more than seven hours, the teams competing in the Apex Legends tournament made history, playing a whopping <strong>thirteen games </strong>before the victor lifted the trophy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-the-distance">Going the Distance</h2>



<p>The reason why the final stage in the Apex Legends tournament took seven hours sits with the competition’s structure. It’s a similar layout used in other battle royale-based events, and it requires the winning team to secure 60 points and <strong>then </strong>a win in a final match. It’s the same model that’s used in the World Series of Warzone.</p>



<p>Because of how this model works, teams can keep coming up to ‘match point’ as play progresses, and ultimately, you could have stacks of teams sitting on more than 60 points, all of which need that one final win to secure the trophy. This is what happened at the Esports World Cup, and it took a staggering <strong>thirteen matches </strong>before Alliance picked up the last win needed to grab the top spot.</p>



<p>By the time the dust had settled, Alliance sat on 112 points – only Team Falcons had more points, but Alliance had the fortune and skills to secure that all-important win first. As the final stage unravelled, underdog teams just kept proving the crowd wrong, pushing the series further beyond what seemed possible, breaking the record for the most matches in a LAN final <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it was the EU side of Alliance that secured the win in the thirteenth round, netting the 1,000 Club Championship Points and the lion’s share of the prize pool. </p>

<p>Team BDS has recovered from a crushing loss at the BLAST R6 Manchester Major to win the Rainbow Six Siege category of the Esports World Cup. In a dominant display, the team stormed through the competition to secure the top prize – a $750,000 bundle of cash and 1,000 Club Championship Points.</p>



<p>This was a well-deserved win – Team BDS played phenomenally during this entire tournament.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-vive-team-bds">Vive Team BDS</h2>



<p>Team BDS is represented by some of the all-time best Rainbow Six players. Leading the charge is Shaiiko, arguably the number-one player with the boldest profile in the competitive scene. Following a lengthy ban that ran from 2017 to 2019, Stéphane ‘Shaiiko’ Lebleu burst back into the landscape with a dominating focus. </p>



<p>Since re-appearing on the scene, Shaiiko has won Gamers8 <strong>twice</strong>, two Majors, and has picked up the top spot at 26 further tournaments, all of which have been with Team BDS.</p>



<p>This past weekend, Team BDS stormed through the group stage, decimating the likes of Team Cruelty and w7m to push forward into the playoffs. It was there that history was made, with Team BDS wiping out FaZe Clan, FURIA, and finally, w7m (again) to secure the trophy. </p>



<p>Now, we look to the unravelling esports schedule for Rainbow Six moving forward. In November, the BLAST R6 circuit moves to Montreal for another Major, and to kick off 2025, the Six Invitational lands in North America. There’s plenty to look out for as a Rainbow Six esports fan.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/someone-added-sliding-to-fallout-4-and-it%E2%80%99s-kind-of-brilliant.944661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-sliding-enhanced-movement-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>People often get creative when designing and developing Fallout 4 mods, but one of the latest and most recently popular mods is relatively mundane, but so well done. It’s called Enhanced Movement, and it was released on Nexus Mods by a modder called bp42s. This mod offers such a huge improvement in exchange for something so simple.</p>



<p>Enhanced Movement adds a few new mechanics, such as <strong>sliding</strong>, and it tweaks existing movement-based fundamentals to make everything feel more <strong>realistic</strong>. For instance, your player feels like they have weight after jumping from a height, their movement speed is adjusted if they run in a certain direction or manner, and stamina decreases when sneaking and swimming.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-simple-but-super">Simple but Super</h2>



<p>Enhanced Movement (dug up by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-4/mod-movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>) is one of the most recent mods to his Nexus that I’d wholeheartedly recommend installing. It offers a sweet depth to the customisation of in-game movement mechanics that genuinely make Fallout 4 feel so much more intense and immersive. </p>



<p>Other mods do the same thing, such as introducing inertia and player weight, but Enhanced Movement feels much more comprehensive and fleshed out.</p>



<p>In the mod menu, you can tweak AP costs and debuffs, and you can switch on or off various animations and elements of the mod. It’s a run-of-the-mill thing in that respect, but it’s in live play that you feel the biggest differences. In the below walkthrough of the mod, you can see how well-animated and smooth sliding is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/86278?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in Fallout 4 with Enhanced Movement</a>:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>This isn’t bp42s’ first rodeo, though. On Nexus, this modder has released 47 different downloads ranging from a karma system to a mechanic that encourages <strong>fear </strong>in enemies when they see you wearing Power Armor. The Enhanced Movement mod is the latest in a very long line of top-tier contributions bp42s has made to the Fallout 4 ecosystem.</p>

<p>The first real teaser for The Last of Us season two has been revealed by HBO, showcasing a wild array of content coming in 2025. One of the most important things to note is that the clips show us a universe outside the games. Many were expecting The Last of Us season two to mimic 2020’s The Last of Us Part II, but that won’t happen, per the reveal. It seems the showrunners have pushed the boundaries of what we know to give us a little more meat on the bones.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-saved-her">‘I Saved Her’</h2>



<p>If the showrunners were planning on staying true to The Last of Us Part II, Pedro Pascal’s Joel Miller would be written out within the first episode, but it looks like they’re intent on going deeper with the second season of the award-winning series.</p>



<p>In the short clip published to social media, we see a series of shots that aren’t replicated in the game, such as Joel wrestling with his decision, Tommy defending Jackson against an onslaught, Isaac taking matters into his own hands, and Ellie being rushed into surgery (or so it seems). </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>We also get our first look at Kaitlyn Dever as Abby in a recognisable scene, plus we see Isabela Merced’s Dina and we see the Seraphites running through a dark forest. It’s unmistakably The Last of Us Part II but there’s a little more mixed in to keep things fresh.</p>



<p>This concept was alluded to by the showrunners and writers several months ago, with them stressing that they don’t necessarily need to follow a like-for-like path as they explore The Last of Us in television form.</p>

A limited edition will also be available for 12,980 yen. <span id="more-903455"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via MAGES.:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Rent-A-Girlfriend</em>, the popular romantic comedy by Reiji Miyajima with over 13 million copies sold and serialized in Weekly Shonen Magazine (<a title="Companies > Kodansha [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/kodansha">Kodansha</a>), finally makes its console game debut. Become Kazuya Kinoshita, a worthless college student at a Tokyo university, and live the part-time job lifestyle on Enoshima with charming heroines Chizuru Mizuhara, Ruka Sarashina, Sumi Sakurasawa, and Mini Yaemori in this game-original story. Additionally, by viewing all endings, you will be able to witness Mami Nanami’s story.</p><p><strong>An Original Story Set in the Summer on the Island of Enoshima</strong></p><p><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> an original love story that could have occurred during the third season of the TV anime. Kazuya Kinoshita gathered the funds to shoot a movie starring Chizuru Mizuhara via crowdfunding, but it turned out not enough! To make up for the insufficient funds, Kazuya Kinoshita stays on the island of Enoshima for the summer working part-time jobs with the four heroines. It will be impossible for something not to happen while under the same roof—Kazuya Kinoshita’s delusions are in full effect!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Each Heroine is Fully Voiced</strong></p><p>Each heroine is fully voiced by their same voice actor from the TV anime, allowing you to enjoy the game as if you were watching the show. This includes Chizuru Mizuhara (voiced by Sora Amamiya), Mami Nanami (voiced by Aoi Yuuki), Ruka Sarashina (voiced by Nao Touyama), Sumi Sakurasawa (voiced by Rie Takahashi), and Mini Yaemori (voiced by Yuu Serizawa). Additionally, the game features a game-original theme song called “Cider no Mukou” sung by the five heroines.</p><p><strong>Limited Edition Includes a Four-Disc Drama CD and Official Soundtrack</strong></p><p>The limited edition includes a four-disc drama CD and original soundtrack. The drama CD features four situations that recreate Kazuya Kinoshita’s delusions (maid, non-blood-related sister, newly-married life, and high school student), allowing you to experience fantasy situations as imagined by him. The soundtrack CD features over 30 tracks and totals at over two hours in length, and includes the game-original theme song “Cider no Mukou” sung by the five heroines.</p></blockquote><p>View the first screenshots and box art <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/rent-a-girlfriend-the-horizon-and-the-girl-in-the-swimsuit/august-4-2024/">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_903460"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Nintendo's Q1 2025 <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240802_2e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial report</a> has been released, and the numbers regarding hardware sales aren't too surprising overall. Nintendo Switch sales have decreased significantly, with 2024 being their lowest year. This quarter of the fiscal year, they sold 2.1 million Nintendo Switches between April 1 and June 30, a significant decrease of 46%.</p>
<p>Their total net sales are down by 46.5%, to 246.6 billion Yen, compared to 461.3 billion Yen during the first quarter of 2024's fiscal year. Their operating profit decreased by a significant 70.6%, with ordinary profit dipping by 55.3%. However, this most likely doesn't come as a surprise to most people.</p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch being seven years old, it is not surprising that sales are starting to drop significantly. Both their dedicated video game platforms, mobile games, and IP-related income experienced severe drops. Consolidated hardware sales dropped by 46.4%, with mobile and other IP-related incomes dropping by 53.8%.</p>
<p>Nintendo acknowledges the overall drop in mobile and IP-related sales, saying it's "mainly due to the decrease in income from visual content related to The Super Mario Bros. Movie."</p>
<p>That said, they made a 42.8% profit on other sales, such as merchandise from official Nintendo stores and playing cards, which brought their sales up from 1.9 billion Yen to 2.8 billion Yen.</p>
<p>All of the Nintendo Switch models suffered a significant blow to sales. The original Nintendo Switch suffered the least with a drop of 18.4%, with&nbsp; <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-lite-oled/">Nintendo Switch Lite</a> sales dropping by 56.1% and Nintendo Switch OLED Model sales dropping by 46.3%</p>
<p>Looking at their software sales, two of their IPs were on top for selling over a million units. These two games were Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Luigi's Mansion 2 HD. One other title reached a million units, but it is not disclosed in the financial report as to which game that is.</p>
<p>Sales are drastically different from the previous fiscal year's first quarter. Last year saw the release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which also saw special edition Nintendo Switches released to celebrate the release. Alongside Zelda, The Super Mario Bros. Movie was released, which boosted sales massively.</p>
<p>Overall, the sell-through in this fiscal year is below the level of previous years. Despite that, sales for Princess Peach: Showtime! and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remained stable. However, these two games combined don't match the amount of sell-through sales Nintendo made with The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Princess Peach: Showtime! and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door account for approximately half of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's sales.</p>
<p>Nintendo has a jam-packed year for game releases, so it's possible the next quarter of the fiscal year will be better for them, with games such as The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom and Super Mario Party Jamboree being released.</p>

        <p>UPDATE: Reference to "Project White Sands" has been removed from the actor's resume.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p><strong>Update 5th August, 2024:</strong> Natasha Chandel's website is currently down after it exceeded the bandwidth limit.</p>
<p>Just before the website went down, it had been updated, and all references to Valve's "Project White Sands" had been scrubbed. 
</p>
<p>Original story follows.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Original story:</strong> Brace yourself, Half-Life fans – rumours of Half-Life 3 have been resurrected once again, this time originating from the unassuming resume of a voice actor.</p>
<p>There's a chance that by the time you read this,  Natasha Chandel's <a href="https://www.natashachandel.com/resume/">website</a> has already been, uh, revised, but right now, if you scroll down to the "voice over" section, you'll see reference "Project White Sands (video game)".</p>
<p>Chandel did not name the character(s) she provided voice work for, but the project is clearly marked as belonging to Valve.</p>

<p>"F*ck it, I'm putting my clown makeup back on," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ek3943/comment/lghyhqy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">declared</a> another.</p>
<p>Is this all-out proof? Nope. Sorry. But at the very least, it's proof Valve is possibly developing another game in addition to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-leaked-footage-of-valves-new-game-deadlock">Deadlock</a>, and if it's <em>not</em> Half-Life-related, that is an extraordinarily cruel codename to use…</p>
<p>Court documents recently revealed detailed employment statistics for Valve, the company behind the ubiquitous PC storefront Steam, the Steam Deck handheld, and - yes, still - a team dedicated to game development.</p>
<p>Altogether, that's just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-is-massive-but-far-fewer-people-work-at-valve-than-you-might-think">371 people employed by Valve in 2021</a>, for a company believed to bring in around $6.5bn a year. EA, home to FIFA/FC, which also generates around $6.5bn annually, had 13,700 staff on the payroll this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
