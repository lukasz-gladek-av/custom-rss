			<p>StarCraft is one of Blizzard's most well-revered franchises, and there hasn't been any new content for the franchise since 2017, when the remastered version of the first installment <a href="https://wccftech.com/starcraft-remastered-announced-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was released</a>. Before that, the latest content was in 2016 for StarCraft II, adding the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nova-covert-ops-coming-starcraft-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nova Covert Ops DLC</a> to the game. Both of these games are being added to Game Pass on November 5, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-reveals-overwatch-2-x-my-hero-academia-collab-starcraft-heading-to-pc-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> during yesterday's Xbox Tokyo Game Show 2024 Broadcast. However, there is also interesting news for the franchise's future.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crazy-blizzard-stories-with-jason-schreier-unlocked-661" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Unlocked podcast</a>, Jason Schreier discussed his new book and shared some wild stories about Blizzard. In this podcast, Schreier said that Blizzard is allegedly incubating a StarCraft shooter, with the project being led by Dan Hay, a former Executive Director of Far Cry.</p>
<p>In this podcast, they discuss his new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Play-Nice-Future-Blizzard-Entertainment-ebook/dp/B0CV46H5XL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment</a>, which also covers some of their not publicly known secrets, as well as the incubated StarCraft Shooter. This alleged shooter comes after they previously worked on two StarCraft projects but both have been canceled. StarCraft: Ghost was intended to be a shooter-style game that would tie into the franchise and was announced in 2002.&nbsp; With development being delayed, the development got handed over to Swingin' Ape Studios before that studio was bought by Blizzard. It wasn't until 2014 that the game was officially noted as canceled by Blizzard President Mike Morhaime.</p>
<p>Additionally discussed was the canceled shooter StarCraft: Ares. Ares was just the codename for the game, which had reportedly been in development since 2017 before it was canceled in early June 2019.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the present day, and it seems as if Blizzard is still sitting on a StarCraft shooter. However, none of the participants speaking in the podcast, including Schreier himself, have much faith that the StarCraft shooter will go ahead, considering the first two attempts at developing one have both been canceled.&nbsp; According to his updated knowledge, the StarCraft shooter is still in development at Blizzard. He states that the game is still in production according to the time he finished writing his current book, which is releasing on October 8.</p>
<p>Although his book wasn't written to tell scoops on upcoming games, he does state that he included it as it was "an interesting, useful nugget to include" because Blizzard can't seem to stop themselves from trying to revive a franchise with new games, even if they never see the light of day. "Blizzard cannot quit StarCraft shooters. They cannot, you just can't say goodbye to them," says Schreier on the subject.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Invictus is one of the many projects in the Assassin’s Creed franchise being worked on at Ubisoft. And while many have wondered exactly what this new game will be, new claims have revealed that the Assassin’s Creed Invictus will be a Fall Guys-like game along with details about what that will entail. </p>



<p>First reported online by leaker <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1837577668365373935">xJ0nathan</a>, Assassin’s Creed Invictus is a multiplayer game in which players will compete in multiple rounds of games. </p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-ubisoft-investor-says-it-has-support-of-10-shareholders-for-sale">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-investor-says-it-has-support-of-10-shareholders-for-sale/">Ubisoft Investor Says It Has Support Of 10% Shareholders For Sale</a></h6>



<p>Those games will feature a team deathmatch, free-for-all, and a “speed game where you have to go to luminous points scattered on the map.” As you move through the rounds, players will have the option to select different powers to create a build, of sorts, for use in the game. All of the gameplay will be “very arcade” with even elements like a bubble shield similar to Super Smash Bros.</p>



<p>Other details include a fairly distant camera and maps being select areas from past Assassin’s Creed games. Lastly there are two confirmed characters thus far: Cesare Borgia and Ezio.</p>



<p>Regarding the above information, Insider Gaming can corroborate the legitimacy of the details via multiple sources. The only difference is Insider Gaming has heard it will feature 18 players rather than the 16 in the report.</p>

<p>BLAST Premier: Fall Final 2024 just began its official event earlier yesterday (September, 25), and teams have been amping up the heat while competing against each other. Despite a successful first two days of the event, Team Falcons and Astralis have both found themselves eliminated from the competition.</p>



<h2 id="h-team-falcons-swept-in-2-0-defeat-during-group-stage">Team Falcons Swept in 2-0 Defeat During Group Stage</h2>



<p>While G2 Esports and FaZe Clan tied in the Group A Stage matches, Team Falcons were not so lucky. The team took a harrowing defeat during the Group Stage matches in Copenhagen, with a 2-0 loss. This loss ultimately eliminated the team from moving forward in the Playoffs, putting Natus Vincere in the Semifinals, after the team won both games.</p>



<p>Astralis also struggled to keep up with the momentum that got them to the BLAST Premier: Fall Final 2024 event. The team only managed to take home one map win against both Team Vitality and Spirit, proving to be a heavy loss. Sadly, the team will be heading home after today’s competition.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>FaZe Clan will be going head-to-head against Team Liquid in the Quarterfinals, while G2 Esports will be facing off against Team Spirit. These matches will decide which team will go up against Natus Vincere in the Semifinals.</p>



<p>The Quarterfinals take place tomorrow, September 27, so be ready for the action.</p>







<h2 id="h-blast-premier-begins-with-massive-prize-pool">BLAST Premier Begins With Massive Prize Pool</h2>



<p>BLAST Premier is officially underway, with its Fall Final marking a historic time in Counter-Strike esports history. The event is currently taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark, and will end on September 29.</p>



<p>With a $425,000 prize pool, first place will walk away with $200,000 and also qualify for the World Finals.</p>



<p>The competition is intense and has already created many storylines that have fans intensely involved in the tournament series.</p>

                <p>Metro Awakening made a splash during the latest State of Play, with a new trailer showing off the atmospheric stealth VR experience for PSVR2, Meta Quest, and Steam VR launching on November 7. Metro Awakening is the latest entry in the post-apocalyptic franchise that spans games, books, and more. If you’re interested in learning more about the Metro universe ahead of Awakening’s arrival, then consider diving into the books that inspired the game series.</p><p>Written by Dmitry Glukhovsky, the series begins with the lengthy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0575086254?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metro 2033</a>. Clocking in at over 450 pages, it gives you a closer look at the life of Artyom and the post-apocalyptic world of Moscow.

Well, Fntastic appears to be back, and they're asking for a second chance — and your money.</p><p>In yet another bizarre development to what was already <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-strange-saga-of-the-day-before">a strange saga</a>, the X/Twitter account for Fntastic resurfaced today, announcing a Kickstarter campaign and asking for "your help again to bring Fntastic back." The post links to <a href="https://www.fntastic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a website</a> which claims to lay out the details for Fntastic's next moves.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Once, you helped us create Fntastic through Kickstarter.<br>Today, we need your help again to bring Fntastic back!<br>Learn more and support us: <a href="https://t.co/6CB75yGWnE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/6CB75yGWnE</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fntastic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#fntastic</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/propnight?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#propnight</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/escapefactory?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#escapefactory</a></p>— Fntastic (@FntasticHQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/FntasticHQ/status/1839404741841047686?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>If your first thought is that this whole thing could be a hoax, you'd be forgiven — and frankly, it very well could be. But if it is, it's a pretty elaborate troll, as the website is extensive. It includes an FAQ, a <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/66cf2872c641a645890f1c5d/t/66e3f77eace4a55f13841699/1726216072958/Fntastic-2-0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF detailing its "recovery plan,"</a> contact info, <a href="https://fntastic.store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a merch page</a>, and more. It also links to a Discord server which has mods claiming to be Fntastic devs and a bevy of confused onlookers.</p><p>What's more, the website even includes details and links to a new multiplayer co-op game, Escape Factory. A free demo is currently available via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143630/Escape_Factory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its Steam page</a>, and a Kickstarter page is looking to raise $15,535 <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fntasticgames/escape-factory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to bring the game to fruition</a>. As of press time, the campaign has raised $139 from three backers. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Fntastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube account</a> for Fntastic, which was scrubbed shortly before The Day Before's launch, also posted a trailer for Escape Factory.</p><p>According to the FAQ section of the website, if Escape Factory does not reach its Kickstarter goal, the studio won't be able to return.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/26/fntastic-1727389111387.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A screenshot from what's allegedly Fntastic's new website.</figcaption></figure></output><p>If the whole thing seems a little tone-deaf after the disaster that was The Day Before, the website claiming to be Fntastic at least acknowledges that it might have some trouble regaining consumers' trust. The website says they "deeply apologize to everyone for The Day Before and take full responsibility for what happened."</p><p>"After the closure, we reflected on our past mistakes and initiated significant internal changes to drive radical improvement," the site's FAQ page reads. "We've discontinued the practice of involving external volunteers and are now fully committed to a more professional approach. Honesty, transparency, and community engagement have become our top priorities."</p><p>In terms of who is apparently on the current team, the website admits that it's "smaller, but it still consists of the same people who created all of our previous games." Interestingly, the website makes no mention of Fntastic founders Eduard Gotovtsev and Aisen Gotovtsev, not even in its <a href="https://www.fntastic.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"About Us"</a> section that chronicles the studio's history. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Honesty, transparency, and community engagement have become our top priorities."</p></div><p>The website adds that Fntastic has lost all legal rights to both The Day Before and Propnight, another game developed by the studio before its closure, and elaborates further on some of the things it's learned from The Day Before debacle.</p><p>"Over time, we’ve analyzed the factors that led to The Day Before's unsuccessful launch," the website reads. "These included overly ambitious goals on a low indie budget, a team without AAA tech experience, and embellished marketing, which we deeply regret."</p><p>The X/Twitter account for Fntastic <a href="https://x.com/FntasticHQ/status/1839419735936762212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has</a> <a href="https://x.com/FntasticHQ/status/1839417991328395602" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">been</a> <a href="https://x.com/FntasticHQ/status/1839417030833045606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replying</a> to concerned onlookers ever since the first announcement, as many are, understandably, a little hesitant to trust the studio (if this even <em>is</em> the studio). </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Strange Saga of The Day Before</h3></div></output><p>Fntastic had a tumultous development cycle for The Day Before leading up to its tumultuous launch. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-day-before-announcement-trailer">first trailer debuted back in 2021</a>, gaining traction for what looked to be an exciting post-apocalyptic open world MMO. Hype gave way to skepticism, however, amid controversy over the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-developer-steam-most-wishlisted-game-defends-unpaid-volunteers">studio's use of unpaid volunteers</a>, various delays, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-devs-say-delay-was-planned-before-trademark-dispute">a trademark dispute</a>, and a fan revolt that accused the whole thing of being a scam.</p><p>It all led up to The Day Before's early access launch in December 2023, and once fans were able to finally get their hands on the game, the response was so overwhelmingly negative (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-review">even IGN gave it a rare 1/10</a>) that the servers shut down <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-is-now-well-and-truly-dead-45-days-after-it-came-out">just over a month later</a>. Refunds were distributed to all who purchased The Day Before, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-day-before-dev-promises-refunds-tells-customers-st-happens">with Fntastic telling one player</a>, “This was our first big experience. Sh*t happens.” </p><p>Still, the website saying it's Fntastic is adamant that the team has learned from its mistakes, stating that its core principles are now "honesty, transparency, and professionalism." </p><p>IGN has reached out to Eduard Gotovtsev and Aisen Gotovtsev, as well as a previous email address for Fntastic, for clarification on the legitimacy of the website, and has not heard back yet. We'll update this story if and when we do. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

The WD Black SN850X is one of the fastest PCIe 4.0 SSDs on the market; it works equally well as additional storage for your PlayStation 5 console or as a blazing fast boot drive for your gaming rig. This is one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">best M.2 SSDs for 2024.</a> (The SN850<u>P</u> is mentioned in the roundup, but the SN850<u>X</u> is the exact same SSD only without the official PS5 certification.)</p><h2>2TB WD Black SN850X PS5 SSD with Heatsink</h2><div id="175040" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>WD Black SN850X 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD with Preinstalled Heatsink</h3></p></div><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/wd-black-sn850x-nvme-ssd">SN850X</a> is the latest generation of WD's flagship Black series M.2 SSDs.

It's faster than the previous generation SN850 thanks to newer flash chips (BiCS5 vs BiCS4) and an updated firmware. </p><p>If you plan to install this in your gaming PC, WD includes Game Mode 2.0 utility software that's designed to tune the SSD for better performance during gaming sessions. Unless you have an unlimited budget, 2TB is the size I would recommend for a boot solid state drive; for most people, this is plenty of space for your OS and apps, and the price is still reasonable.</p><p>The SN850X also makes for an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">excellent SSD for your PlayStation 5 console</a>. This is the same SSD as the officially licensed SN850P. It fulfills all of Sony's requirements, including M.2 2280 form factor, minimum 5,500MB/s speed, and PCI-E Gen4x4 interface. Even better, this model comes equipped with a slim aluminum heatsink already preinstalled. It's guaranteed to fit in both the PS5 and PS5 Slim consoles. The SSD comes with a five-year warranty. By the time your warranty runs out, you might have already moved onto the PS6.</p><p>If you're looking for more SSD storage upgrade options for your PS5 console, check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-ssd-deals-for-2023">best PS5 SSD deals of 2023</a>.

                <p>SteelSeries has revealed the latest iteration of its popular Apex Pro keyboards, all of which are built around the new and improved Omnipoint 3.0 switches. These support 40 adjustable levels of actuation, are highly responsive, and offer a unique Protection Mode that helps eliminate accidental key presses. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Apex-OmniPoint-HyperMagnetic-Switches/dp/B0D4RKYZJ5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apex Pro Gen 3</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Apex-OmniPoint-HyperMagnetic-Switches/dp/B0DGZLHN8G?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apex Pro TKL Gen 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Wireless-OmniPoint-HyperMagnetic-Switches/dp/B0DGZ3VV9X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apex Pro TKL Wireless Gen 3</a> are all available right now--so give them a look if you want to update your battlestation before all the big holiday releases.</p><p>Along with the Omnipoint 3.0 switches, most other features are shared across the three devices. You’ll find an OLED smart display to help optimize your settings, a wealth of customizable RGB lights, a premium aircraft-grade aluminum top plate for durability, and a magnetic wrist rest to get you through those long game sessions. You’ll also find sound-dampening foam inside all three keyboards to help smooth out their performance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4373162-71vg6iuhkol._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4373162" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4373162-71vg6iuhkol._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4373162"></a><figcaption>SteelSeries Apex Pro Gen 3</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4373162-71vg6iuhkol._ac_sl1500.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4373163-71wdt9uqbxl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4373164-713vlzcw3fl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4373163,1300-4373164" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4373163-71wdt9uqbxl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4373164-713vlzcw3fl._ac_sl1500.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4373163-71wdt9uqbxl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4373164-713vlzcw3fl._ac_sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>The cheapest option of the three is the Apex Pro TKL Gen 3, clocking in at $220. It’s great for cramped desktops, as its lack of a keypad gives you plenty of space to make sweeping mouse movements. The Apex Pro Gen 3 uses a traditional keyboard layout and is slightly more expensive at $240.</p><p>The most premium of the bunch is the Apex Pro TKL Wireless Gen 3 at $270--but if you’re not a fan of wires, it’s worth the added expense. Instead of a cable, it connects to your system via a USB receiver or Bluetooth. Note that this one is already listed as “currently unavailable,” and it’s unclear when it’ll be back in stock.</p><h2>SteelSeries Apex Pro Gen 3 Keyboards</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Apex-OmniPoint-HyperMagnetic-Switches/dp/B0D4RKYZJ5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apex Pro Gen 3</a> -- $240</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Apex-OmniPoint-HyperMagnetic-Switches/dp/B0DGZLHN8G?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apex Pro TKL Gen 3</a> -- $220</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Wireless-OmniPoint-HyperMagnetic-Switches/dp/B0DGZ3VV9X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apex Pro TKL Wireless Gen 3</a> -- $270</li></ul><p>SteelSeries isn’t the only company churning out new products, as Razer recently launched its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-Wireless-Gaming-Keyboard-PC/dp/B0DD5S8TM8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlackWidow V4 Pro 75% Wireless</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-day-before-team-fntastic-are-back-asking-for-15k-to-develop-new-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-day-before-fntastic-closing-servrs-staying-up-for-now/">The Day Before</a> was a game made in Unreal Engine 5, with the game being in development for many years, to the point people began to think the game wasn't real. The game was released in December 2023 and immediately faced a significant amount of criticism, with plenty calling it a scam. Not only were there legal disputes that Fntastic were facing, but they were also facing multiple accusations of plagiarism and unpaid labor, as well as severe mismanagement. Four days after the game came out, it was removed from sales, with the multiplayer servers shutting down the following months. Fntastic then closed due to poor sales performance but is now attempting to make their return. In a <a href="https://x.com/FntasticHQ/status/1839405959497892270?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1839405959497892270%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=">new post on X</a>, they have made a return on their account FntasticHQ, saying, "Everyone deserves a second chance. We deeply apologize to everyone for The Day Before and take full responsibility for what happened." In addition to their apology, they posted a link to their website, with the title being "<a href="https://www.fntastic.com/fntastic-plan-for-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Fntastic Plan for Recovery</a>."</p>
<p><iframe title="Escape Factory Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5WoYaBl5dM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The website consists of an FAQ as well as pages such as "How you can help Fntastic." They have admitted that their team has gotten smaller, with some team members helping out on a "goodwill basis," which somewhat feeds into their previous issue of unpaid labor.</p>
<p>The new game that they are developing is called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143630/Escape_Factory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Escape Factory</a> and is a new game in the Prop Hunt genre. To develop this game, they have created a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fntasticgames/escape-factory/rewards#reward-UmV3YXJkLVVtVjNZWEprTFRFd01UVTBPVEE1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter</a>, asking the community to help fund the game. It's worth noting that if they do not reach the funding goal, they have stated they will be unable to return. They have stated that if the fundraiser does not meet the specified goal, all funds raised will be fully refunded.</p>
<p>Fntastic not only made The Day Before, but also developed Propnight. However, after the unsuccessful launch of The Day Before, they lost all legal rights to both games. They have admitted that they were "overly ambitious goals on a low indie budget, a team without AAA tech experience, and embellished marketing."</p>
<p>While people paid for this game when it was released, they fully refunded any purchases from The Day Before. At the time of writing, their upcoming game has 29 days left on their Kickstarter, with eight people currently backing it, raising a total of $217 out of their $15,000 goal. The lowest pledge is $3, with the highest bundle costing $12,000, which grants the backers the chance to meet with the Fntastic founders.</p>

Joel has over 30 points of articulation, and he comes equipped with a revolver, shotgun, and machete. There are also several hands available, so you can swap them in or out for when you want to strike the perfect pose. For Ellie, you're also getting a highly articulated and detailed figure, and she comes with a tactical backpack, switchblade, pistol, bow, and arrows.</p><p>It's worth noting that these <em>aren't </em>The Last of Us Part 2 figures, but with some quick shopping, you can buy a few extra toy accessories that look like they came straight from the best-selling sequel.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-day-before-devs-return-with-%E2%80%98fntastic-2-0%E2%80%99-and-a-new-kickstarter-campaign.993858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-day-before-devs-return-fntastic-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I bet you didn’t see this coming.</p>



<p>In December 2023, The Day Before, a long-awaited, highly anticipated survival shooter, was released by Fntastic after years of development. It quickly turned out to be nothing short of a scam, with the game launching in a miserable state, after which Fntastic pulled it offline and shut down the studio.</p>



<p>Now, almost a year since the studio disappeared, the team is back with ‘Fntastic 2.0’.</p>



<p>Before we get started, let’s highlight that this is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-day-before-devs/">same developer who said ‘shit happens’</a> on social media when their game was taken offline.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-guess-who-s-back">Guess Who’s Back?</h2>



<p>In a shocking post on social media, the Fntastic team returned, stating that ‘everyone deserves a second chance’. They posted a link to a new game called ‘Escape Factory’ and stressed that they’re planning to fix their past mistakes. By ‘past mistakes’, they mean the swindling of thousands of gamers that left them a laughingstock of the gaming community.</p>



<p>They’re back on the scene with a Kickstarter that they’re putting together to generate funds to make more games, including the one I’ve just named.</p>



<p>I’m not even kidding:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Regaining trust will be tough, but we're motivated to make more games if our Kickstarter succeeds. With its 'all or nothing' model, contributions will be refunded if we miss the target. We value your support, and all funds will go to development, not profit.</p>— Fntastic (@FntasticHQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/FntasticHQ/status/1839423294422024688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>At the time of writing, the Kickstarter has made a whopping £154 out of a goal of £11,646 (what a random number). If you back their campaign with a $12,000 donation, you’ll get an ‘unforgettable dinner’ with the founders of Fntastic.</p>



<p>This is the most laughable thing I’ve seen in years. They’re actually saying that they need the community’s help if they’re going to revive Fntastic, and they even <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/66cf2872c641a645890f1c5d/t/66e3f77eace4a55f13841699/1726216072958/Fntastic-2-0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published a whitepaper</a> outlining their desire to change. They’ve ‘rebranded’ by changing the colour palette of their logo, and they’re now preaching honesty, transparency, and professionalism.</p>



<p>They also have a new mission!</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our mission is to create games that will be loved for decades.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is brilliant.</p>







<p>Here’s the spiel for their new game, too:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You play as life-weary workers trying to escape the vicious cycle of deadly factories from which there’s no easy way out. Legend has it that only one great and mysterious individual has ever escaped.</p>



<p>Team up with 4-8 players for pure multiplayer co-op physics-based fun challenges. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>If they raise $200,000, they’ll make the game and bring it to all platforms. I can’t see them making 1% of that, but shall we see how far they’re willing to take this?</p>



<p>If you’re going to put your trust in Fntastic 2.0, let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> has arrived, bringing Zelda's first starring role in a mainline entry to Nintendo Switch. This top-down Zelda experience isn't as chunky as its open-world counterparts, but it still has plenty to see, including both main story quests and side activities. Echoes of Wisdom marks another first for the series as well, marking the first game in the franchise to have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-features-franchises-first-female-director/1100-6526641/">female director</a>. Here's how long you can expect it to take to beat The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How long to beat The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</h2><p dir="ltr">Echoes of Wisdom features an open-world map and its main story functions similarly to Tears of The Kingdom and Breath of the Wild in that you are given a few map markers to go to in your preferred order. While you can certainly complete these at your leisure, there aren't as many side activities to get lost doing, although there are definitely some.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Legend Of Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">A typical playthrough for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will take <strong>between 20 to 25 hours</strong>, depending on how much exploring and side quests you do. That said, if you were to focus only on the main quests, you could likely finish as quickly as 15 hours, and finding everything there is to offer will take you upwards of 30 hours. In terms of main objectives, there are a total of seven main dungeons to complete, along with side activities and areas.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-link-between-eras/1900-6418291/">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom 9/10 review</a>, with critic Steven Petite writing, "If Zelda's debut in the spotlight is a one-off, at least it's a memorable adventure. But hopefully this is the beginning of a new legend for the heroine. Echoes of Wisdom's brilliantly integrated echoes system links two eras, proving that the freeform mechanics of the new age can coexist with the franchise's classic formula. Don't mistake this for a spin-off or minor entry between big 'mainline' games: The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a major moment that shouldn't be missed."</p>

            <p>I don't know why we haven't written about Mechabellum before now, but we haven't. Let's correct that. It's an autobattler in which you plonk down squads of stompy robots then watch them win or lose against your opponent's army based on the formations and upgrades you've chosen. After more than a year in Early Access, it's just released version 1.0.

<p>Visually Mechabellum's robots are reminiscent of Supreme Commander, but SupCom was set across huge maps where victory had at least as much to do with economy management as your fighters on the frontline. As an autobattler, Mechabellum frontloads your decision-making in the buying and positioning of units that will then fight without your intervention in arenas that are relatively tiny.
</p>
<p>That means the strategy lies in which units you choose, how they complement each other, where you position them, and how you upgrade them. Fights happen over several rounds, with chances to re-tool your setup in between. During the battle's themselves you're mostly free to just enjoy watching the explosions, although you can call in airstrikes and make other limited contributions to the flow of a fight.
</p>
<p>Mechabellum launched in Early Access last May and has been well received since. The 1.0 release doesn't seem to make any major changes, but optimises the visuals and performance and introduces a multiplayer rank system.
</p>
<p>I haven't much interest in playing 1v1 against strangers online, because I don't want to have to learn a meta or read guides for the best builds. I'm not Matt Cox (RPS in peace). I do fancy watching robots shoot each other with rockets, though, and I've enjoyed similar strategy autobattlers like the tug-o-war of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1291010/Warpips/">Warpips</a>. I'll give it a go against the AI at some point.
</p>
<p>Mechabellum is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/669330/Mechabellum/">available on Steam</a> where a 30% discount means it's currently £8.95/$10.49/€10.35.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-map-to-map-travel-works-in-escape-from-tarkov/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>There’s a lot to love and a lot to hate about Escape From Tarkov. Over the years, developer Battlestate Games has made a handful of odd choices, sometimes ruining the experience for players, such as the infamous Unheard Edition. But lately, it seems like it’s on the right track. Most recently, the studio introduced map to map travel in Escape From Tarkov, allowing players to transition to new raids on different maps without returning to the menu. Here’s how it all works!</p>



<h2 id="h-here-s-how-map-to-map-raids-work-in-escape-from-tarkov">Here’s How Map-to-Map Raids Work in Escape From Tarkov</h2>



<p>The latest update for Escape From Tarkov includes map-to-map transitions, allowing you to continue your raid across multiple zones and levels seemingly indefinitely. You could start in Customs or Factory, then travel to Interchange, then Streets of Tarkov, then to Ground Zero, etc. It’s a neverending cycle that should ramp up the intensity of the extraction shooter.</p>



<p>First and foremost, know that map transitions will be available between locations for all raids, and even Player Scavs may transition between maps to keep the firefights going. That said, there is a transition countdown, so don’t expect to run straight through a map and into another immediately. It does take a little time to activate after a raid begins.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Streets of Tarkov → Ground Zero</strong></li>



<li><strong>Interchange → Streets of Tarkov</strong></li>



<li><strong>Customs → Reserve</strong></li>



<li><strong>Customs → Interchange</strong></li>



<li><strong>Factory → Customs</strong></li>



<li><strong>Factory → The Lab</strong></li>



<li><strong>Woods → Factory</strong></li>



<li><strong>Woods → Lighthouse</strong></li>



<li><strong>Reserve → Customs</strong></li>



<li><strong>Reserve → Woods</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lighthouse → Reserve</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lighthouse → Woods</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shoreline → Lighthouse</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-can-you-travel-between-maps-in-escape-from-tarkov-pve">Can You Travel Between Maps in Escape From Tarkov PvE?</h2>



<p>While it seems like most often, the major changes launching in Escape From Tarkov primarily affect the PvP players, this time around, Battlestate is gracing the PvE community, too. You can travel between maps in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-tarkov-pve-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape From Tarkov PvE</a>, just like you can in the PvP mode, which means completing quests and keeping the momentum is possible without raging against cheaters or sweat lords.</p>



<p>Does the new map transition update entice you to return to Escape From Tarkov? Let us know in the comments below, or perhaps you can find a squad to play online with in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forums</a>?!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-devs-have-floated-the-idea-of-a-pillars-of-eternity-tactics-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>While Obsidian Entertainment continues to work on Avowed ahead of its launch next year, studio design director Josh Sawyer has revealed that some members of the team have expressed interest in creating a Pillars of Eternity tactics game.</p><p>The director behind projects like Pentiment, Fallout: New Vegas, and Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire spoke about the studio’s desires behind the scenes during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMrwkIC-Ixc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Limit Break Network</u></a>. When asked about Obsidian’s interest in creating more stories set in Eora, he mentioned that a more tactical experience is one idea that at least a few members of the team have brought to the table.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/26/pillars-of-eternity-1727384408647.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Some Obsidian developers have floated the idea of a Pillars of Eternity tactics game.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“There have been a number of people, actually, at the studio who have floated the idea of a Pillars tactics game,” Sawyer teased. “Tactics games are very interesting to me, and they occupy a really interesting space in the marketplace because the audience for them is not huge, typically, but very passionate.”</p><p>It’s an admission that may have some Pillars of Eternity fans frothing at the mouth, but this doesn’t mean a tactical experience set in that universe is in the works. Sawyer touches on why it might be difficult to pull a game like this together, explaining that, while big-name series like Fire Emblem have managed to draw attention for decades, it’s tough for many tactics games to reach that same level of success. Still, he says there are “a lot of people at the studio” who would like to see a Pillars of Eternity tactics game come to be.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“So, who knows? Maybe someday.</p></div><p>“It’s something that a number of people have talked about and thought about,” Sawyer continues. “It’s a hard one to make a case for. Like, how big should it be? What should the size of the team be? Every once in a while, we’ll bring it up and be like, ‘Oh, we could, maybe. I don’t know. We could, maybe…’ I will say, not just for myself, but there are a lot of people at the studio who have pitched their own versions of a Pillars tactics game. So, who knows? Maybe someday.”</p><p>Whether a Pillars of Eternity tactics game will come to be remains to be seen. In the meantime, Obsidian is still hard at work on its Xbox and PC fantasy RPG, Avowed. Set in the Pillars universe, the studio has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-dev-once-again-asked-about-skyrim-comparison-points-to-the-outer-worlds"><u>told fans to expect an experience</u></a> that falls more in line with something like its past game, The Outer Worlds, than The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim. Following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-delayed-to-february-2025-to-give-players-backlogs-some-breathing-room"><u>a delay</u></a>, Avowed is now set to launch February 18, 2025.</p><p>While we know Obsidian plans to eventually release <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/outer-worlds-2-announced-xbox-e3-2021-summer-of-gaming">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, its other plans for the future remain a mystery. Last year, studio CEO Feargus Urquhart teased <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-ceo-id-love-to-make-another-fallout-before-i-retire"><u>he would like to make at least one more Fallout game before he retires</u></a>, though no such project has been announced by Obsidian yet. While a potential Pillars of Eternity 3 has also not be confirmed, Sawyer did say last year that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/josh-sawyer-would-make-pillars-of-eternity-3-if-given-a-baldurs-gate-3-sized-budget"><u>he would make a third game so long as his team got a Baldur’s Gate 3-sized budget</u></a>.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <p>
The end is in sight for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/simpsons-tapped-out">The Simpsons: Tapped Out</a>, EA's long-running and hugely successful free-to-play city builder. The publisher has announced it's removing the mobile game from app stores this October, some 12 years after its initial release.
</p>
<p>
The Simpsons: Tapped Out launched for iOS and Android <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-the-simpsons-tapped-out">back in 2012</a>, challenging players to rebuild Springfield after Homer Simpson's negligence causes a nuclear meltdown. By 2014, it had generated over $130 million in revenue, and it's continued to receive updates since then. 
</p>
<p>
But 12 years on, development is officially coming to an end - a decision EA called an "emotional one" in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheSimpsonsTappedOut/posts/pfbid02EAvK322GtkFzFo5xpCDihMmz8hwtmRuXE5S3KSNXFUd6v3sk9UCJ8e1J9aSdRWi9l?locale=en_GB">statement</a> shared on The Simpsons: Tapped Out's official Facebook page.

<p>
"It has been a remarkable journey," the statement continued, "and we are grateful that we've been able to deliver 308 updates, 831 characters and including today’s final farewell 1,463 questlines. As our journey comes to a close, we offer our sincerest thanks to you, the players, who have made this all possible."
</p>
<p>
Following todays news, all in-app purchases have been disabled and The Simpsons: Tapped Out will be removed from app stores on 31st October this year. Players won't have to wave goodbye to their virtual Springfields immediately, however - EA is keeping Tapped Out's servers live for a little bit longer, with the game set to go permanently offline and inaccessible on 24th January next year.
</p>
<p>
"We're aware of an issue with the in-game currency to donut conversion and are investigating", the publisher wrote in a follow-up post, which feels like an appropriately surreal note to end on.

<p>With so many upcoming video games to keep an eye on, especially on PC, you really must whittle down the list by ensuring you can run everything. It wouldn’t do to become overhyped for an upcoming title and then find out your system can’t handle the game. But I don’t think you have to worry about that here. Here’s a look at the Fantasian Neo Dimension system requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-fantasian-neo-dimension-pc-system-requirements">The Fantasian Neo Dimension PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>Overall, you don’t have to worry much about the Fantasian Neo Dimension system requirements. It’s an old-school RPG with an art style and graphics that match, so the PC requirements aren’t overly demanding. It appears an old gaming computer can run the game without any issue, or perhaps even a laptop, though we’re hoping to play Fantasian Neo Dimension on Steam Deck, so fingers crossed for support there!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 3 1200 / Intel Core i3-6100</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD Radeon RX 460 / Intel Arc A380 / Nvidia GeForce GT 1030</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 11</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 15 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>

</ul>







<h2 id="h-when-can-you-play-fantasian-neo-dimension">When Can You Play Fantasian Neo Dimension?</h2>



<p>The upcoming RPG from developer Mistwalker Corporation and publisher Square Enix is nearly upon us. You can play FANTASIAN Neo Dimension on <strong>December 5, 2024</strong>. </p>



<p>If you intend to play the turn-based RPG, you can pre-order a copy now for $49.99 on Steam. There’s even a pre-order bonus available for buying the game early, which includes an in-game item that increases the overall EXP you earn in a battle for whichever character equips the item before combat. But it’s important to note that you can still find the item in-game by playing through the story, and it’s not solely a pre-order bonus that you’ll miss out on if you choose not to pre-order.</p>



<p>Can your system run Fantasian Neo Dimension? Do you intend to buy the RPG? Let us know in the comments below, or visit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our official community forums</a> to start a discussion!</p>

Everything you encounter has been crafted to convey the physical, often fragile, natural world of paper, amidst a story interwoven with threads of wistful intrigue.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Transform to Use Powerful Abilities</strong> – Discover new forms to traverse the world, solve puzzles, and best your foes. Roll through obstacles and enemies alike as a hardy Armadillo, traverse the treetops and pound pests as a mighty Ape, and leap to previously unreachable heights as a formidable Frog.</li><li><strong>Protect a Fragile Origami World</strong> – A powerful force of digital creatures—the Blight—is invading the world, defiling the delicate natural balance that has held sway for an age. As Hiro, an enigmatic performer (and master of the art of folding) from Shishiki village, it falls to you to cleanse the mind-warped inhabitants of this world, and to bring peace back to the land.</li><li><strong>Discover Untold Mysteries</strong> – Explore every nook and cranny and discover all the world’s hidden secrets. Unfold into a sheet of paper to ride fiery updrafts, or to slide under deadly traps. Or become a paper plane to traverse dangerous chasms.</li><li><strong>Beat Your Enemies to a Pulp</strong> – This origami world is a fragile place, and you’ll need your wits about you to protect it. Wield Hiro’s paper fan to blow away the Blight, or pound, pummel, or poison them using your litany of papery powers.</li><li><strong>Savor a Soothing Japanese Soundtrack</strong> – Bask in a soundscape composed using traditional Japanese instruments and styles—specially crafted to evoke the variety of themes, characters and settings of <em>Hirogami</em>.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
