Did you have a fine old time in Blackreach, the mazy, Dwemer-built underside of Skyrim's sprawling mountain map? Do you like murdering Ents in slow motion? Do you want to see smells? You might be interested in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-axis-unseen">The Axis Unseen</a>, which has just launched on Steam - it's the work of former Bethesda developer Nate Purkeypile, one of the big brains behind Blackreach.</p> <!--more-->
<p>The Axis Unseen isn't an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, nor is it a work of genre fantasy like Elder Scrolls. It's an open world archery hunting sim, set in a "heavy metal horror" universe, with an appropriately loud soundtrack composed by post-metallurgical maestro Clifford Meyer of Red Sparowes fame.
</p>
<p>
The game's monsters can smell you based on the wind direction, and you can track them based on footprints and blood trails. This isn't some pious exercise in realism, however: you also get a sorcerous bow with arrows that can distort time and change the weather. Arrow effects can be combined, Magicka-style, and there are also unlocks that enhance your senses. "See scent particles," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1807810/The_Axis_Unseen/">the Steam page enthuses</a>. "Feel the warmth left behind on their tracks. See colors that no human has ever seen." I'm not sure my graphics card can handle colours beyond human comprehension, though the system specs don't look too brutal.
</p>
<p>
I played an early build of The Axis Unseen at GDC's Day Of The Devs this year, and swiftly got myself stepped on by Bigfoot. In the 10 minutes or so before I was stepped on by Bigfoot, I particularly enjoyed the game's shamanistic in-world HUD design, with health, power availability and how much noise you're making visible as glowing glyphs on your wrists and equipment. I wasn't especially blown away by the hunting element, but it's hard to form a clear impression of such delicacies when you're surrounded by game developers bellowing about the afterparty. 
</p><p>
The full game is "20 hours long, more if you're a completionist", according to the Steam page. Graham is reviewing this, I think, or at least, putting together some lengthier thoughts about it. He says he's interested because archery is the only good part of Skyrim, but don't mind Graham - he's always saying things like that.

It’s grim, it’s moody, it’s empathetic to the very human atrocities at its dark heart. It is also, blessedly, pretty short by modern standards. Meaning, thankfully, you won’t be spending the entire month trying to clear this thing.</p><p>But, that leaves a big chunk of spooky month remaining, and needless to say, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is a tough act to follow in terms of that exact horror wavelength. Since Christophe Gans is taking his sweet French time <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHDUlTa1CQc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHDUlTa1CQc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bringing <em>Silent Hill 2</em> to the big screen</a></span>, we’re gonna have to methadone it for this Halloween. But these six films will fill the gap better than you think, in terms of the very specific mood and themes that made James Sunderland’s blessed hellride so good.</p><p>Click on to read through six movies that’ll pick up that mood and run with it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9fca836e1dacac5c2774d279c80dc913" data-recommend-id="image://9fca836e1dacac5c2774d279c80dc913" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1076" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shutter Island" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shutter Island" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9fca836e1dacac5c2774d279c80dc913" data-recommend-id="image://9fca836e1dacac5c2774d279c80dc913" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1076" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shutter Island" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Nothing but love to Christophe Gans—I still think the first <em>Silent Hill</em> flick is better than folks give it credit for—but four years after he took a good honest crack at bringing the cursed town to life, along came one of the GOATs, Martin Scorsese, and he delivered on all this series’ deeper promises without even intending to, and with a murderer’s row (pun unintended) of prestige actors involved. And, of course, they’re led by Scorsese’s current favorite, Leo DiCaprio.</p><p>Not, there’s no twitchy leg monsters or Pyramid Heads running around, but there is an unnerving misty island asylum, a mystery concerning a murdered wife, a subterranean netherworld where the truly insane taunt our so-called hero, a damaged nurse repentant for her actions, and one hell of a twist that <em>Silent Hill 2</em> fans will genuinely appreciate. Basically, all the wonderfully fucked-up psychological torment, guilt, shame, and fear that a lot of <em>Silent Hill</em> media gets wrong, Scorsese gets right without breaking a sweat.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a6db8ae3aaf7afdc9588e44fbf6817ab" data-recommend-id="image://a6db8ae3aaf7afdc9588e44fbf6817ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Possession." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Possession." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Gaumont</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a6db8ae3aaf7afdc9588e44fbf6817ab" data-recommend-id="image://a6db8ae3aaf7afdc9588e44fbf6817ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Possession." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you could somehow distill pure not-from-concentrate Divorced Guy Energy and pour it onto celluloid, you’d get something that vaguely resembled <em>Possession</em>. It takes a particularly fucked up, jilted mind to take a film about a marriage dissolving to where this goes, to say nothing of how disjointed and coldly malevolent it turns out.</p><p>James Sunderland got off light. His wife getting a wasting disease and becoming an angrier, more hostile version of herself is one thing. Sam Neill’s Mark is married to a woman (Isabelle Adjani) who leaves their young child neglected in an apartment for hours on end, has a random collection of dismembered body parts in a fridge in a separate apartment across town, had what can only be described as a full-body miscarriage in a subway station, and is apparently having the most incredible sex of her life with a murderous tentacle creature. Mark responds by getting involved in seething, violent arguments with her that end in murder and hate sex. Raise your game, Mary Sunderland.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="71936e5e6ae42ad52992007ad2f00d6b" data-recommend-id="image://71936e5e6ae42ad52992007ad2f00d6b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1060" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob's Ladder" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jacob's Ladder" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Tri-Star Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="71936e5e6ae42ad52992007ad2f00d6b" data-recommend-id="image://71936e5e6ae42ad52992007ad2f00d6b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1060" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob's Ladder" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This one’s mandatory viewing for cinephile <em>Silent Hill</em> fans, since this film’s DNA is all over the games, from the twitchy faces co-opted for the enemy designs, to James Sunderland literally wearing Jacob Singer’s outfit.</p><p>But the connection is less about the aesthetics than the tone. It’s a story existing in the surreal, incomprehensible middle-ground between life and death, where angels and demons both try to tell poor tortured Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) something he can’t or won’t understand through increasingly violent means. The drama seems to drag until it all falls into place later in the film, but even then, just like the best moments in the <em>Silent Hill</em> games, it’s a mood unlike anything else.</p><p>Oh, and in case anyone’s wondering, yes, there was a 2019 remake; yes, it was real bad.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="69b385a7101592c1dd0ba9a09c55c84e" data-recommend-id="image://69b385a7101592c1dd0ba9a09c55c84e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1007" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Brood" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Brood" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->New World Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69b385a7101592c1dd0ba9a09c55c84e" data-recommend-id="image://69b385a7101592c1dd0ba9a09c55c84e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1007" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Brood" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you aren’t ready for the nasty European flavor of psychsexual horror on film, don’t worry, David Cronenberg has you covered. Cronenberg’s also got Divorced Guy Energy going on, but his approach at least has a conversation about mental health and a therapist involved. Granted, therapy involves turning negative emotions and experiences into homicidal toddlers who murder whoever you talked about in the last session, but, y’know, still therapy.</p><p>As much as it is definitely A David Cronenberg Movie, there’s a lot of sadness and empathy for the factors that made Oliver Reed’s wife the way she is, but mostly a hell of a lot of anger. If you’re one of those people who thought the Maria ending was the way to go in <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, this should be your jam, because this basically has the same idea.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ee3ca66ed476369324fba6e7f5b04ac" data-recommend-id="image://5ee3ca66ed476369324fba6e7f5b04ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1082" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Skinamarink" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Skinamarink" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shudder</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ee3ca66ed476369324fba6e7f5b04ac" data-recommend-id="image://5ee3ca66ed476369324fba6e7f5b04ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1082" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Skinamarink" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the things that a lot of old-schoolers—even the ones who generally liked the remake—complained about with Bloober Teams approach to <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is that there’s a certain level of jankiness, graininess, and brokenness about the original game that’s just gone by necessity. There’s something that hits different about staring into a hallway, your light barely even penetrating the darkness, bouncing off of a vague abstraction of a lived-in apartment building or abandoned hospital, as opposed to a lovingly crafted, photoreal rendition of the same. Your mind just meets the abstraction halfway, and if it’s got any semblance of an imagination, it’ll craft terrors for you that Hollywood money can’t buy.</p><p><em>Skinamarink</em> is 100 minutes of that feeling. A film taking its sweet time, stripping away every guard rail of typical horror media. The two children at its center wake up one night to find out their parents have disappeared. Then the doors. Then the windows. Then the lights. And then the shadows start moving. And then there are voices calling the kids upstairs. And mom’s upstairs. but something is breaking her bones. But you never actually <em>see</em> any of this in any discernible sense. Now, that does require a lot of buy-in from the viewer, because a mind that can’t really surrender its imagination like that will just see a 100-minute movie about two kids watching cartoons and yawn. But still. Turn out your lights, turn off your phone, watch this sucker in silence. You might be surprised where it takes you.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7511082e0cfb89cdf67895150272644a" data-recommend-id="image://7511082e0cfb89cdf67895150272644a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Mist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Mist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dimension Films</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7511082e0cfb89cdf67895150272644a" data-recommend-id="image://7511082e0cfb89cdf67895150272644a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Mist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Is it an obvious choice? Sure. The original novella is the source of the whole conceit of <em>Silent Hill</em> being covered in fog (<em>Half-Life</em> also cribbed its premise from the original novella). It’s also one of the best Stephen King adaptations ever made, if not <em>the</em> best, and ‘tis very much the season for that. It’s also got a slew of great performances across the board, including the late, great Andre Brougher. For the strict gamers, Sam Witwer of <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Days Gone</em> fame has a small but important role here. But more than anything, especially the more we watch real life splinter into weird pseudo-religious fiefdoms dealing with the threat of apocalypse with fear and bloodshed, it’s only become a more powerful and prescient piece of work since it was released. Mrs. Carmody is EVERYWHERE now.</p><p>But yes, on top of all of that, it’s also the only place in non-game media to get your fix of that special feeling <em>SH2</em> gives you right from the start, of following something unidentifiable into the mist, and seeing it get swallowed up by unholy terror by the end. Do yourself a favor: Don’t stream it. Buy it on disc, roll with the black &amp; white cut, it’s a very different ride.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The package includes a remaster of 2011’s <em>Sonic Generations</em> and a brand-new campaign starring Shadow the Hedgehog. Y’all, <em>Shadow Generations </em>is the best <em>Sonic </em>game in the past 20 years, and I spent a good 20 hours running around its open zone finding all the collectibles I could. That means I can give you a few pointers on how best to use your time as you try to reach that coveted 100 percent completion. Here are a few things to know before jumping into <em>Shadow Generations</em>.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196055,196646" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h6383"><a id=""></a><strong>Consider playing <em>Sonic Generations </em>first</strong></h2><p>This might seem like a wild thing to suggest, but while <em>Shadow Generations </em>is easily the big selling point of the package, the original <em>Sonic Generations </em>is also here and it feels substantially worse to play. However, part of the reason it felt bad to go back to was because I’d just spent 20 hours in <em>Shadow Generations </em>at that point and gotten used to the tightness of its controls. If you want to play both games, it may be worth hopping into <em>Sonic Generations </em>first, just so you don’t have to go back to something that feels a little dated compared to its counterpart. If you never played the original, it’ll also help contextualize <em>Shadow Generations</em>, as Shadow’s story doesn’t do a whole lot to explain what’s going on with the blue blur and all his friends. It will also explain why you don’t actually fight Sonic in the campaign. Just something to consider.</p><h2 id="h6384"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t try and get a perfect run your first time through</strong></h2><p>Having been a high-score hound in previous <em>Sonic </em>games, I’ve always had a bad habit of trying to get a near-perfect run the first time I play through a level. Don’t be like me. If you fall down a hole or lose all your rings, keep running. It’s always fun when you manage to get an S rank the first go around, but if you’re unwilling to move forward until you make that no damage/no restart run, you’re gonna get stuck and waste time you could be spending seeing new levels and story. Come back to a level later. It’ll be there when you get back.</p><h2 id="h6385"><a id=""></a><strong>If you see a machine part, grab it immediately</strong></h2><p>Some of the many collectibles you’ll find in <em>Shadow Generations </em>are bolts, screws, washers, and other mechanical parts lying around the White Space map. If you see one of these, stop what you’re doing and grab it. Even if you’ve gotta run around the map to find the right bouncer to send you flying to it or floating platform to jump across to get to it, these little fuckers are the biggest pain in the ass to find in all of <em>Shadow Generations</em>. Unlike other collectibles that are either on the map or readily visible, these parts are tucked away in the corners of the map and are tiny enough that you might overlook them even from a birds-eye view.

Most of them are marked on the map; however, I encountered a handful that weren’t labeled for some reason and had to go looking for them. You open these with keys you find in stages and challenge levels, which means you may stumble upon a chest you can’t open until you’ve played a bit further. When this happens, try to screenshot the area or take note of where the chest is in case it’s one that the game, for some reason, doesn’t show on the map.</p><h2 id="h6387"><a id=""></a><strong>Finishing the game will make collecting easier</strong></h2><p>When you’re done with the main story, you’ll still be able to play levels, run around the White Space, and finish filling out your collection. Shadow gains powers throughout the game that let him traverse different parts of the map, and without getting into spoilers, the final ability you acquire is basically an easy mode button for traversal. So while you should absolutely grab items when you see them, just know this power will make collecting items pretty painless.</p><figure id="" data-id="268c5447f0f9dba1c25a481ea81011df" data-recommend-id="image://268c5447f0f9dba1c25a481ea81011df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Black Doom and Shadow have a staring contest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Doom and Shadow have a staring contest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="268c5447f0f9dba1c25a481ea81011df" data-recommend-id="image://268c5447f0f9dba1c25a481ea81011df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Black Doom and Shadow have a staring contest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h6388"><a id=""></a><strong>Take the time to read Gerald’s journal</strong></h2><p>One type of collectible you’ll find are pages of Doctor Gerald Robotnik’s journal. This is for the real lore sickos who want a new look at Shadow’s creation, the doctor’s descent into madness, and even a bit of a peek into series antagonist Doctor Eggman’s family drama. You’ll find these pages on balloons floating around the White Space.

However, if you notice you’ve done everything but it still doesn’t say you’ve hit 100 percent completion, it might be because the hard mode bosses and challenges count as separate stages from their normal difficulty counterparts.

<p>There won’t be a sequel to The Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and the team that built the game no longer exists at Ubisoft. According to a new rumor from <a href="https://x.com/gautoz/status/1848742322319548852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">French journalist Gautoz</a>, Ubisoft has disbanded the team behind the game after it failed to reach internal expectations.</p>



<p>A sequel for the game was also pitched, but the company rejected it.</p>







<p>The news was first revealed during Gautoz’s show on the Origami YouTube channel. The show is in French, but a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-has-disbanded-the-team-behind-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-game-did-not-reach-expectations-and-sequel-was-refused.1016355/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">user from Reset Era</a> summarized the report.</p>



<p>The report claims that a decision about the future of the game was decided “a few weeks after the release”. It was made clear by Ubisoft that after releasing DLC and cosmetics for the game, support would be done. It was also said that members of the core dev team fought for the aforementioned sequel and even more expansions.</p>



<p>Lastly, it’s said that Ubisoft didn’t want another game because those higher up in the company because it could “cannibalize” the potential long term sales of the first title.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to multiple sources on the legitimacy of the rumor. Should any new information come in, this article will be updated accordingly. Until then, please take this information with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Earlier today, a <a href="https://www.glitched.online/the-wolf-among-us-2-reportedly-facing-development-issues-and-possible-cancellation/">whistleblower</a> claimed development of The Wolf Among Us 2 was in peril, and developers at Telltale were at a "critical point where they might have no choice but to shelve it".</p>
<p>Now, in a statement shared with Eurogamer, Telltale has assured us that work on the game continues on.</p>

<p>"As a rule, we don't comment on rumours and unsubstantiated reddit threads,"  a Telltale PR told us. "But development on The Wolf Among Us 2 continues and we're excited to share more about the game with Telltale fans and our community when the time is right."</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> animated series Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft has generally been met with middling reviews since its launch earlier this month, but Tomb Raider 2013 writer Rhianna Pratchett has called out one particular element for praise.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Pratchett said she had not yet watched the show herself, but had been "glad to hear the series has touched upon Lara's PTSD after her experiences". Pratchett noted this "was an area we weren't allowed to explore in the games", despite the narrative team wanting to do so.</p>

</figure>
<p>Pratchett spoke to me about Lara's PTSD journey last year, when she revealed that she and narrative designer John Stafford had actually pitched "playable nightmares" to Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics. "I had the idea that she could have these scenarios from the first game that had got kind of twisted in her mind," Pratchett told me at the time. Crystal ultimately did not go for this idea.</p><p>In the Tomb Raider animated series, Lara experiences flashbacks and nightmares relating to her time on Yamatai, and the resulting fallout of those close to her, such as Sam. And this brings us on to another thing Pratchett said she appreciated about Netflix's show: that it focuses more on Lara's personal life outside of hunting for artefacts in every corner of the earth.</p>
<p>"Lara's personal life and friendships and how she navigates the real world have always been fun areas to explore beyond the games," Pratchett told me.</p>
<p>"These were areas that both Gail [Simone] and I touched a lot upon in our runs on the Dark Horse comics -  creating scenarios like Sam fighting off someone with a close-combat cupcake, and Lara taking on bad guys in the depths of the London Underground whilst dressed as one of the Bennet sisters," Pratchett continued, reflecting on her work on the Tomb Raider comics.</p>
<p>"Sometimes it's silly, or irreverent, or just refreshing, but exploring that blurry line where the hero meets the human is always wonderfully fertile ground."</p>

<p>As for the future, Crystal Dynamics is currently working on a new Tomb Raider entry with Amazon. In August, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">development is "going well"</a>.  Along with its upcoming game, Amazon also has a Tomb Raider TV project in the works with Fleabag's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> attached.</p><p>Earlier this month, Aspyr announced Tomb Raider 4 - 6 Remastered - which comprises souped up versions of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-last-revelation">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a> (1999), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-chronicles">Tomb Raider: Chronicles</a> (2000), and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness">Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</a> (2003) - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-of-the-worst-reviewed-tomb-raider-games-is-getting-the-remastered-treatment-and-i-am-here-for-it">will be released next year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Metal Slug Tactics has got a release date, and that date is November 5th. Dotemu confirmed the news with a brand new trailer, that also revealed three more playable characters. Those characters are the Ikari Warriors, Clark Still, Ralf Jones, and Leona Heidern. You can check out the new Metal Slug Tactics trailer below, which shows the characters in action.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metal Slug Tactics - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DYLtBnTjdvk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There has been a bit of a wait for Metal Slug Tactics, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/11/metal-slug-tactics-is-a-tactical-rpg-spin-off-from-the-classic-run-and-gun-shooter/">which was first revealed in 2021</a>. In 2022, developer<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/14/metal-slug-tactics-developer-acquired-by-focus/"> Leikir Studio was acquired by Focus Home Interactive</a>. Later in 2022, there was more news that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/12/metal-slug-tactics-delayed-to-2023/">Metal Slug Tactics was going to be delayed to 202</a>3. Obviously, the game did not release in that year either, but at least it is coming out before the end of this year.</p>
<p>Descriptions for the new characters have been released alongside the trailer too, giving a sense of each one’s playstyle:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><b>Clark Still:</b>&nbsp;Originally hailing from the Ikari Warriors series and previously playable in&nbsp;Metal Slug 6, Clark’s immense strength and wrestling experience allows this tanklike ally to relocate enemies on the map and dish out wide-reaching, status-inflicting damage.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Ralf Jones:</b>&nbsp;Also returning for battle from the Ikari Warriors series and&nbsp;Metal Slug 6, Ralf is a master of short-range combat, packing devastating punches and the ability to charge at enemies head-on like a raging bull.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Leona Heidern:</b>&nbsp;A newer addition to the Ikari Warriors, Leona is a revered fighter capable of replacing fallen enemies with decoy allies; she can distract and overwhelm enemy forces in her distinct approach to dominating the combat zone.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As the name implies, Metal Slug Tactics is taking things in a bold new direction. It may feature the same heroes, visuals, and imagery of SNKs arcade classics, albeit from a new perspective. We’re suckers for turn-based tactical RPGs here at TheSixthAxis and, beyond the Metal Slug name, we want to see the milieu of customisation and roguelike elements that are at play when Tactics launches on November 5th for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S and Switch.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shotgun-king-is-roguelike-chess-with-a-shotgun">Shotgun King</a> developers Punkcake Délicieux have quietly rolled out another ticklish oddity in the shape of Build The Sun, a work-in-progress 2D god sim. In Build The Sun you preside over a tribe of alarming yet cute inkblot creatures, who sometimes remind me of Pikmin and sometimes, of that awful 'roided-up panther monster from the opening stretch of Another World. Your objective is, indeed, to build the sun, because there isn't one: the game's pastoral pixelart world is engulfed in darkness.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
It starts with a single, scurrying inkblot creature, hefting a solitary flame through the shadows. Who lit that first flame? Does this world have a Prometheus? There is no time to ponder, for a helpful arrow ushers you toward a ready-made pile of sticks. 
</p>
<p>
Hold-click on the pile to ignite it (make sure you actually hold till the fire is ablaze, as the current version of the game will crash otherwise). Now, you have a small circle of light that attracts other inkblot creatures. The fire craves growth, as advertised by silhouetted icons for burnable resources when you mouse-over the blaze. These can be obtained by hold-clicking on things like trees and rocks, causing your industrious followers to automatically cluster and nibble the object down to its rudiments.
</p>
<p>
As the fire develops, spilling the light further and further, the game gets more complex. You don't have to burn all the resources you gather; you can use them to construct things like huts and windmills. I'm not sure what these buildings do yet, after 15 minutes with the current build, but I imagine huts increase your population. Everything is left for you to figure out - there's no guidance beyond the silhouetted icons. It appears there's plenty to discover, or at least, that the process of feeding the conflagration is compulsive. Commenters on <a href="https://punkcake.itch.io/build-the-sun">the Itch.io downloads page</a> say they've been tending to their miniature suns for hours.
</p><p>
The current version of Build The Sun is one of many fruits of <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/56">Ludum Dare's 56th gamejam</a>. It was made in 72 hours according to the theme "tiny creatures". "We're definitely going to keep working on this one, so you may also consider this version as a very early demo," the devs note. I wish them all the best with it. I have a thing for weird sun-themed games. If you share that fetish, may I also recommend <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dyson-sphere-program">Dyson Sphere Program</a>?

As a high-tech thriller, the game required a musical score that evoked the science of expert intelligence gathering – and that approach began with the opening cinema. While this prologue sequence focused on the news and popular sentiment surrounding events in recent history, I wanted my score to emphasize technology, so I prepared some satellite telemetry and data entry sounds that I could use during composition:</span></p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7l85AXfC--g" height="nullpx" width="100%" data-testid="iframe" scrolling="auto"></iframe><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s see how that worked in the cinema:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yIHsygEcsPc" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was a somewhat understated use of science sound design, so let’s now check out a more overt example. In the Spyder video game for Apple Arcade, developer Sumo Digital created an over-the-top 1960s spy adventure starring a tiny robotic spider. Creative direction for the sound of this game included a groovy 60s-style spy score and lots of retro futuristic sound design, so I made extra efforts to inject that famously quirky sixties sci-fi audio palette into my musical compositions:</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a rel="nofollow" data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/gdc-2024-dial-up-the-diegetics-the-animal-kingdom" target="_self">GDC 2024 Dial Up the Diegetics: The Animal Kingdom</a></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKBMZSvkXZc" height="300px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There were lots of opportunities to spotlight this sound design approach in my score for Spyder.

The Fail Factory VR game from Armature Studio dropped players into the roles of interns manning an out-of-control robot assembly line. It was my job to make the situation feel as comedically hectic as possible. So, along with a peppy jazz style, I absolutely jammed my music full of robot factory sound design. Here’s a taste of some of the sound assets I was using in this project – these were meant to give the impression of “electronics run amok.”:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0X1fAqsBg5g" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can see that, unlike the sound effects I used in Spyder and Shattered State, these sounds for Fail Factory are particularly aggressive and strident.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-24-data-update-2024-25<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sports Interactive and Sega have announced that there won't be a&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 24&nbsp;</em>data update for the 2024/25 season ahead of the release of&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1848709640751927326" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the two studios say that although they've been "exploring" the possibility of an update for the existing game, implementing such a thing would be a "substantial undertaking" which would divert "critical resources" from&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>.</p>
<p>Essentially, the studios say it would be impossible to "lift assets" being used in&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>and drop them into&nbsp;<em>FM24&nbsp;</em>"without recreating them in full". Since&nbsp;<em>FM25&nbsp;</em>will contain data from the 2024/25 season, the studios would have to recreate that data within&nbsp;<em>FM24</em>'s engine.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-24-data-update-2024-25-menus.jpg?itok=JicnpJtr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-24-data-update-2024-25-menus.jpg?itok=TSbLvbBN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't expect this screen to show up-to-date info for the 2024/25 season.</figcaption></figure><p>The same logic applies to "the many competition rules, translations and database changes that cannot be back ported", owing to the fact that&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>will sport (no pun intended) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-dev-update">an entirely new engine</a>.</p>
<p>Updated assets and data would "both be required to obtain licensor approval", Sports Interactive and Sega say, and despite "a good initial response" from many licensors, the work involved seems like it would simply be too much.</p>
<p>In case you're wondering,&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-release-date">intended for launch next month</a>, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-delayed-2025">delayed to 2025</a> after what Sports Interactive called a "difficult development cycle".</p>
<p>The game will boast a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-premier-league-licensing">Premier League license</a> for the first time in the series' history, but it will compromise on various <i>Football Manager&nbsp;</i>mainstay features, including Create-a-Club and other core series mechanics.</p>

<p><em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>is now scheduled to launch in March, but since that date is fairly close to the end of the 2024/25 football (sorry, Americans) season, some fans have been asking after a season update for the existing game to tide them over.</p>
<p>Sadly, it looks like that won't be happening. If you want to see current data, you'll have to wait for&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>, which is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217490/Football_Manager_25/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010715" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/football-manager-25-console/9NQ4K2ZW5HJV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a> in March 2025, with versions for the Switch and mobile devices to follow after.</p>

First <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio">reported in <em>Game File</em></a> and confirmed by Netflix, the streaming company has quietly closed of one of its studios, the first in the three years since the company began its foray into gaming.</p><p>According to <em>Game File</em>, the shuttered studio was known as Blue. In 2022, Netflix announced it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23411684/netflix-cloud-gaming-studio-pc-tv">hired former <em>Overwatch </em>executive producer Chacko Sonny</a> to run the studio. Since then, Blue had brought on a number of game industry veterans with experience working on high profile franchises including<em> Halo </em>and <em>God of War</em>. Reportedly, Blue was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/17/23686693/netflix-joseph-staten-aaa-game-halo-veteran">developing a multi-platform AAA game for an original IP</a> but was closed before the game could be announced or released.</p><p>Netflix has released a steady stream of games on its platform since the beginning of its gaming experiment in 2021. Though it started with a small handful of hyper-casual mobile games, Netflix’s offerings have expanded to include mobile exclusive ports of iconic games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24048412/gta-is-netflixs-biggest-gaming-launch-so-far"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091183/netflix-games-hades-release-date-ios-march"><em>Hades</em></a> its own internally developed exclusives like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163281/cozy-grove-camp-spirit-release-date-netflix-gaming"><em>Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23787249/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-netflix-playstation-switch"><em>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals</em></a>.</p><p>Netflix has also acquired or spun-up a number of studios to support its gaming pipeline. The most recent additions were a mobile game studio in Helsinki, a new studio in southern California, and <em>Cozy Grove </em>developer Spry Fox. But with the closure of Blue, Netflix’s trend of expansion may be over as well as its grander AAA ambitions.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24273820/intuit-ceo-sasan-goodarzi-turbotax-irs-quickbooks-ai-software-decoder-interview"><h2>Intuit asked us to delete part of this Decoder episode</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24275178/apple-airpods-pro-hearing-aid-test-protection-preview"><h2>Apple’s AirPods Pro hearing health features are as good as they sound</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275797/ford-mustang-mache-2025-heat-pump-bluecruise-design"><h2>The 2025 Ford Mustang Mach-E gets sportier and more affordable</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275970/tesla-cybertruck-range-extender-worse-deal-delay"><h2>Tesla’s Cybertruck range extender just became an even worse deal</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/20/24274915/alien-romulus-vhs-limited-edition-collectible-release-date"><h2>Alien: Romulus is getting a VHS release</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill 2 Remake's Biggest Differences</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Labyrinth is an underground maze of hallways located beneath Toluca Prison. Players will bump into several NPCs while exploring it (including Eddie and Angela), and will also be faced with a couple of boss fights. The Labyrinth also contains a few puzzles for players to solve, and these puzzles are where the problem lies. Upon completing a puzzle that involves rotating a cube, the cube will then disintegrate, allowing players to continue their journey. But as of the 1.04 patch, the cube is no longer disintegrating for some players, leaving them unable to progress.</p><p dir="ltr">On the bright side, Konami and Bloober Team are aware of the issue, and the game's developers have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1g9ei4w/bloober_are_working_on_the_labyrinth_bug_fix/" rel="nofollow ">added an in-game notification</a> confirming that a fix is on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are aware of an issue some players may encounter after the most recent 1.04 patch released on October the 21st in the Labyrinth level of Silent Hill 2," the announcement reads. "The fix will be released as soon as possible. We deeply apologize for the inconvenience."</p><p dir="ltr">But for players who don't want to wait for an official fix, a recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1g8xo92/sh2_remake_game_breaking_bug_in_labyrinth_need_a/" rel="nofollow ">post on the game's Steam page</a> lists some possible solutions that range from simply reloading the game to lowering its frame rate. None of them are guaranteed to work, of course, but for now, they're the only solution for players who are eager to continue their trek through Silent Hill's blood-splattered hallways and foggy streets.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/microsoft-reveal-upgraded-xbox-wireless-headset/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has unveiled an upgraded version of the Xbox Wireless Headset, bringing a handful of key improvements with longer battery life, an upgraded microphone and more.</p>
<p>The new Xbox Wireless Headset is available today for $110 / £100 and regional equivalent pricing – that’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/16/xbox-wireless-headset-pre-order-price-release-date-march/">a notable $10 / £5 price jump</a> over the original headset, but there’s actually a good reason for that, as Dolby Atmos is now included without an additional fee (previously an additional £11/$15 purchase)</p>


<p>At a glance, they’re effectively identical to the original headset, just without the Xbox green rims to the ear cups. There’s now a single green nubbin button on the otherwise all-black exterior. Most of the changes have come on the inside, though.</p>
<p>Battery life now gives up to 20 hours of playtime between charges, there’s an upgraded microphone with enhanced auto-mute and voice isolations, and the headset now features Bluetooth 5.3 for connection to PC and mobile devices. Qualcomm S5 Gen 2 tech has also been integrated for lower latency.</p>
<p>As mentioned, premium spatial audio is no longer an additional purchase, with Windows Sonic still a freebie, Dolby Atmos now included at no extra cost, and support for DTS Headphone:X, which is still a separate purchase.</p>

<p>The original Xbox Wireless Headset launched in 2021, and was an immediate favourite of ours – some disliked the audio balance and got to tweaking the output, but it worked perfectly for us. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/26/xbox-wireless-headset-review/">our 2021 headset review</a>, Dom said, “The Xbox Wireless Headset is a remarkable feat of engineering, providing a smart and solid build as well as top-notch audio and comfort that are a rare commodity at this price point.”</p>
<p>Here’s hoping that this one’s even better.</p>

			<p>A new Alan Wake 2 update went live today, introducing new accessibility options, PS5 Pro support, Xbox Series S improvement, and more.</p>
<p>The October 22nd update is meant to celebrate the game's first anniversary by introducing new features and improvements even for those who have not purchased the Deluxe Edition, which includes the Lake House expansion, also released today. Among the biggest changes introduced in the update are new accessibility options, which include infinite ammo and batteries, immortality, options to change button holds into taps, and more.</p>
<p>The new Alan Wake 2 Anniversary Update also adds, as already mentioned, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-playstation-5-pro-ray-tracing/">PS5 Pro support</a>, optional support for Motion Sensor controls with a DualSense controller on PC and PlayStation 5, refined and additional haptics, and an increased internal render resolution on Xbox Series X, from 1280x720 to 1505x847. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot32-mythologies-histories-prophecies.970347/post-130495653" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the beginning</a>, it seemed like the update also added VRR support on Xbox consoles, but the <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/">current patch</a> notes do not mention it anymore so it's not clear if this has been indeed added or not.</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about one of the best survival horror games released in the past few years by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">review.</a></p>

<p>As outlined in Paradox's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/529340/view/4535779621907257046" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam announcement</a>, the DLC, which launches on November 21st, will bring new narrative for Indian nations, the East India Company, and the Sikh Empire, plus more. It'll be on around the same scale as previous Immersion Packs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/victoria-3-getting-immersion-pack-voice-of-people-next-month">like <em>Voice of the People</em></a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested, the title of the DLC comes from a quote by former Viceroy of India Victor Bruce, who described India as the titular "pivot of our Empire", lamenting that "if [the British Empire loses] India, the sun of our Empire will have set".</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new Harvest and Famines mechanics, which will allow you to "secure India's food supply" and take "advantage of the unique events and narrative content", as well as a new art style with a brand new map inspired by Indian culture.</p>
<p>While this DLC isn't on the same level as the likes of&nbsp;<em>Sphere of Influence</em>, it should still be a pretty substantial addition to what is already a frankly massive grand strategy game.</p>

<p>The new DLC pack will arrive alongside the free 1.8 update, which is set to bring various improvements to&nbsp;<em>Victoria 3&nbsp;</em>including new national and religious movements, company building ownership, the Indian caste system, and more.</p>
<p><em>Victoria 3&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276650/nintendo-switch-2-predictions-playtest-alarmo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2018, Nintendo invited me to a meeting in New York City to see a mysterious new initiative. It was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/17/16900412/nintendo-switch-interactive-experience-feature-announcement">teased as</a> an “interactive experience for Nintendo Switch,” which sent my mind to all sorts of places. This is the company that made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24242128/nintendo-ds-touchscreen-games-2004-launch">a weird dual-screen Game Boy</a> and <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/DK_Bongos">bongo controllers</a>, after all. It could be anything. Even still, I did not guess that I would spend that meeting folding bits of cardboard — or that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/18/17253574/nintendo-labo-review-switch-learning-diy">those cardboard accessories would turn out to be so awesome</a>. That was the moment I completely gave up on trying to guess what Nintendo would do next.</p><p>That meeting has been on my mind quite a bit over the last few weeks. While much of the game industry has been on edge in anticipation of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">whatever the follow-up to the Switch will be</a>, Nintendo has focused on pretty much anything and everything else. </p><div><p>Last month, I went to visit the company in Kyoto, but not to see new hardware; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">instead, I went on a tour of the just-opened Nintendo Museum</a>. This month, Nintendo did announce a new gadget, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">instead of a console, it was an alarm clock</a>. And just this week, details started trickling out about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266478/nintendo-switch-online-invite-application-beta-playtest">the company’s secretive online test</a>, which some predicted would provide hints at the Switch 2. Nope: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">instead, it seems to be an online game in the vein of <em>Minecraft</em></a>. Three big moments, zero Switch successors.</p></div><p>This isn’t new, of course. Nintendo generally goes its own way. When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21534306/ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-guide-games-review">Sony and Microsoft ushered in the current generation of consoles</a>, Nintendo launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21562549/nintendo-game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-next-gen-consoles">a new version of the Game &amp; Watch</a>, an LCD handheld from the ’80s. But the rapid succession of announcements and reveals from the company over the last few weeks has been surprising and indicative of its idiosyncratic nature. And while it might seem random, the weeks full of museum openings and alarm clock launches are likely part of a very calculated strategy.</p><div><figcaption><em>Nintendo’s Alarmo alarm clock.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>It could mean a few things. Maybe Nintendo is clearing the runway to keep the focus on the Switch 2 whenever it does decide to announce it. In the Switch era, Nintendo has become much more adept at clear messaging, which hasn’t always been the case. Just think back to when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/6/7/2515106/nintendo-wii-u-announced">the Wii U was first announced</a>, and some (myself included) initially confused it for a Wii accessory. So it makes a lot of sense to get this other stuff out of the way before the next console. Nintendo Direct presentations have become huge moments, and the one dedicated to the next console will possibly be the biggest to date. You don’t want to mess that up.</p><p>It could also be an indication of where Nintendo is right now. This is a company that doesn’t want to be only known for games. <em>Super Mario</em> creator Shigeru Miyamoto said as much when I was in Kyoto in September. “A lot of people may see Nintendo as a video game company,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">he explained during a press conference</a>. “But what I wanted to express with this museum is that we are first and foremost an entertainment company.” While it’s been building a new console in secret and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24258654/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-edit-dungeons-links-awakening">sending out its current one on a high note</a>, it has also been branching out in new directions.</p><div><p>That includes bringing Nintendo experiences into the real world through a theme park partnership with Universal — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604504/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-super-nintendo-world">an initiative so important that Miyamoto has played a major role</a> — and a (so far) successful jump into feature films with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The</em> <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>, created by <em>Minions</em> studio Illumination. It’s relatively early days, but the company is using its long-running success in games to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">transform into an entertainment empire</a>. Which is to say, Nintendo has a lot more irons in the fire than <em>just</em> a new console. Maybe we’ll get <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23951339/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-live-action-nintendo">a live-action <em>Zelda</em> movie trailer</a> before we see the Switch 2.</p></div><p>Doing things differently isn’t always a guarantee of success, of course, and Nintendo has certainly had its share of failures. These glory days of the Switch, <em>The</em> <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan">Super Nintendo World</a> famously happened in the aftermath of the Wii U, Nintendo’s worst-selling home console to date. It took 30 years for the company to follow up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23668181/super-mario-bros-movie-live-action-revisited">the infamous original <em>Mario</em> movie flop</a> with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">a billion-dollar film</a>. The industry ebbs and flows, and it only takes one console generation to move from the top of the market to the bottom. That only makes it harder to predict what Nintendo will do; I certainly would have never guessed the Switch was its next system back in 2017 or that it would go on to outsell the Wii and Game Boy.</p><p>This is all a long way of saying that, just like when I sat down in front of some stacks of cardboard in New York, I am currently at a loss trying to figure out what Nintendo’s execs are thinking. I have some ideas, of course, helped along by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">a steady stream of rumors</a>, but no real sense of what the company’s next console will look like or when it will be announced. All I know for sure is that it won’t be boring. But if it is? That’d be another big surprise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Netflix have shut down one of their more trumpeted video game initiatives - a Californian studio known as team "Blue" and stocked with former Halo, God Of War and Overwatch developers. It was a major plank in Netflix's on-going efforts to extend their film and TV streaming empire to what Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/io-interactive-fail-to-mention-if-a-potential-project-007-trilogy-will-feature-hitmans-glorious-queues-so-whos-to-say-whether-its-worth-my-time">insists on calling the "greasy screen"</a>. </p><!--more-->
<p>The news comes via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio">Gamefile</a> and Stephen Totillo, who cites a company representative. Netflix have yet to make a formal announcement. Team Blue's members included former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny and former God Of War art director Rafael Grassetti. According to Joseph Staten - an original Halo developer who joined Team Blue in April 2023 after helping 343 Industries polish off Halo Infinite - they were working on "a brand-new AAA multiplatform game and original IP". </p>
<p>Netflix have been trying to establish themselves as a gaming publisher and platform since around the turn of the decade. They began stocking mobile games on their store in 2021, and have splurged on a few studio purchases - Oxenfree 2 devs Night School Studio in 2021, then Next Games and Boss Fight Entertainment in 2022. In 2022, it also emerged that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflix-are-developing-a-aaa-pc-game-with-no-microtransactions">hiring in Los Angeles to develop a triple-A PC game</a>. </p>
<p>Netflix <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflix-are-testing-their-own-game-streaming-service">trialled game streaming in August 2023</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflix-has-reportedly-spoken-with-rockstar-about-releasing-a-grand-theft-auto-game-as-the-streaming-giant-plans-to-add-higher-end-games-to-its-library">approached Rockstar about bringing GTA to Netflix</a> (you can now find the Grand Theft Auto Trilogy on the service). As of July 2024, Netflix Games had over 80 games in development, with around 100 available already. Whether they are seeing returns on all this investment is another question. Also in July 2024, co-CEO and president Gregory K Peters <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-has-80-games-in-development-and-plans-to-release-about-one-new-title-per-month">conceded</a> that engagement with games on Netflix remains "quite small".</p><p>As Kotaku's John Walker (RPS in peace) <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075">observes</a>, the closure of Team Blue isn't wholly surprising. Netflix do not have much experience of founding and running their own game development teams, and "AAA" multiplatform originals crafted by seasoned blockbuster devs are pricey - the kind of prestige item you get rid of when ol' Mr Projected Profit Curve starts to look worryingly horizontal.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what Grassetti, Staten and Sonny get up to now. Given their credits, I'm fairly sure they'll land on their feet. I wish any less established former Team Blue developers the best of luck finding new work. As for Netflix Games as a whole, I don't get the sense that they have much vision beyond "video games now make more money than film and we want a piece of the pie".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At first glance, you would be forgiven for assuming the all-new Xbox Wireless Headset, announced by Microsoft recently, is the same as the old model. On the surface, it is. But underneath, there are a few enhancements and additions that may appear enticing to someone in the market for a new headset or an audiophile. Here’s everything new about the Xbox Wireless Headset.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-new-about-the-xbox-wireless-headset">Everything New About the Xbox Wireless Headset</h2>



<p>For its price tag, the all-new Xbox Wireless Headset isn’t wholly new. It’s an improved version of the last-generation headset, which means it’s not worth the price tag to some. Others, however, will note the enhancements below and find themselves overly excited about a new piece of technology!</p>



<ul>
<li>Dolby Atmos (free)</li>



<li>Improved battery life, allowing up to 20 hours of continuous playtime</li>



<li>Enhanced microphone with auto-mute and voice isolation features</li>



<li>Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, it should be noted that many within the announcement’s comments profess their love for the previous editions of the Xbox Wireless Headset. But there are criticisms. Some claim the microphone snapped off on their old headset, and others claim the sound design is weak. The inclusion of Dolby Atmos should resolve the latter issue, but we cannot confirm either way for the microphone snapping off.</p>



<p>While not a new feature, the ability to tweak and fine-tune your headset is definitely welcome. Too many headsets these days are plug-and-play affairs, and everyone is unique, so the Xbox Accessories app’s customization suite is welcome.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-much-does-the-xbox-wireless-headset-cost">How Much Does the Xbox Wireless Headset Cost?</h2>



<p>If you’re interested in purchasing the Xbox Wireless Headset, you’ll need to pay $109.99 plus shipping and handling during checkout and the usual taxes. In total, I would expect to pay around $150, but it depends on your region and location.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-buy-the-xbox-wireless-headset">Where to Buy the Xbox Wireless Headset</h2>



<p>Currently, the best place to order the new Xbox Wireless Headset is via the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/headsets/xbox-wireless-headset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox accessories website</a>. According to Microsoft, the headset will also be available at local retailers, such as Best Buy or GameStop, so check your nearby shops soon for the headset!</p>



<p>Is the new Xbox Wireless Headset on your radar, or do you have a trusted brand you’ll stick with? I tend to use Corsair, but I’m open to new headsets from others.

            <p>Sports Interactive has released a statement explaining why Football Manager 24 won't receive a current season update, following the delay of Football Manager 25.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-25-release-delayed-until-march-2025">announced Football Manager 25 would miss its original release next month</a> and instead will launch in March 2025 to "ensure the game quality and experience meets your expectations and our very high standards".</p>
<p>Since then, fans had called for a current season update to FM24, something the developer has now said it had been "exploring since the initial internal conversation about postponing the game's release". However, assets from the next game cannot be "back ported".</p>

<p>"Having now scoped the work that would be required, and despite a good initial response from many of our licensors, we cannot lift assets that we are using in FM25 and make them work in FM24 without recreating them in full," a statement from Sports Interactive reads.</p>
<p>"The same applies to the many competition rules, translations and database changes that cannot be back ported. The updated assets and data would both be required to obtain licensor approval - they cannot be separated.</p>
<p>"This is a substantial undertaking which would take critical resources away from delivering FM25 to the highest possible quality, which we simply cannot compromise on."</p> <div>

<p>In its previous statement concerning the delay, Sports Interactive described FM25 as "the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation" and acknowledged it "cannot compromise the delivery of this crucial juncture in Football Manager’s history".</p>
<p>The March release for FM25 will be across all platforms: PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>"It's been a difficult year," boss of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fm25-is-not-a-continuation-of-fm24-the-big-football-manager-interview">Sports Interactive Miles Jacobson told Eurogamer</a> in September. "[But] it's been a great learning experience!"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
