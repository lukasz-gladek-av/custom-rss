<p>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold ahead of it’s July release. To celebrate, developer A44 Games has released 20 minutes of new Flintlock gameplay for players to get a glimpse of what to expect when they start playing.</p>



<p>“This shows the gameplay and quests that take you through the majestic City of Sybil,” the description reads. “The current seat of Dukmar’s power, Sibyl was once one of the most powerful city-states in the world, the seat of learning and commerce alike. </p>



<p>“The dethroning of its king allowed for its borders to finally be opened to outsiders and its Library and Eternal Archive were considered among the greatest marvels of the world, until Dukmar and his legion shut the doors.”</p>

<p>Astro Bot is one of the more anticipated games coming to PlayStation 5 (PS5) later this year after being revealed during Sony’s PlayStation State of Play in May. Now, thanks to a post on social media, it appears we know exactly what size Astro Bot is and how much space you’ll need on your PS5 in order to install the game.</p>



<p>According to a post from Genki on Twitter, Astro Bot comes in at 66GB. For comparison sake, Astro’s Playroom took up just 11GB on the console.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Admittedly this 600% increase in size comes due to Astro Bot being a much larger game in nature than the previous title. Developer Asobi even called Astro Bot <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-biggest-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the studio’s “biggest game ever”.</a></p>



<p>“This is really about going up one notch — really several notches — and having Astro’s big story,” Nicolas Doucet of Asobi said in a recent interview. “We call it&nbsp;Astro Bot&nbsp;because we treat this as a new beginning. That’s a really, really big game. I think for us, that’s the biggest game we’ve ever made.”</p>



<p>According to Asobi, Astro Bot will feature 150 cameos from the history of PlayStation will be in the game. It’ll also feature six galaxies and 80 levels to explore.</p>



<p>Astro Bot launches exclusively on PS5 on September 6.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Zenless Zone Zero: The Final Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenless-zone-zero-the-final-preview.914445/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>At this point, Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail have firmly created the expectation that when developer HoYoverse sets out to make a new game, it's going to be both like and completely unlike what it has done before. Fans of the studio's games will know how getting new characters and eventually building them will work (different names, same structure), but the action and tone vary quite significantly. This is once again true for Zenless Zone Zero, HoYoverse's next project that swaps out its larger sandboxes for stylish streets with even more stylish characters and flashy action combat.</p><p>I played Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ) for the first time briefly in its second closed beta test, and again for about four hours at a media event hosted by the studio. The long and short of it is that in my brief time with it, I feel that ZZZ is the most "mobile game" of HoYo's most recent releases. I don't mean that in a bad way; what I mean is that almost everything can be done in quick encounters – think 15 minutes or less. Whether you're diving into a story beat, a character quest, or just completing side activities, ZZZ seems to take a bite-sized experience approach to most things it offers. Not that some don't go longer (and I didn't have a chance to play everything, after all), but that seemed about the average.</p><p>What I like about that is that while I can see myself spending hours helping complete missions for folks around the city of New Eridu or taking on repeatable combat challenges on PS5 or PC, it'll be just as easy to sneak in a few activities on my phone in between other obligations. And based on how much fun I had during my playtime, I know I'll certainly want to when ZZZ is out soon on July 4.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>A Colorful Apocalypse</h2><p>In ZZZ, the apocalypse struck with the appearance of expanding, dangerous bubble realms known as Hollows. The space-warping zones are filled with dangerous creatures that can afflict humans with a deadly disease that may just kill them or, worse, transform them into monsters. Rather than relocate far away from these Hollows, the citizens of the city New Eridu have developed tools to explore them for treasures and resources.</p><p>While I can't speak to how interesting ZZZ's story is, as I was thrown into the game at a point where the chapters had already been completed (replaying the campaign missions was something I could seek out, but I opted to explore other challenges), I do already appreciate ZZZ's tone. It's incredibly goofy. For instance, while roaming around a construction site I found a Bangoo (small helper robots that fulfill all sorts of roles in New Eridu), Catloverboo, lovingly watching over a cat that was burying its business in a pile of sand. When I asked the Bangboo what the heck it was doing, it went on and on about how nice cat paws smell, and sharing in its enthusiasm got me a few resource rewards. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>ZZZ's lighthearted tone creates a welcoming atmosphere.</p></div><p>Delightfully, that goofiness persisted. From misunderstood affection causing multiple characters to be flustered by a robot-lover's advances at robots to cheeky text messages from other characters, ZZZ's lighthearted tone creates a welcoming atmosphere. It's as though the people of New Eridu's attitudes reflect the city's fun and vibrant design rather than the collapse of society at large. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>It's a Team Effort</h2><p>Zenless Zone Zero's playable characters are divided in an interesting way. The protagonist siblings Belle and Wise are "Proxies," individuals who have the technology and know-how to direct others in navigating the winding paths in Hollows. They don't go in physically themselves and instead guide Agents on their dives into the dangerous realms. One selected sibling is playable during city exploration while the Agents are playable in Hollows. The 15 currently playable Agents are split among various factions often associated with their jobs, from groups like a housekeeping company to a construction company. </p><p>Whether diving into combat from the campaign, a side quest, or by choosing to run through one of the many various combat challenge modes, three Agents and (depending on the situation, though it wasn't clear to me when they were or weren't allowed) a combat Bangoo make up a team. Like with other HoYoverse games, team composition is critical. Every character has a combat specialty type (like defense, stun, or attack, among others) and a damage affinity (like physical, fire, or ether), both of which need to be taken into consideration when building a team, especially for more difficult encounters like boss challenges. Pairing at least more than one member from the same faction on the team awards each of those characters an extra ability too. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/27/zzz-blogroll-1719527848016.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The members of Belobog Heavy Industries.</figcaption></figure></output><p>I like that the Bangboo, which acts independently of the playable team and attacks on their own, can fill in for a damage type if you don't have a particular character ready to take on that role or don't want to swap any one of your favorite characters out. I spent a lot of time using members of the Belobog Heavy Industries and lacked a character that could build up an ether debuff on enemies, so I trained up the one Bangboo in my arsenal that did use ether attacks to help out and it worked remarkably well. Though ZZZ isn't focused on elemental combinations like Genshin Impact, considering affinities and enemy weaknesses still matters.</p><p>The combat itself is a ton of fun, and I appreciate that certain encounters have a regular difficulty and a hard difficulty for players looking for extra challenge. Encounters take place in dungeon-like areas that seem to be procedurally generated and in most situations, you can't revive a character on a team once they've fallen. Engagements are flashy and fluid; players can hack-and-slash their way through, but those who take time to learn attack combos and make use of the dodge counters and the chain attack will see their efforts rewarded. Plus, it's fun to learn how to optimize a team's combat. </p><p>Switching characters at just the right time can lead to a special follow-up attack, and ZZZ helps players learn this by initiating a callout on the side of the screen. The aforementioned dodge counters award, as noted in the game, "a brief moment of invulnerability and deals high damage and interrupts the target." This too is signaled well with colored flash and specific noise before an enemy attacks, making what could be perceived as complex combat rather learnable for anyone getting into more intense action games for the first time. Getting the hang of these plus executing other combos makes the combat delightfully hypnotic. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/27/ellen-combat-1719528705474.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>It's not only the basic mechanics that need to be learned; each character's playstyle was different too. For instance, The Belobog Heavy Industries crew has a great bear character, Ben, whose dodge is a pitiful scoot to the side and a shuffle forward for his sprint, so learning how to swap him in and out at the right time was essential for fights that required faster movement. I look forward to getting to see which characters pair best together, regardless of the group they're from.</p><h2>The Other Half of Exploring Hollows</h2><p>When I first played ZZZ I was most surprised by its Hollow Deep Dive System, the other part of combat exploration that doesn't really have all that much combat involved. Rather than navigating repeating combat paths, ZZZ pulls players back a layer into what could be considered an imagined top-down view of the Hollow represented through TVs on a board (as shown below). Here, additional combat encounters can be found along with navigation puzzles and rewards on hidden paths. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/27/hdd-tv-board-1719528557349.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>This view most clearly represents the Proxy's perspective of the Hollows. Paths unseen by the Agents on the ground, but easy to navigate for those beyond. This board system is intertwined with combat in the campaign. For players who don't favor it and just want to get into the action, though, there are specific "Combat" and "Exploration" divisions at the Hollow Deep Dive menu that separate missions based on the kind of experience players will have, with the Exploration selection filled with the Hollow TV board. </p><p>When I played a random puzzle mission listed in the Exploration section, I was disappointed with how easy it was. In fact, in one mission the memory puzzle was solved for me. I hope these were one-off instances and not representative of the Hollow Deep Dive exploration system as a whole. If there's no challenge to navigating these boards, then what's the point of having them? </p><p>Character dialogue is another issue in the Hollow Deep Dive exploration. Maybe it's not so bad on a mobile device or other small screen, but all dialogue boxes in this mode are relegated to the top right corner of the screen. On a regular PC screen, it was easy to miss when dialogue started and awkward to pay attention to longer conversation points. Given that these "exploration" boards are part of the campaign, it makes me worried that I'll miss out on lore or good conversations between characters. Overall, though, I think the board system could add an interesting mix to ZZZ's gameplay, but I do hope it poses more of a challenge.</p><h2>Walking the Streets of New Eridu</h2><p>Exploring New Eridu is limited. ZZZ isn't an open-world game and it doesn't pretend to be. Instead, players can explore multiple streets connected by an in-game menu. Once at the chosen destination, running through the entirety of a street and its side paths doesn’t take long at all, though I found quite a number of people to talk to and various activities to do. Many of the NPC shop owners have stellar designs and I was delighted to see that playable characters can be freely found around the city for conversations and side quests. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/27/zzz-drive-tuning-demo-1719529091528.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>An important exploration aspect of ZZZ is its in-game clock. Days are split into four segments; morning, afternoon, night, and late night. As the time of day changes so do the city streets, making certain individuals unavailable at a time of day. As far as I could tell, the most meaningful changes at a particular time of day on a specific street are shown in an easy-to-access clock menu, so I wasn't at risk of missing anything too critical. According to the in-game handbook, things like completing story and side mission tasks and resting advance time rather than your real clock. I'm curious to see how this mechanic plays out in the long term, but in my playtime, it only mattered to me when scheduling a meetup with an NPC for a side quest and for opening the video shop.</p><p>There are plenty of other activities other than digging into combat, like running the protagonists' video shop. This is more of a quick optional task to kick up at the beginning of each day where you're asked to stock three tapes based on customer genre preferences. The better your choices, the better the revenue. More videotapes are acquired through exploring, side missions, and running the shop. Once a promoter is selected to run the shop for the day (new promoters can be hired too), you let them do the work, though you can also interact with customers throughout the day while the shop is open. This is just one of the few fun side activities I found that enrich the time of being in New Eridu.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/27/sixth-street-1719528749065.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Other activities included things like minigames in the arcade (anyone up for competitive Snake?) and helping the street-based Officer Mewmew with his list of side missions for residents of the street. There are also functional activities like grabbing a daily coffee (in-game daily, not actual daily) from the cute coffee shop for buffs and a refill on rechargeable energy used for specific combat encounters to earn materials for character upgrades. While New Eridu might not be sprawling now, it's easy to see how HoYoverse can expand the city with new streets, shops, activities, and characters in the future. </p><p><em>Miranda Sanchez is the executive editor of guides at IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-review.914439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Starting a fresh chapter in a long-running video game series must be a daunting endeavor for a developer. How do you follow up 20 years of worldbuilding and deeply intertwined stories with a new setting and cast? It’s a tough question that The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak answers confidently, kicking off an exciting new arc that both newcomers and veterans can equally enjoy after 2023’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-into-reverie-review">The Legend of Heroes: Trails into Reverie</a> brought the series’ previous saga to a satisfying conclusion. With an updated combat system that fuses turn-based battles with some new real-time elements, an engaging story, and a charming cast of characters, Trails through Daybreak shines as yet another great RPG in a year packed full of them.</p><p>Daybreak follows a mercenary named Van Akride who finds himself on a grand adventure that’s noticeably darker in tone than previous Trails arcs. He takes on the dirty jobs local law enforcement aren’t able to handle, and sometimes even work from underground organizations – things like negotiating deals with shady middlemen or hunting bounties. That’s a welcome change from the series’ past protagonists, who have tended to be a bit unrealistically altruistic. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The story itself effortlessly weaves topical themes into your actions, with shadowy figures taking advantage of anti-immigrant sentiment to gain power and the meteoric rise of a new mafia group threatening the status quo of the underground world. These themes aren’t entirely apparent early on in Van’s journey, but he eventually starts to realize just how much influence the different factions of this world have, making Daybreak feel more like an engrossing political drama the deeper you go.</p><p>This is a great jumping in point for the Trails series, free from the shackles of having to directly connect to  previous games, but Daybreak does also treat longtime fans like myself by incorporating lore from them when it suits the story. For example, it takes place in the Republic of Calvard, a place referenced in previous Trails games but never actually shown. Similarly, when Van fights against the local mafia early on, they take performance enhancing drugs to get an edge on him, and he deduces that they may be similar to the ones that the local gangs in Crossbell took, referencing both Trails from Zero and Trails to Azure. It’s a fantastic way to keep this universe interconnected while creating a blank slate to work with for new stories.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The smaller cast means each character gets more room to grow.</p></div><p>The lovable, tight-knit cast of main characters helps set the stage, too. Some standouts include a young girl named Feri Al-Fayed, who Van takes in after she is exiled from her village, slowly growing to accept her teammates as her second family throughout the story. A personal favorite of mine is the fun Grimcat, who is clearly an homage to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-royal-review">Persona 5</a>’s Ann, wearing a skintight suit and cat mask. (Grimcat even calls herself a “phantom thief.”) Her strong willed personality amusingly contrasts with her role as the comic relief – she’s a terrible liar and often slips up when trying to talk her way out of a situation, which is not something you’d expect out of a supposedly slick trickster. </p><p>It’s also great that Daybreak’s comparatively smaller cast means each character’s development is much more focused. They’re able to get more attention throughout the story and have room to grow, which is something the Cold Steel arc in particular had trouble handling as its storyline progressed and its cast ballooned. Veterans will catch a few character cameos from the previous Cold Steel, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/04/04/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky-review">Sky</a>, and Crossbell arcs in supporting roles as well, but they’re smartly placed so as not to steal the spotlight or alienate newcomers. </p><p>When you’re not tied up in the political intrigue of the main story, you’ll be completing various side quests that can earn you points towards Van’s Law, Gray, or Chaos stats. These are framed as a sort of morality system, but they operate more similarly to the way Persona handles its social stats. Certain side quests give out predetermined values for these stats, and you can see which will increase before accepting them – however, they’re all worth accepting and completing anyway, as having a high level in one alignment doesn’t lock out the benefits from the others. This approach offers a greater degree of freedom since you won’t feel like you’re being railroaded into one single morality path. </p><p>It also adds an extra layer of depth to Van’s personality and influences how he handles certain encounters outside of his default cool, bad-boy demeanor. Some quests let you decide how they end, providing extra points to a certain alignment based on your choice. For example, one quest has you chasing down a cashier who is stealing money from his job, but it turns out he was being extorted by someone else: You have the option to encourage the cashier to return the money and come clean as the Law approach, or take the Gray route and return the money but keep it a secret. Because I didn’t feel pressured into following a strict path like with the morality systems of some other games, I loved that I could pick the decision that I would most likely do if I was in Van’s shoes. (If the money is back where it belongs and the business is still running, no one is hurt and ever has to know, right?)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Daybreak’s quests also provide great worldbuilding.</p></div><p>Daybreak’s quests also provide great worldbuilding. One particularly fun one has Van’s party travel to a secluded island to clear its monsters so tourists can safely explore. In an amusing twist, a tour guide appears and gives the party a guided expedition while they’re busy fighting. They’ll periodically stop at certain points to describe local legends, but while the party keeps hoping to learn fun facts, each of the tour guide’s stories instead involves something horrifying, such as people getting devoured by monsters when a high tide occurs or a certain cavern being named “Death’s Head” because it was littered with human remains. The length and effort that these side quests go to in order to make them genuinely entertaining is one of the best aspects of the series.</p><p>Later on, depending on how high Van’s morality is in certain alignments, you can choose to team up with certain factions. While picking any given faction doesn’t change the overall story, Van’s decision can make battles easier for that specific chapter. Some factions have stronger playable characters that can make the enemy encounters and bosses a cakewalk while you have access to them. On the flip side, the faction I picked had two purely AI-controlled characters, so sometimes it was frustrating not being able to give them direct commands when I needed to. Choosing certain factions over others also leads to unique character interactions, which adds some fun replayability for future playthroughs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One of the biggest gameplay changes in Daybreak is its battle system, which is now a hybrid between real-time and turn-based combat. On the field, you can run up to enemies and start hitting them, but you can also initiate turn-based combat at the press of a button any time. By breaking their shields first, you’ll start the turn-based portion in an advantageous state, with enemies dazed and unable to act for a short time. Unfortunately, these real-time elements are very rudimentary; normal hits and charged attacks that stun enemies are all you can do besides dodging. It gets incredibly repetitive over a 50-plus-hour RPG, and I wish more options were introduced throughout the campaign to keep the real-time moments from stagnating.</p><p>However, the turn-based combat picks up the slack thanks to some noticeable improvements over its predecessors. Loading screens are gone outside of boss battles, so fights in Daybreak transition seamlessly from the field to battle. It’s so much smoother now that the party isn’t magically whisked away to a separate dimension just for battles; the battlefield is the same exact size as the room Van was in when he encountered an enemy. </p><p>This battle system also sees the return of the series’ timeline mechanic, which is relatively unchanged but just as great as ever. Bonuses land in random spots in the action timeline, so if you see that a critical hit bonus is going to land on the enemy’s turn, you can cleverly manipulate the order by using an attack with the Delay effect, pushing the enemy’s position and hopefully having the icon land on one of your allies instead. This makes for some incredibly engaging battles since it’s important to take advantage of these bonuses whenever you can, especially during boss fights and other high difficulty moments.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Free movement opens up a whole new aspect of tactical gameplay.</p></div><p>Another welcome change is that characters are no longer required to use up their turn to simply move around the battlefield, and can instead roam freely within a certain movement range. While moving your party into advantageous positions before attacking isn’t exactly a new RPG concept, this tweak opens up a whole new aspect of tactical gameplay when combined with Trails' already excellent combat mechanics.</p><p>For example, Van’s Stun Slash has the Impede effect, which can disrupt enemies in the middle of casting spells, but it also does more damage when Van hits an enemy from their flank rather than the front or back. That gives it a dual purpose, letting you choose whether to increase your damage by prioritizing positioning with your new movement options, or utility by focusing on manipulating the order of the timeline. It helps some attacks stay useful even when their primary effects don’t apply in certain situations, which wasn’t always the case in previous Trails games since moving around counted as its own action. </p><p>Daybreak’s customization system offers plenty of flexibility in how you build out each character’s stats and abilities with different gems. What’s great about the customization is that it can be as straightforward or as complex as you want it to be. Every gem has an element associated with certain stats and abilities, which can then be placed in any of the four customization lines of each character: Weapon, Shield, Drive, and EX. For example, red gems are associated with the fire element and have traits that benefit physical attackers, as well as give them fire-based attributes when placed in certain lines.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Best Game Order to Play the Trails Series</h3><p>This is the best order to play the Trails games in to best understand the events taking place in the Zemuria saga.</p></div><p>It’s all fine and dandy if you simply want to slot in the red Attack +1 gem in any available slot as the character will get the attack stat boost no matter what. If you want to take it a step further, however, you need to be strategic in where you place your gems. Daybreak introduces Shard Skills, which act like passive buffs influenced by the different line options. Placing a red gem in the Weapon line has a chance of adding fire elemental damage to normal attacks, while putting them in the Shield line boosts your chances of avoiding the Burn status. Knowing how to utilize these passive buffs can be the difference between winning and losing, especially during late-game boss battles and when playing on higher difficulties</p><p>The way gems and Shard Skills synergize also makes customization fun. Activating more powerful Shard Skills requires meticulous gem placement. Burst Gain, for example, has a chance of recovering HP when attacking, but requires both a red gem and water-based blue gem in the Weapon line to unlock. I could happily lose track of time optimizing each character and trying different combinations.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Some minigames from past entries are conspicuously gone.</p></div><p>Bonding events called Connections make a return in Daybreak, letting your protagonist casually hang out with other characters during their free time, which is always a lot of fun – especially for returning fans. In one standout scene, Van catches up with Rene, his friend inside Calvard’s intelligence division, and ends up discussing a double agent of theirs who also happens to be working for a key political figure from the Cold Steel and Crossbell games. So not only are these bonding moments entertaining and well-written, the Trails series is able to use its extensive history to incorporate past events for even more impressive worldbuilding, which is something that games with similar features can’t go nearly as in-depth on. </p><p>Other features from past entries are conspicuously gone, though. Minigames in previous Trails RPGs that were entertaining distractions, such as the card games Vantage Masters and Blade, aren’t in Daybreak at all, and there’s nothing new to fill the void they’ve left when I’m between missions and looking for a change of pace. Cooking has also been drastically limited, with each party member now only able to cook a few select dishes rather than having their strengths and weaknesses within the full menu. For example, if someone was strong in the curry recipe, they had a chance to create an enhanced version that restored more HP than usual, while a weaker curry cook could potentially screw up and give you a dish that could be detrimental. That variety added personality to characters outside of battle, so it’s a little disappointing that each character only cooks their specialized recipes without fail here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Fishing is missing, too, which is surprising given it had previously been included in every single mainline Trails game – though that’s not to say that Daybreak is lacking in content. There’s an enormous amount of stuff to do and see between all of the side quests and the morality system, but the absence of these traditional Trails minigame staples does make Daybreak just a little bit less charming.</p><p>And while it can’t make up for everything, Daybreak’s soundtrack is <em>excellent</em>. It incorporates the rocking guitars and melodic piano that the series is known for, and while both the opening theme and the song that plays as the credits roll sound a bit more laid back compared to past games, that’s a fitting reflection of Van’s personality. As always, the battle themes are explosive and designed to get you in the mood to fight, and the lively tunes in the metro areas make exploration fun.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s sequel--known as Project Orion--is currently in development at CD Projekt Red's new Boston-based studio, and the developer is hoping the new locale will give the sequel a more authentically American flair.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think Cyberpunk is obviously a uniquely American story," acting executive producer Dan Hernberg explained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBpEDCZMvo">a recent episode of the AnsweRED podcast</a>. "It's got a lot of like, punk energy, and [the tabletop game] was written by an American, so it just seems right to do it in America."</p><p dir="ltr">The first game--along with its highly praised DLC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/">Phantom Liberty</a>--was developed at CD Projekt Red's studio in Wrocław, Poland. This apparently led to some unforeseen complications when it came to creating Night City, which is canonically located in California and is essentially a futuristic version of Los Angeles. One example of the game's setting getting lost in translation is an issue referred to internally as "the manhole debacle."</p><p dir="ltr">"There was this post [on Reddit] with the guy saying that there is this immersion-breaking bug in Cyberpunk, and the bug was about the fact that the covers for manholes for a sewer were the manholes that you use normally in Europe, in Germany, for a pavement," associate game director Paweł Sasko said on the podcast. "Those are not manholes that you normally cover in America on the streets."</p><p dir="ltr">"When you go to America, there's things like [fire] hydrants, where they are placed and how they look like," Sasko continued. "The street lights, the positions of that, the trash bins, right? They're in the front of the house, right by the street. In Poland, in Europe, you don't see it almost anywhere. There's so much nuance. Dan, when we talk about it, he calls it 'the Americana.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Hernberg then added, "Our curbs are different, our color is different on all of our signs. Everything's just slightly different. It doesn't break immersion, but it's just that little thing where you're like, 'Well, maybe this wasn't made by people who live here or people who fully understand all of American culture.' I also think that [the studio] being in America, it allows us to have those cultural touchpoints with the larger American, you know, kind of influence with Hollywood. Obviously, Cyberpunk 2077 took place in LA, and so there's just kind of all these cultural touchpoints and things that we can kind of interact with, whether that's from music or story or just different parts of America that are interesting to explore."</p><p dir="ltr">But Project Orion isn't entirely made in America--CD Projekt Red's Vancouver studio is also pitching in on the sequel, and Hernberg says the Canadian studio is currently working on some "really cool stuff" for the upcoming game.</p><p>The game is currently in the early stages of development, so there's no telling when players can expect to get their hands on the sequel, but the good news is they won't have to wait for the next entry in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/">The Witcher</a> series to release first, as the new Boston studio was created specifically to allow CD Projekt Red to work on both Project Orion and the next Witcher game simultaneously. CD Projekt Red has also stated that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-aims-to-increase-the-cadence-of-game-launches/" rel="nofollow">it's working to increase the pace of its game launches</a>, so hopefully, players won't have to wait too long to return to Night City.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-roundup-june-28th</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-week-in-gaming-business-change-is-everywhere.914409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-roundup-june-28th<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a week of change in the gaming industry. Unfortunately, we've seen yet more layoffs and studio closures this week, but this week has also yielded a major acquisition, a newly-unionized studio, and some contract alterations from big companies.</p>
<p>Here's what's been happening on the business side of the gaming industry this week!</p>
<h2>More layoffs and closures</h2>
<p>It wouldn't be a gaming business roundup without layoffs and closures, or so it seems. This year's layoff total has, after all, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-saunas-and-shutdowns">already beaten last year's</a>, and there are still six months of the year to go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/second-wave-challengers-gaming-business.jpg?itok=Fav98LJN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/second-wave-challengers-gaming-business.jpg?itok=epjsg1Rm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Challengers, we hardly knew ye.</figcaption></figure><p>This week sadly saw Korean studio Challengers <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/second-wave-developer-folds-after-missing-wage-payments-and-amassing-1-7m-in-debt#close-modal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">closing</a>&nbsp;after building up $1.7 million in debt. CEO Koji Tamura said the studio hadn't managed to attract enough publisher or player interest for its projects to continue.</p>
<p>On the layoffs side, GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-of-mass-layoffs-at-gameloft-toronto" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported this week</a> that Gameloft had laid off "the majority" of its Toronto studio, a report that Gameloft itself later confirmed to the publication.</p>
<p>Chinese news platform The Paper, meanwhile, reported (according to machine translation) that&nbsp;<em>Tower of Fantasy&nbsp;</em>developer Perfect World has supposedly been <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_27838848" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hit by large-scale layoffs</a> across multiple departments. Those layoffs remain unconfirmed at time of writing.</p>
<h2>Cygames' parent company buys&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate&nbsp;</em>dev Nitroplus</h2>
<p>Nitroplus, the studio known for the likes of&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fate/Zero</em>, was <a href="https://x.com/nitroplus_staff/status/1805851928569544964" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bought this week</a> by Cygames parent company CyberAgent.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steinsgate-nitroplus-gaming-business.jpg?itok=fhagyoPu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steinsgate-nitroplus-gaming-business.jpg?itok=ZrysPhRI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Original&nbsp;<em>Steins;Gate&nbsp;</em>co-developer Nitroplus has been bought up by Cygames' parent company.</figcaption></figure><p>According to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nitroplus-to-be-acquired-by-cygames-parent-and-resume-work-on-games-abandoned-due-to-lack-of-resources/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">additional reporting by Automaton Media</a>, a PR <a href="https://www.cyberagent.co.jp/way/list/detail/id=30416" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interview</a> accompanying the announcement of the purchase reveals that CyberAgent will be helping Nitroplus to "pursue projects it had abandoned due to a lack of resources".</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what those projects might be, but if you're a fan of Nitroplus' visual novels, it's a happy day for you.</p>
<h2>People Can Fly and Square Enix reach new&nbsp;<em>Project Gemini&nbsp;</em>agreement</h2>
<p>Square Enix and People Can Fly reached a new agreement this week regarding the ongoing development of upcoming title&nbsp;<em>Project Gemini&nbsp;</em>(almost certainly not its final name).</p>
<p>The project ran into trouble earlier this year when around 30 employees were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outriders-developer-people-can-fly-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs">apparently laid off from the project</a>, with a further 20 being moved from&nbsp;<em>Gemini&nbsp;</em>to other People Can Fly projects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/people-can-fly-bulletstorm.jpg?itok=3GOd27Z1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/people-can-fly-bulletstorm.jpg?itok=g2tIYDRe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bulletstorm</em>&nbsp;dev People Can Fly has worked out a new approach for&nbsp;<em>Project Gemini&nbsp;</em>with Square Enix.</figcaption></figure><p>The new contract appears to stipulate a more stripped-back development model for&nbsp;<em>Gemini</em>; it states that "future revenues" obtained by People Can Fly for&nbsp;<em>Gemini&nbsp;</em>will "only cover the direct costs" incurred for development.</p>
<h2>Another ZeniMax studio unionizes</h2>
<p>The unstoppable march of gaming unionization (hopefully) continues, as another ZeniMax studio revealed its intention to unionize earlier this week.</p>
<p>Bethesda's Montreal branch <a href="https://x.com/OneBGS_MTL/status/1806001296593346639" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced a few days ago</a>&nbsp;that it has filed for certification with Quebec's Labor Board "with the intention of unionizing" and joining with the wider Communications Workers of America union.</p>
<p>The studio says its union is intended to make Bethesda "a supportive workplace that fosters creativity and talent" and that its "seat at the table" will ensure job security for employees, as well as promoting transparency, accountability, and flexibility.</p>
<h2>SAG-AFTRA announces new indie contract tier</h2>
<p>Media union SAG-AFTRA announced this week that it will introduce a new tier for its Independent Interactive Media Agreement, with a new budget range now being included in the agreement.</p>
<p>As reported <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-announces-fourth-tier-to-new-indie-dev-contract" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, projects with budgets between $15 million and $30 million will now benefit from SAG-AFTRA's union protection, as well as "provisions against AI" and access to unionized performers.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, SAG-AFTRA found itself the subject of heavy criticism after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sag-aftra-announces-groundbreaking-agreement-with-ai-voice-company-and-it-isnt-even">signing a controversial agreement</a> with AI voice company Replica, an agreement on which it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/actors-union-sag-aftra-doubles-down-on-controversial-ai-voice-agreement-but-silences">later doubled down</a>&nbsp;to the consternation of many.</p>
<h2>SNK opens a new Singapore location</h2>
<p><em>Metal Slug&nbsp;</em>studio SNK has <a href="https://www.snk-corp.co.jp/us/press/2024/062801/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">opened up a new location in Singapore</a>, which was technically established in 2022 but which was officially unveiled earlier today.</p>
<p>SNK says its new studio marks a "significant milestone" in its mission to create "high-quality games", and that the Singapore location has the potential to "set new benchmarks in game development".</p>
<h2>CD Projekt is a big contributor to the Polish economy</h2>
<p>We end on a story that demonstrates just how important gaming can be to national economies, and that's been illustrated this week by none other than&nbsp;<em>The Witcher&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>studio CD Projekt.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1806341488114073695" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) earlier this week</a>, CD Projekt revealed that it was solely responsible for an impressive 1.75% of Polish exports to the US last year.</p>
<p>That's 1.75% of all of Poland's US exports, not just those in gaming or even entertainment media. The next time someone tells you "it's just a game", make sure to throw this statistic at them.</p>
<hr><p>That's all for our roundup of everything that's been happening in the world of gaming business this week! Join us again next week for another look at the industry.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Valve has seemingly purged aimbots in Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p>Team Fortress 2 fans – who've long complained about the prevalence of aimbots cluttering up lobbies in Valve's tentpole shooter game – are reporting "a large ban wave" after a "prominent hoster" confirmed they had been banned.</p>

<p>Whilst fans were careful not to get too excited given there's been no formal word from Valve, Discorder Megascatterbomb said, "The strongest evidence we have of a large banwave is the Steam charts, however the maintenance period may have simply knocked them offline temporarily".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Update: As of right now, it seems as though the VAST majority of aimbots have been purged.

</p></div>
<p>However, since then, plenty of players have noticed an improvement and even newly-created bot accounts are reportedly getting insta-banned.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it seems developer Valve itself is banning people, not its Valve Anti-Cheat software.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>valve are now banning tf2 bot hosters and sending this message directly to them, stating "Accounts dedicated to the disruption of TF2 have been deactivated"</p><p>VALVE PLEASE KEEP DOING THIS DON'T STOP <a href="https://t.co/PQ9SRZnB60">pic.twitter.com/PQ9SRZnB60</a></p></div>— heavy team fortres 2 (@heavyfortres) <a href="https://twitter.com/heavyfortres/status/1806418629581476180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"Our team noticed your accounts were involved in majorly disruptive activity in Team Fortress 2. Accounts dedicated to the disruption of TF2 have been deactivated, and accounts used for other purposes have been locked or banned."</p>
<p>"I just had a bot-free game, entirely, was 30 minutes and not a single bot joined or tried to join, it was wonderful," said one <a href="https://x.com/FancyNight3D/status/1806258247793352799">happy player</a>.</p> <div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/16-year-old-team-fortress-2-has-just-beaten-its-own-concurrent-user-record">Team Fortress 2 beat its own concurrent user record last summer</a>, clocking up 258,997 players.</p>
<p>Whilst that may not sound impressive given the PUBG: Battlegrounds' record-breaking peak currently sits at a hefty 3.2m players, it's important to note that even though TF2 is widely considered one of the greatest shooters of all time, it's just about to turn 17 years old.</p>
<p>The spike is likely attributable to Valve's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-fortress-2-gets-a-full-on-update-sized-update-this-summer-valve-says">all-new time-limited Team Fortress 2 summer event</a> that introduced several new maps, taunts, effects, war paints, and more.</p>

            <p>Let me continue the theme from our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-how-were-all-spending-our-last-tenner-on-the-best-deals-in-the-steam-summer-sale">round-up of Steam sale reccs for under a tenner</a>, while exchanging the concept of money for the concept of time: what can you do in celebrated open world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragons-dogma-2-review">"anecdote generator"</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragons-dogma-2">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> in two hours or less? Two hours being the length of the free Dragon's Dogma 2 trial that is now live on Steam. For context, this is approximately how much time Capcom gave me to preview their latest action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, many headline cycles ago. During that brief window, I managed to become <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-be-the-worst-wizard-in-dragons-dogma-2-act-1">the worst wizard in Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, but I know you can go further. I'm so confident of this, in fact, that I'm going to start feeling all insecure and hurt in anticipation. How could you trample on my feelings so?</p><!--more-->
<p>The trial will run from now until 19th July at 6pm BST, 10pm PT and 1pm ET. Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2054970/Dragons_Dogma_2/">Steam page</a>. Should you feel tempted to buy the full game, rejoice in the knowledge that your trial save progress will carry over. You can also effectively extend the trial by several precious moments by kitting out your character in advance using the free Character Creator &amp; Storage tool. As for what you might do in those two whole hours, beyond trouncing my preview accomplishments and revealing me for the pitiful backslider that I am - I would focus on levelling up a class to get a sense of the ability design deeper in. I would also hire-and-fire as many Pawns created by other players as you can - they'll clue you in about secrets or sidequests they've had experience of in their worlds.</p>
<p>We like ourselves a Dogmatic Dragon round these parts, but the game has a Mixed rating on Steam for reasons ranging from performance through complaints about an empty world and underwhelming story to the game's design just being a bit chaotic. One of the bigger contention-bones back at launch was the spread of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-plan-to-make-dragons-dogma-2s-dragonsplague-less-frequent-and-more-obvious">dragonsplague</a>, a Pawn ailment spread via online interactions, which could lead to major story characters getting murdered (you're highly unlikely to experience this in the opening two hours). I'm interested to know what the RPS commentariat thinks of the game in hindsight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-culprit-behind-shadow-of-the-erdtree-pc-framerate-issues-is-your-mouse/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Shadow of the Erdtree has taken the world by storm, selling <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 5 million copies</a> within the first release day. However, some players still complain about the DLC, such as the difficulty factor and the PC performance issues. Now, if difficulty is a problem for you, then too bad; get better at the game. But, if you are facing issues with Shadow of the Erdtree on PC, then FromSoftware may have some solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many players have reported frame rate instability in the expansion, with random frame drops disrupting their gaming experience. The <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FromSoftware Player Support</a> account X (formerly Twitter) has identified a significant factor contributing to this issue. They’ve revealed that a ‘mouse-control related app’ running in the background is the culprit behind the PC’s frame rate instability. The support team has recommended that players close this application before running Shadow of the Erdtree to improve performance.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">【ELDEN RING】PC版において、マウス制御関連のアプリを起動している状態でゲームをプレイするとフレームレートが安定しない場合がございます。その場合、マウス制御関連のアプリを停止してゲームプレイをお試しいただきますようお願いいたします。</p>— FROMSOFTWARE PLAYER SUPPORT (@fromsoftware_sp) <a href="https://twitter.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1806520401314586632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The FromSoftware Support Account has addressed other PC issues, too. They have also spotted a bug in the PC version that shows an “Invalid behaviour has been detected” message. This message usually appears when players start playing or trying out multiplayer mode. The support account has advised players to try restarting the game, and if the issues persist, they should consider checking the integrity of their game files. Communication instability could also be one of the reasons for this problem. Rest assured, if you aren’t cheating, you will not be penalised when you encounter this issue in multiplayer mode.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">ゲームを再起動してもこの問題が解決しない場合は、ゲームファイルの整合性確認をお願いいたします。お手数をおかけしますが、よろしくお願いいたします。<br>※本問題は通信が不安定な場合も発生する可能性があります。</p>— FROMSOFTWARE PLAYER SUPPORT (@fromsoftware_sp) <a href="https://twitter.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1806619392337412531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2024</a></blockquote>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dystopika-is-a-cyberpunk-city-builder.914376/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dystopika-cyberpunk-city-builder-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had big plans for last weekend. I was going to reinstall <em>Wolfenstein </em>and blast some Nazis. I was going to try out <em>F1 24</em>. I was going to maybe even dabble in some <em>Civilization</em>, because <em>VII</em>'s reveal has it on my mind. Instead, my free time ended up getting blindsided by something else entirely: a cyberpunk city-builder* called <em>Dystopika</em>.</p><p>* Note: it is not the kind of city-builder the existing genre would have you assume. You do build a city here, yes, but...that's all there is.<a href="https://dystopika.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Dystopika</em></a><em> </em>is more like <a href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-glade-is-a-lovely-stress-free-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tiny Glade</em></a>, <em>Townscaper </em>or<a href="https://aftermath.site/summerhouse-steam-game-architecture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Summerhouse</em></a><em> </em>than <em>Cities: Skylines</em>. You're given a blank, very dark canvas and are left to "paint" yourself a city, dropping certain types of buildings here, and others there. Drop enough of them, or do enough with the ones you drop, and you can unlock some more stuff.</p><p>You can adjust the height of buildings, add decorative effects (like neon lights and huge billboards), adjust the weather and time of day, and take some very nice photos. And that's it! There are no budgets, no rules, no emergencies to deal with, no sewerage links or power lines to bother you.<em>Dystopika </em>is, despite its lack of challenge or variety, a wonderful timesink. </p><p>What few tools it <em>does</em> give you are enough to conjure a megalopolis out of nothing, but alongside those sweeping gestures it's also able to provide hours upon hours of meditative honing as you zoom in to see tiny flying cars buzzing around and delicately place holographic adverts and landing pads on rooftops, as though you were holding a tiny pair of tweezers.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dystopika - cozy cyberpunk city builder - ambience OST #1" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nUjrvmyscQo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While its ease of use and freedom of expression are hallmarks, another star of<em> Dystopika</em> might be its soothing <em>Lo-Fi Beats To Blade Runner To</em> soundtrack, which complements the "action" perfectly. Listen to the music in the vid above, it just hums along like this <em>forever</em>, it's lovely.</p><p>As superficial as it is, <em>Dystopika </em>is still a really good cyberpunk game, if only because--unlike, say, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, which was burdened with having to reconcile the genre's aesthetics (mission accomplished) with its subject matter (eeehhh)--this is just zeroing in on the former without even bothering to deal with the latter.</p><p>Which is great! I absolutely do not want to play an actual cyberpunk city-builder. This is not a fictional space known for its strong central services and tax revenue! Focusing solely on the aesthetics and allowing us to do nothing else but swim in the vibes is just fine, thank you.</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>For decades, Hideo Kojima was one of the top video game designers and directors at Konami, as well as the driving force behind the Metal Gear series. But in 2015, Kojima left Konami behind and struck out on his own. The relationship between the two sides was reportedly strained, with Geoff Keighley revealing Kojima was not allowed by Konami to attend that year's Game Awards. Regardless, at least one producer at Konami would love to bring Kojima back to the franchise he created.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/konami-producer-says-it-would-be-the-dream-for-kojima-to-return-to-metal-gear/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Game Chronicle</a>, <a href="https://fandom.slack.com/archives/C045JJ0S5UM/p1719582757714659?thread_ts=1719582661.433959&amp;cid=C045JJ0S5UM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> producer Noriaki Okamura expressed his admiration for Kojima during a live stream. Okamura also shared his desire to have Kojima return to Metal Gear Solid in the future.</p><p>"Just speaking for myself, personally, I'd like nothing better than to work with Mr. Kojima and the rest of the team again," said Okamura. "If that could happen, it would be the dream."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXoV47YGV70" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mXoV47YGV70" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Okamura qualified his remarks by noting that Kojima and his team may not share the same sentiment about returning to Konami. Despite Kojima's lack of involvement with the remake of Snake Eater, his story is intact in Metal Gear Solid Delta and the game will feature the original voice recordings including David Hayter's performance as Naked Snake/Big Boss.</p><p>As for Kojima, he and his team have more than enough projects to work on, including Death Stranding 2, OD for Xbox Series X, and a new property with Sony that has yet to be officially unveiled.</p>

<p>Lost Records was originally due out in late 2024, which is also when the next Life is Strange is set to launch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-turning-up-the-heat-with-its-super-sexy-lovestruck-expansion-pack<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The Sims team keeps bringing the heat. As part of its "summer of love" efforts, it has announced a new expansion pack for its life-simulation game.</p>
<p>It's known as the Sims 4 Lovestruck Expansion Pack, and if the reveal trailer is anything to go by, it promises plenty of sexy shenanigans including gyrating while wearing an oversized aubergine costume. Excuse me for one moment, I need to go and get myself a cold drink, 'cause things just got steamy!</p>
<p>"It's time to open your heart to romance in the beautiful world of Ciudad Enamorada! Go on swoon-worthy dates in the neighbourhood; your Sims will be able to hunt for the best spot to try the romantic blanket in the city's gardens, dance until morning at their favourite night club, or even experience the beautiful simplicity of sitting together to watch the stars," reads the official blurb.</p>

<p>Ciudad Enamorada itself is described as the "perfect place" for all of these romantic experiences, with Sims 4 players able to create dating profiles for their character via the Cupid's Corner app.</p>
<p>Once Sims are all set up, there will also be the chance try out the expansion pack's new romantic interactions, which include a new kiss, a sultry dance (assume it's the one shown in the trailer above) and three new WooHoo spots.</p>
<p>Of course, while it certainly sounds like there will be the opportunity to WooHoo like you've never made your sims WooHoo before, there is still plenty of chance that hearts will be broken.</p>
<p>The Sims 4 team has introduced a Romantic Boundaries system, however. This system will allow players to "customise your Sim's experience with boundaries and jealousy", meaning they can define how any given Sim approaches romantic relationships in terms of physical and emotional romantic exclusivity. "This allows for Sims to date multiple Sims without impact to other relationships," the team said.</p>
<p>The Sims 4 Lovestruck Expansion Pack is set to saunter its way onto PC, Xbox and PlayStation next month, on 25th July, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/store/addons/the-sims-4-lovestruck-expansion-pack">retailing at £35</a>.</p>
<p>Those that pre-order the pack - or at least purchase it before 5th September - will be able to get their hands on the Cry Me a River Eyeliner (which shows the wearer's eyeliner streaming down their cheeks), the Herbert Heart Plushie, and the Basic Breakup Double Bed (according to The Sims 4 team, "your ex took the bed, but not your dignity! Mostly"). You can see these items in the second image below.</p>

  <p id="DAQNR3"><strong>Pictomancer</strong> is a casting job in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a>, introduced alongside the <em>Dawntrail</em> expansion. Using a magicked brush and palette, players can paint their spells to deal damage.</p>
<p id="Spq5Qg">This magical ranged DPS cannot resurrect allies the way that Red Mages and Summoners can, but they can buff their allies and move quickly using a magical dash.</p>
<p id="KYdzac">Below, we explain what you need to do to unlock Pictomancer in <em>FFXIV</em>.</p>
<hr id="nkFzWZ">

<p id="lyNzRz">Pictomancer unlocks via a quest in Old Gridania. Before you head there, you’ll want to make sure you have met the following prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li id="3eMPX9">You have one combat job at level 80 or higher.</li>
<li id="QJHm7e">You own the <em>Dawntrail</em> expansion.</li>
</ul>
<p id="noodYa">Once you meet those two requirements, head over to <strong>Old Gridania</strong> and talk to the <strong>Cheerless Hearer NPC</strong> at the location below to accept the quest “The Joy of Pictomancy.”</p>

<p>If you don’t mind a free-to-play game, especially one with such interesting gameplay mechanics as The First Descendant, then you’re liable to download said game on any system you can, right? Well, what systems is The First Descendant releasing on?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-the-first-descendant-on-playstation">Can You Play The First Descendant on PlayStation?</h2>



<p>Good news! You can play The First Descendant on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on day one. There is no waiting period for the console release, despite a clear focus on PC, and it’s still free-to-play on both systems.</p>



<p>If you visit the PlayStation Store on your specific system and search for “The First Descendant,” you’ll find the game available to download on July 2!</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-the-first-descendant-on-xbox">Can You Play The First Descendant on Xbox?</h2>



<p>The First Descendant will launch on both Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S on July 2, the same day as all other systems. However, if you go searching for the game on the Xbox Store right now, it says unavailable. On launch day, it will change to available.</p>



<p>Simply follow the usual steps by opening up the Xbox Store, searching for “The First Descendant,” and then downloading the game in the background on launch day!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-first-descendant-on-pc">Is The First Descendant on PC?</h2>



<p>On PC, The First Descendant will only be available on Steam. It’s not on the Epic Games Store, and that’s likely a good thing, depending on your personal outlook on the digital storefront. </p>



<p>To download The First Descendant on PC, visit the Steam Store, search for “The First Descendant” in the top right search bar, and then add the game to your account for free!</p>

<p>Palworld’s much-anticipated expansion is now live, helping bring players back to the “Pokemon with Guns” game that went viral at the beginning of 2024. Palworld’s Sakurajima Island is now live for PCs and Xbox consoles with updated <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4159718272378624292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">v0.3.1</a> and a bunch of new content for the players to immerse themselves in. Learn more about the features of Palword’s Sakurajima expansion below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that Sakurajima is a free expansion with a new island. Players have to work towards taking over a tower that is protected by the latest faction, “The Moonflowers”, and save the island from their evil grasp. The Sakurajima also brings some new species of Pals to capture in Palworld.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Palworld players have a new spot for PvP battles, as a new arena has been introduced in the Desiccated Desert, where players around will battle it out to emerge victorious. A new stronghold under the control of Rayne Syndicate, Oil Rig, has also appeared, and you need to use the aid of your friends to defeat the dangerous enemies that lie here and acquire valuable resources such as crude oil. Sakurajima’s Crude Oil can also be extracted by placing the crude oil extractor at specific locations. Players can also use the new material Plasteel to create other extracting equipment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Get ready to level up, Palworld players! The new cap has been set at level 55, offering more technologies and increasing the upper limit for the Pal capture bonus to 12 from 10. But that’s not all. A new raid in Palworld’s Sakurajima Island, the Blazamat Ryu, has arrived, featuring the strongest Dragon Pal yet.</p>



<p>Good news, Palworld players! You can now store 960 Pals, doubling the original capacity of 480. No more worries about running out of space for your Pals. Plus, Palworld’s Sakurajima expansion brings a host of new features, including a Meteorite event, a new medal merchant, new weapons, NPC and Pal cosmetics, buildings, and a range of fixes and adjustments. Get ready to explore and enjoy all these new possibilities!&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo has yet to bring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-no-complaints-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official complaints </a>against Palworld. Have you tried out Palworld’s Sakurajima expansion? Let us know in the comments. </p>

If that could happen, that would be the dream.”</p><p>Okamura noted that Kojima and others have moved on to new things and have new commitments, so <a title="Companies > Konami Digital Entertainment [1,069 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/konami">Konami</a> cannot be dependent on them, nor set any expectations that they return.</p><p>Okamura also said that Kojima and the original <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em> development staff will be credited for their original roles in <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, just as they were in <em><a title="Games > Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1</a></em>.</p><p>The discussion about Kojima was part of a small set of user-submitted questions featured at the end of the video. Here is the full set of questions and answers:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Is there any chance that the original staff members will return to work on, co-develop, or supervise any of the <em>Metal Gear</em> series?</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Noriaki Okamura, Production Producer:</strong> “Wow, okay. I can see we’re starting with a tough one, huh. Well, it’s not my place to answer on behalf of anyone outside the company, or to guess how they might feel about it. But just speaking for myself, personally, I’d like nothing better than to work with Mr. Kojima and the rest of the team again. If that could happen, that would be the dream. But people have moved on to new things and new commitments, and that’s just our current reality. We can’t just take it for granted that everyone would work with us again, or let ourselves be completely dependent on them. I just don’t think it’s right for us to be the ones to make that kind of demand of anyone. So we’re working with the expectation that whatever we make, it’s up to us, it’s on our shoulders to do a good job.</p><p>“But on a related detail, since we had a lot of questions about this, Mr. Kojima and all the original development staff are of course credited for their original roles. They were already included in the [<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1</em>], and they’ll be listed in <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> as well. They’re a part of these games too, so absolutely, they’re in.”</p><p><strong>Will all the characters in <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> have the same voice acting as the original? Will there be any new performances?</strong></p><p><strong>Okamura:</strong> “For both Japanese and English, the story of the game and all the voice acting will be the same. We definitely didn’t do any recasting. However, and this is something you see a lot in <em>Metal Gear</em>, but characters will give you advice on how to play, especially the controls. But some of those lines don’t match up with the controls on consoles now, and you can’t really have that, so we’ve actually recorded new versions of just those lines. And, sadly, some of the original cast is no longer with us, or couldn’t be available to record, so in those cases we’ve made sure that we have permission first, then went through and made use of their existing recordings to assemble the new lines.”</p><p><strong>Who is involved in the development of <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>? Are you using any outside studios?</strong></p><p><strong>Okamura:</strong> “I think we mentioned this briefly in our last episode, but we do still have many of the same people who worked on the original <em>Metal Gear solid 3: Snake Eater</em> as part of the team. And, we’re also working with a number of people at outside partners. In particular, we’re working closely with the very skilled team at <a title="Companies > Virtuos [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/virtuos">Virtuos</a>, who have previously helped us on other <em>Metal Gear</em> titles as well. They’re assisting us on several fronts, especially because we’re building this game in Unreal Engine 5, instead of the FOX Engine that we’ve been using up until now. Their expertise in that area has been a huge help. We’re really glad to have them working with us.”</p><p><strong>When you decided on a remake title, why did you start with <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Okamura:</strong> “Well, <em>Metal Gear</em>, as a series, has quite a lot of ground to cover, but when we stepped back and took a look at the saga as a whole, it just made the most sense to us to start with <em>Snake Eater</em>. And I know there’s plenty of people who haven’t played a <em>Metal Gear</em> game before, and some of them probably just went, “you want us to play <em>3</em>, first?” So I just want to assure everyone, don’t worry, <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> is the perfect place to get started with <em>Metal Gear</em>.”</p></blockquote><p>Watch the full video below.
