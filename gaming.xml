			<p>As of today, the co-op update for Forever Skies is officially out and will allow players to group up in teams of four to explore the vast world that the game has to offer. All PC players will be able to play together with the co-op update, where you can work together to gather supplies, fight for survival, and help build up a fully customizable airship to help each other survive on the toxic, post-apocalyptic Earth. For those interested in the game, Far From Home is offering a<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> limited-time discount</a> on Forever Skies on Steam until January 2.</p>
<p>Of course, co-op is not the only thing that has been added to this game, as they have taken player feedback to heart and have reworked some of the key elements in the game, as well as added new content to keep it fresh and exciting for anyone who is joining the game in Early Access. As Early Access continues, new features will be added to the game. For the latest update, that, of course, includes co-op. Also, the gameplay loop has been overhauled in terms of survival, progression, and exploration, allowing players to get a fresh experience that doesn't cause them to feel too samey after playing the game for a while.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forever Skies | World Evolved &amp; Co-op Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uHq8D-gxoWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To make that possible, they have made substantial world layout redesigns, including overhauled location designs. There will now also be dynamic random encounters to keep you on your toes, whether you're surviving by yourself or teaming up with friends. There are now new additional enemy threats as well that you will have to learn to fight off to keep yourself safe.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy easter eggs from other games, you'll be able to discover new artifacts that have themed items from Planet Crafter, Pacific Drive, Frostpunk 2, and Medieval Dynasty as a fun little addition to the game.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't all that has been added to the game, as there are also new tools and devices that the players can research and build for themselves, which will allow new ways to progress through the game. This includes new resources that you'll be able to utilize in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>"Launching co-op mode is a huge milestone for us. Forever Skies was built with an emphasis on immersion and exploration, and we believe that experiencing this world with friends adds a new layer of excitement and depth," says Andrzej Blumenfeld, Creative Director at Far From Home.</p>
<p>Forever Skies is currently available on PC, with a single-player demo available to play now on PlayStation 5. Forever Skies is s<a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-full-release-delayed-to-2025-extending-early-access-period/">et to launch from Early Access in early 2025</a> on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monument-valley-3-comes-to-netflix-with-an-iconoclastic-edge.1056057/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317107/monument-valley-3-netflix-launch-ustwo-games-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Tucked away in a leafy part of south London, the historic Oval cricket stadium peeking above nearby houses, some 30 developers at Ustwo Games have been striving to solve one of the defining creative conundrums of modern entertainment: how do you balance the familiarity of a beloved franchise with freshness? The problem is exaggerated with <em>Monument Valley</em>, the acclaimed puzzle series that debuted in 2014. The architectural puzzles of the first entry already felt crystalline; the minimalist aesthetic was already fully formed. Can such a refined formula even be evolved?</p><p><em>Monument Valley 3</em>, which arrives on mobile devices via Netflix on December 10th, answers that question confidently: yes, and then some.</p><p>In hindsight, 2017’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15728558/monument-valley-2-announce-release-iphone-ipad"><em>Monument Valley 2</em></a>, an undeniably beautiful iteration of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/3/5573812/monument-valley-mc-escher-ipad-game">era-defining original</a>, didn’t push the envelope far enough. For the third entry, game director Jennifer Estaris says, “we knew we wanted to do a major change. We wanted to make a splash.” Estaris’ use of the word “splash” is instructive: at various points during <em>Monument Valley 3</em>, water begins to rise, submerging the looping staircases and Moorish towers that have defined the series. Elsewhere, players explore long stretches of open water on a boat, sailing along beautifully tessellated waves. Both offer a clue as to the more irreverent personality of this threequel — a desire to break with the past.&nbsp;</p><p>Nature and — most importantly — unruly, winding vegetative shapes, feature prominently in <em>Monument Valley 3</em>. It is a game about ecosystems. Genuine peril causes the game’s inhabitants to scatter. In a sense, they become refugees. An allegory for the climate crisis presents itself. But it’s not wholly accurate to think of <em>Monument Valley 3</em> as growing directly out of <em>The Lost Forest</em>, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/monument-valley-2-adds-new-chapter-to-promote-forest-conservation/">a DLC add-on for <em>Monument Valley 2</em></a>, or that the expansion was a proof of concept for this wilder take.</p><p>Initially, a smaller team experimented with abandon. “We had a first-person version,” says Estaris. “We had a multiplayer version. We had one where you could create your own architecture. People could create their own levels.”</p><p>Slowly, themes began to emerge. The idea of found family became an anchor for the game’s developers, many of whom have migrant parents or, like Estaris, are new to the UK (she moved from Denmark). Lead designer Emily Brown, who grew up in the Middle East, remembers the team wanting to make a “more personal, people-oriented” experience — a counterpoint to the franchise’s, at times, coldly monolithic architecture. She recalls one scene that summed up the new direction: “a little hillside with little buildings on it, and a puzzle that takes place on a much smaller scale.” It became clear to Brown that Ustwo wasn’t making a “solitary” <em>Monument Valley</em> game. “It’s about bringing people together,” she says.</p><p>The first <em>Monument Valley</em> defined an era of premium mobile titles. It was the killer app for the iPad and iPhone, a game whose design-oriented ethos perfectly matched the form, function, and elegance of those devices. In the Ustwo studio, a chic, warehouse-type space with walls covered in colorful artworks, there is a shelf where a BAFTA award for <em>Monument Valley </em>sits. A dollhouse-sized model of <em>Monument Valley</em> is positioned on a table a handful of meters away, a physical ode to the franchise that has reached more than 150 million players. The series looms large in the studio’s psyche and occupies an important place in its finances.</p><p>“The first <em>Monument Valley</em> is a time capsule of 2013 / 2014 graphic design,” says lead artist Lili Ibrahim, referencing the clean lines of its perfectly crafted, impossible architecture and brain-massaging, soft-pastel color blends. Ibrahim wondered, “What can <em>Monument Valley 3 </em>be influenced by to create a time capsule of graphic design today?” She immersed herself in magazines, websites, and art exhibitions. Of particular resonance were “destructive” and “deconstructive” fashion editorials with paint splodges over the top of them and images butchered by gaping cut-out holes. Ibrahim attended a retrospective on the UK artist Cornelia Parker and saw the famous 1991 installation <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/parker-cold-dark-matter-an-exploded-view-t06949/story-cold-dark-matter"><em>Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View</em></a> — essentially a freeze-frame of a garden shed at the moment of its obliteration. “Seeing this was so freeing to me,” she says. “I could imagine the buildings in <em>Monument Valley</em> doing this.”</p><p>This is precisely what happens in some of <em>Monument Valley 3’s </em>more visually striking puzzles. One origami-inspired stage, which is textured to evoke Japanese washi paper, sees architecture unfurl and unfold like a deconstructed 3D net. Another sees you literally exploding architecture in slow motion so that it comes to resemble a kind of blooming cubic flowerhead.&nbsp;</p><p>There is an ornateness to <em>Monument Valley</em> 3 that breaks with the restraint of previous entries. The curves of nature threaten to overwhelm the clean lines of the people-made structures; the colors are deep, rich, and at times, foreboding. <em>Monument Valley 3</em> is a visually lusher, busier game than what came before. The level select screen sees the protagonist, Noor, standing in a lighthouse and rotating intricate stained glass panels. Diffuse light cascades through each resplendent image. The result is breathtakingly opulent.</p><p>An even bigger surprise is what’s happening to <em>Monument Valley 3</em> after release. Ustwo is pivoting to a live-service model, albeit in a way that eschews the “grind” and “addictive, compulsive loops” of some free-to-play titles, says Estaris. Additional content will be released for at least a year after launch in the form of seasonal puzzles and storied chapters, a move that fits Netflix’s subscription model well. It presumably also makes solid business sense.</p><p>Estaris, who worked on the endless runner behemoth <em>Subway Surfers</em> before joining Ustwo in 2020, compares the base game to a piece of orchestral “classical music.” The additional content, meanwhile, is closer to “jazz” — looser, freer, and more experimental mechanically and visually. Estaris hopes players will develop a “healthy habit” with <em>Monument Valley 3</em>, akin to completing the “Sunday crossword puzzle.”</p><p><em>Monument Valley 3 </em>arrives just over a decade after the original, and a lot more has changed than the decline of premium mobile and the rise of subscriptions. In 2014, users were still in their honeymoon period with smartphones and tablets. Now, the relationship has soured for many, who are reexamining their relationships with these devices. Short-form video has exploded thanks to TikTok, and there are concerns about the link between excessive screen time, social media use, and what <a href="https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/loneliness-epidemic-persists-post-pandemic-look">some research groups</a> call a “loneliness epidemic.” A common <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/jenny-odell-how-to-do-nothing-book-review/">critique</a> is that the extractive, capitalist logic of tech and digital media has intensified, finding newly vampiric ways of bleeding users’ attention dry.</p><p>Danny Gray, Ustwo’s chief creative officer, once <a href="https://www.theringer.com/video-games/2024/4/3/24119719/monument-valley-10-year-anniversary-ustwo-mobile-gaming-apple-ios">called</a> the original <em>Monument Valley</em> a “sanctuary in your pocket.” He emphasized that you could pull out your smartphone anywhere — the bus, the toilet, the airport — and enter into a chill Zen-like space. You feel this sensibility even more acutely playing <em>Monument Valley 3</em>. For all the various ways it moves with the times — the live-service pivot, newly embellished visuals, and freeform gameplay — its meditative core remains intact. This is no mean feat in an era when most digital media and, crucially, the act of interfacing with it, feels defined by a kind of anxiety and restlessness.</p><p>“I’m not saying <em>Monument Valley 3</em> is a perfect corrective to all that,” says lead producer John Lau. “But it is made in the spirit of something that is not disposable — something that you can cherish and take with you as a memory.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you’re familiar with Blur’s work on some of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHCA8tK117c&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHCA8tK117c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best cinematic trailers</a></span> from the past decade or so, you won’t be surprised that the animation across all 15 episodes is truly beautiful. It’s the notable lack of heart and soul in its storytelling as it aspires for big, emotional prestige that lets down several of the episodes, which—if excised—could have made for a more impressive series. Instead, we essentially have 15 trailers, all with roughly the same emotional cadence, and only a few of them succeeding in telling a story that doesn’t just feel like a really expensive advertisement.</p><p>As I look at the 15 games <em>Secret Level</em>’s anthology episodes cover, I’m still not sure why the show chose these stories to tell. But I have a theory: An Amazon series releasing an episode based on the company’s MMO <em>New World </em>under the guise of an artistic endeavor makes for easy promotion. <em>Concord</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">a short-lived hero shooter</a></span> Sony has no intention of promoting any longer but was clearly hoping would be its next big live-service hit, has an entire episode that feels like an extended cinematic trailer dedicated to its “we have <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>at home” world. In other words, while several of the games featured in <em>Secret Level </em>are huge properties with the cultural cache to make them obvious choices for an anthology paying tribute to video games, most episodes feel like extensions of marketing.</p><p><em>Secret Level</em> airs on December 10, meaning some of the games this show highlights are either not out yet or were in active development alongside the show. <em>Concord</em> is, of course, the strangest and most awkward inclusion given the game’s fate, but it’s <em>Exodus: Odyssey</em>—the upcoming sci-fi game from Wizards of the Coast’s Archetype Entertainment—that gets one of the most exhaustingly self-indulgent episodes. The game was announced less than a year ago, and we haven’t even seen it in motion. Wizards of the Coast’s properties also make another appearance in a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> episode. Again, <em>Secret Level </em>makes more sense as a business transaction than it does as 15 stories being told because someone out there genuinely felt they were worth telling.</p><p><em>Concord</em> isn’t PlayStation’s only episode. Easily the worst, least self-aware episode of the show follows a young woman who works as a delivery courier for a company that rewards workers for their personal best delivery times with focus-tested cosmetic upgrades. She sheds her monotonous corporate life by hanging out with a blue slime monster and running away from virtual reality (or maybe real? It’s not quite clear) versions of PlayStation characters like a colossus from <em>Shadow of the Colossus </em>and Kratos from <em>God of War </em>as she bikes through the city. See, you wake up every morning with that grindset, trying to get the best cosmetics while working your life away for your careless corporate owners, but the real cool kids don’t buy into that system with their silly little jobs and play PlayStation games instead? Corporations are evil and manipulating you into doing their bidding with terrible rewards, but getting back to your PlayStation is your safe space? The brand will never hurt you? Or something? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547">Unless you’re a developer under its umbrella</a></span>, I guess. It trades any form of coherent storytelling for cameos from a number of PlayStation characters in an effort to make fans clap and cheer, and could easily be condensed into a TV spot at the Super Bowl.</p><p>Several episodes are strangely nondescript. <em>Crossfire</em>’s episode is a fairly generic military shooter cutscene characterized almost exclusively by the edgy bleakness of its early 2000s era. <em>Exodus</em>’ episode is gorgeous to look at, but if you put a gun to my head I don’t think I would have been able to identify which game it was from. The times <em>Secret Level</em>’s episodes<em> </em>do stand out occur when the show leans into stylistic animation that doesn’t blend into the rest of the series. These are 15 unique games, so why do half of them look the same? It makes such a difference when they look distinct, like the episode based on <em>Sifu</em>, which sums up the game’s roguelike martial arts structure, and the one for <em>Spelunky</em>, which ditches the photorealism employed by most of <em>Secret Level</em> and captures the adventurous spirit of Mossmouth’s cave-delving adventure.</p><p>Some of the adaptations are less faithful. The <em>Pac-Man </em>episode takes a psychological body horror approach to the early arcade mega-hit, a concept which is interesting in a vacuum and results in some of the show’s most memorable sequences. However, in the context of <em>Pac-Man</em>’s typically all-ages history, it feels like the officially licensed equivalent of a Disney character <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mickey-mouse-infestation-88-origins-horror-game-1851134630&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mickey-mouse-infestation-88-origins-horror-game-1851134630">getting thrust into a horror property</a></span> once it enters the public domain. <em>Mega Man</em> doesn’t go quite as hard in that direction, but it nonetheless turns the colorful series of action platformers into a somewhat dark coming-of-age story that marries <em>Secret Level</em>’s prestige storytelling leanings with the father/son dynamic of the titular robot hero and his creator. It’s one of the series’ standouts, but even better episodes like this one, <em>Sifu</em>, and <em>Spelunky</em> can’t clean the stench of cynical advertising that lingers over the whole show.</p><p><em>Secret Level </em>is, in a word, uneven. Its animation is stunning, but it feels like Blur Studio leaned too hard on its experience of making trailers with swelling emotional arcs designed to nudge a customer to their closest game store. When creator Tim Miller announced the show back at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-trailers-announcements-1851627031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-trailers-announcements-1851627031">Gamescom in August</a></span>, he tearfully called it a “love letter” to video games. But the result is something that feels more like a collection of expensive commercials, one of them for a game you can’t even play anymore.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Developer Argonaut Games announced that the remaster for Croc Legend of the Gobbos has been delayed into 2025. The game was originally scheduled to be released in December 2024.</p>



<p>In a message <a href="https://x.com/ArgonautGames_/status/1865093859237056975" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted online</a>, Argonaut said that game will now launch in Q1 2025.</p>



<p>“After careful consideration, we have decided to push the launch into Q1 2025,”  they said. “This decision was not made lightly, but we believe that a little more time is needed to add the final touches to ensure the game meets the high standards that we aspire to and which you deserve.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The statement continues by acknowledging that the news is “disappointing” for players to hear. The team wanted to make sure, however, that the game had the “quality and polish” it needs for release.</p>



<p>“[Our] goal has always been to deliver a game with the quality and polish that will truly delight,” they said. “We appreciate your patience and support as we work to bring Croc back in the best possible way.”</p>



<p>Despite the game’s delay, Argonaut seems excited about the return of the franchise. In a reply to a <a href="https://x.com/ArgonautGames_/status/1865976674568880358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fan on Twitter</a> on Sunday, they teased more Croc remasters, including Croc 3, should the first game do well when it launches.</p>



<p>“We’ve already stated that if the Croc remasters do well, we’d like to make Croc 3,” they said.</p>

<p>EA FC 25’s servers are unpredictable at best. It doesn’t matter how good your internet connection and speed are, if the servers don’t want to play ball (literally), then there’s nothing you can do. So let’s update you with the latest EA FC 25 server status changes.</p>



<p>It’s happened to us at all at some point. You’re ready for an epic EA FC 25 sesh with epic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ea-sports-fc-25-tactics-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tactics</a> at the ready, and you’re met with an “unable to connect to the EA servers” screen. EA FC 25 servers are not immune to this most frustrating issue, and I wish I could give it a red card.</p>



<p>We don’t need VAR to help us crack the mystery of EA FC 25’s server status though. There are a few ways to monitor the soccer title’s online servers and keep up with their latest developments.</p>

<p><strong>Right now, EA FC 25 servers are not down, and they are fully operational and running without a hitch.</strong></p>



<p>Our latest personal check of the EA FC 25 servers is happening now on Dec. 9, 2024. It’s not always easy to keep track of these things though, so, I’ve come up with a multitude of ways you can use to keep an eye on the EA FC 25 servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-ea-fc-25-server-status">How to Check EA FC 25 Server Status</h2>



<p>You can use <strong>EA’s official help page</strong>, <strong>track EA’s X social media communications and EA Help channels</strong>, and keep up with <strong>people’s real-life experiences of the EA FC 25 servers</strong> for the latest information.</p>



<h3 id="h-ea-fc-25-server-help-page">EA FC 25 Server Help Page</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/faq/are-ea-servers-down/?isIhi=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA Help</a> site has tons of different answers for technical questions related to the company’s various games. One of its main uses is the live service check which tracks the online connectivity status of online EA titles. </p>



<p>It includes the EA App and EA Play, along with a bunch of games: Apex Legends, Battlefield 2042, EA SPORTS College Football 25, EA FC 24, EA FC 25, FIFA 23, Madden NFL 24, Madden NFL 25, NHL 24, NHL 25, STAR WARS Battlefront II, The Sims 4, and EA SPORTS UFC 5.</p>



<p>I would be remiss to mention this crucial line on the page though: “We update this page as quickly as possible when a server goes down, <strong>but there might be delays</strong>.” Even though this is a handy source, there are other ways of checking the EA FC 25 servers we need to consider.</p>



<h3 id="h-ea-help-amp-ea-sports-fc-communications-on-x">EA Help &amp; EA Sports FC Communications on X</h3>



<p>Social media site X has two different pages I think are useful for monitoring EA FC 25’s server status issues: <a href="https://x.com/EAHelp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA Help</a> and <a href="https://x.com/EASFCDirect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA SPORTS FC Direct Communication</a>.</p>



<p>EA Help is recommended by EA itself as a more up-to-date page that has the chance of being refreshed quicker than the main Server Help page.</p>



<p>Whereas EA SPORTS FC Direct Communication is a more general way of talking to the player base. Depending on the server status and major outages, it’s always handy to have, just in case.</p>







<p>People like ourselves are as relatable as anyone. If the servers are down and affecting me, there’s a good chance I’m going to complain about it. Many players take to different forms of social media to complain—inadvertently giving a <strong>live update on the situation</strong>.</p>



<p>This is why I’m pushing you to bookmark the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsFC/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports FC Reddit</a>, as well as the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/easportsfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord server</a>. If you ignore the complaint posts about EA FC 25, there’s a lot of helpful information on these boards!</p>

<p>How has your experience been with the EA FC 25 servers this year? Have you played silky, slick football with no issue? Or is it like running around a wet, muddy pitch?

                <p>The partnership between Xbox and IHOP kicked off in November with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-themed-menu-coming-to-ihop-as-custom-xbox-series-x-revealed/1100-6527736/" data-ref-id="1100-6527736">special-edition custom pancake Xbox</a> and a menu inspired by Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Now it's come to light that the partnership also includes the opportunity to get Indiana Jones and the Great Circle for "free" if you spend enough money at IHOP.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1866167680635691190" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>, one of the perks of joining IHOP's loyalty program is the opportunity to earn PanCoins, which can be exchanged for a free copy of the game. It doesn't come cheap, though. Members earn one PanCoin for every $5 spent, and to unlock The Great Circle, you need 40 PanCoins ($200).</p><p>The Great Circle isn't the only game available, though, as 40 PanCoins also gets you a copy of Sea of Thieves, which is a completely different type of game. Meanwhile, 15 PanCoins gets you a one-month trial for Game Pass Ultimate. You can <a href="https://www.ihop.com/en/rewards/xbox-stack-market" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">see all the available rewards on IHOP's website.</a></p><p>Of course, eating a lot of breakfast food is not the most direct or logical way to go about getting your hands on The Great Circle. After all, the game is included with Game Pass Ultimate ($20/month) and PC Game Pass ($12/month), and is also available for direct purchase starting at $70 USD. As it happens, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-is-steeply-discounted-just-in-time-for-indiana-jones/1100-6526404/" data-ref-id="1100-6526404">Game Pass is steeply discounted right now</a>, just in time for the launch of The Great Circle.</p><p>The Great Circle is out now on Xbox and PC, and will come to PlayStation 5 in Spring 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-and-mafia-the-old-country-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following Randy Pitchford's social tease that the Borderlands 4 reveal would be coming soon, the official franchise page on X has now <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1866166006353449188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1866166006353449188%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the game will be shown at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2024 show. The tweet also boasts how it will be the franchise's most ambitious installment to date.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom this year for a generic 2025 release window. Other than the confirmation that it will take place on a brand new planet, not much has been shared so far. The studio did provide fans with a few concept art <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-concept-art-revealed-at-pax-west-202/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during a panel at PAX West 2024</a>, but those were mere tidbits.</p>
<p>The series certainly needs a bit of pick-me-up following the disastrous launch of the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-borderlands-movie-trailer-is-finally-here-at-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live action adaptation.</a> Despite the presence of actors like Cate Blanchett, Jamie Lee Curtis, Édgar Ramírez, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart, the film was a massive box office bomb (making only about a quarter of its $120 million budget back), receiving equally devastating reviews from critics and fans.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the previous game in the series sold extremely well, surpassing 18 million units last year. Undoubtedly, Gearbox owner Take Two (following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-buys-gearbox-for-460-million-confirms-new-borderlands-game-among-other-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$460 million acquisition from Embracer Group</a>) will try to match or even exceed those financial results with Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>It seems like they're going all-in with The Game Awards 2024, anyway, as another heavy hitter of their 2025 lineup <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1866165956134707406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it will also show a new trailer at the show. We're referring to Mafia: The Old Country, which was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024. Developed by Hangar 13, it will function as a prequel, delving into the origins of the Mafia in the fictional Sicilian city of San Celeste.</p>
<p>Those rumors about a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2024-will-have-big-news-says-vgcs-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">big The Game Awards 2024 show</a> are taking shape. As a reminder, the show will go live on Thursday, December 12, at 4:30 PM Pacific Time.</p>

(I had to pick up some dollies to move a couch. I highly recommend buying two flat dollies, man. They're  cheap and <em>very</em> useful for moving things.) And while I'll get into this more on the podcast, I must speak it into existence now: uh,<em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle </em>is<em> good good</em>. It's an immersive sim?

The answer is no. We do have some other cool stuff in the oven and we’ll talk about it tomorrow during the stream — we hope you’ll like it too! Appreciate the patience🙏"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, CD Projekt said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-enters-full-scale-production-cyberpunk-2077-hits-30-million-copies-sold"><u>The Witcher 4</u> had entered full-scale production</a>, with Project Polaris - the first instalment in the new Witcher trilogy - progressing from preproduction to full-scale production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m proud to confirm that several weeks ago the Polaris team wrapped up preproduction and moved on to full-scale production – the most intensive phase of development,” commented joint CEO Michał Nowakowski. “We are very pleased with our progress on this project, and I wish to thank the team for its dedication.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm thrilled to announce that Project Polaris has entered the full-scale production phase," game director Sebastian Kalemba <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a>. "With new challenges just around the corner, it’s the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what’s on the other side of the coin!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt currently has 400 developers working on Polaris, the majority of its 650-person total development staff. That's down from the 410 reported at the end of July. 64 are working on Orion, the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, 42 on Sirius, The Witcher game developed by The Molasses Flood, and 18 on Hadar, CD Projekt's brand new IP. It seems that the developer also had a few members of staff tucked away making this new Cyberpunk 2077 update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news comes as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077"><u>Cyberpunk 2077</u></a> hit an astonishing 30 million copies sold, with the Phantom Liberty expansion selling over eight million. CD Projekt pointed to “strong sales” of both as well as The Witcher 3 during its recent third quarter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In less than four years since release we’ve already sold 30 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077, and as for Phantom Liberty – in just over a year it has sold over eight million copies,” Nowakowski added. “These are impressive figures. I’m very happy to see a large, dedicated community coalesce around our Cyberpunk games. In the coming year the base game, along with its expansion, will be released to a new group of users: owners of Mac devices powered by Apple Silicon chips."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Some things are just meant to be. Peanut butter and chocolate. Movie theaters and popcorn. The Cleveland Browns and failure. By all rights, Power Rangers and a mid-90s arcade beat ‘em up should also be on that list. It just seems like something written in the book that determines cosmic history, willed into existence by a higher power. But it never happened. Yes, there were a couple of middling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-snes">SNES/Genesis sidescrollers</a>, but like most console beat ‘em ups at the time, they were limited by their at-home hardware. We never got a proper, glorious four-to-six player arcade cabinet, or even a game designed like it was made for one. At least, not until now. With Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind, developer Digital Eclipse has taken it upon itself to give us the Turtles in Time/X-Men/The Simpsons-style Power Rangers beat ‘em up we never got. A couple underwhelming gimmick sections mean Rita’s Rewind doesn’t quite manage to carve out a place for itself amongst the genre’s all-timers, but it is a pretty great beat ‘em up that’ll make you want to suit up and take a trip back through time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who absolutely loves arcade-style brawlers like this but doesn’t have much nostalgia for Power Rangers specifically, trust me when I say you don’t need to know “The Lore™” to follow Rita’s Rewind. In the distant future, the year 2023, Robo Rita decides to go back in time with her past self, Rita Repulsa, and take out the Power Rangers. The 2023 lineup can’t stop her, so it’s up to the original 1993 crew to step up and take care of business. (Time travel, baby! We’re making diagrams out of straws.) The story is pretty simple here, but it allows Digital Eclipse to write in some funny moments and interactions (the Ritas, despite working together, don’t get along) and put certain enemies in areas they shouldn’t be. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That setup also adds to the whole “this is a 90s arcade game” feel, just like the CRT filters, excellent, guitar-heavy soundtrack that can stand beside the genre’s best, and the absolutely stunning pixel art. Arcade games like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time and X-Men – as well as modern follow-ups like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-review"><u>Shredder’s Revenge</u></a> – worked in part because they nailed a vibe, not because their stories made logical sense, and Rita’s Rewind gets that. You’re not here for the lore; you’re here to kick some butt as a Power Ranger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a lot of ways, RIta’s Rewind adheres to the standards of the modern, retro-style beat ‘em up. The gameplay isn’t overly complex: you’ve got a basic attack combo, a throw if some mook gets too close for comfort, a double jump, rising and falling attacks, a running kick, a dodge, and a screen-clearing super attack you can unleash once your meter is full. If you want to pull off a sick combo beyond that, you’d better be playing with a friend who is willing to throw dudes at you so you can juggle ‘em. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/streets-of-rage-4-review"><u>Streets of Rage 4</u></a> this ain’t.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's a beat ‘em up built on the fundamentals that make the genre great.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What it is, then, is a three-hour beat ‘em up built on the fundamentals that make the genre great: characters that are just interesting enough (the Rangers — Red, Blue, Yellow, Black, and Pink — are more or less the same functionally), enemies that are fun to fight, cool environments that range from a theme park to a toxic waste dump, enticing Easter eggs and unlockables to hunt down, and unique boss fights, like the excellent one against Bones or the goofy brawl with Chunky Chicken. Rita’s Rewind has all of that. It feels great to play, the levels are memorable, the enemies force you to adapt on the fly, and the bosses are a ton of fun. And, of course, it’s all even better in co-op – as of launch, you can play with up to six people locally (except for on PlayStation, which is currently capped at four, but Digital Eclipse plans to bring that number up to six in a future update), though unfortunately online co-op is still to come in a free post-release update and will be limited to two players when it does arrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All that is to say: beat ‘em ups are kind of a magic trick, the secret sauce can be hard to identify, but you’ll know when it’s not there. In Rita’s Rewind? It’s definitely there. But Digital Eclipse wasn’t content to just trot out a good Power Rangers-themed brawler and call it a day. One of Rita’s Rewind’s highlights is its Super Scaler segments, which plop you into either the cockpit of the Megazord, the driver’s seat of a motorcycle, or behind the controls of your own individual Zord. These sections are, for the most part, pretty great, though certain ones can be frustrating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In general, they operate like arcade classic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/06/24/space-harrier-arcade-review"><u>Space Harrier</u></a>. You zoom toward the screen through a pseudo-3D level, chasing down a boss that Rita has jumbo-sized after you’ve beaten them in a fistfight, or just rolling through Putties if you’re on your bike. These sections are both visually impressive and a ton of fun as you dodge incoming fire, shoot down enemies, and acquire power-ups like missiles or the Double Shot. I loved all of the motorcycle segments, but the Dinozord ones were more mixed, partially because of some pretty crazy difficulty spikes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking the wrong hit or missing a jump in your Zord can cost you one of your limited lives, and it’s hard to dodge all of the stuff coming at you because there’s often so much on-screen at once. Certain Zord segments took my co-op partner and I several tries just because we kept losing lives to single hits or missed jumps. When they work, these segments are great, and provide some interesting differentiation between characters (the Pink Ranger’s pterodactyl is unique in that it can fly, for instance, making it easier to avoid attacks). When they don’t, however, they can be pretty miserable. Every continue I spent during Rita’s Rewind was in a Zord level. There’s certainly more good than bad here, but the bad… well, it’s notable.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Super Scaler levels can be a bit of a mixed bag.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Megazord sections, which serve as the cap to any given boss fight, are also more mixed. You can’t lose during these encounters, which is awesome, but they can be frustrating in a different way. You pilot the Megazord in first person, dodging the boss’s ranged attacks and charged strikes until you can get close enough to land some punches, which charges your Power Sword, in stages, for the final blow. Getting hit knocks you back and you lose any charge in a stage you haven’t fully built up (and in co-op, taking enough hits switches pilots, as well). That’s all fine and good, but the issue is that the boss can just jump away from you when you get close, so your goal is not only to get in without making too many mistakes, you also have to get lucky and hope the boss actually lets you punch them. And if you’re bad at dodging their projectiles, it can get very old, very quickly, especially in co-op. (In another bizarre twist, these levels add a lot more to your score than the beat ‘em up levels do, which feels odd given that Rita’s Rewind is a beat ‘em up first and foremost.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the Super Scaler levels are a mixed bag, but the additional one-off ideas certainly aren’t. Whether it’s a Super Scaler section aboard a rollercoaster, the obligatory elevator level, or wild time travel mechanics, Rita’s Rewind is at its best when it's experimenting. Take the time travel, for instance. Sometimes, Rita’s goons will have large tanks carrying the crystals that make time travel possible – damaging these tanks will cause time to rewind, putting you and your enemies in exactly the same place you were before the attack. It also resets your super bar, so you can spend it, trigger the rewind, and do it all over again until you take out the crystal. It encourages smart play while livening up otherwise standard encounters.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Licensed Games</h3><p>A list of the best licensed games unfit to print.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of cool one-offs, between missions you’ll hang out at the Juice Bar, where you can talk to professional losers Bulk and Skull, check in with Ernie, and see how any of the characters you’ve rescued over the course of the adventure, like Mr. Caplan and Ms. Appleby, are doing. The coolest thing about the Juice Bar, though, is the arcade games you can play. These are brand new, original games designed to answer one simple question: what arcade games <em>were</em> the Power Rangers playing during their downtime? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each one is missing a part, but if you find it out in one of Rita’s Rewind’s levels, you unlock that game for good. They’re pretty grand, whether you’re playing Karate Chopshop (think Mortal Kombat’s Test Your Might), Drive Bomber (a racing game where you try to blow up other cars and avoid the damage your bombs cause), or Nanopilot (Asteroids, but you’re trying to protects cells from invading viruses). They’re really fun, and my co-op partner and I often found ourselves stopping by for a run or two between missions. If I have one complaint about the Juice Bar, it’s that I wish you could change Rangers here between missions instead of having to back all the way out and re-select your save file. That’s kind of a bummer, especially since there’s no option to switch Rangers if you need to use a continue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Rita’s Rewind isn’t short on replay value. Beating the campaign unlocks the Green Ranger to enable that sixth (currently non-PlayStation) co-op slot, and there’s high scores to chase, S-ranks and deathless runs to achieve, new difficulties to conquer, collectibles to find, and a speed run mode. There’s plenty to do here after you’ve rolled credits for the first time, and I can see Rita’s Rewind becoming a staple in my beat ‘em up library.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind nails the look and feel of both Power Rangers and the classic arcade games it’s drawing inspiration from. While the Super Scaler levels can be a bit of a mixed bag, they sing when they work, and they’re still only manageably frustrating when they don’t. Everything else, though, rules — the gorgeous sprite work, bumping soundtrack, rock-solid beat ‘em up gameplay, in-jokes for fans, and other little touches like playable in-universe arcade games. And while nostalgia will certainly enhance the experience for some, you don’t have to know your Green Ranger from your Black Ranger to enjoy it. It might even give you an itch to revisit the classic games, or give the original television series a watch. You may not be able to go down to your local arcade anymore, but if Rita’s Rewind is any indication, you can always go back in time. Just pack some spandex.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.brandshield.com/">BrandShield's website</a> describes it as a service that "detects and hunts online trademark infringement, counterfeit sales, and brand abuse across multiple platforms.” The company claims to have multiple Fortune 500 and FTSE100 companies on its client list.</p>
<p>In its own series of social media posts, BrandShield <a href="https://x.com/BrandShieldltd/status/1866143933320892707">said</a> its "AI-driven platform" had identified "an abuse of Funko... from an itch.io subdomain." The takedown request it filed was focused on that subdomain, not the entirety of itch.io, BrandShield said.</p>
<p>"The temporary takedown of the website was a decision made by the service providers, not BrandShield or Funko."</p>
<p>The whole affair highlights how the delicate web of domain registrars and DNS servers can remain a key failure point for web-based businesses. Back in May, we saw how the desyncing of a single DNS root server <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/dns-glitch-that-threatened-internet-stability-fixed-cause-remains-unclear/">could cause problems across the entire Internet</a>. And in 2012, the hacking collective Anonymous highlighted <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/03/how-anonymous-plans-to-use-dns-as-a-weapon/">the potential for a coordinated attack</a> to take down the entire DNS system.</p>

<p>LEGO Fortnite, the original survival crafting game launched in December 2023, has changed its name to LEGO Fortnite Odyssey. A new Storm Chasers update for this game mode will arrive tomorrow, December 10, along with the name change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s Discover section now has a unique LEGO Fortnite Category, where players can find Odyssey and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-fortnites-brick-life-game-mode-arrives-this-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brick Life</a> as the new game modes. In Odyssey, players will find that the Storm King has invaded the world, and it’s up to them and their friends to take care of him and his storm-wild legion, which Raven leads.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-fortnite-storm-chasers-update-nbsp">LEGO Fortnite Storm Chasers Update&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Your new LEGO Fortnite Odyssey journey will begin at Storm Chaser village, where you meet characters like Carl Ruckus and Dr. Borrasca. Then, you will head out into the storms, where Storm Dungeons are located. Within these dungeons, you will find fragments of Storm King’s power that must be destroyed to loosen his control over the world. The enemies you are up against include the Acolytes, Raven and The Storm King himself.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-gameplay-mechanics">New Gameplay Mechanics</h2>



<p>LEGO Fortnite Odyssey’s Storm Chasers Update also introduces a set of new gameplay mechanics. Enemy health has been balanced, along with their health and damage points. Component-based crafting has been introduced, bringing more flexibility when choosing which materials to use. The Legendary Forge is an upgrade station that you can use to take your tools to the next level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, other players and NPCs can now revive players to get them back into the action. There are new vehicle-guided builds, such as the ‘Lil’ Barge’ and ‘Storm Chaser’. Lastly, LEGO Fortnite Odyssey is fully compatible with split-screen on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/6-steps-to-a-successful-playtesting-process-for-an-indie-developer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Player feedback is a powerful resource. It plays a key role in creating products that truly connect with the audience. While this might seem like an obvious point, such oversights happen far more often than you'd expect.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many indie developers fall into the trap of trying to create a one-in-a-million game, forgetting that complexity doesn’t always equal success. To this, our team is no exception.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We have seen how quickly players can give up on a game if it feels unnecessarily difficult. Just days before one of our release, after reading a particularly critical pre-release review, we made the decision to halve the game's difficulty. We increased the resources and experience available to players while significantly reducing the strength of the enemies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But even after that, Highfleet (the aforementioned release) proved to be too difficult for some players. This challenge isn’t unique to us – studios behind games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rain World</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have grappled with similar feedback. This always happens due to the common cognitive bias: what feels obvious to the creator can be completely baffling to the player, leading to frustration and a skewed perception of the game. Here, the only solution is extensive testing and diligent gathering of user feedback.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before you jump to conclusions — playtesting isn’t always costly. Indie developers on a tight budget start by testing games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>for free</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: involving friends, acquaintances or fans. Later, when there's a bit more room for some spending, developers use </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>low-cost methods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> like questionnaires and surveys. What’s in it for the people? Participants can be rewarded with game bonuses or free access to the full version after release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Professional</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> playtesting, which is the most expensive option, is typically reserved for targeting specific audiences (with the help of professional testing services), testing complex or large-scale games, or preparing for a multi-platform release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regardless of the budget, these six steps will guide indie developers toward receiving effective and valuable feedback.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Prepare for the test."><span>1. Prepare for the test.</span><br></h3><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Define the key elements</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of the game to be tested (control, level balance). Some early development stages test basic mechanics or player reactions to the general idea.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Conduct playtesting consistently</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, without trying to test everything at once. This can reduce the quality of received feedback. Try to choose one or two aspects to test per session. For example, test the usability of the controls in the first stage and the difficulty of the levels in the next stage.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Formulate specific questions: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Is it easy to understand the controls? Is the user interface clear? Which parts of the game felt boring or frustrating?</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Without proper preparation, feedback can end up vague (e.g., "the graphics could be better," "the controls feel awkward," or "the interface is confusing").</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Such feedback doesn’t address the core issues. For example, what specifically needs improvement in the graphics — is it the style, texture quality, or overall atmosphere?&nbsp; Similarly, what makes the controls feel awkward — is it the character’s sluggishness, the button layout, or delayed responsiveness?</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Establish clear success criteria.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> This makes playtesting as objective as possible and allows you to measure how effectively players interact with aspects of the game. Criteria will help focus on key data, eliminating subjective and scattered feedback, and saving time on analysis. For example: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>90%</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of players should be able to understand the controls within the first 3 minutes without any explanation (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ease of mastery), </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">players should be able to use all basic mechanics such as movement, jumping, and interaction within the first 5 minutes (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>usage).</span></span></p></div></li></ul></div><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Build a playable demo or early access version."><span>2. Build a playable demo or early access version.</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The goal of a demo is to offer a focused, polished experience that represents the core elements of the game, enticing players while also providing enough context for actionable feedback.&nbsp; When creating a demo, several important factors need the team’s careful consideration:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stability:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The demo version must run without critical bugs. This means that key mechanics (such as movement, object interaction, or combat) should function without errors that prevent players from completing the game or understanding its core concept.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Focus:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Concentrate on the aspects you want to test. For example, if you're testing the controls, include a simple level where players can learn and test the character's movements. Avoid overloading the demo with unnecessary content that distracts from the goal.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clarity:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Ensure that players understand how to play. This can be achieved through an introductory tutorial (e.g., hints showing the controls) and a clear objective (e.g., "Collect all items and complete the level"). This eliminates confusion and allows testers to focus on the game.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game demo should be short enough to maintain interest but long enough to showcase the key aspects of the game. The optimal duration is 15–30 minutes, depending on the genre and testing objectives. This time allows players to explore the core mechanics, and understand the overall style and atmosphere, but not get tired or lose interest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the demo is too short (e.g., 5–10 minutes), players might not have enough time to immerse themselves in the game or appreciate its potential. On the other hand, if it’s too long (e.g., 1–2 hours), players can become fatigued, especially if the tested content is repetitive or lacks a clear conclusion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The perfect balance would be a limited amount of content, showcasing the most important elements of the game, such as controls, core mechanics, and unique features. Plus, an ending with an engaging moment that leaves the player intrigued and eager for the full version.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Create channels for player feedback to conduct surveys and encourage playtesting at different stages of development."><span>3. Create channels for player feedback to conduct surveys and encourage playtesting at different stages of development.</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Choosing the right platform to test your game is crucial because it determines what kind of audience you will attract, what data you will collect, and how useful it will be for improving your project. Different platforms provide access to different types of players, from a creative community for early prototypes to a mass audience for testing final versions. The right platform will allow the team to focus on the right aspects of the game and get quality feedback, saving time and resources. It also dictates the format of interaction with players, be it face-to-face, analytics or gameplay observation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thus, the platform directly affects the success of testing and finalizing the game before its release. We can distinguish the main platforms depending on the stage of testing:</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Platforms for Early Testing (Prototypes and Concepts):"><span>Platforms for Early Testing (Prototypes and Concepts):</span></h4><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Itch.io</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Ideal for sharing demos with a creative community.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Jolt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Perfect for engaging with indie audiences and testing early concepts.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Reddit</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Find testers through communities like r/playmygame to gain direct and honest feedback.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Platforms for Large-Scale Testing (Later Stages):"><span>Platforms for Large-Scale Testing (Later Stages):</span></h4><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Steam Playtest</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Offers closed and open testing options for a broad audience.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GOG Games in Development</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Great for early access testing with a loyal player base.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BetaTesting</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Professional testing with customizable demographic targeting.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="For community engagement, these would be a great pick:">For community engagement, these would be a great pick:</h4><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Discord</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Facilitates real-time communication with testers and builds a dedicated community.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>YouTube and Twitch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Showcase your game through streams and video reviews to reach a wider audience</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Facebook</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Offers a platform for sharing updates, engaging with followers, and creating dedicated groups for discussions about the game, which can expand your community and gather diverse feedback.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>X (formerly Twitter)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Enables real-time updates, quick interactions, and hashtag campaigns to reach a broader audience, drive engagement, and collect immediate reactions from testers and potential players.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Attending</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> game conferences</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a good opportunity to test games in both early and late stages. These events allow studios to witness firsthand how attendees approach and interact with your game, which provides valuable insights into user behavior. Feedback can be obtained not only from players but also from peers and game development professionals at the conference. A myriad of perspectives can only make the final experience better. In addition, participating in such events allows you to feel like a player-tester, learning about other developers' games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This dual perspective helps empathize with new players testing the game and gain a deeper understanding of their issues and experiences – all in a very relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Conducting a test"><span>4. Conducting a test</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During testing, players launch a demo version of the game, often with prior instructions from developers on specific aspects to test (e.g., controls, level difficulty, or new mechanics).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>In synchronous testing, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">developers observe the process in real-time via streaming platforms like Discord or Zoom, or in person, noting players' actions, delays, errors, or reactions. Players report difficulties or shortcomings directly during gameplay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>In asynchronous testing,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> players test the game independently, recording their actions through screenshots or videos or through completing a questionnaire afterwards. Testing results are collected through surveys with closed and open-ended questions, gameplay recordings (videos or screenshots), automatic metrics (completion time, number of errors), and direct feedback. Surveys help structure the data, recordings allow observation of player actions, and metrics provide objective measurements. All this is analyzed to identify bugs, design issues, and player behavior, which helps in making improvements to the game.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="5. Identify the most useful feedback."><span>5. Identify the most useful feedback.</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Distinguish constructive feedback from noise. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Constructive feedback is often specific, actionable, and repeated by multiple participants. “I don't like this feature” isn't helpful, but ‘I think this feature is too complicated because...’ provides context and possible areas for improvement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Identify recurring themes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Monitor feedback to find common complaints or requests. Recurring issues are usually indicative of broader player concerns.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balance player feedback with the game vision</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Not all feedback will match the original vision. Avoid veering off course unless the reviews offer something useful to the core experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reality is that, no matter how thorough the preparation, it’s impossible to anticipate every situation. For instance, you need to account for the countless combinations of drivers and software. A game might run smoothly on one computer but lag or fail to start on another. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Highfleet</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we faced an issue where the mouse wouldn’t work for users with software installed to connect PlayStation gamepads. It was unexpected, to say the least, and there was no way of anticipating this issue. These problems are nearly impossible to identify until hundreds or thousands of players install the game and start playing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But, once all possible issues have been identified, it’s time to get down to work.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="6. Incorporate the selected feedback into the development:"><span>6. Incorporate the selected feedback into the development:</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Implement an agile update schedule</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Agile, iterative updates allow you to incorporate changes in smaller, manageable steps, showing players that their feedback leads to visible improvements.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Keep a flexible but structured roadmap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Use feedback to adjust, but keep a clear roadmap to avoid being overwhelmed by new ideas. A flexible approach with milestone adjustments helps keep the project on track.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even after you have received and processed feedback, it is important to</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> maintain a relationship with the community.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> It is important to inform players about improvements, incorporate their suggestions and build a loyal fanbase through transparent communication.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Regular updates and patch notes</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Publish updates summarizing major changes, bug fixes, and improvements. Patch notes should include specific community feedback so players can see the impact.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Work with player suggestions</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Even if a suggestion is not implemented, respond to players with reasons. This promotes understanding and respect by showing that all feedback is taken into account.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Playtesting is an essential step in the development process for indie game creators. It offers valuable insights and provides a realistic picture of the situation at hand before a launch. By setting up accessible feedback channels, identifying valuable input, and establishing open communication, developers can make decisions that are driven by real data, and improve their games to better fit expectations while keeping the core that makes the game unique.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Feeling valued as a player is one of the key notions that support the major fanbases that exist in the gaming world today. And, it is a two-way street: you take care of the player’s joy, and they will take care of the game’s success. Early supporters can become loyal fans in a heartbeat and will be the foundation that will keep the game living and thriving.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">No game is immune to unexpected challenges, but a solid playtesting process and a strong connection with your fans give you the best chance to create that one-in-a-million game we all strive for.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
