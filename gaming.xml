            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ballerina-team-not-setting-out-to-do-a-female-john-wick<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When From the World of John Wick: Ballerina hits theaters in June, it will mark the first film entry in the ever-expanding franchise not led by Keanu Reeves’s titular assassin. Instead Reeves passes the baton (or should we say Glock) to Ana de Armas and her character Eve Macarro, who the team insists is complex and nuanced in her own right and not just a female John Wick clone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">De Armas leads a cast of newcomers featuring Norman Reedus and Gabriel Byrne along with returning faces Reeves, Ian McShane, Anjelica Houston, and the late Lance Reddick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ccxp-2024-everything-announced"><u>a wild panel at CCXP</u></a> last week in São Paulo, Brazil, much of the cast along with director Len Wiseman sat down with IGN to talk about building on the franchise’s mythology, if de Armas could take Reeves in a fight, and how they made a John Wick movie without John Wick himself as the lead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> At the CCXP panel, the fans were really excited to see you all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ian McShane (Winston Scott): </strong> Delicious. It was delicious.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> With all that energy, what do you think is going to surprise and excite them about Ballerina?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ana de Armas (Even Macarro):</strong> It’s (a) new take on this world. It is changing perspectives and a new point of view in the world that we already know and love. But this time (it’s) through Eve's experience. We’ll see the connection and the timeline, how it intertwines with John Wick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Len Wiseman (Director):</strong> One of the things that was very important early on was that I was not setting out to do a female John Wick, that John Wick is John Wick. This is an entirely different character, kick-ass (in) her own right. (She’s) a new character within the world, not somebody that's replicating what John Wick does. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> John Wick shows up in some form in Ballerina… </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Norman Reedus (Daniel Pine):</strong> He shows up in human form. In human form. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was not setting out to do a female John Wick. This is a completely different character. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wiseman: </strong>Eve is looking to become an assassin. (She) starts up with the Ruska Roma, train(s), and becomes an assassin. John Wick is really essentially trying to get out of the world. So that became the building ground of what really set it apart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>McShane:</strong> It’s new but natural. I mean, don't forget, we've met the character before as a girl, but now we meet her as a grown-up. So my character has been keeping tabs on her throughout all these years. So when she appears, (he tries to) dissuade her from a mission in a certain sense as he always does John. Winston's ever, ever enigmatic. And also it's a natural thing. It's nice to turn around instead of looking at Keanu, I look at this gorgeous…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas</strong>: Keanu's gorgeous,</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>McShane:</strong> Oh, he's gorgeous too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas:</strong> Keanu is gorgeous too. We love him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Norman, was there something specific that made you want to join this franchise?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Reedus:</strong> Well, I'm a big fan already. I've worked with Len before. I am friends with Keanu. I'm a big fan of Ana's as well, and the whole franchise. I mean, it's a cool world to be a part of, so it was kind of a no-brainer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Ana, you're no stranger to fight scenes. Can you compare what you've done in Ballerina with what you did with Paloma In No Time To Die? Was there a change in how you approached the action scenes?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas:</strong> It’s a completely different character. I mean, I loved Paloma. I really wish I had more time in the movie and…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>McShane: </strong>No, it was perfect. Everybody wanted her to come back again and she never did. But now you come back as a fully fledged “Paloma Two!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas: </strong>(With) Eve, her motivation behind it all, it's pain. In this case also, I had the time to sink my teeth into the fights and really had time to get better at it. Not just three weeks training. I was training for four or five months. So it was really intense and the stakes (of) the fights and the level of detail and everything. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are very intricate, complicated fights with very imaginative stuff that I have around me to figure out how to defend myself in this male-dominated world. So it's less humor, but also (in) the John Wick universe (there’s) this kind of humor or irony in these scenes. And some things are so crazy that you have to laugh at it because it's bananas. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every time you check into a hotel, you're on an airplane, John Wick is playing.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>As the series has progressed, the mythology has gotten bigger and more complex. When you're making this movie, how do you balance that with the action scenes the John Wick films have become known for?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wiseman: </strong>One of the things that is very special about the franchise is the mythology and the worldbuilding. There’d be a lot of conversations (with Chad Stahelski, director of the four John Wick movies, and Keanu) about that. We’d say “what if we developed this section that's new to the world?” And so it is a balance. It's fun. I love worldbuilding. So it's challenging, but it's a lot of fun as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>McShane:</strong> The mythology behind it has always been steeped into some kind of movie reality. That's why people love them. Lights go down (for) two hours, you go somewhere else, then the lights go up and you should feel you've been somewhere (else), a little deeper each time. Fans get so obsessed by and now social media, they want to know an answer to everything that happens in a movie. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas: </strong>When we met John Wick, he's already who he is, and we didn't see him becoming that person. We didn't see him in the Ruska Roma. And how was that training and preparation? And we do see that through Eve. What does it mean to be protected by them or be an outsider? What are the consequences? If you break the rules, who can help you? Who can you trust? So for me, it was interesting to explore a little bit more of the origins of becoming an assassin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>McShane: </strong>I know (writers) Chad (Stahelski) and Michael (Finch) and Shay (Batten), each time kill off every character apart from Keanu. There are many versions until they decide how it should be going forward. The one thing I'll miss if we do another one is my dear friend Lance Reddick, of course. God bless you brother. But this will be a fitting testament to his character. And he was a great human being. He was a lovely man. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Norman, you've been involved in projects before that have had really hardcore dedicated fan bases. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Reedus: </strong>I think the first time I experienced a rabid fan base was Boondock Saints. That movie, for not coming to theaters, was the most rented Blockbuster DVD ever above Titanic. And we filmed that for like $7 million. It became that successful because of the fan base. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">(With) The Walking Dead, that fan base is crazy. Death Stranding even has a crazy fan base. Of course, (John Wick) has a crazy fan base. Every time you check into a hotel, you're on an airplane, John Wick is playing. I'm sure this will be the same. So bring on the crazy. It's great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>When you're preparing for a role like this in Ballerina, do you approach it differently than your involvement in something like Death Stranding?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Reedus:</strong> That's apples and oranges. (Ballerina) is very physical and very mathematically put together as far as action scenes go. There's a lot of people that help put those types of things together and make them safe and make them spectacular. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">(The) people on a Death Stranding game are behind a computer and the walls are blue and I have a skintight, Lycra body suit on with a camera and balls all over me. And Hideo is going "pick up that baby doll and cry." And I'm like, “why?” And he's like, “look, a whale goes over.” They're totally different. There's nothing to hold onto in a Death Stranding game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Keanu is God. He's the Baba Yaga.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Ana has trained so much for this, as Keanu did for all of his movies. Could you pick between Ana and Keanu if they faced off against each other? Who would win?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wiseman: </strong>John Wick. John Wick is the Baba Yaga. He has been Eve's character. She's on the rise. She starts to train, so we'll check it in a couple years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Reedus: </strong>There’s John Wick, then there's Keanu. If those crossed, maybe she would win because John would be "I can't. You can have it." You know what I mean?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Ana, with all of the training you've done, do you think you could take Keanu if it came to it in a fight?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>De Armas:</strong> No, he's God. Keanu is God. He's the Baba Yaga.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This piece was combined from two separate interviews and has been edited for clarity.  </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>There’s now a pair of Warhammer 40,000 games that have been given the PS5 Pro treatment, with the recent launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/darktide-ps5-review-warhammer-40k/">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide on PS5</a> having support built in at launch, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/space-marine-2-obelisk-update-adds-free-new-operations-map-ps5-pro-support/">a patch for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> adding new graphics profiles to make the most of the mid-gen console. They’re both great games if Warhammer, hordes and co-op are your jam, but one definitely has a leg up over the other than to the vagaries of PSSR upscaling on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Darktide, making its way to PS5 after a period of console exclusivity on Xbox Series X|S, and having recovered from a rocky initial launch on PC in 2022. The grimdark sequel/successor to the Vermintide series does a great job of capturing the Warhammer 40,000 universe’s grimy blend of gothic architecture, sci-fi and malevolent Chaos gods, sending you and your expendable buddies into the Hive world of Tertium to fight Chaos-addled hordes in Left 4 Dead-style co-op.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40K Darktide on PS5 – The problem with PS5 Pro PSSR" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2UXcuByAO4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One of the main cuts for the game on console was to cleave out the very costly ray tracing effects from the PC version, and that’s true across the board on PS5 – there’s no ray tracing on PS5 Pro, even – but it’s still a very striking looking game, thanks to the emphasis on its lighting and strong use of colours amidst the darkness to set the tone.</p>
<p>The game on base PS5 looks and feels very similar to the Xbox Series X version, with both fidelity and performance modes. I would suggest that the PS5 has a slight edge in performance, as I felt fewer frame rate hiccups, though all graphical modes have a fair bit of aliasing and there is also&nbsp;a fairly significant amount of detail pop in really quite close to the camera at times.</p>


<p>PS5 Pro comes with just a single mode and no performance options. The aim here is the mid-gen console’s publicised goal of having quality mode visuals and performance mode frame rates. It does a decent job of this, but the leaning on PSSR is Darktide’s undoing here, as the upscaling algorithm introduces more shimmering on edges even when stood still – in fairness this can also happen in the base PS5’s visual modes, though to a lesser degree. The bigger symptom is that there’s just a lot of noise introduced, almost like a film grain filter but at a deeper level, and which is completely unintentional.</p>
<div id="attachment_455587"><p id="caption-attachment-455587">Look to the rafters in the hub between missions, and all of the lit edges shimmer even when stationary.</p></div>
<p>We have to hope that this can be improved in future updates, whether Fat Shark need to do some backend work to better adapt to PSSR or Sony improves the PSSR algorithms.&nbsp;The quickest fix might be to simply let players choose between having PSSR and using the game’s native TAA. If we’re legitimately getting the quality mode resolution or close to it at performance mode’s 60fps, that would be more than good enough!</p>
<p>Space Marine 2 is a whole other kettle of fish, and still offers up both a 30fps quality mode and a 60fps performance mode on PS5 Pro – again assisted by PSSR… but in a good way.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Space Marine 2 PS5 Pro patch is basically perfect (even with PSSR)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOh7mWOtVbk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking strictly at the resolutions, and this PS5 Pro update solves one of the main weaknesses on base PS5, which was rather blurry and soft in its performance mode. Performance mode jumps from a 720p to 1080p base resolution range before FSR2 upscaling to a 1080p to 1440p range with PSSR upscaling.</p>
<p>And in this case, PSSR works absolutely perfectly. Space Marine 2’s implementation looks absolutely pristine with no hint of shimmer or noise – perhaps aided by the solid implementation of FSR 2 previously.</p>

<p>Performance is also improved by the slightly higher CPU clock speed on PS5 Pro, so that performance dips aren’t anywhere near as bad and should be able to stick better within the VRR range that PS5 consoles offer.</p>
<p>PS5 Pro performance mode isn’t a like-for-like in PS5 quality mode fidelity, though. Ground detail seems to be one notch below base PS5 quality mode, and the shadow map cascade and level of detail is also closer to base PS5’s performance mode. So there are tradeoffs being made.</p>

<p>But not for PS5 Pro’s quality mode. This has, per Saber, got a very wide resolution range, from a native 4K all the way down to 1080p, with PSSR there pick up any of the slack, and you can see the jump in shadow quality, better textures and more detail in general very clearly. It looks great, and I also like the very wide resolution target window. This “future proofs” the game so that future consoles with backward compatibility could very easily push the practical window up to 4K almost across the board, and the only thing that would make this better is having a frame rate limit toggle added as well.</p>
<p>All in all, Space Marine 2’s PS5 Pro patch is a success. The console’s improved CPU helps with the frame rate, the GPU powers both resolution and visual detail increases for both graphics options, and PSSR seems to work pretty well in this instance.</p>
<hr>
<p>PSSR is still quite the mystery right now, with some games clearly able to benefit from it very easily, and others plagued with visual issues from its use. It seems that some developers are too quick to jump onto the PSSR bandwagon as a drop-in replacement for TAA, FSR 2 and other anti-aliasing and upscaling techniques, without being able to give a full QA pass to ensure that it’s working at its best. Hopefully it can be improved by Sony to work more universally, but failing that, developers should be more wary in using it and include an optional toggle if they can’t guarantee good performance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/2024-was-a-slow-year-for-our-fastest-genre<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Around this time last year I criticised The Game Awards for continually <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-best-sports-racing-category-is-an-insult-to-both-genres"><u>forcing racing games to share a common category with sports games</u></a>, to compete for recognition at what’s described (by The Game Awards) as “gaming’s biggest night.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Up until this year it was an award no traditional sports game had ever actually won. The category had been totally dominated by racing games, with the exception of 2015 (Rocket League, which still has cars in it) and 2020 (Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2, which is still… on wheels). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year FC 25 got the gong. Just a single racing game made the shortlist: F1 24. A great racing game, no doubt, but one that’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-24-review"><u>hard to argue was an immediately essential upgrade</u></a> for those who already owned F1 23, or F1 22, or so on. What else could’ve made it? Monster Jam Showdown? Good fun (which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-jam-showdown-review"><u>shouldn’t be surprising</u></a> given the developer’s recent form with the Hot Wheels Unleashed series) but I wouldn’t fancy its chances at The Game Awards. Le Mans Ultimate? Well, that’s still ostensibly in Steam Early Access, even though they’re… already selling in-game DLC before the game’s officially “finished.” Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review"><u>No chance.</u></a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sad reality is there simply weren’t enough racing games released in 2024, full stop. For the first time I can remember in my nearly 14 years at IGN, we didn’t even hand out an award for the year’s best racer. There just weren’t enough of them to even pad out a list of finalists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sad stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, for clarity, I <em>have </em>had a number of fresh reasons to slide behind a steering wheel this year, but the bulk of these opportunities have arrived as updates to existing racing games I already own. Most months of 2024 have seen an injection of new cars and content for Gran Turismo 7. As is usually the case with GT, not <em>all </em>those cars have had a solid racing pedigree, but I won’t pretend I’m not at least mildly interested in seeing how fast an eight-year-old Toyota Hiace can lap the Nordschleife.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A 2024 expansion to EA Sports WRC added several new cars and two new countries: Latvia and Poland. The new countries feature some excellent stages, and it makes a lot more sense for Codemasters to improve WRC this way than immediately put it on a yearly, F1-style cadence (if only the asking price for the DLC wasn’t as uncomfortably close to the cost of an entirely new game anyway).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I won’t pretend I’m not at least mildly interested in seeing how fast an eight-year-old Toyota Hiace can lap the Nordschleife</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flip side, The Crew Motorfest literally became 50% larger for free, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-crew-motorfest-official-season-5-launch-trailer">all players getting access to the entire island of Maui</a>, added to Motorfest in November. Maui is not a bespoke area; it’s been seamlessly injected into the game’s existing world (and developer Ivory Tower has even added a fantasy connecting bridge, meaning you have a choice to either fly, boat, or drive to Maui from O’ahu without any loading screens. It admittedly hasn’t turned me into a Motorfest regular, but there <em>are </em>some satisfying stretches of road and some nice areas on Maui – which is obviously a lot quieter than the more densely-populated O’ahu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown has grown in a similar fashion with its Ibiza expansion (although don’t expect a bridge from Hong Kong to the Mediterranean). Solar Crown’s Ibiza map is a fairly small section of the island that may come as a nostalgic bonus for those players who recall blasting around the Spanish party paradise in 2011’s Test Drive Unlimited 2, but it’s hard to say whether it’ll turn around Solar Crown’s slow start. The map, after all, wasn’t Solar Crown’s main problem.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mount Panorama has finally found its way back into Forza Motorsport in its most-recent update, but I have to admit I’m extremely disappointed with all the fake sponsors used throughout the track. It just makes it appear totally inauthentic compared to Bathurst in Assetto Corsa Competizione, Gran Turismo 7, and even Forza Motorsport 7 – all of which feature real sponsors. It feels like a bizarre step backwards for the series, but hopefully it can be redressed. The update arrived along with a bunch of antipodean automobiles that have largely been seen in the series before, but nonetheless appeal to me as a dedicated Australian meathead. There’s only one new car, but it <em>is </em>a great one: a 1991 HSV Commodore VN Group A SV. If there’s one thing I like more than Australian cars, it’s the 1990s, so this fills both of those criteria. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/21/forza-vn-commodore-1734777778443.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Despite its faults, Forza Motorsport's garage philosophy is still more global than GT or NFS.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And speaking of the ’90s, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/need-for-speed-unbound-vol-9-official-reveal-trailer">Need for Speed Unbound just added a motorbike</a>, which is a surprising and impressive first for a series that’s literally celebrating <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/need-for-speed-turns-30-the-lasting-legacy-of-eas-fastest-franchise"><u>30 years since its 1994 debut this month.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, sure, there’s been plenty of tinkering still going on beneath the bonnets of most of the biggest racers in the business, but very little new blood in the genre in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s worrisome, particularly as younger generations continue to exhibit an increasing disinterest in cars in general, but I do think 2024 is probably just an aberration.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Greatest Racing Games Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I say this because 2025 is looking extremely exciting in the racing space. Assetto Corsa Evo promises to be one of the biggest racers of the year and, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/massive-open-world-map-confirmed-for-assetto-corsa-evo"><u>1,600-square kilometre open world map</u></a> in development for it, I do mean that literally. JDM: Japanese Drift Master from Polish studio Gaming Factory has shown promise for some time, and you can already check out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364930/JDM_Rise_of_the_Scorpion/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>free demo of this on Steam now.</u></a> Tokyo Xtreme Racer is set to return after a nearly 20-year absence. Project CARS spiritual successor Project Motor Racing is scheduled to arrive in 2025. It’s got the Lister Storm in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes please.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s just some of what we know about already. Will Wreckfest 2 arrive in 2025? The planned release date for that is yet to be confirmed, but that should be something special. Is 2025 the year we hear about the future of Forza Horizon? Next year will mark four years since Forza Horizon 5, after all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, I’ll see you at the starting line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

By then, Tom Cruise and <em>Top Gun</em> had long established the F-14 Tomcat and a pair of aviator shades as <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/08/11/top-gun-boosted-recruiting-and-brought-tailhook-scandal-so-what-happens-after-blockbuster-sequel.html">a fantasy for young men</a>; I personally preferred the Lockheed F-117A, the high-tech angular “Stealth Fighter” that could invisibly sneak past enemy radar, and was partial to the legendary Lockheed SR-71 that flew so fast it could outrun missiles.</p><p>At the time, I probably would have snapped up a jet-black Lockheed Game Boy without a second thought. But I’m old enough now to realize that cool aerodynamics are just the tip of a deadlier geopolitical iceberg. Lockheed makes <em>weapons</em>, and I don’t have a say in who gets to buy them or who they’re used against. I don’t have a say in whether that tech should exist at all.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Link (cable) to the past.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I’ve been thinking about Lockheed Martin as I review a much simpler gadget: the ModRetro Chromatic. The Chromatic is a high-end remake of Nintendo’s Game Boy, and it might be the best version of a Game Boy ever made. But it’s connected to a company much like Lockheed:&nbsp;Anduril, the defense contractor that makes weaponized drones, networked surveillance systems, and other military tech.</p><p>Both Anduril and ModRetro are founded by Palmer Luckey,&nbsp;the creator of the Oculus Rift VR headset.<strong> </strong>Luckey is now an <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/feature/american-vulcan-palmer-luckey-anduril">almost unbelievable character</a>, a devout anime and video game lover who reportedly stores his vast collection of games in a decommissioned US nuclear missile silo — one of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/la-influential/story/2024-06-30/palmer-luckey-anduril#:~:text=And%20then%20there%20are%20the%20nuclear%20missile%20silos.">several silos he says he owns</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Luckey, playing a Chromatic and surrounded by anime figurines, from </em><a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1797662883914154212"><em>his marketing video</em></a><em>. </em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: ModRetro</cite></p></div><p>He plays with a lavish collection of military hardware including helicopters and a Mark V Special Operations Craft used by Navy SEALs. He once <a href="https://time.com/3987059/in-the-latest-issue-41/">made the cover of <em>Time Magazine</em></a> as a floating barefoot “visionary” with an Oculus headset atop his head, though these days he’s more likely to make headlines <a href="https://gizmodo.com/im-a-propagandist-palmer-luckey-on-the-future-of-warfare-2000506276">propagandizing for</a> his version of the defense industry. He was the face of VR before Facebook kicked him out. (Luckey was an early <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15366500/palmer-luckey-trump-donations-chrono-trigger-oculus">Trump booster</a><strong> </strong>and took flak for funding a single Hillary Clinton-trolling billboard; Mark Zuckerberg denied he was fired for his political views at the time; some Meta execs have <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/metas-apologizes-oculus-founder-palmer-luckey-ousting/">since apologized</a> for his ouster.)&nbsp;</p><div><p>Many tech companies are involved with military projects in some shape or form. Google and Amazon have a contract with Israel for a “Project Nimbus” that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24311951/google-project-nimbus-internal-documents">Google knew could have enabled human rights violations against Palestinians</a>, and Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145680/google-workers-fired-project-nimbus-protest-nlrb-complaint">has fired many workers</a> for protesting that deal. Microsoft is currently working towards <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236116/microsoft-hololens-army-contract-workers-letter">outfitting over 100,000 soldiers</a> with a militarized version of its HoloLens headset. Meta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24287951/meta-ai-llama-war-us-government-national-security">is now letting defense contractors</a> use its Llama AI model. I think it’s fair to say few of us boycott these companies or even think about these things when we use their products.</p></div><p>But where each of these companies can plausibly say “It’s just business” as they defend their cloud server<strong> </strong>contracts or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24282719/tech-leaders-trump-jeff-bezos-zuckerberg-pichai">when their CEOs</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320643/sam-altman-is-donating-to-trumps-inauguration-too">kiss</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319768/meta-1-million-donation-trump-inauguration">the</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320063/amazon-is-donating-1-million-to-trumps-inauguration">ring</a>, and it’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-tried-to-block-amazon-from-my-life-it-was-impossible-1830565336">very hard to escape Big Tech’s orbit</a>, this is a fun but unnecessary product from a man with a specific point of view on weapons, war, and politics. Luckey has twice hosted fundraisers for Donald Trump (in 2020 and 2024) at his own house. He publicly expresses the fervent (and self-serving) belief that tech companies should get in bed with the military.</p><p>For Luckey, it’s not just business, it’s <em>personal</em>. And we’ve heard loud and clear that it’s personal for many of our readers, too. I’ve been testing the ModRetro Chromatic for over a month, and it’s <em>very</em> good. I believe it’s the best, most luxurious way to play Game Boy and Game Boy Color games. But if the goal is to restore and preserve our childhood nostalgia, the Luckey connection throws a wrench in the works. What you’re about to read is a real review of an excellent product, one I genuinely enjoyed using — but one that left me feeling somewhat tortured in the process.</p><p>For Luckey, the Game Boy itself is personal. It’s how he got his start. Before Anduril, before Facebook, before Oculus, Palmer Luckey was a teen who modded Nintendo Game Boys. “ModRetro” was the name of the very first thing he founded: an online forum for gaming hardware modders like himself.</p><p>So as you’d expect, his company has some strong ideas about what a modern Game Boy should look like.</p><p>Where <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">the $220 Analogue Pocket</a> seeks to update the Game Boy experience for the present day —&nbsp;with support for other handheld cartridges, ROMs, save states, a TV dock, and so on —&nbsp;the Chromatic stays squarely rooted in the handheld’s past. There are few modern amenities here. It’s designed to <em>feel</em> like a vintage Game Boy, only now with the rough edges sanded off.</p><p>Nintendo’s easy-to-scratch casings, screen lenses, and buttons? They’re made of metal, sapphire, and PBT plastic now. Those hard-to-see screens? You now get a custom IPS display at the same size, resolution, and pixel structure as the original Game Boy and Game Boy Color, one so bright you can play in direct sunlight like we did back in the day. It does come, however, with a brand-new copy of <em>Tetris </em>that optionally adds T-Spins, instant drops, and the ability to hold pieces for later, modernizing the classic game that famously came bundled with the original.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Direct sunlight on the Chromatic’s screen.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>At its heart, the Chromatic is an attempt to faithfully cross the original 1989 Game Boy with the 1998 Game Boy Color. There’s no SD card reader, no user-accessible operating system, no ability to add or play ROMs: when you slide the top-mounted power switch, it instantly boots your Game Boy or Game Boy Color cartridge using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip that emulates an actual Game Boy’s processors. Like with the Analogue Pocket, the upshot is more responsive, quirk-free gameplay than software emulators allow.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m a parent, and “I don’t have time for this shit” comes with the territory, so I immediately assumed I would miss “save states,” the feature that lets practically every video game emulator and retro handheld pause and resume your game at literally any moment.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->10</p><p><figcaption><em>Hardware comparison gallery: Chromatic next to the originals. (3D-printed stand designs </em><a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/joshnoodles/designs"><em>by Joshnoodles</em></a><em>.)</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Then I fired up <em>Pokémon Pinball </em>on an Analogue Pocket, and found I was wrong. I was on a pokémon-catching roll like never before. I caught Charmander, my daughter’s favorite pokémon, and for the first time in <em>Pinball</em>, I evolved it into a Charmeleon, then a Charizard, all without losing my ball. The stakes were high, so I reflexively tapped the Save State shortcut so I could retry if I failed.</p><p>Immediately, the pressure was off — but I felt a chunk of my excitement vanish along with it. I caught those Pokemon fair and square without loading the save, but I’d <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-cheated-not-only-the-game-but-yourself">cheated myself</a> of a pure victory, even if I didn’t wind up cheating the game. When I stuck that same game back into the Chromatic, a handheld without save states, the excitement came back. This is the way the game is meant to be played, and those stakes are there by design. That’s the experience ModRetro wants you to have,&nbsp;and the only one you’ll get. Ditching that modern amenity is a choice, and it isn’t for everyone.</p><p>It’s just one of many ways the Chromatic feels more authentic. Even though it’s a mash-up of two different Game Boy models, it instantly feels familiar in ways the Analogue doesn’t, from the sliding power switch and volume dial (the Analogue has you hold down closely spaced digital buttons and takes longer to start a game) to the button layout and feel.</p><p>The Chromatic is basically the size of a Game Boy Color, with the same bulging battery compartment curve providing a rounded perch for your fingers to rest. But it’s clearly been designed for those who appreciate the original 1989 model too. It’s got the original’s iconic slanted, cake-sprinkle Start and Select buttons, its glossy domed A and B buttons, its larger D-pad, its more protected cartridge slot, and the rounded lower-right corners of its flat-faced chassis and cover glass. All of them bring me back to the handheld that made me a gamer.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The D-pad and start/select have a very different texture, but they feel great.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p>I wonder if they bring Luckey back to his early days, too. Because while ModRetro appears to have made a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/106916/modretro-chromatic-better-than-the-game-boy-color-it-emulates">remarkably repairable handheld</a> and is currently <a href="https://modretro.com/pages/downloads">open-sourcing its CAD files and firmware</a>, this bespoke device is not exactly what ModRetro was originally created to make.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Luckey cut his teeth turning <em>existing</em> Game Boys and GameCubes into arguably better, more portable versions of themselves by reusing bits of old and new electronics. “It’s a lot of fun because it’s about taking old technology and then cutting out the old parts, replacing them with new parts and making it into something that was never possible before,” he told <a href="https://voicesofvr.com/5-palmer-luckey-on-modretros-influence-on-oculus-vr-the-oculus-subreddit-facebook-acquisition-reactions-the-future-of-vr/"><em>Voices of VR</em></a> in 2014. The ModRetro Chromatic is all custom, though, right down to its in-house screen.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Palmer Luckey, age 16, with modded GB Pocket.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Still, ModRetro’s original approach to development has been on display throughout Luckey’s professional history. Luckey’s key insight with the Oculus Rift was that low-cost smartphone components could finally make VR accessible, a belief <a href="https://www.markbolas.com/blank">he shared with researchers at the lab where he worked</a>, too. Repurposed commercial supply chains are also Anduril’s pitch to become the world’s most efficient weapons manufacturer, “so that the same processes used to build fiberglass bathtubs can just as easily be reconfigured to build missile airframes,” <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/feature/american-vulcan-palmer-luckey-anduril">as <em>Tablet Magazine</em> described it</a> in August.</p><p>With that approach, Anduril has rapidly built out an arsenal in just seven years, including multiple drones that can kill — one is a “loitering munition” that remotely dive-bombs a target, another effectively a recoverable ground-to-air missile.&nbsp;</p><p>When I look at the Chromatic and its prominent “MODRETRO” logo right above the screen, often I just see an excellent Game Boy. But sometimes I see the latest high-tech product from a man who makes high-tech missiles.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, you might be wondering: just how excellent is this hardware to justify all this soul-searching? Let’s start with build quality:</p><div><ul><li>It’s made of metal, not plastic, which can seem a little cold at first touch, but I can’t overstate how solid and premium this gadget feels. The build is incredible.</li><li>I even intentionally dropped a Chromatic twice onto concrete, from 4.5 feet, without destroying it. More on that in a sec.</li><li>The battery latch is a physical spring-loaded lever, which takes a little getting used to, but has such a satisfying snap.</li><li>Unlike every official Game Boy, there’s no front speaker grille. But unlike all my official Game Boys, the bottom-facing speaker is loud, crisp, and clear.</li><li>The Start/Select buttons are no longer pliable mushy rubber, but rather PBT plastic with the same firm clicky presses as A and B.</li><li>The volume dial is big and easy to find and use by feel alone.</li><li>The battery compartment is nearly the same thickness as the original Game Boy’s, giving it a beefier grip than any Game Boy since (though not quite enough for my friends with big hands).&nbsp;</li><li>The D-pad, a bit of a sore spot for some Analogue Pocket enthusiasts because it can sometimes allow accidental inputs, feels tight and responsive – almost too firm, mine wore in after many hours of play.</li><li>When I tested it against an Analogue Pocket at the same brightness, using rechargeable AAs, the Chromatic lasted three entire hours longer. (You can watch a sped-up timelapse in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/verge/reel/DCjvFOQJhcB/">my Today I’m Toying With video</a>.)</li><li>I simply plug the Chromatic into USB if I’m ever running low on charge — at under three watts of power draw, any old port will do! I powered it from my phone.&nbsp;</li><li>I could even <em>hotswap</em> AA batteries that way. Plug it in, swap AAs, unplug, all without losing my game.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><p>The Chromatic’s pixel-perfect screen isn’t strictly necessary: I generally had just as good a time on the Analogue Pocket’s bigger, higher resolution display if I enabled the right filters and color palettes, though I did appreciate that the Chromatic got the Game Boy Color feel just right out of the box. The Chromatic even <a href="https://modretro.com/pages/chromatic-manual?srsltid=AfmBOoo-klp0wAw3FLaFKGN3rJ4z_6LVT_nLIV0E2O6ZyBp8mHaj0l2F">lets you summon green-tinted original Game Boy palettes</a> by holding down buttons at boot.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->10</p><p><figcaption><em>Screen comparison gallery time! The Chromatic’s subpixels are visible in this macro image (though the yellows are a little yellower in real life). </em><a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25749229/eyedropper_pokemon_chromatic.jpg"><em>Tap this link for a larger image</em></a><em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>There are also some ways it’s not completely faithful to the original Game Boys, just FYI:</p><div><ul><li>There’s no longer a visible gap between the screen crystal and the LCD, and the screen is no longer a blank green or grey when powered off. It’s a laminated black mirror like modern phones.</li><li>While it’s largely the size of a Game Boy Color, it’s nearly as heavy as a fully loaded original Game Boy at 10 ounces (285g). Compare to 7.5oz / 212g for the Game Boy Color.</li><li>There’s an extra button beneath the volume dial that lets you change brightness, turn on <a href="https://modretro.com/pages/chromatic-manual?srsltid=AfmBOoqMa9GbAwzA5uy5EkUmXhkPK7IzLXtNmYnLKbfGD9dI5bn3CKaz#:~:text=Link%20Cable-,System%20Settings,-Hotkeys">frame blending and USB color correction</a> and… that’s about it for now.</li><li>You get a Game Boy Color-sized Link Cable connector, but with the extra notch of the Game Boy Advance’s connector for potentially more compatibility with other Game Boy gadgets.</li><li>You get two lanyard/charm holes, one on each side of the system, unlike the Color’s one on the left.</li><li>The battery compartment takes three AAs, not four or two.</li><li>There’s no longer a red power LED staring you in the face, but rather a multicolor LED on the bottom that only turns on for boot, low battery, and charging.</li><li>The Game Boy Color infrared port’s been slightly moved to accommodate the power switch.</li></ul></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The handheld comes with three AAs and a battery door that uses flexible fins to keep them from getting dislodged.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>And there were a few minor disappointments too. Mostly, I wish it worked a little better in quiet bedrooms and loud airplanes. The buttons and even the D-pad click louder than any of my old Game Boys, yet the 3.5mm headphone jack volume is the <em>quietest</em> of the pack. I could barely hear its chiptunes over the din of the plane, and I couldn’t compensate with my noise-canceling Bose QC25 since the Chromatic doesn’t have a four-pole headset jack.</p><p>ModRetro also advertises the Chromatic as “indestructible,” and if that sounds like marketing bluster, you’re at least half right. I dropped the Chromatic twice onto concrete, from 4.5 feet, and it came away with only minor dents, and I was impressed. But ModRetro also has <a href="https://modretro.com/products/chromatic-tetris-bundle?variant=47637522678062#:~:text=A%20handheld%20that%27s%20indestructible">a picture of the thing</a> getting run over by a car. When I ran it over with <em>my</em> car, the screen shattered. The frame is now badly bent.&nbsp;</p><p>I was also a tad disappointed to find the Chromatic’s USB-C port isn’t as potent as promised. While the company advertised USB-C video output and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170572/modretro-chromatic-game-boy-color-palmer-luckey-price-release-date#:~:text=he%20also%20told%20me%20you%20can%20even%20recharge%20your%20NiMH%20AA%20batteries%20over%20USB%2DC">even told me you could charge rechargeable AAs</a> using the do-it-all port, it turns out the Chromatic can only present itself as a webcam for desktop-style video recording, and NiMH AA charging didn’t make the cut. ModRetro CEO Torin Herndon, who was an engineer at Anduril from 2017 to 2021, tells me the company is beginning production on an optional rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack, but won’t talk price, capacity, or runtime just yet.</p><p>That said, I actually find I prefer AAs. At 50 percent brightness — far higher than I needed on the plane — I saw over eight hours from a set of Ikea-branded Panasonic Eneloop rechargeables, or closer to seven hours from Amazon Basics alkalines. That same brand of alkalines gave me over 12 hours at the second-lowest brightness setting, the dimmest I’d want to use in the daytime, and just under five hours at max brightness and max volume. And again, you can simply plug the Chromatic into a USB port if you’re ever running low on charge, then drop in new AAs without losing your game.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Yes, I’m really powering the entire handheld from my flip phone.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>There’s really no question in my mind that this handheld is the best retro Game Boy yet made, the one that best captures the physical feeling I had playing Game Boy as a kid. I <em>love</em> remasters because they can let you recapture that childhood joy, playing with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23173235/lego-galaxy-explorer-90th-anniversary-birthday-price-release-date#:~:text=With%20the%20Galaxy%20Explorer%2C%20says%20Psiaki%2C%20the%20goal%20was%20to%20trigger%20nostalgia%20by%20building%20the%20ship%20you%20think%20you%20remember">the Lego starship</a> or<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21207441/final-fantasy-7-remake-ff7-review-ps4"><em>Final Fantasy </em>game</a> you think you remember instead of the one that actually existed.</p><p>But I don’t remember my childhood nostalgia coming with a side of possible guilt and fear about putting money into the pocket of a weapons contractor. Feels weird!&nbsp;</p><p>Even practically, I wonder who, outside of a handful of 1989 handheld lovers like me, would want a handheld that <em>just</em> plays Game Boy and Game Boy Color carts. Many of the best games are expensive and hard to find in physical form — <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> and the best <em>Pokémon</em> titles can easily command $100 each — and it’d be a more compelling gadget if it could play the arguably better library of Game Boy Advance titles as well. The Analogue Pocket does.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The only way GBA carts fit in the Chromatic: sideways. ModRetro </em><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/09/modretro-is-certainly-going-to-create-an-fpga-game-boy-advance"><em>has said</em></a><em> it wants to tackle the GBA separately.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Luckey has said he wants to expand that original Game Boy library. Game developers never quite stopped making homebrew games for the Game Boy, and ModRetro is one of the few now publishing them on actual carts. Every Chromatic comes with a new copy of <em>Tetris</em>,<em> </em>and you can <a href="https://modretro.com/collections/games">already order 10 more titles</a>, including a new version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Tori"><em>Toki Tori</em></a> and <a href="https://joelj.itch.io/talesofmonsterland"><em>Tales of Monsterland</em></a>, sequels to <a href="https://horatiunyc.itch.io/traumatarium?ac=qfCyYFQF-yt"><em>Traumatarium</em></a> and <a href="https://pearacidic.itch.io/in-the-dark"><em>In the Dark</em></a>, and my personal favorite, the grindy JRPG <a href="https://spacebot-interactive.itch.io/dragonyhm"><em>Dragonyhm</em></a><em> </em>with some excellent tunes and pixel art.</p><p>This chiptune in particular, Dragonyhm’s “Gonrad Forest,” captivated me at once:</p><p>If you feel weird about ModRetro, you should know these games aren’t exclusive to the Chromatic, either — they played perfectly well plugged into an Analogue Pocket or a Game Boy Color, and some even worked on my 1989 original. Some may be available to <a href="https://patmorita.itch.io/hermano-game-boy">purchase as ROMs</a>. If you just want to try them, many have <a href="https://joelj.itch.io/tales-of-monsterland-dx">playable demos</a> you can try in an emulator, or even <a href="https://spacebot-interactive.itch.io/dragonyhm">a web browser</a>, like this:</p><p><small><em>On a desktop, tap to focus; press Enter to start; use Z, B, and arrow keys to play.</em></small></p><p>It’s not clear to me how serious Luckey is about funding a new era of Game Boy. For one thing, the Chromatic is already sold out at his website, and <a href="https://x.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1869538969022787704">he says</a> he isn’t making any more, but will focus on releasing new games while it builds <a href="https://x.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1869538970704679267">“something more sustainable”</a> in terms of hardware instead. (<a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fretro-consoles%2Fproducts%2Fmodretro-chromatic-gamestop-exclusive%2F20014956.html">A grey Chromatic</a> is still available at GameStop, for now.)</p><p>Second, as far as I can tell, all of ModRetro’s games beyond <em>Tetris</em> were already in development; some, like <em>Dragonyhm</em>, were already <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/dragonyhm/13/70gphb?srsltid=AfmBOoo7uRqQEcvAvT9aEixG9dEhAoeId2n4CjJZTm_MwDDbQgVXmfXr">headed to cartridge elsewhere</a>. Developing new games isn’t currently a company goal: “We are typically looking for games deep in development at this time, and try to push them across the finish line into being a full-on physical good,” Herndon tells me. He says ModRetro largely pays to create cartridges, boxes, and manuals, and gives developers a “pretty awesome” percentage of sales. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>The cartridges I tested — including 11 from ModRetro itself.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The pre-release carts that ModRetro sent me also had a couple issues that are hopefully getting ironed out: I mysteriously lost my entire save in <em>In The Dark 2</em>, and <em>Traumatarium Penitent</em> was missing a key bugfix the developer made almost a year ago. <em>Toki Tori</em> also booted into a full screen glitch the first few times I started it up, but it seems to be working now. </p><p>Even when people love the idea of revisiting the Game Boy and supporting retro game development, I suspect most will see a $200 handheld that makes you individually swap pricy cartridges as a luxury they can’t afford — not when every iPhone and a mountain of Chinese emulator handhelds can play the same games, ones they can (illicitly) download for free.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you find the Analogue Pocket isn’t vintage enough for your tastes, you could always do what I just did and add a modern backlit screen to your genuine Nintendo Game Boy. It won’t be pixel-perfect, but it might be good enough for me:</p><p>This is one of the more difficult reviews I’ve ever had to write, because I have no qualms recommending the ModRetro Chromatic on the strength of its hardware, which justifies its $200 price. It feels more like the Game Boy I remember than many of Nintendo’s actual handhelds when I pick them up today.</p><p>But like the Tesla Cybertruck, it’s also very much the product of one person in particular, a person who stands for <em>other</em> things that might clash with your ideals, and it could wind up being a symbol that you don’t terribly mind any of that, even if you actually do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Luckey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flEhMMJ4qoU">recently told</a> a Pepperdine University audience that it’s not a bad thing to celebrate the power of weapons, saying that “societies have always needed a warrior class that is enthused and excited about enacting violence on others in pursuit of good aims,” and that “you need people like me who are sick in that way and who don’t lose any sleep making tools of violence.” He explained that his company is named Anduril after Aragorn’s sword in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> partly because that sword was “inherently<em> </em>good,” and “wielded only by the kingdom of man against the hordes of Mordor.”<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><p>Real life contains no inherently good drones or inherently good missiles. And two major throughlines of Tolkien’s work are that war is hideous and that power inevitably corrupts. The joy I find playing with fake swords in the ModRetro Chromatic is now weirdly intertwined with a general fear: that Anduril’s real weapons might be misused. I won’t suggest that niche $200 Game Boys are actually <em>funding</em> those weapons in any meaningful way, but these still aren’t emotions I associate with my childhood Nintendo experience.&nbsp;</p><p>That means the Chromatic isn’t the ultimate Game Boy, even if it has the best build quality and the best screen. There’s still room for a better pair of rose-tinted glasses than the ones Luckey has paid to create.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Photography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>At first glance, Crow Country is a nostalgia piece. It pulls on the horrific sprawl of Resident Evil, populating its theme-park setting with brain twisters and monsters contorting into human shapes. It borrows from the toy aesthetic of Final Fantasy VII, its characters rendered in blocky, plastic proportions like Playmobil. Yet, it's more than just a throwback, it lays bear the haunted roots of nostalgia culture.</p><p dir="ltr">Protagonist Mara Forest visited the titular theme park as a child, but it was not a happy experience. There, a strange man bit her and she gained some terminal illness, which is slowly killing her. She has returned to make things right, find out what happened, and stop it from happening again. She returns to what was, only fleetingly, a site of childhood joy. She finds death, its shadows, its echoes, its remnants.</p><p dir="ltr">Crow Country's entire setting is a place of childhood play. The park is clearly designed for small children. It lacks thrilling high-rise roller coasters and is instead populated by graveyard ghoulies, thicket mazes, and fairy-tale stage shows. It's all playful and encouraging. Even the "Haunted Hilltop" section of the park is more trick-or-treat than Horror Nights. But without the bustle of life--the parents and children to animate it--the park gains an eerie quality. This is not an original observation, of course. Theme parks are a common setting throughout horror, but Crow Country begins at the park's gates and ends when Mara leaves them once again. The whole game is enveloped by this childhood environment. It is in the contrast between the toy aesthetic and its eeriness--between theme park and haunted house--that Crow Country builds its horror.</p><p dir="ltr">Crow Country departs from its influences in that it does not have fixed camera angles. Instead, each room is a miniature diorama. The angle mimics peering over a dollhouse, lifting off the roof to see inside. For a time, the world outside is distant; you only see this room, its little objects, and its traps and puzzles. This is, of course, true of most video games, where there are only so many places you can go, but Crow Country draws its lines decisively and artificially, much like its theme-park setting. Yet, the theme park is continuous--interlocked. Like any survival-horror game, it is a set of keys and locks, each contingent on the other, one door opening another. Crow Country's world is a microcosm, apparently siphoned off, but actually the wider world in miniature.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413137-crowcountry2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413137-crowcountry2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413137"></a><figcaption>Mara kneels in front of a collapsed young man in the opening moments of Crow Country. She says she's here to help.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413137-crowcountry2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Crow Country spoilers ahead.</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">Fittingly, the theme park itself is deceptively large, intercut with hallways and dug under with hidden depths. Mara wanders through backstage rooms and offices as much as playgrounds and rollercoasters. Eventually, she descends to the park's secret mining facilities, an underground environment made of metal scaffolds and endless abysses. Much like Resident Evil's manor, Crow Country has a secret industrial heart. However, much like the theme park itself, the mine is segmented. Each section holds a "root," a large tentacle-like object made of precious metals that the park's owner, Edward Crow, has been secretly mining. As the game progresses, the theme park becomes dirtier, overwhelmed with monsters, laced with traps and obstacles. The sun sets. The park turns as dark as the abyss below.</p><p dir="ltr">That structure, from the world above to the world below, and from day to night, mimics the game's plot, in which hidden things come to light. Edward discovered the roots touring the land with his father, wriggling in the dirt by their campsite. As an adult, he began to mine them, obscuring the operation with a cover story about a mine in Brazil. But then the creatures started coming through. Edward quickly discovered the creatures are, in fact, human beings. Edward Crow's mining of the portal has distorted what goes through it. The more the portal was mined, the more it stretches out, blob-ifies, and melts the people who pass through it. They cannot speak--only reach--and their touch contaminates. The portal is to the future: a prophetic warning of disaster and the planet rendered uninhabitable. But Edward keeps mining, obscuring this truth rather than spreading it widely.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet Edward has a curious reverence for the portal. He calls the creatures who come through it "guests," almost like they are visiting the theme park. One root he leaves intact, building a shrine for his childhood discovery. The rest he mines out, leaving them gaping like severed limbs. That might seem a curious contradiction, but it is mutually reinforcing. His own past is all that matters to Crow; the rest can rot.</p><p dir="ltr">Crow Country taps into a vein the rest of culture is also mining. The recent novel Birnam Wood concerns a billionaire secretly mining lithium underneath a New Zealand national park, an echo of Crow's extraction. Nobody would bat an eye at a reclusive millionaire having mining assets in Brazil, but a mountain of gold from a US backwater? That might be controversial. Both works call into question what violence is further unseen, when it's in countries outside of the global North.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413138-crowcountry3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413138" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413138-crowcountry3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413138"></a><figcaption>In a darkened hallway, Mara takes aim at one of Crow Country's creatures.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413138-crowcountry3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Crow Country has parallels to Alan Moore's "Illuminations" as well, which is a short story that concerns a middle-aged man traveling back to the pier of a childhood vacation, only to be horrified when he finds himself actually traveling back to the past. The story turns nostalgic longing into pure terror: the kind of thing only a fool would actually want. Returning to the past with the knowledge you have now means returning as you are now, not as a wiser past you--an adult in child's garb.</p><p dir="ltr">Crow Country builds out a span between secretive economic exploitation and a personal longing for the past. Edward Crow's mission is in exact contrast to those of "the guests." They transport themselves from the future to the past to try to save it. In contrast, Edward maintains an imagined past to destroy the future. The one section of the park that is inaccessible is an unbuilt sci-fi section a la Tomorrowland. The future is unknown, far off, and those with the actual power to predict who are suffering the future's atrocities cannot be heard. Notably, Crow Country was not always called such. It used to be called Condor Country, presumably by its native inhabitants. That past is totally lost, completely overwritten, only found in Crow's own admission that the land was not always his. Nostalgia is by nature selective, often violent in what it chooses to omit.</p><p dir="ltr">To be clear, Crow Country is not exactly a startling work of horror. It is cute, and at times cuddly and warm like a worn VHS tape. But its treatment of nostalgia gives it hues, depths, and darknesses. That is what is so scary about it. It is that refusal to be merely cute, its desire to remember but not to commemorate, that makes it such a textured and lovely work. Any game looking to the past to make a future has a lot to learn from it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

		<p>As wild as it is to have quirky pixel art and claymation going up against photo realistic graphics in our best Visual Design award, it’s just as broad a spectrum of styles and genres when looking at soundtracks. From jazzy chip tunes to sweeping orchestral scores, there’s such variety in video game soundtracks these days that it’s almost impossible to choose.</p>
<p>And yet here we are, picking the soundtracks that stuck with us most through the year, whether it was ramping up the atmosphere, putting a little smile on our faces as we played, or even getting us to sing along while hurtling through a loading screen – can you guess what game that refers to?</p>

<p>There are are a remarkable 101 different tunes in the soundtrack of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a>, each one reflecting the style and tone of level you are playing. From disco to ragtime to 80’s hair rock you will never get bored from the upbeat bops that propel you forward just as much as the actual on screen action – just imagine what the soundtrack to a Muppets game would be like and you would be close.</p>
<p>Just like the in-game cameos, the music features nods toward Sony’s franchises, the Bot of War track is superb with with a perfectly timed “BOY!” dropped in the music, and the jazzed up glitchy remix of the Uncharted theme will bring back many happy memories. If you’ve managed to finish the game you can stop by the massive PS5 in the Crash Site where the various components of the console will serenade you, singing “Cooling Fan” and “GPU” in time with the theme.</p>

<p>The music was honoured at this years The Game Awards with a full orchestral version of the game’s theme, I Am Astro Bot, check it out:</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth – Runner Up</h2>
<p>You’d be hard pressed to name a more iconic soundtrack than Final Fantasy VII.&nbsp;Nobuo Uematsu’s score has gone down in games history as the defining soundtrack of a generation. Over the years since, it has graced theatres and halls as part of Distant Worlds, and been alluded to in everything right up to Metaphor ReFantazio (which sounds eerily like Uematsu at times).</p>
<p>This incredible score not only defined a generation, but set the bar for what we expect from this franchise. With that in mind, it’s safe to say that composers Mitsuto Suzuki and Masashi Hamauzu had a lot riding on their work, when it came to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">FF7 Rebirth</a>. Not only did they have to remaster perfection, but they had to expand on it, filling in the blanks where the story branched out into new and untold areas.</p>
<p>One example of their brilliance is the boss fight against Jenova Emergent, which has all of the motifs you would expect from the score, while also being a fresh new track.&nbsp;And when you beat Jenova, you get the victory march — yes that one — again redone beautifully, and with lyrics this time.</p>
<p>But we can’t just focus on the big stuff that you’d expect — like the remastered Chocobo theme or Sephiroth’s One-Winged Angel. The rest of the game sounds incredible, from big brass band battles to synth pop, upbeat guitars.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, you only have to look to the main theme for something that beautifully sums up how exquisite this soundtrack is.</p>

<p>This wistful, melancholy but hopeful score underlines everything you’ll feel playing this game. And talking of playing, you can even take to the in-game pianos in every city and try your hand at playing it yourself.</p>

<h2>Helldivers 2 – Runner Up</h2>
<p>Sometimes all you really need is one booming leitmotif to lodge itself into the collective consciousness of gamers. For a couple months earlier this year, it felt like almost everyone was joining in with the “Dun-dun-dun-duuuuuuuuuuuuuun, Duuun-duuuuuun” of the drop sequence in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a>, the orchestral soundtrack perfectly capturing the bombastic patriotism and themes of the game as you hurtle towards overwhelming odds against bugs, bots, and now glowy-eyed alien zombies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/forever-skies-apocalyptic-adventure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

						
			<p>Jumping into <a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-full-release-delayed-to-2025-extending-early-access-period/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forever Skies</a>, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. From the title alone, I was expecting some sort of War game, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out it was a post-apocalyptic survival game that takes place on Earth. There were two significant periods in which I played the game. The first was during the initial Early Access period, and the second was after the<a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-co-op-launch-available-today-huge-overhaul-added-in-new-update/"> co-op update</a> was released. During these times, the changes made were incredibly obvious, and for the most part, they made the experience a lot smoother and more user-friendly. Games like this can often be quite overwhelming, as you're being introduced to a lot of new features, which usually include traveling through space or something of the sort.</p>
<p>However, I found that Forever Skies is a very peaceful game, regardless of difficulty. It eases you into the game as you need and tells you how and where to find everything. While some may find this a bit "hand-holdy," it's perfect for being introduced to all of the necessary features of the game.</p>
<p>Pressing play, I was a little bit disappointed with the intro cutscene. Both times I watched it, before and after the update, it was severely broken. The cutscene froze often, was very laggy and the subtitles were in no way synced up with the audio, which isn't helpful for those who do need subtitles. While I managed to get the gist of what was happening in the cutscene, it doesn't give a great first impression of what's to come in Forever Skies. I was immediately a bit on edge and wasn't sure what to expect, especially if the cutscene was in such a state.</p>
<p>What came after the cutscene made up for it significantly. The game was easy to dive into, and immediately, I found myself loving every second of it. Comparing it to games like No Man's Sky, Forever Skies isn't nearly as overwhelming. The only thing I would wish for with this game is that it gets Steam Deck support, as this is the perfect game to play on the go or while you're lounging.</p>
<p>The world that you are put into is desolate, and it's very obvious that there is a strong feeling of loneliness and danger. The atmosphere is quite heavy, and I loved that about the game. You could sense the feeling of desperation, especially when fighting to create food and water for survival without risking your health further. I loved the crafting system and the ability to take materials from floating objects through the sky, turning them into Synthetics and Metals for you to use in crafting. I was a little bit surprised at how small my airship was to begin with, especially when it came to putting the engine on the ship. It felt like there wasn't really enough space to do so, and it left me a little bit concerned about how using the ship would pan out.</p>
<p>Admittedly, once you get a bit further into the game, encountering the horrifying creatures that are now inhabiting Earth is absolutely terrifying and does rip you out of the safe and sound mindset that you've been carrying prior to that event.</p>
<p>From the outset, you're thrown into the deep end of exploration and scavenging for resources. Luckily, it's all explained to you, and it's very easy to get started on hoarding materials like your life depends on it (because it does). You then have to craft a research station and a crafting machine, which will allow you to get access to clean water and edible food. My only gripe with the process of doing this is that when crafting items, it's on a timer. For example, if I were to craft a membrane for the water purifier, that would take 30 seconds, while other items could take up to and over a minute to create. If this was in the late game, it wouldn't be as much of a problem. However, getting started, you essentially have to stand around and wait for it to be done, as there are no other quests for you to complete.</p>

<p>Because I played it before the update initially, it meant that by the time I got around to playing it again, my save wasn't compatible with the latest version of the game. While this is an issue that probably didn't affect many people, it was a bit frustrating to have to go through it all again. However, it was interesting to see the changes that the developers made to the game, especially in the intro scenes. It felt like the tutorial area was easy and quicker to get through compared to the previous version.</p>
<p>Overall, I had a great time with Forever Skies, and I can't wait to sink more time into this game. It is very well padded out and has a lot of love poured into it. This game is the perfect game to dive into after a long day and can prove to be quite relaxing. Admittedly, I have not played it in co-op, and I'm happy to continue to play this game solo, but the option is now there for those interested. The only real issue is the laggy cutscene at the beginning and the flying being terribly slow to start with. Of course, this is something that you can upgrade later on in the game, but it makes short distances feel like endless corridors.</p>
<p>Despite that, I love&nbsp;<span>Forever Skies's echo chamber feeling, as well as the loneliness and desolation that come with it. Even though it's post-apocalyptic, I found myself soothed by the gameplay. I hope that one day I get to see this game become&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Deck verified</a>, as it would be the perfect game to play on a</span> portable device.</p>

				<p>Forever Skies has a great, relaxing core gameplay loop. The atmospheres are vibrant, but still provide the feeling of desolation and complete loneliness. It's very easy to dive into, once you get past the laggy and broken cutscene at the beginning of the game. Overall, Forever Skies is a great experience, and significantly less overwhelming than other games in this genre. </p>

You don’t have to remove it to use your phone like a phone, because the whole gamepad retracts underneath<em>,</em> a little like the slide-out keyboard phones (or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452167/sony-xperia-play-2-playstation-phone-prototype-concept-leaked-images">PlayStation Phones</a>) of old — and now, it’s mounted on a spring-loaded arm that pops out at the push of a button and also slightly angles your device towards your face.</p><div><figcaption><em>The OhSnap Mcon’s hinge in action.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Video by Josh King / OhSnap</cite></p></div><p>OhSnap even found room for a pair of Nintendo Switch-esque analog sticks, with drift-resistant Hall effect sensors, and pair of fold-out grips so you can (theoretically) hold it more like a full-size gamepad. The sticks are clickable buttons, and it’s got a full set of shoulder buttons and triggers as well.</p><div><figcaption><em>An illustration with the grips unfolded.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: OhSnap</cite></p></div><p>Two months ago, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Retro Game Corps</a> came away <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3969hkkFSE">impressed with a prototype</a>, and it seems King has been <em>very</em> busy since then. As he explains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIgugX2gODE">on YouTube</a>, he initially tried to start his own company around the gamepad, even attracted a few investors, manufactured some boards and was working toward injection molding, before he started running out of money and reached out to OhSnap about a partnership.  </p><p>Speaking of money, we don’t have any idea how much it’ll cost, particularly at retail — OhSnap is planning to launch a Kickstarter on January 2nd to raise funds. <a href="https://ohsnap.com/pages/mcon-signup-page">It’s taking signups here for now</a>.</p><p>I should be getting my own hands on a prototype next month at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, and I’ll let you know how it feels. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
