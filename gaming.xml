<figure><a title="R-Type Delta: HD Boosted Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160706/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>In the great pantheon of shoot-'em-up games, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/tg16/r-type">R-Type</a> is both one of the greatest and one of the most excruciatingly difficult. Released in arcades in 1987 and drawing visual inspiration from the works of H.R. Giger, you pilot an R-9 fighter craft through spectacular alien worlds in a bid to destroy the Bydo Empire.</p>
<p>Although shoot 'em ups later evolved to favour more twitch-reflex gameplay, R-Type’s staple is its strict memorisation, requiring you to learn it by rote. As with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_gradius">Gradius</a>, not dying is an unspoken challenge: losing your power-ups makes recovery brutally tough, and the game's infamously aggressive checkpoints send you back a considerable distance each time you bite a bullet.</p>
<p>Impressed with the polygonal revision of Taito’s 1996 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/raystorm_x_raycrisis_hd_collection">Raystorm</a>, IREM endeavoured to make a similar transition for R-Type’s fourth entry. Being their first attempt at 3D, it was a project with a steep learning curve. And, while the result was glorious, it was also mystifyingly brief, remaining a PlayStation exclusive for 27 years.</p>
<figure><a title="R-Type Delta: HD Boosted Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160704/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_delta_hd_boosted">R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</a> - a remaster that upscales the visuals handsomely. Its PlayStation-era polygons have been buffed to an astonishing shine without losing any of their characteristic charm, and overall visibility is greatly improved.</p>
<p>Additionally, while the game was originally in a 4:3 aspect ratio, some trickery has been done to create the illusion of widescreen, using an “expanded” fade effect on the border edges that, when locked in, you quickly forget are there. Its upscaling is on par with M2’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/g-darius_hd">G-Darius</a> port, and, coming from City Connection — a developer praised for their taste in re-releases but less so for their effort thereafter — its quality comes as a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>R-Type Delta is one of the series' best, both smoother and cleaner than <strong>R-Type Final</strong>, and faster and freer than the three 2D entries that preceded it. Delta is to R-Type what G-Darius was to, well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/darius">Darius</a>: a remarkably slick, visually gorgeous game that maximises the possibilities of 3D architecture.</p>
<figure><a title="R-Type Delta: HD Boosted Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160705/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are now three craft available: the original R-9, playing in traditional fashion; the new R-X, with Force Ball homing properties; and the R-13, which is primarily hinged around its Force Ball’s sticky anchoring and laser tether. Impressively, each craft totally changes your approach, requiring its own roadmap to victory. Power-up modifiers vary greatly depending on the ship you’re using, making a maximum of nine shot-types when factoring in three per craft. Additionally, the doubling up of said power-ups expands the range even further.</p>
<p>Visually it’s beautiful and the audio is stellar. Set pieces abound as early as stage one: mecha-centipedes rip through burned-out industrial high-rises to encircle you in the foreground, and screen-dwarfing bosses pump out neon laser barrels and fiery exhaust flame. Dynamic and ploughed with invention, it cherry picks elements from its predecessors and paints them across a bolder seven-stage canvas.</p>
<p>Stage three is wonderfully creative, the entire episode just one hulking, stalking boss that requires travelling beneath its feet to strip its armoury, before climbing to its peak under a hail of missiles. The way the camera scales, shifting your flight path in various directions, heightens its cinematic nature. The fine visual and audio details are terrific, too, like the way the music switches to a muted, bassy throb the instant your ship dips below water.</p>

<p>Delta remains a hardcore memoriser, despite having more random elements than those before it. It also maintains checkpoints, although now getting powered back up post-death is much easier. Not dying, though, is still the star to shoot for, as maintaining a strong ship enables you to wipe out large enemies and bosses in a fraction of the time.</p>
<p>More than anything else, though, Delta is about ball control. And by that, I mean the Force Ball: R-Type’s idiosyncratic ship attachment. More than any other game in the series, Force Ball usage feels so much more integral, and its strategy varies greatly depending on the different ship types.</p>
<p>Typically the ball can be bolted to the front or back of the craft with a touch. When positioned there, it provides different shot boosts depending on the colour of the power-up you collect. It also shields against almost all incoming bullets and missiles. With a touch of the button, it can be shot out directly into enemies or objects, and set to travel adjacently, firing as it goes to cover more screen space.</p>
<figure><a title="R-Type Delta: HD Boosted Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160703/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sending the Force Ball out on repeat is how Delta ticks, with the landscape and enemy patterns calling for ever-evolving strategies. When it’s fired into a large enemy it can be absolutely devastating, its point-blank hit-rate making short work of any foe - but its greatest trick is in its new “Dose” function. Now, whenever the ball absorbs a bullet on your behalf, it fills a gauge that, when reaching 100%, will allow you to deploy an explosive super attack against everything on the screen.</p>
<p>Delta has been engineered painstakingly around this, cleverly placing swarms of popcorn enemies in-between junctures so you can quickly ‘dose up’ with a little risk-reward flying. Attached to the front of your craft, it can be used as a collision barrier, nosing through enemy waves and building the meter fast. Dedicated players will be able to eke out myriad possibilities for maximising the Dose attack's regular deployment.</p>
<p>Delta proves incredibly deep and impressively malleable for a series known for its strict rail structure. Elements that pose problems initially can be quickly outwitted through experimentation, and often felled in the blink of an eye. Learning not just where to camp, but how to utilise the Force Ball effectively increases your offence and defence in equal stride. And when all else fails, you still have your charge beam to cut through incoming obstacles.</p>
<figure><a title="R-Type Delta: HD Boosted Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160702/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Although you start with limited continues, these increase through play time, and once a stage is beaten it becomes available in practice. There are three difficulty levels to choose from, and perks in the form of graphics texture options, screen dimension adjustments, and time-unlockable bonuses that will keep you plugging away.</p>
<p>Delta HD Boosted's only real presentation shortcoming is that, inexplicably, you can’t skip the lengthy start-up sequence on each new game. With no quick restart from the pause menu either, you’re forced back to the title screen to repeatedly endure the whole opening preamble. It’s an easily addressable oversight that proves genuinely frustrating.</p>
<p>Delta is often cited as one of the most difficult R-Type games, but I beg to differ. Compared to the more static nature of its predecessors, all the new tricks and possibilities here actually make it easier in many ways. Getting powered back up after a death is far friendlier, the Dose super weapon is a crucial get-out-of-jail-free card, and being able to adjust the ship’s speed can save you in a pinch. That said, it’s still hard as nails, and 'Kid' difficulty, despite the disparaging name, comes highly recommended as a first port of call.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A true arcade game that never was, and confined to the PlayStation until now, shoot-'em-up fans will adore what’s in store. A seminal work that has never looked better, Delta, with its boundless creativity and exacting design, stands out not just amongst its peers, but as perhaps the best R-Type the series ever produced.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s still crazy tough, and no quick restarts or scene-skipping is painful, but this new HD revamp is by far the best way to play it. If you’re itching for a shoot-'em-up experience of note, this will make your year.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Another week, another NVIDIA GeForce NOW Thursday with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-Ultimate-is-everywhere/">a new batch of games added to NVIDIA's cloud gaming service</a>. This week, eight games are entering the service, while an additional title is added to the list of games playable with the RTX 5080-powered Blackwell servers. Also, those servers are just one region away from completing NVIDIA's campaign to make them available worldwide.</p>



<p>Regarding the games joining the service this week, the heavy-hitters are titles like the highly anticipated Persona-like indie game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-series-inspired-tactical-rpg-demonschool-launches-next-month-on-pc-and-consoles/">Demonschool</a>, the early access release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-the-crew-motorfest-xbox-game-pass-november-2025/">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/prologue-go-wayback-open-beta-pubg-productions/">Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>, the new survival game from PUBG Productions that's finally releasing in early access. It's a different kind of class of heavy-hitters <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-where-winds-meet-possessors-nvidia-geforce-now/">compared to last week's batch of games,</a> but they're heavy hitters nonetheless.</p>



<p>As far as the game that's now RTX 5080-ready, it's Ubisoft Massive's Star Wars Outlaws. A game that definitely didn't get off to a great start with players, but has since been updated for a much smoother experience that doesn't involve a bunch of frustrating insta-fail stealth missions. At least it was always a good looking game, and now that you can play it through NVIDIA's RTX 5080 Blackwell servers, it can look even better.</p>



<p>Speaking of those Blackwell servers, last week it was Phoenix getting added to the list of regions where RTX 5080 servers were available. The only remaining region on NVIDIA's list now is Stockholm, which isn't ready to go live this week, but will be ready soon. As a reminder, the Blackwell servers are only available to players subscribed to GeForce NOW at the Ultimate tier.</p>



<p>"<em>With GeForce NOW Ultimate, top-tier streaming truly goes everywhere</em>," head of partnerships and licensing at 2K, Sean Haran, added with regard to GeForce NOW in a press release. "<em>Anyone can experience the glory of Borderlands 4, with breathtaking graphics and flawless gameplay powered by GeForce RTX 5080 servers, even without the latest devices. Jump into the cloud and play at high settings, whether you're at home or on the move.</em>"</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining the GeForce NOW library this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Spongebob Squarepants: Titans of the Tide</li>



<li>Long Drive North</li>



<li>Demonschool</li>



<li>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</li>



<li>Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road</li>



<li>Prologue: Go Wayback!</li>



<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>



<li>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy</li>



<li>Sacred 2 Remaster</li>



<li>Star Wars Outlaws (RTX 5080-ready)</li>
</ul>

            <p>Open world Czech Bohemia-inspired orienteering game Prologue: Go Wayback! from PlayerUnknown Productions and PUBG creator Brendan Greene is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/">out now in Steam Early Access</a> - and that's very inconvenient, because we <em>still</em> don't have consensus on a nickname. Back in 2017, RPS jocularly renamed PUBG "Plunkbat" - a show of feistiness that surely resulted in no angry emails (genuinely, I don't know if it did), and which I recently consecrated by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bounty-of-gaming-news-discovered-in-isolated-scottish-cabin">writing it on the wall</a> of a random shed in Scotland. We are still massaging our temples about the new game, however. 
</p>
<p>Obviously we can't just call it Prologue: Go Wayback! That exclamation mark is some drive-by Yu-Gi-Oh bullshit, and besides, the title's arguably a tautology and I would like to be able to mention this game to my partner without sounding like I think she doesn't know what "prologue" means. So here's our working list of alternatives, mixing in a few other informal RPS titling conventions. Please pick favourites or suggest your own in the comments.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Proback</li>
<li>Prologoback</li>
<li>Prayback</li>
<li>Progo</li>
<li>Ploway</li>
<li>Proooack</li>
<li>Puwack</li>
<li>ack!</li>
<li>Pooo!</li>
<li>Prolo!</li>
<li>Plab!</li>
<li>: !</li>
<li>Prologue Colon Go Wayback!</li>
<li>Pro Colon!</li>
<li>Colon!</li>
<li>Colon Go!</li>
<li>Colon Go Way!</li>
<li>GoW</li>
<li>Anti-Social Peak</li>
<li>A Good Walk Rewardingly Ruined</li>
<li>Gunshy Plunkbat</li>
<li>Revengeless Liam Neeson Simulator</li>
<li>Czech Stranding</li>
<li>Not Generated From Anything Stolen</li>
</ul>
<p>The last part is a reference to the game's map generation tools. As disclosed on Steam, the game makes use of proprietary machine learning software to create wilderness maps. Here's that disclosure in full. 
</p>
<blockquote>We are developing our own in-house machine-learning model which is trained on publicly available open-source data and vetted to prevent the use of any copyrighted material. This ML model is used to generate base terrain maps in Unreal Engine 5 which are then populated procedurally with custom assets such as the trees, rivers, rocks, and hills you explore. Our artists and designers use our ML model to allow us to generate 64km2 maps that look and feel natural and realistic. The game generates a new map offline on your system every time you play. 
</blockquote>
<p>It's one of the more informative such disclosures, responding to the broad concern about genAI using other people's art and media for their datasets without the creator's consent. It muddies the waters a bit, however: "machine learning" and "generative AI" aren't the same thing, as Embark recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now">explained to us</a> in an interview about robot animations in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>. 
</p><p>The disclosure also doesn't address worries about the emissions cost of 'training' generators by having them repeatedly go over datasets to extrapolate patterns - yes, it'll run offline on your PC, which suggests a lower energy footprint for the user, but it's not clear how much power was consumed during development. There's also the question of whether the map generation here contributes to overall normalisation of efforts <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">to automate jobs and shrink team sizes</a>, even if the game's handling of such <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">technological terrors</a> strikes you as above reproach.
</p><p>
Such caveat! Much proviso! More context than I can easily get into here! And it's only going to get more complicated. As the developers recap on Steam, this is "the first of three games that lay the foundation for our studio's ultimate vision: Project Artemis", which is "a platform for massive, living multiplayer sandboxes where millions of players can shape their own worlds and emergent stories."
</p><p>Somewhere inside all of these metaversals convolutions and investor-facing language there is a promising wilderness walking sim. I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playerunknowns-prologue-go-wayback-is-an-enchanting-exploration-sim-tossed-on-a-sea-of-metaverse-imagineering">interviewed Greene</a> and played the game earlier in the year (amongst other things, he told me there are in-game lore reasons for the title). I swam across a river in the dark and it did feel slightly magical.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-marshall-acton-iii-bluetooth-speaker-drops-40-off-amazon-clears-them-out-on-black-fridays-opening-day-2000645713</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-marshall-acton-iii-bluetooth-speaker-drops-40-off-amazon-clears-them-out-on-black-friday%E2%80%99s-opening-day.1359196/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Bluetooth speaker market overflows with generic black boxes that all sound roughly the same, but <strong>Marshall brings legitimate audio heritage and iconic design</strong> to an over-crowded category. The <em>Acton III</em> just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/">dropped to a record low of $179 for Black Friday’s opening day on Amazon, down from its usual $299 price</a>. Marshall built its reputation on guitar amplifiers that shaped rock and roll for decades, and that audio expertise translates directly into home speakers that sound like music instead of compressed digital mush.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Small Speakers Sound Big</h2>
<p>The Acton III delivers a <strong>wider stereo soundstage compared to the previous generations</strong>, hence giving the impression of sound surpassing the physical speaker cabinet. To achieve better stereo separation in such a compact form factor, Marshall redesigned the internal driver arrangement and acoustic tuning. The signature Marshall sound <strong>emphasizes midrange clarity and controlled bass</strong> which makes vocals and instruments sound present rather than distant. You get to hear details in recordings that cheaper speakers bury under the boomy bass or shrill treble.</p>



<p>Marshall engineered the Acton III to be immediately usable without complicated setup procedures or compulsory app installations. You power on the speaker, toggle on Bluetooth on your phone, select Marshall Acton III from available devices and <strong>start playing music within 30 seconds</strong>. This straightforward approach saves you from frustration over pairing modes, connection failures, or multi-step configuration processes. This speaker remembers your previously paired device and picks up the signal automatically when it comes in range.</p>
<p>Next-generation <strong>Bluetooth 5.2 provides more stable connections with lower latency</strong> than older Bluetooth versions. The improved protocol keeps connections strong even when you walk into other rooms with your phone and reduces audio lag during video playback. Marshall future-proofed the speaker by building in support for Bluetooth features that haven’t been finalized yet, so firmware updates can enable new capabilities as the Bluetooth standard evolves.</p>



<p>The<strong> 3.5mm auxiliary input will accept wired connections</strong> from devices that don’t have Bluetooth or for situations where you want to avoid wireless compression. You can plug in older MP3 players, laptops without Bluetooth, or use the aux input for guaranteed zero-latency audio during gaming or video editing. For purists who prefer wired, analog input bypasses digital processing.</p>
<p>The <strong>top analog control knobs adjust the volume, bass, and treble</strong> with very satisfying tactile feedback-beating tapping on glass touchscreens any day. Boosting the bass for hip-hop or dialing it back down for acoustic is straightforward; you can easily dial in your preferred sound signature. The treble control brightens up vocals and cymbals or tames overly harsh recordings.</p>
<p>At $179, this Black Friday price makes the Marshall Acton III cheaper than many generic Bluetooth speakers that don’t feature the audio engineering, build quality, and design heritage that Marshall has.

              <p data-start="90" data-end="688">Searching for a holiday gift that fits the lifestyle of the fitness lover in your life? Whether your partner prefers long runs, scaling indoor climbing walls, or sticking to a steady gym routine, the right present can show how much you pay attention to what they care about. Right now, thanks to an early Black Friday promotion, you can snag the Google Pixel Watch 4 at a solid discount. The 41mm model usually sits at about $450, but Amazon has it marked down to $350 for a short window. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/">That works out to a 22% price cut, putting an extra $100 back in your pocket.</a></p>
<p data-start="690" data-end="924">The Pixel Watch 4 has a clean, polished look while maintaining the practicality people expect from an everyday wearable. You can pick between two display sizes, 41mm or a slightly larger 45mm, depending on preference or wrist size.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="926" data-end="1470">The Google smartwatch can act as a personal fitness coach. It can suggest running workouts tailored to your goals, your training history, and how prepared your body is on a given day. Those personalized plans can help runners watch their progress unfold mile after mile, as longer routes and quicker splits start to feel more manageable. You can even design your own workouts, complete with warmups, cooldowns, and pace targets. Saved runs can be revisited anytime so you can track improvements and chase new personal bests.</p>
<p data-start="1472" data-end="1708">Beyond workouts, the watch provides a wide range of useful health metrics, including daily readiness scores, cardio load stats, and the FitBit Morning Brief, which gives you a quick snapshot of your recovery and helps you shape the day ahead.</p>
<p data-start="1710" data-end="1995">With the Pixel Watch 4, you can use offline Google Maps, pay on the go with Google Wallet, and connect it with other Pixel products or smart home gear such as a Google Nest hub with ease.</p>


<h2>Upgrades With the Pixel Watch 4</h2>
<p>The main upgrades we’re seeing on this newest model over the Google Pixel Watch 3 are subtle. First, while it’s hard to tell in the pictures along, the watch now features a curved display. While the Pixel Watch 3 had curved glass as well, the actual screen underneath the Watch 4 is also curved, standing out visually.</p>
<p>You can also expect better battery life with this new model getting you up to 30 hours as a standard when using the always-on display or up to 48 hours when in Batter Saver mode.</p>
<p>And to no one’s surprise, Google is now touting AI features on the Pixel Watch 4 with direct access to Gemini.</p>

Now, Prologue: Go Wayback! is officially entering early access today and giving players a chance to brave the elements from the comfort of their own homes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLdm77g5F2M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YLdm77g5F2M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Prologue unfolds from a first-person perspective and drops players into a landscape that changes in every playthrough thanks to procedurally-generated maps. Even the weather can dramatically change, which forces you to make choices about how you're going to survive. Thirst, hunger, and body temperature all need to be maintained long enough for you to reach a weather tower. There are always multiple approaches for that goal, and plenty of ways to die if you make the wrong move.</p><p>As part of the launch, PlayerUnknown Productions is introducing a handful of features. Players will be able to customize the weather, the temperature, and the time of day at the beginning of each playthrough, which can make the experience easier or harder.</p><p>The standard mode is called Go Wayback!, but there's an even more difficult option called Objective: Survive. In the latter, you'll have limited resources to fall back on. Users who just want to explore can try the Free Roam mode, which lets up on the survival aspect of the game. But you can still manage to die if you fall from a great height.</p><p>One of the most intriguing new features is the map editor, which will let you import an image into the in-game map and use it to create a customized world. Alternatively, you can design your own maps.</p><p>Future early-access updates are planned that will introduce more dynamic weather patterns, the ability to craft objects with the available materials, climbing gear, and items of clothing that can degrade or tear if players don't repair them.</p><p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is now available for $20 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prologue-go-wayback-prologue-go-wayback-open-beta-0261c6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://rocketwerkz.com/">Rocketwerkz</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> CEO Dean Hall and Floating Point Origin Interactive founder Felipe Falanghe sound downright giddy when they talk about the new C# framework named "Brutal." During a recent call with Game Developer, the brains behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>DayZ</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kerbal Space Program</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> couldn't stop making random asides to each other about what they've pulled off with the tool and how they've inspired each other's work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Their joy was infectious because once you understand how Brutal functions, you realize every new feature is a bona fide accomplishment even for this pair of seasoned developers. "It's called Brutal for a reason," Hall said after Felipe compared working with it to the experience of sitting on a bar stool while all your friends using engines like Godot are sitting on a comfy couch.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brutal is, to quote a Rocketwerkz spokesperson, a tool that "uses the latest .NET features while providing low-level API access to high-performance C++ libraries and tools, including a Vulkan graphics API." That's it. That's all you get.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rocketwerkz created the framework to develop </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a spiritual successor to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kerbal Space Program</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The company invited Falanghe onto a steering committee consulting on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which has led to him consulting him on the engine. Brutal will be made open source through a commercial entity called "Ahwoo."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-unveils-new-toolkit-to-accelerate-multi-platform-launches" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity unveils new toolkit to accelerate multi-platform launches</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers who remember the days of XNA and home-brewed engines may shudder at the prospect. Visual scripting tools like Unity and Unreal Engine were supposed to speed up development and let designers think more about their game and less about blocks of code. Why would we go back to a world where everyone's building their own game engines?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hall understands that nervousness. But in our conversation he made a rather bold prediction: frameworks like Brutal, not game engines, will be the future of the game development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Brutal forces developers to build workflows from the ground up">Brutal forces developers to build workflows from the ground up</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To follow Hall's thinking, you need to think about Brutal in terms of developer workflows, not what it can or can't do compared to third-party game engines.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rocketwerkz created Brutal to drive development of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but that's because they determined scene-based rendering wasn't sufficient for the task. "If you take Unity or Unreal, you have this editor scene and push play, it becomes a game scene and everything in it is relative to 0-0-0 of that scene," said Hall. "That's how you draw things, and it's so ingrained that people have a hard time imagining something that's different."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/obituary-interplay-co-founder-rebecca-ann-heineman-has-passed-away-at-62" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Interplay co-founder Rebecca Heineman has passed away at 62</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, everything's contextual. So an object is drawn relative to something else. The camera is actually always at it's 0-0, it never moves, and everything is drawn into it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Spaceflight simulators depict long distances, a concept in rendering sometimes called "floating origin." Falanghe said he was rethinking his approach to this in his new project and came up with a similar solution to Rocketwerkz, calling it "first-order floating origin," where the system resolves the positions of objects to be relative to the camera as late as possible before rendering. "You still get the basically the same functionality, but you get to use high precision numbers as far as you can into the game execution," he explained.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In our case, we resolve them on the GPU. We send a pair of of numbers that act like a double precision value to the shaders, and the shaders then figure out the camera relative coordinates." To do anything similar in Unity (the tool Falanghe used to make </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kerbal Space Program</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">), you have to "brute force" the existing system by telling it to shift every object in the game world by the same amount.</span></p><p>Image via Rocketwerkz</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For developers wondering about optimization performance in Brutal—Rocketwerkz explained that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> C# code runs on the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and is JIT-compiled when the game runs instead of being compiled native ahead of time. This was done in part to make the game "easier to mod," since the managed code is "more accessible" to players.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/spooky-mmorpg-networking-stories-from-guild-wars-and-guild-wars-2-gdc-podcast-ep-56" target="_self" data-discover="true">Spooky MMORPG networking stories from Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 - GDC Podcast Ep. 56</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pay attention to the process though. The thinking wasn't "Unity can't do this, I need a tool that can do this." It was "our game needs floating origin to work this way, how do we do it?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a mindset that comes naturally to Falanghe, Hall said. "One of [Falanghe]'s superpowers that I don't think he quite realizes he has is he's always thinking about how he wants to do something, especially if it's not something that he's super familiar with."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a second call, Hall showed us other </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> systems built through Brutal. Some, including one that used volumetric lighting to create engine glow went a bit over my head, but Hall's system for mathematical-based user interface features was easy to understand.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> lets players simulate space flight with a number of semi-realistic UI elements that can be expanded or shrunk and even moved to other monitors. Video game UI is usually texture-based, but Hall wanted these to be math-based to allow for that scaling and repositioning. He also feels these look crisper and less "washed-out."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These are among a number of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> systems that are technically possible in other game engines, but by building them from the ground up, developers can answer the question "what am I trying to do?" before they ask "how am I trying to do it?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hall and Falanghe said this was made possible by a very coincidental series of events that happened alongside the making of Brutal: the advancement and popularization of large language models in generative AI.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Brutal workflows are the opposite of vibe-coding">Brutal workflows are the opposite of vibe-coding</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's hard for me to talk about it without sounding like a cult member," Hall said sheepishly, when describing how he uses ChatGPT while working in Brutal. But he and Falanghe agreed—using LLMs has made language-based coding an easier task.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>that</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> much easier, to be clear. They both said that when querying an LLM, they rarely copy and paste whatever code it generates. Instead they ask questions about C# libraries or Vulkan documentation, and the software is able to return high-quality answers. Answers that normally require programmers to sit down for hours to pore over documentation or scour ancient forums to find that one post with the solution (which was &nbsp;probably written in 2014).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"An LLM is essentially tokenizing language, then putting masses of vectors around that to build linkages between those tokens," said Hall. "What could be better than a highly-structured, in fact </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>brutally</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> structured language?" Vulkan and the latest version of C# are very "highly structured, with very clear syntax."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers critical of ChatGPT maker OpenAI should be able to replicate this process on open source models like DeepSeek, Falanghe said (though he hasn't tried this himself).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This process doesn't work as well with Unity and Unreal because they're both "highly spatial" as a result of their visual scripting tools. A solution for one game's problem may not work with another because of the different scripted elements. LLMs scouring the web can't produce consistent answers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is also the opposite of vibe coding, a method where programmers tell an LLM what they want a system to do and it generates code—and it isn't code completion, where AI tools "predict" what someone is typing and finish the string for them to speed up their workflow. The only thing the LLM does for Brutal developers is speed up access to information, letting them research without watching a 40 minute YouTube video.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Falanghe said he even tried "vibe coding" at one point with ChatGPT but found it inadequate. He compared the experience to being "a project manager who's not a coder" and badly communicating with a programmer about how to make an application. They'll give you something that's almost correct, but not quite what you wanted, and you'll just go back and forth iterating and making it worse and worse.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You don't need to pay somebody to have that experience, you can just do it with an AI and be frustrated," he quipped.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How can frameworks change game development?">How can frameworks change game development?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can boil down Hall's theory about what he calls "the death of big engines" to this: if LLMs make language-based coding more accessible, than visual-based scripting loses its edge. Developers who embrace the Brutal method become responsible for understanding every piece of tech powering their game.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a difficult task, but one that doesn't require them to understand the parts of their tools that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>don't</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> go into their game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And despite the difficulty of using the framework, Hall said Rocketwerkz has had an easier time recruiting programmers using this tool than they did using Unreal. High-level Unreal programming requires highly specialized knowledge tuned not just for the engine, but the kinds of games being made. A programmer already familiar with C# can pick up the Brutal workflow if they're willing to embrace its... well, brutality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hall brushed off the notion that Brutal would be the sole framework driving an end-to-game engines. He even grew a tad prickly at the notion that some companies might establish themselves as Brutal experts who can build tools for other developers on top of the framework, akin to developers making plugins for Unity and Unreal. &nbsp;"Brutal was made to deliver a very specific, kind of hard-to-make game where you need to sit down and ask a whole bunch of questions [about how it works]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I don't like the idea that Brutal would then become this one-size-fits-all pocket knife because I don't think that's true. In my heart of hearts, I think someone else might create something else that follows a similar approach, but simpler."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hall's vision of the future game industry is almost the polar opposite of the one pitched by UGC platforms and AI boosters. Instead of a world where game development becomes easier through simplified tools, it becomes more accessible through easier understanding of language-based programming through LLMs.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Skeptics could brush this off by saying language-based coding could never move as fast as engine-based game development.

<p>What did I just watch..?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has seemingly become the go-to place for crossovers, with everyone from Solid Snake to Mariah Carey making an appearance in the online game.</p>
<p>Its latest trailer teases the Chapter 6 Finale Event, and it's an unsettling realisation of its crossover ambitions, showcasing Godzilla, King Kong, Homer Simpson, and Kill Bill's 'The Bride'. Oh, and some Star Wars X-Wings, too. We can't help but feel a keen sense of bemusement watching the action unfold – yes, crossovers in Fortnite is hardly a new concept, but it's just all so <em>weird</em>, y'know..?</p>

<p>Kill Bill is especially jarring. Of course, the upcoming release of <strong>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</strong> – which combines both movies into one seamless experience – makes it obvious why The Bride has cropped up in Fortnite, with the game playing host to a 'The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge', but even so... Knowing the context of why the character embarks upon her revenge mission in the movies makes it all the more weirder seeing her fight alongside Homer flippin' Simpson.</p>
<p>It's not a movie for kids, y'know?</p>
<p>We're looking into this too much, we get that, but where does it end..? Are we going to see Art the Clown prancing alongside Ms. Rachel? Y'know what, don't get any ideas, Epic.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches today on Sony's PlayStation 5 console, exactly one year after its initial release on PC and Xbox Series S|X, following the end of the timed console exclusivity deal with Microsoft.</p>



<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-anniversary-ps5-debut-qa-ps5-pro-leans-toward-pc-high-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> an interview with GSC Game World focused on the PS5 launch, but we also asked about the content and features that are still to come. Ahead of last year's launch, the Ukrainian studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that the game would eventually be updated with features like multiplayer, cross-platform mods, and hardware-accelerated ray tracing. However, twelve months later, there is still no news to share on that front. However, we did get confirmation that the first STALKER 2 DLC will launch at some point in 2026. As a reminder, the game's Ultimate Edition is still being sold with the promise that its Season Pass would include 'two future expansions and all upcoming DLCs'.</p>



<p>We also inquired about the announced upgrade to a newer version of Epic's Unreal Engine 5. </p>



<p><em><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong> Switching to a new version of Unreal Engine 5 is a very big task, which is exactly why even in our roadmap we especially noted that we cannot guarantee the exact timing. It should bring a significant boost to optimization overall, but we will keep you updated on the timing of this update through our socials. But here I would like to note that <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-update-1-7-adds-faction-turf-wars-expedition-mode-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update 1.7</a> has already delivered a significant and very noticeable optimization gain, and it is available right now.</em></p>



<p>Finally, we wanted to know if GSC Game World was satisfied with the performance of STALKER 2 so far.</p>



<p><em><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One million copies sold in under three days</a>&nbsp;and several million players through Game Pass on PC and Xbox can undoubtedly be considered successful figures. Over the year, the game received 7 major updates — and far more smaller ones — which not only improved performance but also added new content. The game is now significantly different from what it was at launch. Updates are a complex matter. In the world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R., they could probably go on forever, much like the pursuit of perfection. Nevertheless, they will continue forward on.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-external-hard-drive-drops-to-a-new-record-low-amazon-clears-out-the-4tb-option-2000645709</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate%E2%80%99s-external-hard-drive-drops-to-a-new-record-low-amazon-clears-out-the-4tb-option.1359130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon kicked off Black Friday by dropping the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/">Seagate 4TB external hard drive to a record low of $99, down from its usual $124 price</a>. External storage solves the constant problem of running out of space on laptops, game consoles and desktops without requiring you to open up your machine. This 4TB capacity gives you enough room to store your entire game library, backup your computer multiple times, or archive years of photos and videos. The drive’s<strong> universal compatibility with Windows, Mac, Xbox, and PlayStation</strong> means you buy it once and use it everywhere without reformatting or compatibility headaches.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Plug-and-Play Simplicity</h2>
<p>The Seagate 4TB HDD <strong>doesn’t need any software installation or setup process</strong> to get it up and running. You connect the provided 18-inch-long USB 3.0 cable between the drive and your computer, and the OS immediately recognizes it as available storage. Windows users will see the drive pop up in File Explorer; Mac users will find it in Finder; and console gamers can format it via their system settings in roughly 30 seconds. This is true <strong>plug-and-play functionality</strong> with no troublesome proprietary software, driver downloads, or cumbersome setup wizards.</p>



<p>In theory, the USB 3.0 interface can reach transfer speeds of as high as 5Gbps but realistically, <strong>this works out to 100-120MB/s for sequential file transfers</strong>. You can back up your entire photo library in the time it takes to make coffee or transfer 4K video footage without waiting around all afternoon. You will be able to copy a 50GB game in about 7-8 minutes. This speed is more than adequate for directly playing games from the drive on either an Xbox or a PlayStation, though load times will be slower compared to internal SSDs.</p>
<p>The <strong>compact design measures approximately 4.5 inches long by 3 inches wide</strong> and less than an inch thick, so it easily slips into a laptop bag or backpack. Weighing only a few ounces, you hardly know the drive is in the bag when on the move. Finished in matte black to resist fingerprints, it looks professional when plugged into your laptop for home or office use. The rounded edges and smooth surfaces keep the drive from catching on contents inside a bag or scratching other devices. Seagate has engineered the enclosure to shield the internal drive against minor drops and bumps common during normal travel.</p>



<p>The 4TB of capacity offers enough space for <strong>around 1,000 hours of HD video, 80,000 high-resolution photos, or around 50 of the latest AAA games</strong>. Xbox and PlayStation users are able to install their entire game collections and not have to continuously uninstall titles to make room for new releases. Archive completed projects, store raw footage, or maintain multiple backup versions of important files without running out of space on the drive.</p>
<p>In addition, Seagate bundles the drive with one year of <em>Rescue Service</em> which will help you get your data back in case the drive dies or you accidentally delete some important files. That service alone can save you thousands of dollars compared to paying for professional data recovery out of pocket. With decades of experience in the storage business, the company’s drives power everything from consumer devices to enterprise data centers.</p>
<p>At $99, this <strong>Seagate external hard drive costs just 2.4 cents per gigabyte</strong>, which is exceptionally good value for reliable branded storage. Amazon’s Black Friday pricing brings the cost down to where buying cloud storage subscriptions for the same capacity would cost more over two years.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-ace-anc-headphones-are-2x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-amazon-clears-out-stock-and-wants-them-all-gone-2000645672</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s stock counter shows<strong> fewer than 12 units remaining at the time of writing this article</strong> which tells you everything about how fast the Sonos Ace headphones are moving at this Black Friday price. Premium wireless headphones solve the problem of airplane noise, open office chaos and commute soundtrack quality but most flagship models cost a fortune. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5727/">Sonos Ace just dropped to its lowest price ever at $279 on Amazon for Black Friday, down from the usual $399</a>, which puts them at roughly half the cost of AirPods Max or Bose Ultra headphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three-Dimensional Music</h2>
<p>The <strong>Sonos Ace delivers spatial audio via Dolby Atmos</strong> which places instruments and vocals in a three-dimensional soundstage around your head. Dynamic head tracking shifts the audio positioning as you move, so the sound stays anchored to your device rather than rotating with your head. This tech creates an immersive listen that’s almost as if you’re sitting in a recording studio or a concert hall. It works great in those Atmos-mixed tracks on Apple Music or Tidal, where producers have placed elements on purpose in the spatial field.</p>



<p>It’s unusual that Sonos allows for <strong>lossless audio streaming over Bluetooth</strong>; most wireless headphones tend to compress audio to fit within Bluetooth’s bandwidth limitations. The company also uses USB-C connectivity for true lossless playback when you want absolute audio fidelity. This dual approach means you get convenience when you need it and maximum quality when you’re sitting down for critical listening.</p>
<p>The <strong>ANC uses multiple microphones to analyze and neutralize external sounds</strong> across a wide frequency range. Sonos engineered the ANC to handle everything from low-frequency airplane engine drone to mid-range conversation noise. It also adjusts in real time to your surroundings, kicking cancellation harder or softer depending on the ambient noise. Transparency mode lets you hear your surroundings when needed, be it airport announcements or quick conversations.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life reaches 30 hours with ANC enabled</strong> which means you can fly cross-country multiple times before needing a charge. That endurance puts the Ace ahead of most competitors that struggle to hit 20 hours with noise cancellation running. The rapid charging feature gives you three hours of playback from just three minutes plugged in, saving you when you forgot to charge overnight. <strong>A full charge takes about three hours via USB-C</strong>&nbsp;and the headphones support charging while listening through the cable.</p>
<p>The physical design focuses on all-day comfort: <strong>plush memory foam ear cushions are wrapped in soft vegan leather</strong>. Sonos shaped the headband and earcups to adapt to various head shapes, hairstyles, and even accessories such as glasses without causing pressure points. An adjustable headband extends smoothly to find that just-right fit, while earcups rotate to keep up with the angle of your head.</p>
<p>At $279, the Sonos Ace costs roughly half what you’d pay for AirPods Max or Bose Ultra headphones and delivers comparable or superior features in several areas. The fact that Amazon has fewer than 12 units left at this record low price suggests other people have already figured out this value equation.</p>

<p>Leaks continue to flood in for Chapter 7 in Fortnite following a creator preview event held by Epic Games, including some of the items set to be included in the Season 1 Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Chapter 6 in Fortnite draws to a close next week with a big <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Hour live event</a>, and, following a period of downtime, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 7 kicks off on November 30</a>—and there’s a big collab in store, according to leaks.</p>







<h2 id="h-leaks-say-marty-mcfly-skin-coming-to-fortnite-chapter-7">Leaks Say Marty McFly Skin Coming to Fortnite Chapter 7</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Zooming onto the scene. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to reliable leakers, including <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991464160996344068" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, Marty McFly from the Back to the Future franchise will feature in the Battle Pass for Chapter 7, Season 1, alongside another big collab that Epic Games has already teased.</p>



<p>McFly’s look will be based on the original Back to the Future films, with high-top trainers, sunglasses, and an orange gilet, and his inclusion comes alongside previous links that indicated the iconic DeLorean car will be featured—with the vehicle already appearing in Epic Games’ Rocket League.</p>



<p>Ahead of the new chapter, Epic Games revealed a collab with Kill Bill, with The Bride shown in a trailer for the upcoming live event, and it’s stated that the iconic look, with the yellow tracksuit, will also feature in the Battle Pass.</p>







<p>The two collabs indicate the widespread rumor that Hollywood serves as major inspiration for the Island in Chapter 7, with a ‘Battlewood’ sign on the hills mimicking the famous Hollywood sign <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991240664986632626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">already spotted</a>.</p>



<p>This also aligns with previous leaks for Chapter 7, which indicate that both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob Squarepants</a> will have collabs during the Chapter.</p>

<p>Embark Studios is well aware that ARC Raiders is a success. This is why the developer keeps supporting the game with new updates and dropping patch notes like it’s hot. The November 20 ARC Raiders 1.3.0 update drops some big changes that you can’t DUCK.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is amazing, but it isn’t perfect. This is why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-nerf-security-breach-perk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embark Studios nerfed ARC Raiders’ most OP perk</a> not long ago. The changes will keep coming, and improvements will shape ARC into <em>the </em>extraction shooter.</p>







<p>We’ve got everything you need to know about the ARC Raiders 1.3.0 update, featuring full patch notes at the end.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-arc-raiders-november-20-changes">Biggest ARC Raiders November 20 Changes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Look out. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Various balance changes have rolled out for the value of certain items, specific damage numbers—such as the Venator—have been readjusted, many bugs have been fixed, and there’s even a nice touch for rubber duck fans.</strong></p>



<p>You will need to think twice when selling certain items in ARC Raiders—such as Power Cells and certain ammo—as Embark has rung the changes. ARCs have been weakened to behave slightly more reasonably, and the Venator’s fire rate has been reworked, as it was “over-performing.”</p>







<p>One of the biggest, growing pastimes in ARC Raiders is collecting rubber ducks. While Embark hasn’t stated specifically what the change is, the dev has been listening to your request:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Your Raider Den has been ducked out.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-all-arc-raiders-patch-notes-for-november-20-update-1-3-0">All ARC Raiders Patch Notes For November 20 Update 1.3.0</h2>



<p>Here’s the complete 1.3.0 patch notes for you to read.</p>



<h3>Balance Changes</h3>



<h3>Items:</h3>



<h4>Deadline</h4>



<ul>
<li>Buy value: From 8,100 to 15,000 Coins</li>



<li>Sell value: From 3,000 to 5,000 Coins</li>



<li>Crafting:
<ul>
<li>Old: 2 Explosive compound + 1 Synthesized fuel</li>



<li>New: 3 Explosive compound + 2 ARC Circuitry&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Deadline trader stock: From 3 to 1</li>
</ul>



<h4>Power cell</h4>



<ul>
<li>Sell value: From 640 to 270 Coins</li>
</ul>



<h4>Launcher ammo</h4>



<ul>
<li>Buy value:
<ul>
<li>Old: 10 launcher ammo for 6,000 Coins</li>



<li>New: 6 launcher ammo for 4,500 Coins</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Sell value: From 200 to 250</li>



<li>Crafting:
<ul>
<li>Old: 6 launcher ammo for 4 Metal parts + 1 Explosive Compound</li>



<li>New: 6 launcher ammo for 1 ARC Motion Core + 2 Crude Explosives</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Launcher ammo crafting is available at the Workbench without needing a blueprint.</li>
</ul>



<h4>Venator</h4>



<p><strong>Dev note:&nbsp;</strong>The fully upgraded Venator has been over-performing recently, capable of outgunning full squads using close range weapons. We’re re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact. This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter. The community also rightfully pointed out that the weight of the Venator was inconsistent with the weights of our other pistols, so we’ve corrected that as well.</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced Fire-rate gained from upgrades from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%.</li>



<li>Increased Weight from 2 to 5.</li>
</ul>



<h4>Explosive Damage</h4>



<p><strong>Dev note:</strong>&nbsp;We noticed that explosives dealt damage to more parts at once than intended, allowing weapons like the Hullcracker to kill larger drones too quickly. We’ve adjusted explosive damage to make it more consistent across the board, and we’ve re-balanced the damage of the Hullcracker to account for that change. This will require Hullcracker shots to need a bit more precision while still dealing good damage to the targeted spot.</p>



<ul>
<li>Rebalanced explosive damage against ARC for a more consistent experience.</li>



<li>Explosions on smaller enemies, e.g. Turrets are largely unaffected.</li>



<li>Explosions on larger sized enemies, e.g. Bastion will typically deal a bit less damage.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>

            <p>Capcom has celebrated a new milestone for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-guides-tips-tricks-9422">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, which came out last year, but the most common response so far is - what about some DLC?</p>
<p>Last night, the Dragon's Dogma 2 team shared the following post across its social media: "Thank you to the four million Arisen around the world! We're grateful to share the immersive fantasy world of Dragon's Dogma 2 with you all, where freedom and adventure await."</p>

<p>Capcom accompanied its post with some Dragon's Dogma 2 artwork proclaiming this player number (see image below), and it is of course a figure worth celebrating. However, fans of the game clearly now want more of the good stuff, and have used this post to voice their desires for some DLC.</p>
<p>"Where's the post release support guys? DLC? A reason to revisit? Feels like you have given up on it," reads one such response. "Please give us any information on if any plans for updates or DLC are in the works. We all are dying to know," adds another. You get the idea.</p><p>And after all, the first game in the series got new content after launch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen-review">via expansion Dark Arisen</a>, which dramatically transformed the game. I was just chatting with our Alex about it, and in his words Dark Arisen "legitimately took the game from like a 7 to a 9/10".</p>

<p>However, there is one key spanner in the works when it comes to new content for Dragon's Dogma 2. The game's director - Hideaki Itsuno - is no longer part of the development team. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/veteran-capcom-developer-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom-after-30-years-and-five-months">Itsuno left Capcom after more than 30 years at the studio</a> in August of last year. At this time, he said he hoped to "create fun, beautiful games that are as memorable as, or even more memorable than, the ones I have created so far".</p>
<p>In November last year, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-director-hideaki-itsuno-announces-new-studio-focused-on-original-aaa-action-games">Itsuno was now the head of LightSpeed Japan Studio</a>, a newly-established game developer with a focus on the creation of "original AAA action game titles".</p>
<p>Do you want to see more Dragon's Dogma 2 content? Or, have you accepted it is what it is?</p>

<p>As shared by company CEO Akihiro Hino on <a href="https://x.com/AkihiroHino/status/1991399440079552852">X</a>, Victory Road has already surpassed 500,000 sales worldwide. Sure, this is across <em>all</em> platforms (including PS4, PS5, Xbox Series and Steam), but that's no mean feat for a title that has been this long in the making.</p>
<p>"We will leverage the strengths of a download-only title to make the game even more enjoyable and add new content," Hino wrote in the accompanying tweet (via Google Translate), "so please look forward to it!".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gkuhqr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>And new content <em>is</em> inbound, it seems. In the blog post marking the sales milestone on the <a href="https://www.inazuma.jp/victory-road/topics/251120/">Inazuma Eleven website</a>, Level-5 mentions that it will be adding new "Galaxy", "Scales of Ares" and "Seal of Orion" routes (presumably based on the anime series of the same name) to the game's throwback Chronicle Mode, as well as an online tournament and additional free content in the future too.</p>
<p>We'll have our full review of Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road with you before long, so keep an eye out for that one!</p>

			<p>With the Barbarians knocking at the gates, I’m sure that the Romans despaired at their lack of foresight in not building their great cities on wheels. Had they done that? Well, they could just roll off into the distance and away from those that menaced them. That’s pretty much the plan in Monsters Are Coming! Rock and Road, with the world beset by hordes of shadowy creatures and the distant promise of sanctuary at the Arch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road | Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kVZpnNukOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Right from the opening moments, it’s clear that Rock and Road is a fun mash-‘em-up of roguelite, bullet heaven and tower defence. You start with the core building of your city, trundling downwards toward safety as monsters spawn around you, and a black fog follows. As the hero peon, you have to scurry around nearby, gathering wood, stone and gold while also chipping in with some of the defensive effort.</p>


<p>Somewhat counterintuitively, those resources don’t actually pay for city upgrades and new buildings in the moment. Wood increases the speed of your towers firing, stone repairs damage, and gold can be spent on buildings and upgrades at safe zones, but the main way you’ll earn buildings is through levelling up and getting a choice of three buildings to place. That comes from gathering the experience gems dropped by fallen monsters and levelling up.</p>


<p>There’s more of the Vampire Survivors structure and gameplay feel to this game than it appears on the surface. Your hero also controls in that bullet heaven fashion, so you just move them around and they’ll automatically attack nearby enemies and harvest from scenery that you push them into, gathering a long snake of resources that you need to then lead back and deposit at your city. That’s the point that everything is banked, often levelling you up in a single go early on, and kicking you into the building screen.</p>
<p>This is where it starts to feel like tower defence. Your city sits in the centre of a square grid, and you can build out from that point. Each building takes up just a single square, and doesn’t have to be adjacent to another building, just in line with one, so you can immediately start to strategise with your building placement. Shorter-ranged turrets can go to the edges, longer-ranged mortars and ballistae more centrally, and then minion generators, stat farms and special buffing buildings nearby. Given the direction of travel, it’s easy to load up the rear of your city, but that can hurt you when waves of enemies spawn from the front and sides, so you do often need a multi-sided approach. I’ve repeatedly leant into having a skinny column, which helps with the need to clear scenery that your city can get stuck on and be vulnerable.</p>

<p>You can get adjacency bonuses –&nbsp;there’s a really helpful +50% damage building that wants to be central to a bunch of towers, while stat farms give 5% boosts by default and an additional +1% for each one in a chain. It’s fun trying to get boosts and synergies to work together, like leaning in on having minions and then a turret that gains 10% damage for every minion currently alive, or a building that makes fire deal 50% bonus damage to frozen enemies.</p>
<p>In a typical roguelite fashion, you need to roll with what the game randomly offers you. You pick from 10 cities to start with, and that can bring some fundamental changes –&nbsp;a left-to-right mirror city that doubles your buildings, a city where XP comes from harvesting not enemies –&nbsp;and Hard difficulty on each biome starts to add further challenges, so you might have an initial plan, but if the unlocks given to you are all for fire and ice, instead of minions or gold generation, and you don’t have the cash to re-roll the options then you’ll have to pivot. The handful of safe zone checkpoints also give you a chance to adjust or enhance without pressure, giving you a choice of new weapons for your hero, a chance to get a stash of resources and the shop to sink all of your cash into.</p>
<p>The overarching progression naturally brings you new cities to play with (luring you into these different playstyles), and unlocks more buildings that broadens the options you might be presented. Even if you fail, each run also generates overarching progression points, largely depending on how far you’ve travelled, which you then spend to give percentage boosts to various city and hero traits. Success, however, immortalises that first city in the Arch, piecing together a new sanctuary and giving a little script about each one’s method.</p>

<p>One of the things I appreciate about Rock and Road is how bitesized each run can be, coming in at under 30 minutes, with the spaces between checkpoints ramping up the pressure and building up to a randomised Kaiju-sized boss. They’ll generally just walk around your city alongside throngs of other enemies, while you scamper around and try to undo their abilities. One can make itself invulnerable by attaching to scenery that you need to destroy, another is a big spider queen where you need to race to destroy globs of enemies they spawn, and more.</p>
<p>Should you defeat them, it’s then a straight run to safety, and there’s a lot of joy to seeing the mass of arrows coming down from the Arch’s defensive walls, while your city fends off the chasing horde. But then that’s the end. You don’t roll through to the next biome and even greater challenges; your city is consigned to history and you start a new run. That makes it feel like you’ve seen all that the game has to offer by the time you’ve bested the standard difficulty – which I’d say isn’t that great a challenge. Playing on Hard is a big leap and requires that progression grind and more experimentation, but I feel this as a more casual option, compared to the more compulsive roguelites out there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Powered by NVIDIA technology, Nintendo Switch 2 games can leverage RTX tech like<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/"> NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing </a>to deliver better visuals and <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-surpassing-xbox-series-s/">enhanced image quality at solid performance.</a> Since launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-nvidia-dlss-engine-limitations/">Nintendo's own titles had yet to take advantage of either,</a> but it seems like the ray tracing floodgates have been opened by the publisher's latest first-party title, Kirby Air Riders.</p>



<p>As confirmed by a screenshot of the game's license readme found in the Nintendo Switch 2's menu <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders-is-the-first-nintendo-published-switch-2-game-to-support-ray-tracing-specifically-ray-traced-global-illumination.1358995/">shared on ResetERA</a>, Kirby Air Riders reportedly uses the RTXGI SDK, meaning that the racing game uses ray-traced global illumination in some capacity, making it the first proper Nintendo first-party game to do so.</p>



<p>While it's not yet known how Kirby Air Riders implements ray-traced global illumination, this is a very interesting find in light of how the Nintendo Switch 2 handles the game. According to our own Nathan Birch, the game not only looks gorgeous, but <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-air-riders/">runs at a smooth 60 FPS even when the tracks become utterly chaotic</a>. As such, it will be interesting to see how this is achieved, and whether any upscaling technology, such as the aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-nvidia-dlss-types-nintendo-switch-2/">NVIDIA DLSS</a>, is also utilized to deliver the excellent image quality and solid performance the game exhibits at launch.</p>



<p>Although Kirby Air Riders is reportedly the first proper Nintendo game to use ray tracing in some capacity, this isn't the first time we could be witnessing ray tracing on Nintendo Switch 2. Star Wars Outlaws, the open-world game developed by Ubisoft based on the popular franchise, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-early-footage-analysis-highlights-need-for-ray-reconstruction/">also makes ample use of ray tracing</a>. Future third-party releases, such as Resident Evil Requiem, will likely utilize ray tracing in some capacity as well, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-ray-tracing/">judging from currently available footage</a></p>

			<p>The price will be the critical factor that will determine the success of the Steam Machine, but those who expected the upcoming system to be priced in the same range as a console will likely be disappointed, judging from some new information shared online.</p>



<p><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnKy4UEdiyo&amp;t=2s">In the latest episode of Linus Tech Tips' WAN Show podcast</a>, Linus commented on the yet-to-be-revealed price for the system. While he doesn't know the price (as no one does yet), there are strong indications the system won't fall in the $500 price range of the current PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X systems, judging from the reaction of Valve's employees during a recent media event to show the system to press and creators.</p>



<p><em>"When I said I'm disappointed it isn't going to follow a console pricing model, where its subsided by the fact that manufacturer is going to be taking 30% of every game sold on it over the lifespan of this thing, because I feel that would be a more meaningful product, they asked what I meant by console price and I said $500. Nobody said anything, but the energy in the room wasn't great,"</em> Linus said during the podcast.</p>

<p>Although Valve said that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/">Steam Machine will be priced competitively with a PC of similar specs</a>, expecting a gaming PC in a console form factor to cost as much as a console is definitely a little unreasonable. As such, what happened at Valve's headquarters, as reported by Linus, shouldn't surprise anyone, especially in light of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/samsung-rumored-memory-price-hike-could-be-a-catastrophe-for-pc-gamers/">now expected massive RAM price increase</a> that will impact a wide range of hardware, including gaming hardware.</p>



<p>However, despite Valve believing that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bigger-game-catalogue-steam-machine-success/">a bigger game library will ensure the Steam Machine is more successful than its predecessors</a> and that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-offers-equal-or-better-performance-70-gaming-pcs/">it will offer a better gaming experience than 70% of current gaming rigs</a>, pricing still needs to be right for the system to be successful. While it is true <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-rely-amd-fsr-4k-60/">it may have a hard time delivering a 4K@60 FPS gaming experience even with AMD FSR</a>, those who want to have a hassle-free gaming experience in the vein of consoles won't look at the system twice if it's priced too high, especially in the current climate where the price of living continues to rise worldwide.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Asus Is Going Nuts, Selling ROG Strix 27″ 240Hz OLED Gaming Monitor at a New Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-is-going-nuts-selling-rog-strix-27-240hz-oled-gaming-monitor-at-a-new-record-low-2000645693</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-is-going-nuts-selling-rog-strix-27%E2%80%B3-240hz-oled-gaming-monitor-at-a-new-record-low.1359070/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The fact that this <strong>Asus ROG Strix 27-inch OLED gaming monitor</strong> has never been on sale before makes<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5734/"> this Black Friday drop to an all-time low of $549 (down from $699) on Amazon a big deal</a>. Asus usually sticks to its guns with MSRP on premium ROG monitors but Amazon’s opening day of Black Friday saw deep cuts across the board on everything from the larger 32 and 34-inch models that also reached new all-time lows.</p>
<p>Gaming monitors solve the fundamental problem of seeing what you’re shooting at before your opponent does, and OLED panels take that advantage to another level with instant pixel response and infinite contrast. The ROG Strix XG27AQDMG combines <strong>1440p resolution with 240Hz refresh rate and true 0.03ms response time</strong> in a package that makes everything else look washed out and sluggish.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5734/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>OLED Technology Perfect for Gaming Workloads</h2>
<p>The <strong>26.5-inch WOLED panel offers a resolution of 2560 by 1440</strong>&nbsp;which hits a sweet spot between the lack of detail in 1080p and the demanding GPU of 4K. Third-generation WOLED technology results in brighter white windows and clearer text compared to previous generations of OLED that struggled with full-screen brightness. Each pixel emits its own light and turns fully off for true blacks, creating infinite contrast that makes dark scenes in games actually visible instead of turning into grey mush. The glossy coating maximizes color vibrancy and eliminates the haze that matte coatings introduce, though it does require some attention to room lighting to avoid reflections. The <strong>99% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage</strong> means colors look saturated and accurate without the oversaturation that cheap gaming monitors produce.</p>



<p>The <strong>240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms grey-to-grey response time</strong> eliminates the ghosting and motion blur that plagues slower panels. Your mouse cursor moves across the screen with zero trailing, and fast-paced shooters clearly display enemy movement without smearing, while racing games show track details even at high speeds. This combination of high refresh rate and instant pixel response creates the motion clarity that competitive gamers need to track targets accurately.</p>



<p>ROG’s exclusive OLED Anti-flicker technology <strong>reduces flicker during refresh rate fluctuations</strong> that can cause eye strain during extended gaming sessions. Conventionally, variable refresh rate displays would usually flicker when frame rates change rapidly, but Asus worked out algorithms that would smooth these transitions. The technology works invisibly behind the scenes, maintaining consistent image quality whether you’re getting 240fps or dropping to 120fps during intensive scenes.</p>
<p>Included in the purchase price is <strong>three months of Adobe Creative Cloud access</strong>&nbsp;which adds value if you do any photo editing, graphic design, or video work. The OLED’s perfect blacks and wide color gamut make it excellent for creative work beyond gaming, as it’s able to accurately display the full range of colors that content creators need to see. The 1440p resolution provides enough screen real estate for editing timelines or working with multiple windows without feeling cramped.</p>
<p>At $549, this is the first discount ever on the ROG Strix XG27AQDMG and brings OLED gaming down to prices that previously only got you mid-tier IPS panels. You’re getting third-generation WOLED technology with burn-in protections, 240Hz refresh and instant response times for $150 less than Asus’s asking price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gopro-heros-rival-this-dji-4k-120fps-camera-is-going-for-pocket-change-at-black-friday-2000645668</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gopro-hero%E2%80%99s-rival-this-dji-4k-120fps-camera-is-going-for-pocket-change-this-black-friday.1359067/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>GoPro should be looking over its shoulder because DJI has been closing the gap fast in the action camera market over the past few years. The <strong>Osmo Action 5 Pro</strong> goes head-to-head with GoPro’s latest Hero13 Black, and in several areas, it actually pulls ahead. This Black Friday deal on Amazon drops the <em>Essential combo</em> to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4783/">a record low of $259, down from the usual $339</a>, which undercuts GoPro’s flagship by a decent margin.</p>
<p>Action cameras capture moments your phone can’t handle like mountain biking through trails, surfing big waves, or documenting motorcycle rides where stabilization and durability matter more than megapixels. DJI packed this camera with a massive sensor, advanced stabilization, and dual touchscreens that make it easier to use than the competition.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Sensor That Handles Low Light</h2>
<p>The <strong>Osmo Action 5 Pro features a 1/1.3-inch sensor</strong>, considerably larger than you’d find in most action cameras. It features 2.4-micrometer pixels that pull in more light per pixel to give you usable footage in conditions where other action cameras produce grainy messes. The 13.5-stop dynamic range means you can shoot into bright skies without losing detail in shadows or capture sunset scenes without blowing out the highlights. <strong>DJI’s processing handles 4K video at 120fps</strong> which gives you buttery slow-motion playback to analyze your technique or create dramatic highlight reels. In quick-changing lighting conditions such as moving between shaded forest trails and sunny clearings, this sensor does an excellent job of maintaining consistent exposure.</p>



<p>Subject tracking that actually works in the real world is powered by an advanced 4nm chip. You can set the <strong>camera to track yourself, friends, or even pets</strong> while <strong>shooting in either 16:9 or vertical 9:16 aspect ratios</strong>. Its tracking stays locked on moving subjects with remarkable accuracy, removing that perpetual anxiety of whether I am staying in frame or not. This feature transforms solo content creation because you simply don’t need someone behind the camera following you around.</p>
<p><strong>Voice control</strong> remains on and ready for response within about a meter radius so you can start recording, shoot photos, or stop recording from a distance without touching the camera. This makes sense when you’re skiing, climbing, or doing anything where reaching for buttons breaks your flow. Recognition accuracy handles commands reliably even in moderately noisy environments, though strong winds or loud motors can sometimes throw it off.</p>



<p>The <strong>dual OLED touchscreens on front and back</strong> eradicate that usual action camera frustration: composing shots blind. The front screen means you can frame yourself perfectly for vlogs or selfie shots without having to guess where you’re positioned. Both screens stay bright and readable in direct sunlight, which matters enormously when you try to adjust settings on a sunny beach or snowy mountain. The <strong>touchscreen interface responds quickly and logically,</strong> and makes adjustments of parameters feel natural rather than something you have to commit to memory, along with button combinations.</p>
<p>DJI’s 360° <em>HorizonSteady</em> <strong>stabilization keeps your horizon straight</strong>, no matter how much the camera rotates on the roll axis. You can mount this on your chest, helmet, or handlebars and get footage that’s like it was coming from a gimbal. The stabilization algorithm compensates for sudden jolts, vibrations, and continuous movement while maintaining natural-looking motion.</p>
<p>The 1950mAh battery provides <strong>up to four hours of continuous recording</strong> in normal conditions and impressively keeps 3.6 hours even at negative 20 degrees Celsius. That kind of cold-weather performance puts it ahead of most action cameras, which start dying quickly in freezing temperatures. The <strong>IP68 rating</strong> certifies the camera for depths up to 20 meters without any additional housing, so you can take it snorkeling, surfing, or kayaking without worry.</p>
<p>This Black Friday price of $259 makes the DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro substantially cheaper than GoPro’s Hero13 Black with comparable or superior features in several key areas. The larger sensor alone justifies the purchase for anyone who shoots in challenging lighting conditions and the dual OLED screens eliminate the composition guesswork that plagues single-screen action cameras.</p>

<p>Major Fortnite leaks for Chapter 7 content have begun to flood social media following a creator preview event in Los Angeles, with standout details including driveable reboot vans and a dedicated bots mode.</p>



<p>Epic Games is gearing up for the major <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Hour end-of-chapter event</a> next week, which will be followed by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start of Chapter 7</a>, Season 1, and big changes are on the cards that will impact various core mechanics of the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-driveable-reboot-vans-bots-mode-amp-storm-size-changes-coming">Driveable Reboot Vans, Bots Mode &amp; Storm Size Changes Coming</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big changes afoot. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to reliable leakers, including <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991464160996344068" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, some of the biggest gameplay changes coming to Fortnite in Chapter 7 include reboot vans being driveable, an overhaul to the gameplay UI, and a dedicated Solo vs Bots mode.</p>



<p>Bots are nothing new in Fortnite and are widely used to populate Battle Royale lobbies to reduce wait time, but introducing a dedicated mode where solo players go head-to-head with them is a big change. However, there is still plenty to be detailed about the game mode.</p>



<p>Driveable reboot vans align with previous hints towards a revamp of the reboot system in Fortnite, which will result in changes to gameplay tactically as reboot vans will be moveable, thus becoming a core resource later in games to revive fallen teammates, or prevent opponents from bringing back their squad.</p>



<p>Another big change, again leaked by <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991290054728159308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, shows that storm sizes are being adjusted in Chapter 7 away from the standard circle closing in, instead having a ‘seven’ shape. However, it’s mentioned that the sizes and timings are not final.</p>



<p>Epic Games will reveal all the major changes to Fortnite in Chapter 7 closer to the release date, likely sharing the full details in a pre-launch blog ahead of the start of the new chapter on December 30.</p>

After seeing that teaser trailer, fans think "Titans" refers to the game's current main antagonist, The Dark Presence, a towering demonic entity that rules Chapter 6's Spirit Realm, but also to the forces now squaring up against him. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the coming battle, players look set to fight alongside a series of other looming figures: the returning Godzilla and King Kong, plus the newly giant-sized Homer Simpson. Is there a clue to a much longer story arc here too? Think back to Fortnite's Chapter 5, which introduced the current era of storytelling focused on blue-haired hero Hope, and you could also link in the mysterious giant hand that erupted from the ground holding Pandora's Box. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Are all of these Titans? And how will Fortnite wrap all of these things together (plus Star Wars' X-Wings, Uma Thurman, and Marty McFly) as it moves to its new USA-based home?

<p>This literally can't fit on a cartridge</p>

<figure data-uuid="ac15c7c16a707"><a title="Aerith" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac15c7c16a707/aerith.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix has just posted an update on the expected file size for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>As we had perhaps expected, it's big, folks. Like, real big. Store listings on the eShop already have some pretty lofty numbers attached to them, but according to Square Enix, these actually aren't accurate.</p>
<p>As stated on <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1991431395873530291">X</a>, the file size for the <strong>Standard Edition will be 90GB to 95GB</strong>. Meanwhile, the <strong>Limited Early Purchase Edition and Limited Early Purchase Digital Deluxe Editions will be 93.8GB to 99GB</strong>.</p>

<p>Woof! This means, of course, that the game simply won't fit on a 64GB cartridge for its physical release, and so Square Enix has, like many others, opted for a Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p>It makes us wonder just how large <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</a> will be alongside the untitled third entry. Is it possible that these three games combined simply won't fit on the Switch 2 without an additional microSD Express Card..?</p>
<p>Needless to say, if you've yet to invest in some extra storage space, now might be the time to do so. We suspect 2026 is going to be packed with some pretty sizeable ports, so you're going to want to have all the spare GBs you can get.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launches on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>

            <p>The messy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">legal dispute</a> between publishers Krafton and three former lead developers on the game rumbles on. The lawyerly wranglings about Krafton's decision to delay Sub 2's early access, leaving a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-will-get-their-bonus-says-krafton-but-its-not-the-250-million-promised">$250 million bonus to developers Unknown Worlds</a> up in the air, then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">fire Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill</a>, are still wrangling.</p>
<p>A pre-trial briefing released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publisher-krafton-allegedly-looked-to-chatgpt-to-figure-out-how-to-not-pay-that-250-million-bonus">earlier this week</a> saw the three leads claim Krafton CEO Kim Chang-han consulted ChatGPT about ways the company could get around paying the much-discussed $250 million bonus, which the leads claim they would have shared with the rest of Unknown Worlds. Krafton subsequently said in a statement to Kotaku that this allegation from the ex-leads was "simply a distraction from their own efforts to destroy evidence". Now, testimony from Chang-han has emerged, in which the exec concedes he did consult ChatGPT about aspects of the Subnautica 2 situation.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Upon learning that Cleveland and McGuire weren't directly involved in Subnautica 2's development, Chang-han said "I started discussing this matter with various teams within the company to find - to figure out what we could do," in testimony spotted by cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/after-krafton-denied-its-ceo-consulted-with-chatgpt-on-the-subnautica-2-mess-krafton-ceo-says-he-consulted-with-chatgpt-on-the-subnautica-2-mess/">PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p>The CEO said he chatted to various teams within the company about this, then "searched on ChatGPT to get faster answers to figure out what kind of rights we have", adding that he used it "just like Google search". Lawyers for the former Unknown Worlds leads subsequently brought up a message Chang-han sent to Krafton head of corporate development Maria Park in June, in which he wrote: "Now, ChatGPT [is] start[ing] to answer that it is difficult to cancel the earn-out. If so, this is a contract under which we can only be dragged around."</p><p>Asked why that and another conversation the CEO had with ChatGPT about the situation were subsequently deleted, Chang-han cited concerns about what OpenAI might do with their contents, saying "what I learned is that - from OpenAI, is that if you use certain important information concerning your company, then that type of information can be used by OpenAI for learning purposes."</p>
<p>Basically, the exec's stance is that he was simply using ChatGPT in this scenario in the same way he now uses it "dozens" of times a day when dealing with Krafton's usual business, as he would a regular search engine. Krafton haven't been shy about sharing how much they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-and-inzoi-publishers-announce-voluntary-layoff-program-amid-the-era-of-ai-transformation">generally embracing the use of AI</a> as a business. The question is whether it's really appropriate for a CEO to be turning to an AI chatbot for help with a situation of this gravity.</p>
<p>As we've seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-lay-off-830-people-thanks-to-unrealistic-metaverse-ambitions">depressingly often</a>, when company heads like Chang-han make bad decisions, lots of people suffer, making it rather terrifying to think that a technology still <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/ai-factual-errors-chatgpt-gemini-copilot-b2867620.html">very prone</a> to churning out errors or  inaccuracies could now be relied on as part of that decision making. Meanwhile, the deletions obviously risk adding to the impression that Krafton aren't being transparent about their motivations. If Chang-han <em>is</em> being honest about the reasons for the deletion, it's also interesting to hear the CEO of a company this committed to generative AI as a tool expressing anxiety about what these tools do with our data.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Krafton for comment. In their latest statement on the case in general, the company said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are grateful to the court for its thorough commitment to understanding the facts, and we are confident we have demonstrated our commitment to delivering the best game possible to our fans. We made clear to the court that we were forced to make a change when the former leaders showed little interest in the development of Subnautica 2, which has always been our top priority.</p>
<p>Now, this trial comes down to plaintiffs asking to be restored to jobs they were not doing, said they had no interest in doing, and had previously declined requests that they come back and do those jobs. We look forward to receiving a decision. We have made incredible progress in the past few months, and we are excited to share with all the Subnautica fans.”</p></blockquote>
<p>You can almost certainly expect plenty more news to follow as this saga continues to get deeper and deeper into the legal waters.</p>
