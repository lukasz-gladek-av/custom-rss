"The main reason we wanted to do that is we wanted not only the fans of the series, but also new players, to start at the same place with the story. Everyone can experience the same thing at the same time."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Onimusha: Way of the Sword - 2nd Trailer: Formidable Foes Emerge</p>
      </div>
<p>Up until now, all mainline Onimusha games have been connected narratively since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/onimusha-warlords/" data-ref-id="5000-1574">Onimusha: Warlords</a> kicked things off in 2001, often having their protagonists fighting demonic Genma and a possessed Oda Nobunaga's forces. Capcom even went through the effort of remastering the first two games in the series in the 2020s, so it could be believable that it was prepping players to understand the series' overarching narrative and lore prior to its continuation. That's not the case, though, as the only real connection is that players are still fighting Genma and Kadowaki admitted that Way of the Sword's development was separate from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-gets-a-modern-remaster-this-year/1100-6529245/" data-ref-id="1100-6529245">those remaster efforts</a>.</p><p>Players will control a new protagonist named Miyamoto Mushashi, whose face is modeled after actor Toshiro Mifune and who wields an Oni gauntlet that gives him special powers. That all may sound familiar to those who watched the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/netflixs-onimusha-anime-brings-together-three-japanese-legends/2900-4875/" data-ref-id="2900-4875">Onimusha series on Netflix</a> last year. But once again, Kadowaki denied any sort of connection between the show and new game, even though they both feature the same character modeled after the same real-world actor. "There's absolutely no connection with the Netflix animated series," Kadowaki bluntly confirmed.</p><p>If you are planning on playing Onimusha: Way of the Sword when it launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime in 2026, you at least don't have to worry about this franchise's past, as it's a clean slate narratively.</p>

Brandon Adler said in an interview that Obsidian did not set the price for the game, adding that anyone bothered by the price point should take their concerns to Microsoft.</p><p>"We're a game developer. We love to make games. We don't set the prices for our games," he said in an <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/as-the-outer-worlds-2-hits-usd80-director-says-we-dont-set-the-prices-for-our-games-and-wishes-everybody-could-play-obsidians-new-rpg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview with GamesRadar</a>. "Like, personally, as a game developer, I wish everybody could play my game, because that's what I want out of this whole thing. But for the reasons and so like, why the $79.99 price point, you'd have to honestly talk to the Xbox folks."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Outer Worlds 2 - Official Story Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is Microsoft's first $80 game, but it wasn't a total surprise, given that Microsoft had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">said it would begin charging $80 for some games in 2025.</a> Microsoft also raised prices on Xbox consoles.</p><p>Outside of Xbox, Nintendo is charging $80 for Mario Kart World, while there are expectations that other publishers will follow suit and start charging more as well. 2K Games has been caught up in pricing drama, too, as Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-reacts-to-price-point-controversy/1100-6531739/" data-ref-id="1100-6531739">he doesn't know if Borderlands 4 will be $80 or not.</a></p><p>What Adler said about The Outer Worlds 2 lines up with what Pitchford has said about Borderlands 4. He mentioned that, as an artist, he wants as many people as possible to play his games. At the same time, he acknowledged that it's a business and the company has to keep making money to make more games. Like Adler, Pitchford also noted that he does not set prices; in his case, 2K Games is making the call.</p><p>As for Xbox, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said again and again that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-accountable-to-microsoft-for-running-a-good-business/1100-6532338/" data-ref-id="1100-6532338">it's his job to make money and run a successful business</a>, even if this means the company has to make some tradeoffs.</p><p>"We're accountable to Microsoft for running a good business--a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line. That's kind of a foundation for us," Spencer said.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 launches on October 29 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. If you don't want to pay $80 for it, you can subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate and play it via your membership. Game Pass is not available on PlayStation, however.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/impressions/2025/06/12/the-razer-kishi-v3-pro-is-the-best-mobile-gaming-controller-and-its-not-even<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>I’ve always admired the attempts to make mobile gaming feel comparable to my experience gaming on consoles with a controller in hand. I have the Riot PWR controller that mimics the Xbox gamepad, a couple of Backbones, and some other random ones, but none have ever given me the impression I was doing anything more than just making it work. I’m always left wanting something better, something more premium. With Razer’s latest controller, the Kishi V3 Pro, I finally have the controller I’ve always wanted when gaming on my iPhone.</p><p>Let’s get some caveats out of the way before I dive into what I love about the Kishi V3 Pro: It is far and away the most expensive mobile gaming controller out there, closer in price to PlayStation’s DualSense Edge and more costly than PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo’s baseline controllers. It’s available worldwide today for a whopping $149.99. It is also only available with a USB-C connection, meaning you’ll need one of Apple’s newer iPhones (if you have an Android phone, you’re likely set) or an iPad Mini to use it. There’s a non-Pro version lacking some of the better features of the Pro for $99.99, and Pro XL version for $199.99, if you want to use a full-sized iPad with it.</p><p>While that price is exorbitant for a mobile controller, once you bite the bullet, you will not regret it.</p>

<p>Immediately upon opening the box, you’re greeted with premium packaging with a blocky foam insert to ensure the controller stays secure. With the controller I received – the Pro – there was another set of analog sticks to connect to the controller: rounded bump sticks and traditional concave sticks. I like the latter on the left side for movement and the former on the right side for faster aiming. Swapping these sticks is as easy as pulling them off with a little bit of force, but it doesn’t feel terrifying to as though you’re breaking the device. You’ll also find a couple of gummy plastic inserts that provide different bumper sizes to the top of your phone, the left side (or top), which isn’t connected to the USB-C connection port. The box is so lovely that I’ve been using it as the controller’s “case” when not in use, and I appreciate Razer’s Apple-like presentation with the packaging. If people are expected to pay $150, every aspect, including the box, needs to feel worth that price tag.</p><p>Prompted to download the Razer Nexus app, I do so and am happyit’s free, because it’s a really nice game launcher that groups together mobile games, ones available in the App Store (which pairs nicely with the free 3 months of Apple Arcade the controller includes), and Xbox PC games available for cloud streaming or remote play. In my briefing with the Razer team before actually receiving a Kishi V3 Pro, it emphasized that Nexus is free and will remain free, making sure to subtly shade “other” mobile controller apps that aren’t free, cough cough, Backbone+, which costs $50 a year after a free year trial.</p><p>Even if Nexus didn’t exist, the Kishi V3 Pro is still an excellent controller. Its design feels most similar to an Xbox controller and has enough girth to feel premium, versus something that feels like it’s doing its best to mimic a standard controller but missing the mark. Razer says the USB-C connection promises little to no latency, though admittedly, I’ve never had latency issues on any of the mobile controllers I’ve used.</p><p>There’s much customization under the hood, too, even beyond the swappable thumbsticks and phone bumpers. The triggers can be switched to an Analog or Digital mode, allowing you to customize their feel, how much you need to press before registering an input, and more. The two back “pedal” buttons are circles that your hands grip around the controller, and they feel similar to clicking a mouse. I haven’t used them too much, but I can imagine the possibilities with shooters, strategy games, and other genres where a mouse click is often more competitive than triggers.</p><p>The Tunnel Magnetoresistance (or TMR) thumbsticks are apparently longer-lasting and more precise than other types, including Hall Effect thumbsticks, according to Razer, and while I’ll need more time to put these to the test, I can say they feel incredible. The same goes for the Hall Effect triggers, 8-way d-pad, and face buttons. There are even two additional buttons up top by the bumpers for more customization. The entire package is lifted by Razer’s Sensa HD Haptics, which do feel quite premium, especially for a mobile controller. Though haptics have never been the gamechanger controller makers boast them to be, I would compare the Sensa HD haptics with Nintendo’s Joy-Con and PlayStation’s DualSense haptics technology.</p>

<p>If you aren’t familiar with the mobile gaming controller market, these are features you won’t find in other controllers. Instead of taking the more casual approach to designing a controller for use with phones, Razer has treated this device like something for the market of gamers the DualSense Edge or Xbox Elite controllers appeals to – it’s for the gamers who want to tinker and toy with small customizable options, the players who don’t want caveats just because they’re using their phone to game. The Riot PWR controller works, the Backbone works, and so do all of my other random devices, but none feel as intentional as the Kishi V3 Pro. It feels like a controller that will become an integral piece of my gaming rotation rather than something I only use on planes or as a quick fix, which is what the Backbone has been for me as of late. Admittedly, this is my first Kishi, so perhaps this line of controllers has always been this way. Still, I imagine this is the company’s best swing yet.</p><p>At the end of the day, though, it’s still a mobile gaming controller. If you play a lot of mobile games, there is no better controller than the Kishi V3 Pro, unless you believe fake gamer and also my boss, Kyle Hilliard. If the feeling of gaming via your mobile device has always hampered your desire to do so, this controller could change that, but if mobile gaming just isn’t for you, this controller likely won’t. Nonetheless, the Kishi V3 Pro blows every other mobile controller I’ve tried out of the water. It is the best controller for my iPhone I’ve ever used, and I look forward to taking more of my games (and this controller) with me on the go.</p><p>The Razer Kishi V3 Pro is available starting today for $149.99.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/12/konami-teases-a-remake-of-the-original-silent-hill<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The big news from Konami’s Press Start presentation today is the tease of a new Silent Hill remake. Bloober Team, the developer behind last year’s <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/silent-hill-2/engrossing-and-unsettling">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, is back at the helm and appears to be tackling the first entry in the series.&nbsp;</p><p>Konami announced the game was in development with nothing more than a simple graphic. Although the publisher doesn’t specify which entry is being remade, all signs point to the first Silent Hill, released for the PlayStation in 1999, given that the game’s main theme song plays during the teaser. You can see the teaser at the tail end of the Press Start presentation at the 35:28 mark.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This is likely exciting news for fans; Bloober Team’s remake of Silent Hill 2 was generally well-received, earning an 8.75 out of 10 from <em>Game Informer</em>. It’s unclear when this remake will arrive, given that Bloober Team is currently developing <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/bloober-teams-sci-fi-horror-cronos-the-new-dawn-launches-this-fall">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, slated to launch this fall.&nbsp;</p><p>The first Silent Hill centers on Harry Mason, who searches for his missing adopted daughter in the foggy streets of the eponymous town. The game has no direct narrative connection to its recently remade sequel beyond the setting. If you've never seen Silent Hill in action, you can watch GI editors Kyle Hilliard and Marcus Stewart play the entire game in our six-episode <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/super-replay/2023/01/20/super-replay-silent-hill">Silent Hill Super Replay</a>. Be sure also to check out the latest trailer for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-gets-release-date-alongside-creepy-new-gameplay">Silent Hill f</a>, the series' next mainline entry, which launches on September 25.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World - Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/59bdf11a1b69a/mario-kart-world-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest Japanese boxed charts are here, courtesy of <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/44654">Famitsu</a>, and golly gosh, would you believe it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has stormed to the top with a total of 782,566 copies sold. That's simply incredible.</p>
<p>The next in line is the Switch 1 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> with 45,703 copies sold. Truth be told, we're a little surprised that MK World wasn't immediately followed up by another Switch 2 game, but it seems the vast majority of buyers have opted for Nintendo's latest flagship title and left it at that. There's always digital sales to account for too, of course.</p>
<p>That said, both <strong>Zelda</strong> titles on Switch 2 have made the top ten, along with the Switch 2 version of Rune Factory and, of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>.</p>

<p>With hardware this week, as expected, the Switch 2 is off to a roaring start in Japan, but we weren't prepared for just <em>how</em> successful it would be. The console has sold a whopping 947,931 consoles at launch.</p>
<p>This means that the Switch 2 is comfortably the fastest-selling console in Japan of all time, smashing the previous record of 630,552 set by the almighty PlayStation 2. Similarly, the GBA managed to sell 611,000, the DS 468,000, and the original Switch 330,637.</p>
<p>To put this into further perspective, the Switch 2 has already outsold the Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X Digital Edition, <em>and</em> the PlayStation 5 Pro combined. It's also just about outsold the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition too, though it's still a little way off surpassing the standard disc version.</p>
<p>We imagine these numbers will only continue to skyrocket in the coming weeks, so long as Nintendo maintains decent stock, and frankly we can't wait to see where the Switch 2 ends up by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Here's your look at the latest Japanese hardware sales in full:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-silent-hill-f-deep-dive-digs-into-how-konamis-core-design-concept-of-find-the-beauty-in-terror-drove-the-games-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just last week, Konami announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-launches-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-september-2025-new-gameplay-showcased/">Silent Hill f</a> would arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, on September 25, 2025, and today, during the company's Press Start presentation, we got our latest developed deep-dive from Konami, and a Japanese studio it collaborated with on Silent Hill f, Neobards.</p>
<p>Members from both Konami and Neobards talked about how the teams worked together to evolve the design of Silent Hill f to both keep the essence of a Silent Hill game, while leaning into the fact that the game is not set in the western town of Silent Hill, but in Japan, and is going for a Japanese style of horror story than anything else in the series so far.</p>
<p>"<em>The setting of Silent Hill f has shifted from the town of Silent Hill to Japan,</em>" said Silent Hill series producer at Konami, Motoi Okamoto. "<em>But it remains a psychological horror experience where one confronts themselves within a mental world. Taking into account that it is a psychological horror, we sought to enhance the essence of Japanese-style horror. The hallmark of Japanese horror is not simply grotesqueness, but the coexistence of beauty and the disturbing. We are creating this title with the concept: Find the beauty in terror</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="KONAMI PRESS START 6.12.2025 ( KONAMI Game News )" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI?start=303&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Neobards game director, Al Yang, added, "<em>We created our visual designs to have a distinct uneasiness to them, but also have a horrific charm that would make it so you just couldn't stop staring. In this matter, we were extremely fortunate to be able to work with Kera-san to design our key character art, as their designs perfectly suited the ideal of 'Beauty in Terror'.</em>"</p>

<p>We also heard from the game's scriptwriter, Ryukishi07, who discussed how he connected elements of present-day Japan with how different Japan was in the 1960s, which isn't exactly that long ago but is still very different compared to modern-day Japan.</p>
<p>With Silent Hill f's launch still months away, we'll likely hear and see more about the game before its release, but even now it feels safe to say that this is shaping up to potentially be one of the most terrifying Silent Hill games yet.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f also wasn't the only Silent Hill game featured during Konami's presentation, as the company also announced that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDORsTHAQSs">Bloober Team</a> would be back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">remake the first Silent Hill game</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/686013/razer-kishi-v3-xl-ipad-pro-air-android-hands-on-gaming</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/razer%E2%80%99s-new-mobile-controller-can-stretch-wide-enough-to-fit-an-ipad-pro.1216827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/686013/razer-kishi-v3-xl-ipad-pro-air-android-hands-on-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The iPad Mini is no longer the biggest tablet you can fit into a mobile gaming controller (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment">without breaking it a little</a>). Razer’s new $199.99 Kishi V3 Pro XL can accommodate a 13-inch iPad or Android tablet that uses a USB-C connector. It’s like Razer’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/28/4155606/razer-edge-review">2013 Edge</a>, in spirit at least.</p><p>My 10.9-inch iPad Air is a cinch to fit inside of the Kishi V3 Pro XL, and having even this large of a screen to play on is a treat. How could it not be? Not only that, its speakers sound fantastic for playing games.</p><p>The ability to fit a huge tablet is the key feature of the Kishi V3 Pro XL specifically, but it shares other gen-to-gen improvements with the smaller, cheaper Kishi V3 options in the lineup: the $99.99 V3 and $149.99 V3 Pro. Razer says that the Kishi V3’s design was inspired by its own Wolverine V3 Pro Xbox controller (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025443/best-xbox-controllers-one-series-x-s">our pick for the best alternative to the Xbox Elite Series 2</a>), which was clear to me as I got some gaming time in with the XL.</p><p>All the controllers in the Kishi V3 lineup include full-size <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR joysticks</a> (with swappable caps), which use magnets instead of physical contacts for registering inputs, and thus aren’t prone to stick drift. The controller grips are more pronounced and are covered in an etched texture to keep them snug in your hands. The pair of configurable macro buttons near the triggers from prior Kishi models are present in the Kishi V3 Pro XL, along with a new second pair around the rear of the grips. The V3 Pro and V3 Pro XL support haptics, but only on Android, or when connected to a computer via USB-C cable (not included).</p><p>I had a great time testing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/676167/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-test-hands-on">GeForce Now on the Steam Deck</a>, so I wanted to take advantage of the Kishi V3 Pro XL to try it on an iPad’s larger screen. Not that it’s Razer’s fault, but it’s more difficult to get GeForce Now running on an iPad, since Apple’s App Store policies require streaming experiences to run through a browser, not through their own dedicated apps.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Once I got it running, the game window fit the iPad’s aspect ratio almost perfectly, save for small black bars on the left and right sides of the screen in landscape mode. This won’t be an issue if your tablet has a 16:9 aspect ratio. Despite my fast internet speeds, visual quality looked worse on the iPad Air than it does on the Steam Deck OLED. That could be because the iPad has a much larger screen and a significantly higher resolution that make it a lot easier to see visual artifacts in a cloud streaming session. Still, latency felt good enough that I could complete parries in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc"><em>Expedition 33: Clair Obscur</em></a>.</p><p>The moment the Kishi V3 Pro XL clicked with me was when I launched Razer’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646810/razer-pc-remote-play-ios-android-game-streaming">somewhat-new PC Remote Play experience</a>. It performs really well, if you’re okay with installing Razer apps on your PC. You’ll need Razer Cortex, which lets you run games on your PC and stream them to your handheld. Cortex makes the feed look fantastic, taking full advantage of the iPad’s screen resolution. Steam’s Link app works just fine, too, and it’s a convenient option if you’re accustomed to using a Steam Deck since it has a similar interface.</p><p>With my iPad Air installed, the Kishi V3 Pro XL setup weighs about 1.7 pounds, which is over a fourth of a pound heavier than the Steam Deck OLED, and just a touch heavier than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/684247/xbox-ally-x-hands-on-gears-of-war-reloaded">new Xbox ROG Ally handheld</a>. It’s a little too cumbersome to hold comfortably with one hand, even if just for a moment to itch my shoulder. I assumed this would be the case, though it’s worth keeping in mind if you have an even bigger tablet than me. Still, it’s a comfortable two-handed experience if you’re hunkered down on the couch.</p><p>The Kishi V3Pro XL has less direct competition than the rest of the Kishi V3 lineup. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/661382/the-new-backbone-pro-could-be-the-one-controller-for-all-your-gaming">Backbone’s </a>$169.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/661382/the-new-backbone-pro-could-be-the-one-controller-for-all-your-gaming">Pro</a> controller doesn’t attempt to fit devices larger than a phone. But unlike the Kishi V3 series, it can be used as a standalone Bluetooth controller for your other devices — including tablets — when a phone isn’t wedged into it. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24187539/gamesir-g8-bluetooth-mobile-controller-ios-android-nintendo-switch-pc">GameSir G8 Plus</a> is a cheaper option at $79.99, and can stretch to fit an iPad Mini or the original Nintendo Switch, but it can’t fit a full-sized iPad like the Kishi V3 Pro XL can. </p><p>While I’m not thrilled with the $199.99 price, there’s an audience that’s been asking for something like the Kishi V3 Pro XL to exist and will probably pay for it. It’s a great way to use your tablet as a console-like gaming device, putting its screen and speakers front and center. As for me, I’m thrilled to have more fun things to do with my iPad Air instead of using it exclusively as a Ms. Rachel device for our one year old (no shade to Ms. Rachel).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deltarune-has-a-hidden-message-on-playstation-for-anyone-who-manages-to-earn-no-trophies-at-all.1216821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-has-a-hidden-message-on-playstation-for-anyone-who-manages-to-earn-no-trophies-at-all<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Deltarune chapters 3 and 4 out last week, players have been eagerly mining the new episodes for more of Toby Fox's characteristic secrets and mysterious plot threads. In the process, they've found an absolutely fascinating bit of dialogue that's almost impossible to get, as it requires beating all four chapters of Deltarune on PlayStation without earning a single trophy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warning: While this article won't spoil any of the major plot moments of Deltarune, it will talk in vague terms about some of the more common and low/no-spoiler trophy achievements. If you're someone who doesn't want to know a single piece of information about Deltarune before going in, probably better skip this one!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As shared by Reddit user millsbuddy, there's a special, hidden bit of dialogue that appears in Deltarune Chapter 4's credits sequence if, and only if, the player has completed all four chapters without earning a single trophy. This allegedly checks the player's PSN account, so if you try to get this text, fail by accidentally getting a trophy, delete your file and try again, no luck. You still have the trophy, so it won't appear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is an even more ridiculous task than it sounds on its face, as some of the achievements are so laughably easy to get that you're almost certainly going to get at least a few by accident just through playing normally. There are achievements for taking damage a certain number of times, for using or equiping items, for getting a Game Over, equipping armor, opening too many treasure chests, interacting with chairs, and a lot more. Some achievements have multiple possible triggers. There are also four achievements simply obtained by completing a chapter, but you can avoid getting those by finding a certain secret item in each chapter that will nullify the achievement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trophies were added to Deltarune with the addition of Chapters 3 and 4 last week, but they're PlayStation-exclusive. Fox <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/release-date/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted in a newsletter</a> that this was because trophies were a requirement to shipping a paid game on PlayStation, and alluded to the challenge of finding this special text in his announcement:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were required to have TROPHIES! This time, they give rise to a pretty hard-core challenge. But - and PLEASE listen - I make no endorsement that you actually attempt it! Even knowing of its mere existence will only bring you frustration and anguish! Honestly, it may be one of the worst ideas I've ever had. Perhaps no one will even try. Maybe that's for the best after all... I think it will be too late for most of you anyway..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the vast majority of us who either aren't playing on PlayStation or like retaining our sanity, here's the text that appears when you accompish this. <strong>WARNING: If you consider this text a spoiler, don't keep reading below the trailer!</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><blockquote>INTERESTING.</blockquote><blockquote>YOU FAILED</blockquote><blockquote>TO ACHIEVE</blockquote><blockquote>ANY MARKS.</blockquote><blockquote>WHAT</blockquote><blockquote>ARE</blockquote><blockquote>YOU?</blockquote><blockquote>"(playername)"</blockquote><blockquote>I VERY MUCH</blockquote><blockquote>LOOK FORWARD</blockquote><blockquote>TO THE NEXT.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">This text seems to be spoken by the same voice that addresses the player in the opening of the game and in a few other places, as well as the same voice that speaks in the end credits with a different message if you finish under any other conditions. Fans, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._D._Gaster" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have plenty of theories on who this is</a>, but we'll leave that to the community for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With chapters 3 and 4 finally out, we've reviewed Deltarune so far, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">giving it a 9/10</a> and saying that its "incredible story is already bursting with hilarious charm, unforgettable characters, and an iconic soundtrack that make it worth investing your time in," even though its story is only halfway done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The developer has now issued a statement, saying it is "heartbroken" over the game's difficulties.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy’s debut title came out on June 10 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam. On Valve’s platform, it currently has a ‘mixed’ user review rating, with most of the complaints revolving around performance issues, bugs and glitches, broken AI, and game crashes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players have reported gaining refunds — even from the notoriously stubborn Sony — rekindling memories of Cyberpunk 2077’s disastrous launch back in 2020. CD Projekt's game was eventually pulled from sale on the PlayStation Store, but there is no indication yet that MindsEye will suffer a similar fate.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">PlayStation is allowing refunds for MindsEye <a href="https://t.co/zzaHbNt3ET" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/zzaHbNt3ET</a> <a href="https://t.co/KclpMTwSJi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KclpMTwSJi</a></p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1933152235417939985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, streamers are saying they received requests to postpone their sponsored MindsEye livestreams, some last minute. As spotted by Kotaku's Ethan Gach, popular streamer CohhCarnage revealed this happened to him just as he was about to begin a sponsored MindsEye livestream:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>MindsEye dev canceled Twitch streamer CohhCarnage's playthrough of the game seconds before it was supposed to start.</p><p>He said it was the first time that had ever happened in his streaming career. <a href="https://t.co/KOjyQ8ml21" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KOjyQ8ml21</a></p></div>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1932892473249992746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“For the first time in my streaming career, I changed my title for a sponsored stream, I put in a profile button, I put in the command, that was at eight o'clock sharp — my sponsored stream was supposed to start at eight — I opened up MindsEye, and as it was loading, my management contacted me and said, ‘The sponsor does not want to do this right now, they would like to reschedule.’ And I said, ‘Oh, that’s a first.’ So the sponsor decided not to do the sponsorship for now, and honestly, it sounds like for MindsEye that was the right decision.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another streamer, DarkViperAU, couldn't even make it through their sponsored MindsEye livestream without breaking down in tears of laughter.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Sponsored MindsEye streamer can't keep it together when telling viewers where they can buy the game. <a href="https://t.co/kdR3EuGims" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/kdR3EuGims</a></p>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1932816433425395799?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In response to the chaos of the past 24 hours, Build A Rocket Boy issued a statement on its Discord, addressing MindsEye’s community and the game's various issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are heartbroken that not every player was able to experience the game as we intended,” the statement began. “Our priority is optimizing performance and stability so that every player, across every device, can enjoy an equally high-quality experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our teams have worked tirelessly throughout the night to solve many of these issues, and we have now identified that the vast majority of crashes were caused by a memory leak. This impacted roughly 1 in 10 of our players. We have developed a hotfix that addresses this issue (alongside other issues that our players have highlighted), which we are working hard to deploy as soon as tomorrow on PC and on consoles once it passes certification with PlayStation and Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are fully committed to ensuring all our players have a great experience, and we will continue to provide frequent and transparent updates. We will do our best to respond to all your comments and feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you for playing MindsEye. Thank you for your understanding and continued support – it truly means the world to us. We’re grateful and blessed to have you on the journey with us.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy then outlined the hotfix schedule for the coming weeks. By the end of June, it said, players can expect ongoing performance and stability improvements, a rebalanced ‘hard’ difficulty setting, animation fixes, and AI improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It remains to be seen whether Build A Rocket Boy can turn MindsEye around following this troubled start. While Steam concurrent player numbers do not paint the whole picture of a game's success, particularly single-player games, they do provide us with an idea of a game's popularity on Steam's platform. On Steam, MindsEye has a peak concurrent player count of 3,302.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

No release date was mentioned. For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-press-start-live-june-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Konami Press Start Live June 2025</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In February, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-developer-bloober-signs-deal-for-another-game-for-konami-could-it-be-more-silent-hill">Bloober Team announced it had signed a deal with Konami</a> to make a new game based on the Japanese company’s IP, following the successful release of the Silent Hill 2 remake. Now we know it was for a remake of the first Silent Hill game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill exploded onto the scene in 1999 on the PlayStation as a Resident Evil rival from Konami. It established the series’ trademark fog-filled visuals, third-person viewpoint, and the eerie town of Silent Hill itself. It sees Harry Mason searching for his missing adopted daughter, Cheryl — and all manner of horrible things along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Silent Hill 2 remake has sold 2 million copies, so it’s no surprise to see Konami greenlight another remake in the series. And it is no surprise to see the first game get the remake treatment next. In an IGN poll, over 61% of the 20,000 voters picked Silent Hill as the Silent Hill game Konami should remake next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb from Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno, issued back in February:</p><blockquote>Konami, a legendary name in the gaming industry, sought a partner who could breathe new life into one of its most iconic franchises — Silent Hill. Bloober Team was selected for their expertise in horror and atmospheric storytelling, and in 2021, both companies signed a partnership agreement. In October 2022, during the official Silent Hill Transmission livestream, it was announced that Bloober Team was working on a remake of Silent Hill 2, widely regarded as one of the best psychological horror games in history.</blockquote><blockquote>The success of the remake proved that Bloober Team had perfectly captured the atmosphere and depth of the original while introducing crucial innovations. The game was well-received by players, earning an 86/100 rating on Metacritic and an 88/100 on OpenCritic, along with numerous awards, including Game of the Year 2024 from IGN Japan and Best Horror Game of the Year from the IGN Community Awards.</blockquote><blockquote>The trust built upon the success of Silent Hill 2 laid the foundation for signing another agreement for a new project. The deal aligns with Bloober Team’s strategic plan to expand its internal development division within a first-party framework.</blockquote><blockquote>Our collaboration with Konami has been incredibly fruitful, and the success of Silent Hill 2 speaks for itself. By sharing knowledge and experience, we have been able to create high-quality production together. Of course, we can't reveal too many details at this time, but we are confident that fans will be just as excited about our collaboration as we are. We can't wait to share something truly special with players when the time is right.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill 2 remake went on sale on PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam on October 8, 2024 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-console-exclusive-to-ps5-for-1-year"><u>there’s no word on an Xbox Series X and S version</u></a> yet), and just a few days later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week"><u>had sold 1 million copies</u></a>. This was thought to have made Silent Hill 2 remake the fastest-selling Silent Hill game ever, but Konami has yet to rubber stamp that potential record.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review"><u>Silent Hill 2 remake review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sales success of the Silent Hill 2 remake has clearly strengthened Konami’s plans for the franchise, which have ramped up significantly in recent years. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f"><u>Silent Hill f</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-townfall"><u>Silent Hill: Townfall</u></a> are both still in the works. Now we have Silent Hill remake. There's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-movie-first-look-pyramid-head"><u>a film adaptation of Silent Hill 2</u></a> coming, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Dispatch Is A Superhero Logistics Game]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/dispatch-demo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-is-a-superhero-logistics-game.1216809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dispatch-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m not really into superhero stories–as a tedious literalist, they often feel like metaphors for human struggles when I’d rather just watch regular people deal with that stuff. But the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam demo</a> for <em>Dispatch </em>is light on the parts of superhero media I like the least, instead focusing on learning the ropes of a new job, if that new job involved sending superheroes out to fight crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Dispatch </em>follows Robert Robertson, a superhero who inadvertently destroyed his mechanical suit and has now been relegated to a desk job at the Superhero Dispatch Network, where he sends other heroes out on rescues. The members of his team have all committed crimes, and they’re all hostile to the whole setup, as well as to Robert. Alongside all this city-saving and superpowers, Robert deals with regular new job problems, like meeting his coworkers, office bathroom etiquette, and his own feelings about being behind-the-scenes instead of on the front lines.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dispatch | Official Demo Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LJt-4YgRAng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Dispatch</em> is made by AdHoc Studio, which contains folks who previously worked on games like <em>The Walking Dead </em>and <em>Tales From The Borderlands</em>. That pedigree shows through in the game’s quippy dialogue, though the demo is refreshingly largely free of the Whedonspeak that plagues the superhero genre. There are also some dialogue choice moments and even a “so-and-so will remember that” that hints at deeper relationships.</p><p>The dispatching aspect of the job takes place on Robert’s computer, where crimes pop up on a map of the city. You get a description of the mission–a hero is needed to climb a tree to get a kid’s balloon, and also not make the child cry–and then you have to pick which of your heroes would be best for the job based on a visualization of their stats. Picking the right hero to send is then a little puzzle of parsing the call’s description: in the balloon case, you'd want someone with good mobility to climb the tree, but also good charisma to handle the child. Once the mission is complete, you’re shown a visualization of the stat distribution the mission actually required, and you see how well your chosen hero’s stats lined up. If enough of your hero’s stat shape overlaps with the mission’s, you succeed.</p><figure></figure><p>This is made more complicated as more calls pop up, necessitating waiting for characters to return from missions and rest up before you can send them out again. At a couple points in the demo I didn’t have the best person for the job available, so just had to send someone and hope for the best. There’s also a pretty simple hacking minigame, and characters also have special attributes that didn’t figure too much into my demo experience but will surely play a role in the full game: characters who get stat boosts if they’re alone, a character who transforms into a monster and reverses some of his stats after coming back from a job.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a lot to cram into a very short demo, much of which is taken up by table-setting dialogue about Robert’s backstory and the other characters at the Network. Being thrown into the deep end of the gameplay was a good way to get a sense of what <em>Dispatch</em> actually is, but also felt for me like a lot to take in at once. The lack of clarity regarding what stats a mission requires is a good way to keep the dispatching from just being some kind of fancied-up matching game, but a little more visual clarity might also help to keep things from feeling too much like guesswork and keep track of your team's stats better. But trying to make decisions with limited information and remember the details of your team, all while new calls pop up and Robert’s team argues with him and each other in the background, is hectic in an enjoyable way.</p><p>Currently, to replay the dispatching you’ll have to restart the demo and sit through the (well-written and well-acted) cutscenes again, something I hope the demo tweaks if it stays up past the current Steam Next Fest. I’d like to see if I could do better on my calls, managing my team more efficiently and making better decisions on the calls that require more hands-on participation than just choosing who to send. I’m intrigued by what <em>Dispatch</em> is shaping up to be, and the demo definitely got me excited to see more of it. It’s set for a 2025 release.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-the-veilguard-electronic-arts-sales-layoffs"><h3>Good Day To Everyone Except The Senior Management At Electronic Arts</h3></a><p>'The team was asked to change the game’s fundamental structure and recast the entire story on the fly'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-indie-games-summer-game-fest-2025"><h3>Seven Cool Video Games I Saw During (Well, After) Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>From LEGO to bicycles to...whatever the Yakuza guys are doing next</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-lost-save-game-pass"><h3>My Lies Of P Save File Is Dead And I Am Full Of Regret</h3></a><p>I love Lies of P, but trying to play Lies of P: Overture became a cautionary tale about Game Pass and personal data archiving.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>The game's director said he's been dreaming of making a game like this since he was a child.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There were all kinds of games on display at Summer Game Fest 2025: scary games, thrilling games, funny games, but only one game was making everyone cry. I played a demo of the game alongside the developers, and I won't pretend otherwise: It messed me up, too. The incredibly moving experience came from my time with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/out-of-words/" data-ref-id="5000-681510">Out of Words</a>, the debut from the creative team of Kong Orange and WiredFly. In speaking with the team, I was incredibly moved by their emotional maturity and thoughtfulness. Out of Words is an adorable co-op puzzle-platformer, but more than that, it's an exercise in heart-on-your-sleeve vulnerability.</p><p dir="ltr">"I am a bit of a romantic," game director Johan Oettinger told me, describing the relationship between the game's playable characters, Karla and Kurt. Typically, "they can talk about anything. But they find themselves in a moment in their relationship with something new in the air." But sadly, Oettinger added, "they can't find the words" to say how they feel. Out of Words is a coming-of-age love story about the things we want to say but don't know how.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzA43ZQJ3Q" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HSzA43ZQJ3Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Something is in the way of them being honest with each other, and that premise, combined with Oettinger's soft-spoken way of speaking about this game he clearly loves so much, was already getting me pretty misty before I even played. It was like I'd walked into a poetry reading where, by chance, a demo of a gorgeous, stop-motion animated video game was also taking place.</p><p dir="ltr">"I love stop-motion," Oettinger told me, admitting it's like the "extreme sport of animation" due to how unforgiving it is. He explained to me that creating this game had been his dream since he was 11 years old, when he played The Neverhood, a 1996 stop-motion animated game developed in collaboration with Stephen Spielberg's Dreamworks. "All the cinematics [of Out of Words] are fully stop-motion, animated frame by frame in front of a camera. And everything in the world is also handcrafted. Every element you see, every picture you see, has literally been touched by a human being. The grass, the strings are cut out of paper with scissors. The little cliffs and surfaces and books are cut up and 3D-scanned, the surface of the water is cellophane, and so on."</p><p dir="ltr">As players explore the world, searching for the words to say what they need to say, they'll come to find the true antagonist: "doubt itself," as Oettinger put it. The mechanics of the game will change often to reflect the story. In a portion I played, Kurt and Karla had to learn to trust each other, sharing possession of a light that would help them float above gaps. At first we stumbled, vanishing into pits of darkness with every mistake. But soon, we were able to pass the light back and forth with dance-like chemistry, catching each other with well-choreographed trust falls. Whatever shape the gameplay takes as the story goes on, it's meant to be approachable for players of all skill levels. "The dream is that you're able to play with your child, or your non-gamer partner, your non-gamer parents, take them on this journey with you," game design lead Jeff Sparks told me.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Art, for me, has to be deeply personal. That's where it gets honest, when it comes from personal experience.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Morten Søndergaard, the game's poet--yes, that's his actual job title--met Oettinger in 2012, and the pair bonded over similar experiences and a shared vision. "I always wanted to make language something tangible," Søndergaard said. "I'm a little dyslexic, actually, and so I keep bumping into language. Language is something that bumps into me, and I bump into it. Meeting Johann and starting the work on Out of Words was a dream come true, to be able to be <em>in </em>language. [Karla and Kurt] are in language. And so they are going <em>through </em>language. And I think language is a trust system in a way, and language is also a game. Language is something we play with, 'play on words' and all that. So, it all comes together in this symphony of emotion."</p><p dir="ltr">"When Martin came to me with the idea of, 'Wouldn't it be cool to fall <em>into </em>language?' I fell in love, not only with Morton, but also with that idea," Oettinger added, "because I am dyslexic myself, and we've combined this with my love of coming-of-age and stop-motion, and it turned into the game I've been dreaming about making. I want to make something that, if I found this as an 11-year-old dyslexic boy, it could just show me, 'Okay, this is how language can be. It's not something a belittling teacher is trying to push into you.' Then I would have discovered so many things I love much earlier, and it would have opened my world. I could say to my mother, 'Look, mom, let's play this together. This is why I love games.'"</p><p dir="ltr">The room was getting weepy by this point, and the team had told me crying had been a running theme of Summer Game Fest in the Out of Words booth. Oettinger shared a touching example from earlier in the day where he was explaining the game to a translator who would then translate his words into Japanese for their colleague, and the translator couldn't help but cry as they reshaped the words, which to me seemed sweetly similar to what the game is trying to do itself; through this transformation came raw emotion.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4512361" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4512361"></a><figcaption>Out of Words has been in development for years, but the game's director told GameSpot it's actually been his dream to make this game for most of his life.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Everyone was being so sincere and vulnerable, and it was quite unlike any video game demo I've ever been a part of, to be totally forthcoming. I believe emotional vulnerability is the purest form of beauty. When people, especially two people together, can open themselves up to potentially be hurt but are instead rewarded for their honesty with the other person's empathy and acceptance, it's one of the most extraordinary things that can happen to us as human beings. I'm elated to see a game taking on this idea with such a delicate hand and artful eye. Suffice it to say, by the time my 40 minutes with the team was nearing its end, I knew it would go down as one of my favorite experiences I've had in my career.</p><p dir="ltr">"Art, for me, has to be deeply personal. That's where it gets honest, when it comes from personal experience. I mean, the moment there," Oettinger said, pointing to an image of the main characters, "I think we all have our story of that moment where we can't find the words. And in my case, a girl is standing there in front of me, and Karla is, of course, based on that girl from when I was that age, Sarah, and maybe that's a little Johan," he hinted, "and I lost her. She was my best friend. In that moment where I couldn't find the words, what if I could fix the inner language, and then I could say what I wanted?"</p><p dir="ltr">Out of Words comes out in 2026 on Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Co-op will be playable locally or online with cross-play, making it easy to bring the Kurt or Karla from your own life into the game with you.</p>

                <p>MindsEye, the new action game from former Rockstar veteran Leslie Benzies' new studio, launched this week but left a lot to be desired due to technical and performance issues.

            <p>The team at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> studio Build A Rocket Boy is "heartbroken that not every player was able to experience the game as we intended," it has said, promising more fixes throughout June.</p>
<p>MindsEye released earlier this week, however it wasn't the smoothest of launches. Many found themselves presented with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">distorting character bugs and stuttering issues when they booted up the game</a>. Build A Rocket Boy released a statement yesterday, when it said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-hotfix-planned-for-pc-this-week-but-console-players-may-have-to-wait">would be prioritising gameplay performance with an update</a>.</p>
<p>"Our teams have worked tirelessly throughout the night to solve many of these issues, and we have now identified that the vast majority of crashes were caused by a memory leak," the developer has since shared on the MindsEye Discord, adding roughly one in 10 players were impacted.</p>

<p>"We have developed a hotfix that addresses this issue (alongside other issues that our players have highlighted), which we are working hard to deploy as soon as tomorrow on PC and on consoles once it passes certification with PlayStation and Xbox," it continued, stating the team is "fully committed to ensuring all players have a great experience".</p>

<p>MindsEye has had an unusual lead up to launch, it has to be said. At the end of May, the studio's co-CEO suggested the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio"> game's negative reaction up until that point had been paid for in a "concerted effort" against the developer</a>.

			<p>Suikoden STAR LEAP, the first canon entry in the series in a very long time, is launching on PC as well as on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>During today's Press Start showcase, Konami confirmed the next entry in the role-playing game series, which returned to the spotlight earlier this year with the launch of a remaster of the first two games released on PlayStation decades ago, is launching on Steam as well as on mobile platforms. Besides confirming the game's Steam release, Konami also shared a brand new trailer providing more information on the story set a few years before the events of the original Suikoden and only a few years after Suikoden V, the latest main entry in the series. You can check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="KONAMI PRESS START 6.12.2025 ( KONAMI Game News )" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI?start=978&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Suikoden STAR LEAP was officially announced back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/suikoden-series-revival-continues-with-new-canon-mobile-game-animated-series/">March</a> as a new mobile entry in the series. Besides sporting beautiful 2D graphics over 3D backgrounds inspired by the first entries in the series, the game will also see the return of plenty of fan-favorite characters like Viktor, Flik, and Odessa.

Mode director Yu Sahara, who’s worked on <em>Metal Gear </em>in the past, distinguished it from <em>Metal Gear Online</em>, a multiplayer spin-off of <em>Metal Gear Solid 4 </em>that featured tactical stealth takes on traditional scenarios like team deathmatch and capture the flag.</p><p>“The landscape of multiplayer games has changed a lot,” he said during the livestream. Indeed it has, but the most appealing about Metal Gear getting multiplayer again is how old-school it might end up feeling compared to the current glut of extraction shooters, battle royales,and battle passes. Here’s a quick teaser from the showcase:</p><p>Instead of bringing that back, Sahara and the team at Konami worked on updating what <em>Metal Gear Online </em>might look like decades later. The focus will still be on camouflage and staying hidden before choosing the right time to go after an objective or surprise an opponent, and footage in a brief teaser showed characters getting into what look like small D-Walker-type mechs on the battlefield. Also lots of operatives crawling around in leaf shrouds. </p><p>Konami didn’t have anything else to reveal about the mode other than it will be arriving with the rest of <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em> at launch on August 28. In addition to Fox Hunt, the remake also features a Snake vs. Bomberman mode and one where he has to round-up monkeys from Ape Escape. Despite the new content, however, much of the base game appears to be an exceedingly faithful retread of the 2000s-era stealth thriller, just with modern controls and other tweaks to make it more approachable for new audiences. The original is still available to play as part of the <em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection</em> released back in 2023. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

During the Konami Press Start showcase, the company announced that a goofier side of Metal Gear Solid will return, as the Secret Theater bonus feature will be included in the upcoming game. Not only will it feature all of the classic cutscenes from Snake Eater, but several new ones have been created for it as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXaDgU72gRI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="204">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI?start=204" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you're unfamiliar with it, Secret Theater was originally an unlockable extra in Snake Eater that reimagined the endings to several cutscenes. These ranged from Snake causing a time paradox to legendary sniper The End falling in love with Eva, and the videos were originally only made for the eyes of Snake Eater's production team.</p><p>These short clips were eventually placed on the official Snake Eater website, and several more were created thanks to them being popular with fans. The original videos will be found as collectibles inside the game, and for the new Secret Theater videos, players will have to track down enemy soldiers carrying rolls of film on their uniforms.</p><p>Konami also revealed a few more extras that'll be in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater when it launches on August 28, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-fox-hunt-brings-back-online-multiplayer/1100-6532384/">like a new online multiplayer mode called Fox Hunt</a>, an Ape Escape crossover on PC and PS5, and a Snake vs. Bomberman mode that'll be exclusive to the Xbox Series X|S version of the game.</p>

            <p>As we suspected, but couldn't say 100 percent for sure until now, Bomberman has been confirmed for the Xbox version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Konami released an Xbox-specific trailer for its upcoming remake of the 2004 game. And, while those on PS5 and Steam versions of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be able to partake in a spot of 'Snake vs Monkey', where they have to capture the Pipo Monkeys, we now know Xbox users will instead square off with Bomberman.</p>
<p>"Snake vs Bomberman for Xbox Series X/S," reads the trailer's blurb. "Take control of Snake and face off with Bomberman in this special side mode. Blast 'em away in each stage!" You can have a watch below.</p>

<p>As well as this Bomberman confirmation, earlier today Konami also announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-taking-hide-and-go-seek-to-the-next-level-with-original-multiplayer-mode">"completely original" online multiplayer mode coming to Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, known as Fox Hunt.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-announced">initially revealed back in 2023</a>. It retains the 2004 original's story - which follows Naked Snake on an operation deep within the Soviet jungle, some 31 years before the events of Metal Gear.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-being-remade-as-konami-says-younger-generation-now-unfamiliar-with-the-series">remake has been done with future generations in mind</a>, series producer Noriaki Okamura said in an interview last year. "It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations," Okamura said. "After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say - but again, who is Solid Snake?"</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-announced-complete-with-a-butt-slapping-ape-escape-monkey">scheduled for release on 28th August</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Black...like a doll's eyes</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/poppy_playtime_chapter_1">Poppy Playtime</a> is one of those strange video game phenomenon, in this writer's experience at least, that seems to be a pretty big hit with younger players, even though it's a proper creepy-ass horror game. There are toys of this franchise everywhere, and we've even got a movie on the way. And, it has the vibe of something that's fallen out of Roblox, too.</p>
<p>It'll come as some very good news to fans of Mob Entertainment's series, then, that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/poppy_playtime_chapter_4">Poppy Playtime Chapter 4</a> (the 4th chapter in the Poppy Playtime saga lest you're confused) drops onto consoles - including that there Nintendo Switch - on <strong>June 25th</strong>.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Poppy Playtime, you see, is set in an abandoned toy factory that's full of very nasty toys who are set on making life unsettling for you, a factory worker who needs to get the heck out of there. Cue lots of creepy doll stuff that probably isn't really all that suitable for young kids, actually.</p>

<p>This 4th entry, entitled "Safe Haven" continues the nightmare, with a fairly large cast of characters to meet as you work through its puzzles and utilise its gadgets.</p>
<p>Chapters 1-3 of Poppy Playtime have been well received by players over time, and although this 4th chapter has already been released to somewhat disappointing (in comparison) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008670/Poppy_Playtime__Chapter_4/">reviews on PC</a>, there's still been enough love that we're sure fans will be very interested in picking it up.</p>
<p>Now, that June 25th release date gives us just enough time to get some clean underwear in, as we're actually fairly terrified of some of the dead-eyed, ghoulish toys in the game's fresh new console launch trailer...</p>

			<p>A remake of the first entry in the Silent Hill series is in development by Bloober Team, Konami confirmed today.</p>
<p>During the Press Start showcase, the Japanese company shared a brief trailer, which confirmed that a new entry in the series is in the works by the Polish development studio that masterfully remade the second entry in the series last year. As if the trailer's music didn't give it away, the Silent Hill official Japanese X profile confirmed that the game Bloober Team is working on is indeed the remake of the first entry in the series, which launched on the first PlayStation back in 1999.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="ja">『SILENT HILL』リメイク制作中</p>
<p>1999年にPlayStationにて発売した『SILENT HILL 』のリメイクをBloober Teamと制作しています。</p>

<p>— SILENT HILL (@silenthill_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/silenthill_jp/status/1933156514614988898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Given how Bloober Team has handled the Silent Hill 2 remake, there's no doubt the Polish studio will do one of the best survival horror games ever released justice, hopefully bringing the classic to the modern day without doing away with what makes it so endearing still to this day. You can learn how Bloober managed to do so for the second entry in the series by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mixtape-preview-bygone-era-captured-beautifully</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mixtape-preview-%E2%80%93-a-bygone-era-captured-beautifully.1216731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mixtape-preview-bygone-era-captured-beautifully<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mixtape </em>is the perfect encapsulation of the wonderfully weird feelings of growing up, standing on the edge and looking at the fall to adulthood. Every frame is gorgeous, every emotion powerfully evocative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As is no surprise, <em>Mixtape </em>is designed around music. You play one of three teenage friends who are determined to make their last night together one they’ll never forget. Each track of the tape is announced with a key frame showing the song and the artist before it starts playing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Growing Up is Weird and Wonderful</h2>

<p>Preparing for that last night together, each one of those tracks from the eponymous mixtape sends you off into a memory of some formative event in growing up. Each memory is lovely and powerfully relatable, ranging from a first kiss to running from the cops crashing a house party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In essence, <em>Mixtape </em>is a John Hughes film made in the modern age through the medium of video games. It’s about the awkwardness of growing up, the sadness of leaving things behind, and the rebellious attitude of youth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one, you remember your first kiss. In silhouette, your character leans in to get a kiss from a boy who she doesn’t much care for but wanted to get her first kiss out of the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cut to an insanely detailed set of teeth and tongues. Each thumbstick controls its own tongue as the writhe, slap, and slither together. It is awkward, hilarious, and a perfect way to show just how weird it all can be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every memory is a little story told about their lives that is a great window into the era the game is portraying. Quick cuts to static images doodled on in the background, like MTV, and flourishes of art are everywhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simply put, <em>Mixtape </em>has a stellar aesthetic that is impeccably drawn together. It is extremely effective.</p>

<h2>Mixtape's Visual, Sound, and Gameplay Design Come Together Perfectly</h2>

<p>Even just the visual design of the neighborhoods and the roads the characters skate on works. There is an authentic realism to them that fits the somewhat cartoonish characters that inhabit it very well.</p>

<p>The opening scene sees you and your friends skating down a huge hill, each of you yelling out "Car!" when one is coming to avoid it, while leaves litter the ground and the greenery passes you by. It is a beautiful introduction into the world, and the lighting ties it all together into one of the better looking stretches of games in memory.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, seeing as all of the memories and the game is named after a mixtape, the tracks fit the moods of whatever is going on perfectly. <em>Mixtape </em>features a huge list of amazing artist, like&nbsp;The Smashing Pumpkins, the Cure, DEVO, Iggy Pop, and a whole lot more.</p>

<p>Obviously, the music is great in and of itself, but a lot of thought and care has been put into making sure each track enhances what we see and play on screen. Gaming's best moments are when gameplay, visuals, and sound all come together as one, and <em>Mixtape </em>is designed to hit you over the head with that again and again as we move from track to track down memory lane.</p>

<h2>Mixtape Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>My brief preview of <em>Mixtape </em>makes me confident in saying that it will be the best coming of age story put to video games that I can think of. It’s a classic story of teenagers moving through the world as they try to figure it out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can’t wait to soak it all in and vibe with a soundtrack that will transport me to a past I may never have experienced, but it’s one that everyone will relate to. If I had to guess, I imagine there will be a fair few people that find many aspects of it eerily biographical.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/postal-2-remake-postal-2-redux</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/postal-2-remake-postal-2-redux-announced-for-pc-and-consoles.1216728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/postal-2-remake-postal-2-redux<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Team Beef, as well as publishers Flat2VR Studios and Running With Scissors, have announced&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux</em>, a ground-up remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Postal 2&nbsp;</em>that's hitting Kickstarter sometime later this summer.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>will serve as "part modernization, part love-letter". It'll utilize the Unity engine, rather than the original's "creaking Unreal 1.5 engine", and it'll boast a host of other improvements and tweaks besides.</p>

<p>Team Beef and Flat2VR say the goal with&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>is to "deliver the ultimate, no-excuse&nbsp;<em>Postal 2&nbsp;</em>sandbox". The game's world will apparently be "rebuilt with no limits, ready for every screen you own, and still happy to let you finish your errands with a shovel".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/postal-2-redux-welcome-to-paradise.jpg?itok=loAxe-3o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/postal-2-redux-welcome-to-paradise.jpg?itok=7fz_DlFK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>modernizes the 2003 original, and it's coming to Kickstarter this summer.</figcaption></figure><p>Improvements offered by&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>include modernized visuals, with the game's textures and lighting both getting a Unity-powered glow-up (quite literally, in the latter case).</p>

<p>Additionally, you can expect a world with "zero" loading times, as well as smarter crowd AI with "improved pathfinding", new weapon and explosion physics, and "fully propped, breakable interiors". Not only that, but lovable dog Champ is also getting a "Champ 2.0" overhaul.</p>

<p>The three studios say that&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>is aiming to land on "every modern box that'll boot", including the Switch 2, by the sounds of things. Notably, the list of platforms doesn't include the Xbox One, so hopefully, you've upgraded to a Series X|S if you want to play&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux</em>.</p>

<p>Whether or not the game does come to all of those platforms, however, will be dependent on how the upcoming <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postal2redux/postal-2-redux" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> performs. Despite that, however, Team Beef's Grant Bagwell says the campaign is just an opportunity to "shove even more nonsense in", so it seems the game will happen either way.</p>




<p>This remake follows in the footsteps of 2016's&nbsp;<em>Postal Redux</em>, albeit handled by a different development team to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/postal-redux-review-no-return-address" rel="nofollow">that game</a>. It'll also technically serve as the seventh full game in the&nbsp;<em>Postal&nbsp;</em>franchise (not counting mobile games and joke titles, of course).</p>

<p><em>Postal 2 Redux</em>'s Kickstarter campaign begins later this year, although we don't have a concrete date for it yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

You can give them a peep on the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958130/Jurassic_World_Evolution_3/">Steam page</a>, where they’re revealed as a refreshingly light list of relatively attainable cards 'n' chips, with a mere 25GB storage requirement – a welcome bucking of recent trends for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-best-settings-pc-performance">100GB-plus</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-hope-youve-got-a-spare-190gb-kicking-about-for-god-of-war-ragnarok-on-pc">SSD installations</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inzois-system-specs-make-me-want-to-see-this-handsome-sims-killer-running-on-a-pocket-calculator">extravagant GPU demands</a>.</p>

<p>That disclosure is, at least, more detailed and specific <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">than some games bother with</a>. And we don’t yet know how often or even in what context we’ll see these machine-hewn boffins – if they’re just dinky models wandering around the raptor paddocks, specks of white in your god’s-eye view, you might not even notice their soulless, artless visages. Still, it remains easy to forget about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/for-a-best-case-scenario-future-generative-ai-must-put-creators-at-its-heart">more optimistic arguments</a> for AI generation when the real-life examples we’ve seen so far tend towards the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-devs-multiplayer-shooter-the-finals-is-full-of-ai-voices-and-oof-you-can-tell">robotic</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-strongly-feel-this-ai-powered-demo-of-quake-2-is-an-insult-to-life-itself">terrible</a>. You could say Evolution 3’s approach will prevent asset recycling, but I personally wouldn’t worry about a repeating scientist face breaking the immersion of my cloned dinosaur theme park.</p>
<p>Anyway, system requirements. Again, these look very accessible by 2025 standards: even the recommended graphics card list is a mix of mid-range oldies and newer budget models, like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-arc-b580-review">Intel Arc B580</a>. And again, 25GB isn’t much to make room for these days either – that’s less than half the storage heft of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a>.

<p>The game itself promises an upgraded, more modular suite of building and terraforming tools, as well as lil’ baby dinos you’ll be able to nuture into profitably terrifying adulthood. It also features the vocal talents of film series star Jeff Goldblum, which unfortunately makes me<em> less</em> interested, as – and this is not necessarily the fault of Mr. Goldblum himself – I cannot mental unshackle him from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thirty-flights-of-loving">Thirty Flights of Loving</a> mode that replaces every character with his mumbling, stuttering likeness:</p>

Well well well, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake developers Bloober Team are working on a remake of the very first Silent Hill in collaboration with publishers Konami. Please give me a few seconds to pat myself furiously on the back for asking Bloober about the prospects of an original Silent Hill remake, way back in August last year. Oracular insight, thy name is Edwin. OK, that's enough patting, my shoulders are starting to hurt. You can watch the teaser trailer now, which surfaced during Konami's Press Start showcase today. Lovely to hear that gut-twisting banjo melody again.

There's zip to say beyond what you see in that video - no Silent Hill remake release date, no hint about how the story or combat system might change. The game is only confirmed as being "in development". We can, of course, make deductions from Bloober's past efforts. In his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-2-review">Silent Hill 2 remake review</a>, Brendy called it "a handsome horror remake that plays safe with its own history". I had a few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-hours-of-bloobers-silent-hill-2-its-unclear-who-is-remaking-who">thinky thoughts</a> myself about the formal ironies of remaking a game defined by repressed trauma.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of playing things safe, it seems likely that Bloober weren't being entirely straight with me <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-didnt-silent-hill-2-remake-devs-bloober-start-by-remaking-silent-hill-1-the-devs-explain">when I asked them why they didn't start by remaking the first game</a> last year. 
</p>
<p>
"I think Silent Hill 2 just matches our DNA way better," Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart told me at the time. "It's much more emotional, a much more personal story than, for example, the first game or the third game. And we at Bloober were always fans of telling personal stories about people's experiences, people's feelings and how they go through them. Not so much about, you know know, occultism and things from other worlds, right? So I think that was the main reason, basically." 
</p>
<p>
Lead producer Maciej Głomb qualified, however, that "it's not like we were making this decision, right? The franchise is connected to Konami's plans."
</p>
<p>
If all this strikes you as one throwback too many, you might be better served by the forthcoming Japan-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, and indeed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, the spin-off from Observation developers No Code, of which little has been heard for some time.
