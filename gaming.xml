<p>In this article, we're going to look at 5 different expansions for <em>Zombicie White Death</em>. If this is the first time you're hearing about <em>Zombicide</em> or <em>White Death</em>, check out our review <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/zombicide-white-death-review-incessant-march-continues" rel="nofollow">here</a>, or our coverage of the other game entires below. We've been fans of CMON's <em>Zombicide</em> franchise for a while, and along with the first <em>Zombicide</em> fantasy game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/zombicide-black-plague-review-old-school-zombie-slaying" rel="nofollow">Black Plague</a>, we've also covered the modern <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/zombicide-2nd-edition-board-game-review" rel="nofollow">2nd Edition</a> and the awesomely thematic movie tie-in, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/night-of-living-dead-zombicide-game-review" rel="nofollow">Night of the Living Dead</a> version.</p>

<p>Divine Beasts is an abomination expansion pack for<em> Zombicide White Death, </em>and it can also be used with<em> Black Plague </em>and<em> Green Horde. </em>It adds a divine beasts card to the zombie deck, and when drawn, starts off a chain of divine beasts spawns. The first beast to appear is the Vermillion Bird and it will activate for 3 turns, and if not eliminated, it disappears and the next beast spawns next turn until all 4 have appeared.</p>

<p>Each of the 4 beasts has 3 action cards for each turn they're in the game, along with unique rules to eliminate them. The Vermillion Bird for example needs to be hit with a single ranged attack. They each also have a unique effect, like the Black Tortoise which makes nearby zombies need 2 damage to be removed. Eliminating the beasts before they disappear earns the survivors a permanent skill.</p>

Rather than just having to load up damage on an abomination, the players are pushed to position and bring the right weapons to bear in time and it fits in really thematically to the game.</p>

<p>The Crossfire Pack is an expansion pack for<em> Zombicide White Death, </em>and it can also be used with<em> Black Plague </em>and<em> Green Horde.&nbsp;</em>It includes some crossbow-armed guards and zombies. The guards give the player activating them a Delayed Ranged Action card, which can be discarded any time during the zombies phase to perform a ranged attack on a zone. The Deadbolt Walkers add a new challenge for survivors, and when they activate, they target a zone with the most survivors up to 3 zones away.</p>

<p>Climbers and Terrorcotta Walkers is an expansion pack for<em> Zombicide </em>fantasy series, including<em> White Death,</em><em>&nbsp;Black Plague,&nbsp;</em>and<em> Green Horde. </em>This expansion features 2 new types of Zombies. The climbers can ignore ramparts, barriers, and ledges when moving, and can be a real menace when trying to defend against. The Terrorcotta Walkers are fantastically thematic and offer a great new challenge. At the start of each zombie phase, if there are 1 to 4 Terrorcotta Warriors in a zone, more spawn around them until there are 5. This means that you need to take out all 5 in a turn, otherwise, they'll keep coming back, and if you separate them, they'll start spawning multiple sets of 5.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-7.jpg?itok=asgI099N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-7.jpg?itok=X2fj96Y- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Zombicide </em>Climbers and Terrorcotta Walkers expansion adds 2 new challenging zombie types to your games.</figcaption></figure><p>This is a great enemy expansion for the <em>Zombicide</em> fantasy games. The Terrorcotta Walkers offer a unique and entertaining challenge, and the climbers add a new element to your games. While not as good as the Divine Beasts expansion, it adds some interesting depth.</p>

<p>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles<i> Zombiecide Timecrash </i>expansion contains a load of new content and can be used with <em>White Death</em>, <em>Black Plague,</em> or <em>Green Horde</em>. In total, it contains 7 new heroes and their unique equipment, a new enemy type and a new necromancer, 10 new quests, and some new rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'll be honest, this is why I'm here. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Timecrash and <em>White Death</em> is my thing, and it doesn't disappoint. Each Turtle feels thematically perfect (as does Splinter, April, and Casey) and each comes with their own unique equipment card, which can be upgraded by taking an ultimate token (a pizza slice, for which there are 6 that sit as a whole pizza when not in use).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enemy-wise, the Foot Soldiers spawn on objectives to make them more difficult to take, and Shredder, a unique Necromancer, deals damage when survivors miss their attacks against him. These all combine in the 10 new quests, which use the included new map tiles and creates an enjoyable zombie-filled ninja romp through the snow.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-9.jpg?itok=UIxClAgU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-9.jpg?itok=r6Vx3Cin 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Zombicide</em> Timecrash Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles miniaturs are fantastic. Now who is the best turtle and why is it Raphael?</figcaption></figure><p>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Timecrash expansion is fantastic. Incredibly thematic throughout with a load of content that works great in all <em>Zombicide</em> fantasy games. The fantasy design for all the miniatures works very well and it's obvious that some work has gone into capturing the theme in all aspects of this expansion.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-10.jpg?itok=dkUmyqjg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-10.jpg?itok=t4mFsrYs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Zombicide White Death Eternal Empire</h2>

<p><i>Zombicide Eternal Empire </i>is a fantasy expansion for<i> Zombicide. </i>It contains the most content out of all the expansions we've looked at here, including 6 new survivors, chi rules, and upgraded survivor cards for the <em>White Death</em> survivors (and rules for <em>Black Plague</em> and <em>Green Horde</em> survivors as well). It also includes a new action, meditation, which boosts Chi, and Chi Statues (that come in 2 halves to show when they've been broken by the zombies), and full replacement equipment decks that use the chi rules.</p>

<p>2 new zombie types are also included that play into the Chi theme. Warden Brutes, which make it so zombies can only be eliminated with chi attacks, and the God-Eater Abomination, who go straight for the Chi Statues and sap the chi from the survivors.&nbsp; Eternal Empire also adds new map tiles with ice zones that survivors can't attack in (zombies still can though), 10 new quests, and a campaign sheet and rules for linking your <em>Zombicide</em> games together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-11.jpg?itok=tTKoGTjs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zombicide-white-death-expansions-11.jpg?itok=FcYWvTbH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zombicide</em> Eternal Empire adds a huge amount of content to your games, and the Chi Statues that break in half are inspired design.</figcaption></figure><p>If it wasn't for how thematically awesome the Turtles expansion is, this would easily be the best of the new <em>Zombicide</em> fantasy expansions. It adds a huge amount of content to your games, even without the new enemies and survivors. The campaign play is fantastic, and the 10 new quests and their objectives are super fun to play through.</p>

<h2>Zombicide White Death Expansions Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The 5 <em>Zombicide</em> expansions we've looked at here can be divided into 2 types, the Divine Beasts, Crossfire Pack and Climbers and Terrorcotta Walkers simply add new enemies (and guards) to your games. Out of those Divine Beasts adds the most interesting aspect to games, with the Climbers and Terrorcotta Walkers adding a new great dimension and challenge. The Crossfire Pack is decent, but if you're only picking up one, then I'd recommend Diving Beasts.</p>

<p>The other 2 offer a lot more content in their expansions. Timecrash Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Eternal Empire both have a great amount of content. Turtles is my personal favorite, just because it's so thematically brilliant, but Eternal Empire adds huge depth to your games, with new rules and campaign play. Recommending one over the other would depend on what you're after, but if it's just honest <em>Zombicide</em> fun, then Timecrash Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is fantastic.</p>

But it ain’t just fans who have been waiting for a decade that are desperate for a <em>GTA 6</em> release date. Studio and publisher execs across the industry as well as smaller devs are watching closely, as nobody wants to release a game too close to <em>GTA 6 </em>and get demolished by it. As a result, everybody seems nervous about announcing a fall release date for their non-<em>GTA </em>games. And investors and analysts are watching to see if Rockstar’s behemoth lands in 2025 or slips into next year, something that would cause a lot of industry chaos.</p><p>Okay, so with seemingly everyone wanting to know when <em>GTA 6</em> will specifically launch, I’m here to provide a date. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/mzAfTmC3It0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/mzAfTmC3It0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A drumroll, please</a></span>...</p><p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>will launch on October 28.</p><p>Probably. Or, like, right around there. Pretty close to that point. I mean I’m fairly certain that if the game doesn’t get delayed into 2026, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501">which Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick doesn’t think will happen</a></span>, <em>GTA 6</em> is arriving <em>sometime </em>in late October. And October 28 is the last Tuesday of the month, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_published_by_Rockstar_Games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_published_by_Rockstar_Games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a month in which Rockstar has historically</a></span> released a lot of its biggest games. But this isn’t just a random guess based on the fall 2025 release window and Rockstar’s past game releases. </p><h2 id="h1397992"><a id=""></a><em>Borderlands 4</em> and Take-Two’s CEO</h2><p>Earlier this week, 2K Games and Gearbox announced the release date for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-release-date-state-play-gta-6-fall-2025-1851762044&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-release-date-state-play-gta-6-fall-2025-1851762044"><em>Borderlands 4.</em></a></span> The co-op sci-fi looter shooter is set to arrive on September 23. Why does that matter? Well, Take-Two Interactive is the parent company for both Rockstar and 2K Games. So unless Rockstar Games is completely rogue and never communicates with Take-Two leadership, I’d imagine they know when <em>GTA 6</em> is landing, even if it’s just a rough window. And that would likely help inform when they would choose to launch <em>Borderlands 4. </em></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/dice-cards-ruler-earthbound-vivrato&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/dice-cards-ruler-earthbound-vivrato" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by Stephen Totilo’s <em>Game File </em>on February 13</a></span>, there was a lot of excitement and chatter at DICE during the week due to the announcement of <em>Borderlands 4</em>'s release date. Totilo reports that a “well-plugged-in attendee” that he spoke to at the industry event explained that “everyone’s waiting for Take-Two and Rockstar” to pick a release day for <em>GTA 6</em>. And <em>Borderlands 4</em> is a signal from Take-Two: September 23 and the weeks immediately before and after it are probably safe.</p><p>Pull out a calendar and that likely means <em>GTA 6</em> isn’t landing in September. Fall starts on September 22 and the next day <em>Borderlands 4</em> launches. So September is out. That leaves October and November. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/all-call-of-duty-games-in-release-order&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/all-call-of-duty-games-in-release-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">historically <em>Call of Duty</em> has arrived in November</a></span> and while <em>GTA 6 </em>is likely to outsell this year’s <em>CoD </em>sequel, I doubt Take-Two and Rockstar want that big of a game launching so close to <em>GTA 6. </em></p><p>So with that in mind, and based on Zelnick sounding very committed to a fall release date, I think that points to a late October launch while <em>Call of Duty</em>, which is now owned by Xbox, probably moves into the middle of November. Remember, Xbox wants <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> to be a big hit as it’s a game that will likely sell a ton of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-xbox-series-x-s-performance-mode-1851074000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-xbox-series-x-s-performance-mode-1851074000">Xbox Series S</a></span> consoles. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-xbox-series-s-pc-take-two-boss-worried-rockstar-1851691951?_gl=1*9mbwku*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTU2OTQxNy40NDguMC4xNzM5NTY5NDE5LjU4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-xbox-series-s-pc-take-two-boss-worried-rockstar-1851691951?_gl=1*9mbwku*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTU2OTQxNy40NDguMC4xNzM5NTY5NDE5LjU4LjAuMA..">The tiny Xbox is the cheapest way to play the upcoming <em>GTA</em> sequel</a></span>. </p><p>So there you go: <em>GTA 6 </em>is out on October 28. Or maybe Take-Two does an early access period for the game and the “official” release date is the 28th but it really arrives three days early on the 25th. Either way, I’m thinking this Halloween season a lot of people are going to be too busy causing mayhem in Vice City to go to any spooky parties. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The two also answered a few pre-submitted audience questions, including one that Barlog read to Druckmann about sequels: “How do you and your teams approach character development over multiple games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Druckmann’s answer, though, was surprising for someone who’s made quite a few sequels in his day: he doesn’t think about multiple games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's a very easy question for me to answer, because I never think about multiple games, because I'm the game in front of us is so all consuming,” he responded. “I think you're jinxing yourself if you're starting to think about the sequel when you're working on the first game. So when I was making The Last of Us 2, yeah, sure. Every once in a while an idea pops in your head of where it might go if we get the chance to do another one. But I just approach it as, ‘what if I never get to do another one?’...I'm not saving some idea for the future. If there's a cool idea, I'm doing my best to get it into here.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ten-year payoffs</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Druckmann went on to explain that this is how he approaches everything, with perhaps the exception of the The Last of Us TV show since he already knows it’s going to have multiple seasons. So when sequels come around, instead of having a plan already in mind, Druckmann says he looks back on what he’s already done and asks himself what elements are unresolved and where the characters can go. “And if I feel like the answer is, they can't go anywhere, then I go, ‘I think we'll just kill them off.’</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/14/gettyimages-2172932657-1739566989717.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Neil Druckmann. Image credit: Jon Kopaloff/Variety via Getty Images</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm half joking, but we just find the next game. When we made Uncharted 1, we had no idea we would do the train sequence of Uncharted 2, or where Nathan Drake would be. We figured it out when we made Uncharted 2. And eventually, the same when we worked on Uncharted 3, same when we worked on Uncharted 4, where we look back and say, "How do we not repeat ourselves? Where else could this character go? What else could get him back into the adventure?" And we have to come up with a new answer. And if we don't have a new answer then we should ask ourselves, is this the right character? Is this the right game for us to work on? Or is it time to find something new?”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When we made Uncharted 1, we had no idea we would do the train sequence of Uncharted 2.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Barlog responded, saying he doesn’t work that way at all. Barlog says he has “way too much of the Charlie Day crazy conspiracy board of trying to connect and plan with all of these pieces,” and especially likes when he’s able to connect something he’s working on now with something he planned ten years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's just so magical, but it is absolutely, unequivocally the most unhealthy thing ever, because it is insanely stressful to try to fold and connect each of these pieces,” Barlog continued. “Because give or take five years, there's hundreds of people involved, and then a whole new group of people often are moved in on the next project. That's a bunch of different, and perspectives, and likes and dislikes that are going to negatively impact you setting something up that early. And they're going to be like, ‘Let's talk about this, because that was kind of the dumb. I don't know if I want to do that.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think for me that requires a level of confidence I just don't have,” Druckmann later responded. “Like this is going to be so successful, I know where this is going next. I'm like, I just want to focus on the next five days in front of me, let alone 10 years down the line.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The reason to wake up</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The fireside chat spanned a number of topics, with Druckmann and Barlog discussing their own experiences with doubt, and their respective creative processes for determining when an idea is “correct.” Later in the talk, they alluded to their feelings on their careers as they currently stand. Druckmann spoke on how he doesn’t want to go into TV or movies permanently, sharing this anecdote about his love for games:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since we're talking about TV, one time I gave some direction on Pedro Pascal. And I think he was frustrated by my direction, but he said it jokingly. He's like, ‘Do you like art?’ And I said, defensively, ‘Yeah, do you like art?’ And without missing a beat, he goes, ‘It's the reason to wake up in the morning. It's why I live and breathe.’ And to me, that's why we do it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“...At times, I've had panic attacks. It's just so much stress, but you do it, because you love it so much. I love games so much. I love the stories we tell in games so much. It's the reason to wake up in the morning. It's why we do what we do, and despite all the negatives that come with it, sometimes the death threats and all the negativity and all those things, you just kind of dismiss those things and say, ‘Yeah, but I get to make games with the most talented people. How lucky are we?’”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/14/gettyimages-1968417204-1739567114001.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Cory Barlog. Image credit: Hannah Taylor/BAFTA via Getty Images</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Druckmann then turned a question on Barlog, pointing out Barlog’s storied career in light of the recent retirement of his colleague Ted Price. “When is it enough?...When is this compulsion enough? When have you proven yourself enough?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barlog gave a lengthy answer that got <em>real </em>real:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Is it ever enough? The short answer's, no, it's never enough. It is the voice in your head driving you more, and more, and more, and more…You struggle, you struggle, you work, you work. And it feels thankless, and you're not being heard. Or the thing you're doing doesn't resonate. Then you reach that point where this mountain you've been looking at it, you've been dreaming about, you've been aspiring to. Finally, you reach the summit of this mountain. And it's like the most amazing and horrible thing all at the exact same time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Is it ever enough? The short answer's, no, it's never enough.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because when you get to the top, this demon of obsession inside of your head doesn't shut up and let you appreciate the moment, the smell of the air, the sound of this sort of successful silence, that you've persevered, you've struggled, you've worked so hard to get all this. And so many people came together, and used this collective creative brain space to give birth to something that was only an idea, or a concept. And just enjoy, and revel, and see that you accomplished this thing, and you are at the top of the mountain. No. The demon just looks and goes, ‘There's another mountain over there that's a lot taller.’ Okay, well what next? You don't even often take that time. And I don't want to believe that it is intentional. It is this weird, I think silent, not so silent part of your individual makeup. The reason you're in this is because you can't stop. You're driving yourself forward, and to your detriment, to everyone else giving you the advice to stop, and pace, and you don't.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Druckmann echoed this sentiment, but softer, ending on an anecdote about Naughty Dog’s Jason Rubin. Upon his departure from the company, Druckmann remembers Rubin telling him that him leaving would create a space for everyone else to rise up behind him. “I think about those opportunities. Eventually when I am done doing this, it will create a bunch of opportunities for people. So for me, it's like I'm slowly rising up. I'm getting less involved on the day-to-day stuff, like on this project that I'm on…And eventually I think I'll just be able to remove myself. I don't know how long that will take, but I think about it. And I think about the opportunities I will create for next people to take on this stress, and take on their ideas, and be vulnerable and do all those things.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barlog quipped back, concluding the talk: “Very convincing. I’m going to retire.”

Both were in the top five most-played games on the platform, alongside <em>Genshin Impact</em>, <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, and <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>. The company reported $1.09 billion spent by 295 million PC players on the Epic Games Store last year, but only $255 million of that went to third-party games. For comparison, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/valve-runs-its-massive-pc-gaming-ecosystem-with-only-about-350-employees/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/valve-runs-its-massive-pc-gaming-ecosystem-with-only-about-350-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft estimated Valve’s annual revenue</a></span> at over $6 billion back in 2021.</p><p>So the Epic Games Store is still very much a <em>Fortnite </em>launcher with a ton of other cool stuff grafted onto it, but it’s certainly not <em>just</em> a<em> Fortnite </em>launcher. And with that in mind, the company also signaled what’s ahead for its digital storefront in 2025. The roadmap includes an overhaul of discoverability, new social features, the addition of pre-loading and a new download manager, as well as the ability to finally gift games to other people. </p><p>All of this is being done with the intent to seamlessly integrate it across an Epic Games Store mobile app as the company lobbies regulators the world over to force iOS and Android to play nice with it. We’ll see if, as that grand vision comes closer to being a reality, the Epic Games Store finally becomes a more central force to be reckoned with in PC gaming. For now, it’s still a great place to snag tons of cool games for free. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Afterlove EP is the new visual novel and/or broken hearts album from Indonesian developers Pikselnesia. It’s the sad, sleepy tale of a musician, Rama, who is trying to put his life back together and reconnect with his old bandmates in Jakarta a year after the death of his girlfriend, Cinta. The complicating factor is that Cinta isn’t entirely gone: she is a voice in Rama’s head, chatting to him throughout the game's 28-day storyline as though sitting next to the player on the other side of the screen. </p><!--more-->

<p>Afterlove EP is the original brainchild of Mohammad Fahmi, creator of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/coffee-talk">Coffee Talk</a> and What Comes After, who died in 2022. His colleagues at Pikselnesia have been reckoning with their own sorrow as they finish his game. I’ve been playing Afterlove EP for review, and while it’s a short game – maybe five to eight hours – in which you spend a lot of time listening to conversations, I’ve found it tough going. I’ve lost a few people myself, and this is pretty squarely a game about grief: exploring it, unpacking it, arguing about it, releasing it, or perhaps just existing with it. </p>
<p>As such, I’ve decided to miss this week’s review embargo and give the game the time it needs to settle in my head. But I feel confident in saying that there’s an interesting piece of narrative design here, presented in the form of evocatively scruffy hand-drawn art and accompanied by gentle indie rock music. If you fancy trying it out for yourself, you can find Afterlove EP on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599780/Afterlove_EP/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a thread of social media posts on X (formerly Twitter), Tolarian Community College announced this year's <a href="https://give.translifeline.org/campaign/tolarian-community-college-trans-lifeline-2025-fundraiser/c658047" rel="nofollow">Trans Lifeline</a> fundraiser. It started with a simple request. Donate multiples of $4.00 to the fundraiser and you will be eligible to win one of ten <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Masters boxes.</p>

One day later, that amount increased to over $270,000. To commemorate this milestone, Tolarian Community College announced a series of thank-you gifts would be going out to certain donors.</p>

<p>Those gifts included gaming accessories like playmats and Infinitotokens. But mostly the gifts were sought after <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> cards and decks including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/secret-lair-x-doctor-who-regeneration-brings-15th-doctor-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em></a> Commander Deck, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/secret-lair-x-dungeons-dragons-50th-anniversary-superdrop-announced-by-wizards-of" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em> Secret Lair</a>, a Zendikar Rising Collector's Box, and a Revised Counterspell card signed by Mark Poole.</p>

<p>The most recent update by Tolarian Community College exclaimed surprise at the Trans Lifeline fundraiser raising over $425,000. This puts the fundraiser close to its stated goal of $500,000.</p>

In addition, the organization's members are part of the transgender community. Their stated goals include keeping their members' identities anonymous and confidential, providing peer support, and dismantling the institutional bigotry of white supremacy.</p>

<p>The support for Trans Lifeline comes during a volatile time in the United States. Due to several executive orders by President Trump, transgender identity is being erased or actively overwritten. This includes the removal of "transgender" and "queer" altogether from the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/references-transgender-queer-removed-stonewall-monuments-webpage-rcna192204" rel="nofollow">Stonewall National Monument's</a> web page.</p>

<p>The Trans Lifeline fundraiser concludes February 15.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> has required a $15 monthly subscription to play since its launch back in 2004, but in all those years, the price in the US has never gone up. According to ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, it was due to not wanting to "agitate" the game's playerbase.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick reflected on his long history as the CEO of Activision and later Activision Blizzard. Along the way he dove into details about developer Blizzard and WoW's success.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="3483">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D2urSgcuyyo?start=3483" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">He said the game over its lifetime has seen over 150 million subscribers, making it the "best subscription business of all time." When one of the interviewers suggested the price of the subscription could have been "priced more highly" given WoW's huge success, Kotick pushed back against the idea.</p><p dir="ltr">"We never raised the price," Kotick said. "My view was we come up with value-added services, come up with new things to sell, but just leave the price. We could figure out how to come up with other things to sell them. And it's a prickly audience, you know? You don't wanna do too much to agitate them. And even a dollar increase would've been a problem in my view."</p><p dir="ltr">Kotick went on to talk about how vital Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen was to the company's success, and said he was, and still is, "the soul of creativity at the company." Metzen retired from Blizzard in 2016 (according to Kotick, due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-activision-blizzard-boss-thought-warcraft-was-one-of-the-worst-movies-ever-made/1100-6529392/" data-ref-id="1100-6529392">burnout related to the Warcraft movie</a>) but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-veteran-chris-metzen-is-once-again-working-on-warcraft/1100-6510092/" data-ref-id="1100-6510092">returned in 2022 as a creative advisor on WoW</a>. He is now an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-chris-metzen-is-now-shaping-the-future-of-warcraft-as-a-creative-director/1100-6518000/" data-ref-id="1100-6518000">executive creative director for the Warcraft universe</a>. Prior to returning to Blizzard, Kotick said Metzen believed WoW's upcoming expansions were in bad shape, and Kotick "begged him" to return in order to fix them.</p><p dir="ltr">"Just come do it, you're the guy, come do it," Kotick said he told Metzen.</p><p dir="ltr">Kotick said Metzen had his "fingerprints" all over the MMORPG's latest expansion, The War Within, and that the next expansion, under Metzen's guidance, "is going to be great." Once Metzen returned to Blizzard, Kotick said he hardly ever talked with him, instead preferring to let him get to work.</p><p dir="ltr">"What am I going to tell Chris Metzen about game design?" Kotick said. "I just wanted him to do his thing."</p><p dir="ltr">Kotick served as CEO of Activision, and later Activision Blizzard, from 1991-2023, stepping down after the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-officially-acquires-activision-nearly-two-years-later-bobby-kotick-resi/1100-6516016/" data-ref-id="1100-6516016">publisher's sale to Microsoft for $69 billion</a>, which came after a variety of controversies involving the publisher.</p>

		<p><em>Not everyone is built for, or would have fun at, a surprise party thrown in their honor. But the joy of being with someone for long enough is knowing what would make them happy, and Patrick's wife was keenly aware that Patrick would enjoy—but not expect—a big party.</em></p><p><em>This party was developed covertly, in secret, for more than a year. It's no small thing to try and coordinate invitations for dozens of people scattered all over the  country, put them into a single room at the same time, and keep everyone's mouth shut. What a thing, you know?</em></p><p><em>Everyone celebrates differently. Some loud, some soft. It's part of what we talked about last week, as Patrick circled his way towards 40. </em></p><p><em>This party, naturally, was very loud.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob: </strong>So now you know about the surprise party. But let me fill everyone in who is reading along at home.</p><p>Patrick’s wife Katie reached out last year about his 40th birthday and the fact she wanted to surprise him with a big get-together of friends and family. She was probably correct that Chicago in February was going to be a hurdle for some people, but I’m from here and honestly it was part of the draw. Give me salt-bleached streets under a harsh winter sun, blowing snow, and the furnace-heat of bars trying to keep out the cold and the boredom of a slow season in Chicago sports. So I made plans to come out here, and then had to make sure never to offhandedly mention anything that might suggest I’d be back in Chicagoland this winter.</p><p>Now the funniest part of this whole experience, for me, was the wait for Patrick to be delivered to the surprise party. For one thing, he’d been lured to a nearby bar in Wrigleyville that turned out to be literally across the street from my hotel. If he’d been at the front door at the wrong moment, he might have seen me parking my car, or beginning my trudge to the brewery where his party was being arranged. For another, Patrick started having such a <em>good </em>time at this sports bar that he didn’t want to leave. We started getting updates as he fell further behind schedule, “He wants to see the end of this game.” “OK he ordered more drinks. I’m trying.” “He has another bet he wants to see pan out.”</p><p>But eventually Patrick arrived, the surprise appeared to be near-total and welcome, and we ended up having a lovely party to kick off a lovely weekend of hanging out with Patrick’s friends and family in Chicago. A very Patrick-themed playlist (copious amounts of Weezer, of course) blasted from the speakers while a slideshow of old and recent Patrick photos flickered across a projector screen.</p><p>So Patrick, you were genuinely caught off-guard by this party. But I’m also surprised by that, because one of the things that I picked up being around your family this weekend is that you’re very good at marking occasions.&nbsp;</p><p>I think my favorite moment of the weekend was when you talked about how your father made it a point to show up for people, to mark occasions and share the milestones with them, and trust that when you had your own moments you wanted to share, people would show up for you. And that you’ve tried to honor that instruction through your own life.</p><p>Your whole family seems to enjoy coming together around milestones and holidays, you have strong friendships that seem like they get nurtured regularly. It doesn’t seem like you’d ever expect your 40th to pass by as a small family dinner with cake and ice cream.&nbsp;</p><p>How is it you didn’t think you’d end up with a big birthday party, or at least cause a problem for Katie by deciding you <em>should </em>throw a big birthday event while she was busy trying to organize this surprise? And is this something your whole family tends to do, or is it really something unique to you via your father and his sense of how family and social obligations should be tended to?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Patrick managed to pull in a favor and get everyone on the floor of the Chicago Bulls stadium.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>First of all, thank you for coming. Though humorously, it’s not the last time I’ll see you, because I’m writing this while trying to finalize plans for the two of us to catch the Chicago Bulls later tonight.</p><p>I remain genuinely flabbergasted that my wife pulled this surprise party off. She’s a manager by trade and years ago co-founded an events company, so planning is her expertise. But she is also incapable of telling a lie. Or, as I found out this weekend, it’s merely very hard and causes her incredible and crippling anxiety. She told me that at one point, she used the recent iPhone update that lets you “lock” an app to only opening via Face ID to her messages app, because she worried I’d idly glance at one of her devices.</p><p>I was oblivious, though. Utterly. While I’m touched by the weekend’s events, part of what spurred me to pitch our back-and-forth last week was genuine happiness and acceptance with my spot in life. There was nothing sad about the party I <em>did</em> have on Friday with a small group of friends and family. I was genuinely having a <em>blast</em> with my brother and another smaller group of friends hopping from a golf simulator to a goofy sportsbook attached to Wrigley Field, as we irresponsibly placed $5 bets on non-descript college basketball games. (The reason we were late was not me placing another bet, but was an existing bet going not only into overtime but <em>triple</em> overtime. C’mon, no chance I wasn’t gonna see that play out!!!)</p><p>The bar was busy downstairs! It made sense for us to head upstairs! But as I made it around the corner and everyone yelled out, my children running over to hug me amidst the noise, as I tried to sputter out a few words while feeling speechless, the moment it crystalized for me how much work my wife had put into all this was briefly seeing you in the back. “Oh, Christ, if Rob is here, I have no idea what else I’m going to find.” And what I found was a wide net of friends and family from across the country, living evidence of the decades I’ve been around, from before I was able to walk, to the very people I helped learn how to walk.</p><p>Who’s got it better than us/me?</p><p>But I think you earn the right to be in someone’s life. You earn the right to stay there. You earn the right to be <em>wanted</em> there. It’s a value persistent across my dad’s side of the family, which is the vast majority of the family you met over the weekend. I care deeply for my mom’s side of the family, too, but what my dad’s side has is unique. Everyone likes each other. Everyone is not just family—they’re friends. But that didn’t happen by accident, it happened because, like I mentioned in my impromptu speech, they showed up.&nbsp;</p>

Most of the studios Xbox bought or created around 2018 have only shipped maybe one game, and some of those were in development before the Xbox deal. Other studios, like Compulsion, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/south-of-midnight&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/south-of-midnight">are finally releasing something after seven years of Xbox ownership</a></span>. And if you look at other Xbox studios, things aren’t much better. </p><p>The Coalition hasn’t launched a new <em>Gears </em>game since <em>Gears 5</em> in 2019 and Rare hasn’t made a new game since 2020's <em>Battletoads</em>. (Though the studio does a lot of support on <em>Sea of Thieves</em>.) </p><p>Meanwhile, Obsidian has shipped three games since 2018 under Xbox and has another big RPG landing later this year. And it released<em> Outer Worlds </em>in 2019, a game which started production before the Xbox deal and wasn’t published by Microsoft, but was yet one more big RPG from the company in a relatively short span of time. And there are rumors of the company already working on a new project, too. So how did the studio reach this point? </p><h2 id="h1380470"><a id=""></a>How Obsidian became Xbox’s most valuable asset</h2><p> Well,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-plans-to-make-rpgs-for-100-years-by-not-trying-to-grow-aggressively-expand-our-team-size-or-make-super-profitable-games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-plans-to-make-rpgs-for-100-years-by-not-trying-to-grow-aggressively-expand-our-team-size-or-make-super-profitable-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> during a talk at DICE Summit earlier this week</a></span>, Obsidian Entertainment VP of operations Marcus Morgan and VP of development Justin Britch talked about the company’s philosophy of staying lean and making smart investments in medium-sized games that don’t take a decade to make. The studio heads also emphasized keeping headcount low and aiming for as little turnover as possible to help the studio gain more institutional knowledge. </p><p>The goal: The duo want Obsidian to last 100 years. Really. When asked about the goal of keeping the studio around for 100 years, long after they are dead, they said: “Are we serious? … Yes.” </p><p>And honestly, I think Obsidian can pull it off. It clearly has a team of people who understand how to build properly scoped games using relatively small teams while managing multiple projects at once. </p><p>In an industry where some studios <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818">lay people off all the time</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamerant.com/gta-6-leaks-development-how-long/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamerant.com/gta-6-leaks-development-how-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spend five to seven years working on one game</a></span>, Obsidian has gone a different path. And the end result is one of the most productive and successful studios around. I bet Microsoft is happy they snagged the place up back in 2018. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-skips-xbox-cloud-gaming-in-favor-of-nvidia-geforce-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Avowed launched in Early Access yesterday, with those who played it giving positive feedback on the game. This title comes from the beloved studio Obsidian Entertainment, which has also made games such as Fallout: New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity, and more. Avowed launched exclusively on Xbox and Steam, offering a premium early access period for an additional $10 where the game will then launch on Xbox Game Pass next week.</p>
<p>As the game launched, an uproar began regarding Avowed's early access being live on Xbox Cloud Gaming, as reported by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-avowed-early-access-inexplicably-skips-xbox-cloud-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows Central</a>. However, it seems that regardless of whether or not you bought the premium edition of the game, it simply would not be going live on Xbox Cloud Gaming until next week.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Avowed's early access period is currently available on the rival cloud service, NVIDIA GeForce Now. This seems like a bit of a strange choice, especially since Obsidian Entertainment is a part of Xbox Game Studios. It doesn't seem to make much sense that Microsoft wouldn't try to peddle its own services rather than benefit a rival one.</p>
<p>Considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/">how expensive</a> the Ultimate Game Pass subscription is, after receiving a price hike, it seems quite unfair that Microsoft wouldn't put loyal customers at the forefront and give them what they wanted by allowing them to have advanced access to the game that they paid for.</p>
<p>In addition, with the new ability to "buy to own" games on Xbox Cloud Gaming, a brand-new title such as Avowed would have been the perfect opportunity for this new feature. The system supports DLC entitlements for those who purchase deluxe editions of a game, which, by rights, should include the ability to access the game early, as stated when purchasing. However, as shown in a <a href="https://x.com/mrbobman15/status/1890114317569360154?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on X</a>, a user purchased the Premium Edition and found that it was nowhere to be seen on Xbox Cloud Gaming. At the time of writing, Microsoft has yet to explain why this is.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's very uncertain as to why Microsoft has made this decision and whether it was just a massive oversight by people working at Microsoft or whether this was an intentional move to cozy up with a rival cloud gaming service. Either way, it's left those on Xbox feeling slighted and ripped off after not being able to get their money's worth. Whether or not the company will respond to those who have left complaints on social media remains to be seen.</p>

But while we may love our video game love interests, perhaps it’s worth reflecting on whether or not these relationships would be feasible were they not bound together by a world-ending event like the Blight or the invasion of Corypheus.</p><p>Sure, a romance with Iron Bull in <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> is undeniably hot, but what happens when the hole in the sky is no longer spitting demons out into the real world and you just have to live with each other? <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>added three new datable dudes to the mix and expanded on two old ones from <em>Inquisition</em>, which means it’s time to re-rank the <em>Dragon Age </em>boyfriends on how much they are actual, real-life boyfriend material. </p><p><strong>Update, 2/14/25, 2:00 p.m. ET: </strong>This piece was originally published on February 14, 2023. It has been updated to account for the release of <em>The Veilguard.</em></p></div></div><div><p> I don’t have to hypothesize as to whether or not Solas would be a good boyfriend in real life because he was already a terrible one in the <em>Dragon Age </em>games. This guy spends the entirety of <em>Inquisition</em> lying to you about the real reason he’s been helping you, which is to help get his world-ending plan back on track after he fucked it up. Even if you’re in a romantic relationship with the guy, this truth doesn’t come to light until after he dips at the end of the game and tells you why he ghosted you in the DLC. Yes, it’s tragic, it’s angsty, and it makes for great drama, but one day you, too, will be old and tired and want someone who’s just gonna be there when you get home from work. This man is too busy trying to destroy the world for a righteous cause to care about seeing you every night. <em>The Veilguard </em>only makes his crimes against humanity more clear and even if he ends up smoothing things over with his girl in the end, you deserve someone who isn’t gonna leave you waiting for 10 years to get his shit together. Worst rl boyfriend, easily.</p></div><div><p>Look, Sebastian sucks. In <em>Dragon Age II</em>, the guy is so beholden to the church that he’s constantly judging people, including you. He’s also a chaste romance, if that’s your thing, but if it’s not, you’re gonna be left wanting at the behest of a god who left you and everyone else behind a long time ago. He’s not trying to destroy the world, so he does get to come out above Solas, but you can do better, friend. We have 11 bachelors yet to go...</p></div><div><p>I love Fenris. He was my romance option every time I’ve played <em>Dragon Age II</em>, and the rival romance between him and a mage Hawke plays out as delicious angst. But as the years have passed, I’ve cooled a lot on the relationship because it just has a lot of abusive undertones. The sex scene is sparked by an argument, then Fenris shoving you into a wall, lit up with his lyrium tattoos ready to reach through your chest and crush your heart. It illustrates the abuse Fenris has gone through, and the scene itself is very earned. It works well in a video game and on An Archive of Our Own, but in the context of a real romance the red flags keep popping up. Yeah, by the end Fenris and Hawke grow and have a better relationship, but if that shit happened once, it can happen again.</p></div><div><p>Cullen is a wildcard because his romance scene in <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>shows he knows how to give you that good good and throws all his shit off his desk to do it. But he also seems like the kind of guy who, after you’d gotten well and settled, would start asking why you haven’t made dinner for when he gets home from work and tell you that your job should be to take care of the children, rather than having a career and life of your own. He seems sweet and chivalrous, but that can also come from some extremely backward views on relationships. So proceed with caution. You know the joke about liberals who look like Republicans? That’s Cullen, and it’s a coin flip for what you’re actually going to get.</p></div><div><p>Look, I know. But please hear me out before you start throwing tomatoes. Anders is possessed by the spirit of Justice, but he’s also possessed by his devotion to his cause. And that devotion extends to you, as well. You want a man who is <em>obsessed </em>with you? That’s Anders. You think a man who blew up a church in an act of terro—uh, revolution is going to ever half-ass your birthday or not appreciate the big moments of your lives together? No, this guy is gonna do something explosive for every life event you there is...so long as he doesn’t spot some great injustice happening elsewhere in the world that might distract him. Good thing the world is a completely just and good place in which no one is being disproportionately harmed by societal structures, right?</p></div><div><p>Blackwall is a liar, and as we established earlier when we talked about Solas—not to mention in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-romance-rank-boyfriend-kaidan-garrus-thane-1850096380&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-romance-rank-boyfriend-kaidan-garrus-thane-1850096380"><em>Mass Effect </em>boyfriend ranking</a></span>—that’s pretty bad. But Blackwall’s lie is a good lie, because he’s trying to keep the legacy of a better man alive while trying to atone for his sins. Unlike Solas and the others, his lie is not selfish. Assuming Blackwall’s identity did allow Thom Rainier to avoid his tortured past, but he owns up to it and then there are no secrets between him and the Inquisitor. Then you just have a guy who is a broody gentleman that will fight and die for you.</p></div><div><p>When you meet Zevran in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, it’s because he’s trying to kill you. But when you defeat him, the assassin tells you that he’ll turn on his employer in exchange for his life. In the early bits of the relationship, Zevran is out for himself. You overcome that detachment in the romance, until eventually you’re left with a funny, horny goofball who brightens your day with his antics. If you want someone who’s going to turn your frown upside down during the darkest times, you can’t go wrong with this assassin turned golden retriever puppy.<br></p></div><div><p>At a glance, Lucanis looks like he’s a bad boy who would ruin your life for a few weeks. I mean, when you see a man viciously descend upon a target while sporting magic wings, that screams edgelord. But it turns out, this guy’s a big ol’ softy. He’ll remember your favorite snacks, tend to your every whim, and slay your enemies with trained efficiency. Did someone cut you off in traffic? Dead. Was someone in the booth next to you rude to the wait staff? Contract accepted. What possible downside could this short king possibly have? Well, there is that Spite demon that possesses him when he goes to sleep. Unless you’re into that. If not, you’ll at least always have a fresh pot of coffee in the morning as he downs the stuff constantly to keep himself awake.</p></div><div><p>Surely Alistair is the least experienced of the <em>Dragon Age </em>boyfriend pantheon. That means he’s got a lot to learn, but since he’s not been playing the game, you can assume some level of purity in his intentions and willingness to feel the relationship out. Where Cullen feels like a risky proposition because he seems the type to harbor prehistoric views, Alistair seems too naive to want to do anything other than worship the ground you walk on. He’s a doofus, but he’s funny and kind-hearted. Just don’t ask him to take up the responsibility of being a king or he’ll resent you forever.</p></div><div><p>As SZA once said in an SNL sketch, “it’s cuffin’ season, and all the girls are leavin’ to get a big boy.” She was definitely singing about Iron Bull. This qunari giant is all about boundaries and consent, and serving you and your needs both in and out of the bedroom. Iron Bull is the kind of guy who will do anything to protect and serve his mate, and the man will not rest until you are content with every aspect of your life and relationship. Iron Bull won’t give up on you, unless you completely betray his trust and get all his friends killed. Which is valid, because in that case you were the problem in the relationship.</p></div><div><p>Davrin the Grey Warden is the embodiment of positive masculinity. He’s stoic but not emotionally withdrawn, firm but not harsh, and he’s nurturing to those he cares about. It takes a lot of patience to be a griffon dad and also be the protective caretaker of a strapping adventurer who can’t stop getting into trouble. But he also recognizes that your responsibilities weigh heavily on you and doesn’t leave you wondering about the relationship. Davrin is the kind of man who says “yes, I would still love you if you were a worm” without once getting annoyed at the improbable scenario.</p><p>The one lingering question mark comes from him being a Grey Warden. He could be doomed by the narrative, destined to leave you a single parent to a griffon if he hears his Calling and must go down to the Deep Roads to die, or, if some major lore developments happen and he doesn’t have to worry about the Calling, he might suddenly have a lot more road in front of him than he knows what to do with. Dating a Warden is a risk. But with Davrin? It’s one worth taking.</p></div><div><p>Dorian is too much of an idealist to ever want anything other than the best for you. When he’s not being a revolutionary tearing down the corruption of his homeland, Dorian is the kind of man who will come home and worry that you’re running yourself ragged with your own responsibilities. He deflects with humor when you ask him about how he’s doing, but then opens up because he’s just as comfortable with you as you are with him. He’ll have some internalized homophobia to unpack, which comes from growing up with an oppressive, prejudiced upbringing, but once you’ve helped him untangle that abuse, he’ll be your rock, just as you are his. In <em>The Veilguard</em>, Dorian is walking the walk he spent all of <em>Inquisition </em>saying he would. He’s spearheading real change in Tevinter, and if you can get past the probable political assassination attempts, you know he is someone who will come through for you at the hardest of times.</p></div><div><p>If you want a relationship in which you never have to worry your sweet little head about anything ever again, Emmrich is your guy. From the moment I met the necromancer in <em>The Veilguard </em>I was immediately charmed by his kind demeanor and the fact that a youthful whimsy had not left him in his twilight years. This man will wine and dine you without asking you to lift a finger. This man’s love language is acts of service. He likes to take things slow and will treat you with nothing less than the respect you deserve. Emmrich is the kind of guy who, when you take home to meet your mom, she’s happier to see him walk through the door than you are, and they get wine-drunk and cry looking at your baby pictures. You ask him what’s wrong and he tearfully says “I wasn’t there to protect you, darling.” How can you say no to someone who’s that obsessed with you but in a non-toxic way?</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While they're out there, they might discover some magical items and dangers, and apparently, a little bit of love after all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the pre-release run-up for Avowed, Obsidian said the game wouldn't feature a dedicated romance system, and would instead focus on building "thoughtful relationships" with companions. Here's a quote from an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-explains-why-avowed-wont-let-you-romance-your-companions">IGN interview with Avowed game director Carrie Patel</a>, explaining the thought process:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are building thoughtful relationships with our companion characters," Patel said at the time. "Ultimately, I personally am a fan of making that an option, but I feel like if you're going to do it, you really, really have to commit and make sure that you're giving all to fulfilling that in a way that feels both true to the character, but also creates an engaging player experience. So not something we're doing for Avowed, but I wouldn't say never."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early players and reviewers of Avowed are reporting that, actually, at least one companion has eyes for your player character. <strong>Spoilers ensue </strong>for specific interactions with the companion Kai, so if you're looking to avoid that, turn back now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Avowed spoilers follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/obsidian-insisted-that-avowed-wouldnt-have-romance-but-that-wasnt-quite-true-because-theres-at-least-one-eligible-bachelor-and-hes-voiced-by-an-iconic-mass-effect-heartthrob/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a> reports that Kai, voiced by Brandon Keener (also the voice of Mass Effect's Garrus Vakarian), can wind up in a romance with the player. Complete his own personal quest line, confess your feelings, and apparently you'll get a confirmation of your happily-ever-after in the credits roll.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm not far enough in my personal Avowed playthrough to confirm as much, but <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/those-mad-lads-at-obsidian-were-bluffing-us-avowed-does-have-a-tiny-bit-of-companion-romance-as-a-treat/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer encountered similar dialogue</a> in their playthrough. The romance seems gender-agnostic too, as PC Gamer played as a male character, and GamesRadar's reported success was with a female character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a nice little treat, especially for all the Garrus fans. It does make one wonder what shifted in development, but if love wins in the end, that's all that really matters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Avowed is out now in early access, so if you're looking for a take on it, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-review">be sure to check out our Avowed review</a>.

For another, Windows 11 came along with some stiff hardware requirements that essentially locked out those with older processors, even though many of those machines can still run many PCs games well.</p><p dir="ltr">Windows 10's end of life means that Microsoft will no longer receive software updates or security fixes, and the company has been encouraging users to upgrade for years now. It seems inevitable that the numbers will begin to shift a bit more, a process that has perhaps already started--Windows 10 had a slight majority of Steam's userbase in September of last year, losing roughly 5% in the interim. The survey also revealed that the most popular GPU for Steam users is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060, that 16 GB RAM is the most common, and that a majority of Steam users have hard drives with more than 1 TB total space and 100 to 249 GB of free space.
