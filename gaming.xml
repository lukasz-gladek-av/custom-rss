			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 would greatly benefit from NVIDIA DLSS 4 if the console manages to run games with it at decent performance, as highlighted by a recent Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 video.</p>
<p>The new video, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RandomGaminginHD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RandomGaminginHD</a>, shows the second entry in the series by Insomniac which launched last week on PC, running at 1080p upscaled from 360p base resolution by NVIDIA DLSS 4 at the Ultra Performance setting on an RTX 4060 GPU, which is far from being the most powerful GPU around. While it's clear how the game is upscaled to 1080p from a very low base resolution, NVIDIA DLSS 4 not only delivers an acceptable image quality, considering the base resolution, but also very solid performance, as the game achieves an average of around 90 FPS at the highest setting without ray tracing, and a respectable 53 FPS average with Ultimate Ray Tracing. All this bodes extremely well for the Nintendo Switch 2, which is said to support NVIDIA DLSS, as this image quality would be more than acceptable on a small 1080p screen. Hopefully, the Nintendo system will be able to use the new Transformer model that powers NVIDIA DLSS 4 without a big impact on performance.</p>

<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as mentioned above, launched on PC last week, but its launch was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/">far from being the smoothest for PlayStation-to-PC ports</a>, as the game suffered from some critical crashing issues that prevented the vast majority of players from enjoying the game. Sony and developer Nixxes released a hotfix shortly after release to address the issue, although some are still experiencing crashes.</p>
<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the series from Insomniac by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/">review.</a></p>

            <p>Friendly skateboarding game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/olliolli-world">OlliOlli World</a> and its rollerskating gun friend <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rollerdrome">Rollerdrome</a> have been delisted on Steam for unknown reasons. If you go to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1190170/OlliOlli_World/">the store page</a> for OlliOlli World, you'll currently see the classic delisted message: "Notice: OlliOlli World is no longer available on the Steam store." The same thing appears on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1294420/Rollerdrome/">the Rollerdrome page</a>. No, we're not sure why. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Buckle up, there are layers of ownership here. The skating games were developed by Roll7 and published under Private Division. But Roll7 were shut down last year by uber-owner Take-Two Interactive, who reportedly sold Private Division to Haveli Investments, an equity firm from Austin in the US. Haveli are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-annapurna-staff-reportedly-found-new-studio-to-rescue-sold-off-private-division-projects-including-new-game-freak-game">reportedly funding</a> the new venture from staff who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resign-following-dispute-with-owner">quit Annapurna Interactive last year</a>, though the new company does not yet have a name.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division">Bloomberg reported</a> (paywalled) that this new company would "inherit the games and franchises of Private Division". That presumably includes the works of Roll7 published by Private Division, OlliOlli World and Rollerdrome. It seems plausible that Take-Two pressed a big 'off' switch for those games on Steam, now they don't own them and can't profit from them, before the new Haveli-ex-Annapurna venture could take control of the Steam pages.</p>
<p>The previous games in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/olliolli">OlliOlli</a> series are still available - they were published under Devlolver Digital. And it's possible the missing games will be relisted once the dust settles. It would be a shame otherwise, considering OlliOlli World was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/olliolli-world-review-so-good-it-will-give-you-blisters">so good it gave me blisters</a>. And Rollerdrome was a similar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rollerdrome-review">blast of adrenaline</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fromsoftware-is-%E2%80%98not-chasing-a-trend%E2%80%99-with-elden-ring-nightreign.1098504/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-is-not-chasing-a-trend-with-elden-ring-nightreign/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>FromSoftware recently explained how Elden Ring Nightreign is not following a trend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conversation with <a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/az-magazines/6936639/pc-gamer-us-edition-magazine-subscription_.thtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-went-roguelike-as-the-focus-was-condensing-the-rpg-experience-down-not-because-fromsoftware-was-chasing-a-trend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>), the game director, Junya Ishizaki, revealed how they are treating Elden Ring Nightreign and why it isn’t following a trend. Ishizaki stated that the developers are focusing on “condensing the experience down”, which includes the RPG stuff, the open-world nature, character development, and levelling up. Their plan was for everything to come together and turn into “a boss fight but in a more concentrated form.”</p>



<p>The developers want to integrate a “new sense of accomplishment” not found in Elden Ring or other FromSoftware titles, along with “some new mechanics and some new elements” they can add to the game. They never really insisted on “let’s absolutely not do anything that other companies are doing or not follow any trends”; hence, they didn’t see Elden Ring Nightreign as “chasing a trend” but as elements that will work within their “multiplayer-focused session-based gameplay.”</p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign was revealed last year at The Game Awards as a spinoff co-op action-adventure game slated to release in 2025. The game will allow you to play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo or as a trio</a> on a smaller map based on the Limgrave region, with randomised enemies for each playthrough. The title is arriving for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam.</p>



<p>In other news, Elden Ring Nightreign’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-will-have-a-network-test-starting-february-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">network test will be on February 14</a>. Here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-join-the-elden-ring-nightreign-network-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to register for it</a>.

<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket recently released a statement on the Trading Feature, accepting that the restrictions are preventing players from enjoying the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s new post on <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1885447974094070090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> discusses why trading features were implemented and the feedback it has received. The developers revealed that the “item requirements and restrictions” have been imposed so that players do not “abuse” the trading feature with bots or “other prohibited actions,” such as using multiple accounts. Their goal with these restrictions has been to provide a fair and balanced environment for the players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the Pokemon TCG Pocket developers have admitted that these trading restrictions haven’t hampered the player experience, and hence, they will introduce new changes. After the feedback, the developers are “actively investing ways to improve the feature to address these concerns” Moreover, they plan to introduce more channels for players to obtain trade tokens, “including through event distributions”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The comments section of this post is filled with players providing their opinions and solutions for Pokemon TCG Pocket’s trading restrictions. Some players have issues with the number of <a href="https://x.com/Lumix_Corrupt/status/1885448532187812345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trading tokens required to trade</a>; reducing them should be enough for the feature to be enjoyed. Others have stated they want other restrictions to be removed, too, such as allowing trading <a href="https://x.com/jedi_flodux/status/1885448458300948925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">between friends and non-friends</a>, trading cards of any rarity, and more.&nbsp;</p>

Also, the developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-real-money-trade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t want players to use real money</a> to trade.

<p>A leaked set photo (below) has revealed Dinky the T-Rex will be popping up in Fallout's second season. For those unaware, Dinky the T-Rex is a roadside attraction found within Novac, a location in the Mojave Wasteland in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas_Official_Game_Guide">Fallout: New Vegas Official Game Guide</a> has to say about Novac and our dinosaur pal:</p>
<p>"Novac is little more than a lonely desert highway motel with multiple buildings that have been fortified for the post-apocalyptic protection of its inhabitable. Watching over them is the landmark of the area: a giant fabricated Tyrannosaurus rex biting off the top of 'The World's 2nd Largest Thermometer'.</p><p>"The interior of 'Dinky' also serves as the city center (a converted gift shop from pre-war times, with a sniper's nest in Dinky's mouth). Dinky is the 'attraction' that drew in tourists. Some of the locals are friendly folk, though most aren't trusting of outsiders."</p>

			<p>The first Final Fantasy VII Rebirth PC patch has gone live today, introducing game stability improvements and more.</p>
<p>The 1.001 patch, which is 17.65 GB big on Steam, improves, as mentioned above, game stability by fixing several unspecified bugs. The patch also fixes the graphics preset to be set to Low when launching the game for the first time on Steam Deck, even when sava data is linked from the cloud, sets DLSS as the default option for anti-aliasing if the NVIDIA upscaler is supported by the system, and updates DirectStorage to the latest version. Sadly, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2909400/view/518578271369035851?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a> don't mention anything regarding performance improvements, so it may be a while until the issues that many are experiencing are addressed.</p>
<p>While Square Enix works on fixing the PC port of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which is a definite step up from the Remake port, though it is still not as good as it should have been, modders are hard at work on improving the game's visuals and introducing <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-mods-ultrawide-fov/">new features</a>. Several 4K texture packs have already been released to enhance<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-greatly-improves-environmental-textures/"> environmental</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-4k-texture-packs-tifa/"> character textures</a>, while some Cheat Engine tables allow players to add <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mod-addresses-pop-in-playable-sephiroth-zack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sephiroth and Zack</a> to the party, who both work quite well in combat but are still far from being complete characters, as it is not yet possible to edit their equipment and Materia.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review</a> of the PS5 version.</p>

            <p>
Unreleased details of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' story and characters have leaked out via an adult cartoon website. 
</p>
<p>
Over the weekend, scans of the game's currently-unreleased art book were posted on a hentai site, before being vigorously pulled offline by publisher Ubisoft.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the internet took notice - and you can now find the art book's 230-plus pages hosted elsewhere on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ig5byz/assassins_creed_shadows_art_book_leaked_on_hentai/">reddit</a> and social media if you so choose.

</figure>
<p>
Included in the art book - images of which we won't include here - are details of the game's major locations, items and characters. 
</p>
<p>
There's detail on what appears to be the game's Templar antagonists that Ubisoft has so far decided to keep schtum about - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">even after last month's Assassin's Creed Shadows hands-on previews</a>.
</p>
<p>
Also included are descriptions of the game's legendary creatures, which I fully hope and expect to be able to tame and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-turned-my-assassins-creed-shadows-hideout-into-a-personal-cat-and-tanuki-sanctuary-human-allies-be-damned">keep in the game's new customisable base</a> alongside my garden variety cats and tanuki. 
</p>
<p>
These are not the same as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>'s mythological fights - such as against Medusa and the Minotaur. Indeed, there's little in the art book that draws heavily on fantasy. Likewise, there's nothing in there on the game's modern day storyline - which is now being told separetely, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animus-hub-revealed-ubisofts-new-assassins-creed-start-screen-and-modern-day-story-wrapper-thats-definitely-not-just-another-launcher">by the series' new Animus Hub</a>.
</p><p>
After its most recent delay, Assassin's Creed Shadows is now set to arrive on 20th March - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">its success may hold a pivotal role in the future of Ubisoft as a whole</a>. Last month, Ubisoft told us exactly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-changed-and-what-didnt-during-assassins-creed-shadows-four-month-delay">what has - and hasn't - changed over the past few months after Shadow's initial delay</a>.

            <p>It looks like Pokémon TCG Pocket will offer all players a guaranteed rare card for the franchise's annual Pokémon Day.</p>
<p>Though not formally confirmed as yet, it's expected that a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-presents-livestream-looks-set-for-next-month">Pokémon Presents 2025 livestream will debut on or around 27th February</a> (the anniversary of Pokémon Red and Green's Japanese launch), and with it comes a few gifts for players, including three "special booster packs from Genetic Apex" - a Mewtwo pack, Charizard pack, and Pikachu pack.</p>

<p>Whilst these packs broadly contain the same cards as usual, a new datamine suggests the fifth card is guaranteed to be of at least four diamonds or higher rarity, including one star or higher cards.</p>
<p>Again, whilst not confirmed just yet, it's thought the promotion will kick off on Pokémon Day, with players getting until 30th April to claim their freebies (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-pokemon-tcg-pocket-pokemon-presents-gift-guaranteed-hit/">TheGamer</a>).</p>

			<p>FromSoftware shocked most of its fans with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of Elden Ring Nightreign, a standalone spin-off focused mainly on a new multiplayer experience that even includes some survival and Battle Royale elements. In an interview posted on <a href="https://fave.co/40ZkkHy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC Gamer's February 2025 magazine</a> (issue 405), Game Director Junya Ishizaki (formerly a Battle Director on Elden Ring) said the goal was not to chase trends.</p>
<p><em>The focus was condensing this experience down: the RPG elements, the exploration, the character building and leveling. We wanted that to feel like it was all coming together and culminating in a boss fight, but in a more concentrated form. For this new sense of accomplishment that you wouldn’t quite find with Elden Ring or our previous titles, we felt like we needed some new mechanics and some new elements to add into that mix. We’ve never really held the stance, ‘Let’s absolutely not do anything that other companies are doing or not follow any trends.’&nbsp;So we didn’t really see this as chasing a trend, but we saw these as interesting elements that could work well within our multiplayer focused session-based gameplay.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign hasn't been designed as a live service game, either. On this topic, Ishizaki explained:</p>
<p><em>We wanted to have a game that felt like a complete package out of the box on the day of purchase, so everything is unlockable… it’s not what we’d consider a ‘live service’ game”. We’re still in the process of thinking about the possibilities [for post-launch content].</em></p>
<p>Players will be able to approach each session differently, according to the Game Director:</p>
<p><em>We wanted the map itself to be a giant dungeon, so players have the chance to traverse and explore a different way every time they play. You have to choose the boss you want to face at the end of the third day. Once you’ve made that choice, maybe you have an idea of how you want to strategize against that boss, and this might change how you approach the map. We wanted to offer players that agency to decide, ‘I need to go after a poison weapon this time to face this boss’.</em></p>
<p>There's no release date for Elden Ring Nightreign yet. However, a large scale network test for console users i<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-coming-next-month-to-consoles-only/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">s coming later this month</a> to evaluate the online systems and possibly get some feedback from testers ahead of the launch date.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sniper-elite-resistance-season-pass%E2%80%94all-contents-price.1098447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-season-pass-all-contents-price/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If Sniper Elite Resistance’s base content isn’t enough, the Season Pass offers more stealth and sniping. It also brings back a familiar face seen throughout Sniper Elite’s DLC over the years. There’s plenty to admire about Resistance’s Season Pass, so let’s take you through it.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> DLC is forthcoming about what it provides. Unlike Sniper Elite’s various editions, there aren’t multiple Season Pass choices, just a standard set of new goodies. It’s a one-off transaction for a big bundle of new Sniper Elite content set to add many hours to its already generous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-sniper-elite-resistance-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game length</a>.</p>



<p>Whether you’re gripped by the tone of Harry Hawker’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-voices-harry-hawker-sniper-elite-resistance-voice-actors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voice actor</a> or need more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">missions</a>, the Season Pass has it all.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-sniper-elite-resistance-season-pass">Everything Included in Sniper Elite Resistance Season Pass</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We meet again. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Sniper Elite Resistance Season Pass includes new weapon and character skins, fresh guns, and four brand-new missions to complete.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick rundown of every piece of new content included in the Season Pass:</p>



<ul>
<li>1 Character Skin Packs.</li>



<li>3 Campaign Missions.</li>



<li>3 Weapon Packs.</li>



<li>3 Weapon Skin Packs.</li>



<li>Target Führer Campaign Mission—Lights, Camera, Achtung.</li>
</ul>



<p>There aren’t many specifics when it comes to the nature of the skins or weapons. However, thanks to the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3258690/Sniper_Elite_Resistance_Season_Pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Page</a>, we know to expect “A bolstered cache of authentic World War II weapons.”</p>



<p>Lights, Camera, Achtung is a day-one release. The series tradition of having a DLC mission where you kill Adolf Hitler makes a return. Infiltrate the German leader’s secure area and take him out in a variety of creative ways.</p>



<p>The rest of the content is expected to drop between “<strong>January—March 2025</strong>.” Many Season Passes and instances of post-launch content are dropped periodically in the months after release. So at least you don’t have to wait too long to get everything extra you’ve paid for! </p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-sniper-elite-resistance-season-pass">How Much is The Sniper Elite Resistance Season Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s $34.99 or £29.99 if you want the Sniper Elite Resistance Season Pass on your platform of choice.</strong></p>



<p>With Lights, Camera, Achtung, and an extra three missions on the way, this represents many hours of new content. Given Sniper Elite’s penchant for replayability, this DLC is sure to occupy your time.</p>



<p>Also, if you’re only interested in the Lights, Camera, Achtung Hitler mission, it’s available as a standalone purchase for <strong>$6.99</strong> or <strong>£5.79</strong>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>' game director has reflected on last week's announcement that the free-to-play brawler's fifth season will be its last.</p>
<p>On Friday, developer Player First Games confirmed Season 5 will end on 30th May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-fighter-multiversus-makes-a-return-in-may">roughly a year after its post-beta rerelease</a>. At this time, the studio said the game will be playable offline "for the foreseeable future", but it would be pulled from Epic Games Store, Steam, and both the PlayStation and Microsoft stores.</p>
<p>Following a few days of silence following this news - and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1iew7s0/the_development_of_multiversus_was_problematic/">rumours mismanagement was a key factor in the game's shutdown</a> -  MultiVersus' director Tony Huynh has now shared his own thoughts on the situation, stating he is in "deep mourning for the game", and "nobody wanted this outcome".</p>

<p>Writing on social media platform X, Huynh said he was "sad about the outcome", but remains "grateful for the opportunity given to us by Warner  Bros. Games and to each and every developer on the Player First Games and WB Games teams". The director additionally thanked all those who had lent their IP to the game, which included an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-characters-roster-unlock-free-rotation-9024">eclectic roster of playable characters from DC to Game of Thrones</a>.</p><p>"We hope we made the characters true to themselves and felt authentic to your fans," Huynh wrote. "I couldn't be prouder of the work the [Player First Games] team did. Their endless creativity and passion never ceased to inspire and amaze me. And of course I wanted to thank every player who has ever played or supported MultiVersus. Delighting and serving players is Player First Games' objective."</p>
<p>Huynh went on to apologise for not addressing MultiVersus' ending sooner, stating his focus has been on the game and the team. He then appeared to address claims it was his fault MultiVersus is getting shut down.</p>
<p>"I don't have the power some [of] you think I do," he wrote, adding the studio is "a highly collaborative team" and "ideas are encouraged and can come from anyone and we promote delivering value to players".</p>
<p>Huynh continued: "I also hope that the community notices that we try to listen and act. Like any developer we're limited by time and resources.</p>
<p>"I know that this is painful for everyone, and I know every member of PFG feels it too, but I have to call this out, you're entitled to what you say and think, but when there are threats to harm it's crossing the line. I hope that you can take a step back and realise that this is an extremely sad time for the team. I am in deep mourning for the game.</p>
<p>"Nobody wanted this outcome and it wasn't from lack of caring or effort."</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thats-all-folks-another-warner-bros-live-service-bites-the-dust">news of MultiVersus' end</a> followed an announcement earlier in January that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">Warner Bros. Games boss David Haddid is leaving the company after 12 years</a>. His departure follows the disappointment of fellow live-service hopeful <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, and the inability for Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions to replicate the same success as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players will still be able to access all earned and purchased content while offline via the local gameplay mode and training mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While real-money transactions for MultiVersus are no longer available, fans can still use Gleamium and character tokens to access in-game content until support ends on May 30. MultiVersus will also be delisted from the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, Steam, and Epic Games Store at this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the announcement, and without word of a refund policy, MultiVersus players who bought the $100 premium Founder's Pack hit out at Warner Bros. and Player First Games, with some saying they felt “scammed.” Based on online reports, there are a number of disgruntled customers who have character tokens that are now rendered useless, given they had already unlocked all playable characters in the game. Predictably, MultiVersus is also getting review-bombed on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tony Huynh, co-founder of Player First Games and game director of MultiVersus, <a href="https://x.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1886119648480915954" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to address player concerns and call out threats of violence directed at the team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Huynh’s statement in full:</p><blockquote>Hey all, I wanted to say a few words as I reflect on the recently announced news about MultiVersus. While I'm sad about the outcome, I will forever be grateful for the opportunity given to us by Warner  Bros. Games and to each and every developer on the Player First Games and WB Games teams. Also to every IP holder thank you for entrusting us with your babies, we hope we made the characters true to themselves and felt authentic to your fans. I couldn’t be prouder of the work the PFG team did. Their endless creativity and passion never ceased to inspire and amaze me. And of course I wanted to thank every player who has ever played or supported MultiVersus. Delighting and serving players is Player First Games objective.</blockquote><blockquote>I apologize for not addressing things sooner, there’s been a lot going on and I’ve been focused on the game and the team, but now more-so the team.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for sending us all the great fan art, character ideas, and personal stories. They were the highlight of every day and always excited the team.</blockquote><blockquote>I’m sorry if we couldn’t get to your favorite character. I do think Aquaman and Lola are really cool and I hope you all check them out. Character selection comes down to bunch of things including development time, listening to what the community wants, working with IP holders and approvals, if there is a cross-marketing opportunity available to support, and of course if the team is inspired to make the character. So a lot goes into to it.</blockquote><blockquote>For instance BananaGuard came about because the team was enthusiastic about making it and on their own produced it over the weekend as a fun, quick-to-make character. When inspiration and enthusiasm spark we want to reward that and we got BananaGuard because of that. It wasn’t at the expense of another character. It was because the team was excited about making the character.</blockquote><blockquote>I don’t have the power some you think I do. PFG is a highly collaborative team and ideas are encouraged and can come from anyone and we promote delivering value to players</blockquote><blockquote>I also hope that the community notices that we try to listen and act. Like any developer we’re limited by time and resources.</blockquote><blockquote>I know that this is painful for everyone, and I know every member of PFG feels it too, but I have to call this out, you’re entitled to what you say and think, but when there are threats to harm it’s crossing the line. I hope that you can take a step back and realize that this is an extremely sad time for the team. I am in deep mourning for the game. Nobody wanted this outcome and it wasn’t from lack of caring or effort.</blockquote><blockquote>I sincerely hope that Season 5 is enjoyed with the time we have left and that you will all continue supporting other platform fighter and fighting games as these games have impacted me in many positive ways. I’ve made so many friends and created so many great memories because of these games, and a big reason why we worked so hard at PFG was to share that with you. I hope that we played a small part and that you can look back on MVS and find some joy in the friends you made and the memories you shared.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for allowing this dream to become a reality even if for a briefer time than we would have wanted. I don’t know what the future holds for any of all of us, but I just wanted to say thank you. It has been an honor to work alongside the team at PFG to serve our community and players.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Player First Games community manager and game developer Angelo Rodriguez Jr. took to <a href="https://x.com/AJAX_HQ/status/1886134953546838238" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> to defend Huynh, stressing: “Receiving threats of physical harm against him is not and will never be the way.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I've legitimately been losing sleep over the past few days watching as all of these has been happening to Tony,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The man who would stay up past midnight with us watching streams and listened for fun ideas from the players. The man who took the time to read so many messages and respond to so many people when he didn't have to. The man who spent countless hours working with every department to try and improve things we could in the weeks we had to do it. The man who went out of his way to hire so many of us from the community and gave us a shot at being involved in something so special. Tony is not who he is being painted out to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know things aren't the best right now and everyone is looking for answers. Receiving threats of physical harm against him is not and will never be the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“PFG poured their heart into this game and we still hope everyone enjoys season 5. We never stopped pushing for improvements and again you will see 50 pages worth of them this season. I hope everyone can take the time to read through what Tony has to say, and I hope you will all think things through.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MultiVersus’ demise is the latest high-profile failure for Warner Bros. Games, following Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s disastrous launch last year.

Warner Bros. has yet to announce Rocksteady’s next game, but it is reportedly helping out on a director’s cut of Hogwarts Legacy.

Sony is set to hold its next PlayStation State of Play broadcast next week, according to a new report.
</p>
<p>
The tip comes from NateTheHate, a leaker with a long track record who accurately reported last month's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2 reveal date</a> ahead of time. 
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, the leaker <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1885748440132456877">teased</a> Sony's upcoming broadcast is currently expected to arrive around Valentine's Day - which is the end of next week.

<p>
Sony has streamed a State of Play broadcast each year in February since 2021, and typically uses the show to lay out its list of big first-party and third-party exclusives for the year.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-sonys-playstation-state-of-play-2">Last year's big show</a> (held on 31st January, before a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>-specific State of Play aired in early February) highlighted <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>, Foamstars, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-the-short-message">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a>, Judas, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-guides-tips-tricks-9422">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, Rise of the Ronin, Until Dawn and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, among others. The biggest surprise of the show was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-fans-after-sickness-made-him-reconsider-his-priorities">Hideo Kojima popping in to announce Physint</a>, a fresh game that's set to hark back to the creator's Metal Gear Solid action-espionage roots.
</p><p>
So, what do we expect from State of Play this year? Well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reveals-ghost-of-yotei-the-follow-up-to-ghost-of-tsushima">PlayStation is set to launch its samurai sequel Ghost of Yotei this year</a> - and could do well to announce some kind of launch window to space it out from Assassin's Creed Shadows. 
</p>
<p>
We're also expecting to hear more about Bungie's shooter reboot Marathon, and potentially Haven's live-service Fairgame$. Kojima may pop in to chat more about Death Stranding 2, which is out this year. And then there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">Marvel's Wolverine - will it make 2025?</a>
</p>
<p>PlayStation's livestream will follow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-during-the-xbox-developer-direct-2025">last month's Xbox Developer Direct</a>, which gave us a look at South of Midnight, Doom: The Dark Ages, Ninja Gaiden 4, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - the last four of which will all arrive on PS5.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-4k-texture-packs-tifa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">character improvement texture mod</a>, here's another Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod that improves the game's visuals. This time, the so-called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/198?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natural Fantasy mod</a> is focused on improving the environmental textures via 2x upscaling, specifically these textures (around 1300 of them):</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Trees<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Cliffs<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Rocks<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Stones<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Ground<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Grass<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Flowers<br>
</span></li>
<li><span>Puddles<br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The improvements are rather noticeable in the provided comparison pictures.</p>

<p>The author reported between 5% and 20% performance hit, depending on the graphics card. However, they recommend the mod only to players with 8GB+ VRAM graphics cards and NVME SSDs. Moreover, they warn that sometimes the game's texture streaming issues may well prevent the sharper textures from correctly appearing. The following tweaks to the Engine.ini file were provided to mitigate the issue:</p>
<p>r.Streaming.PoolSize=20000 (Adjust to 80% Your VRAM)<br>
r.Streaming.LimitPoolSizeToVRAM=0<br>
r.Streaming.UseFixedPoolSize=0<br>
r.Streaming.PrioritizeMeshLODRetention=1<br>
r.Streaming.SkeletalMeshResidentLODBias=-1<br>
r.Streaming.StaticMeshResidentLODBias=-1<br>
r.Streaming.TextureResidentLODBias=-1<br>
r.Streaming.UseAllMips=1<br>
r.Streaming.UseMaterialData=1<br>
r.Streaming.MaxTempMemoryAllowed=10000<br>
r.Streaming.PoolSizeForMeshes=5000</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launched a few days ago on PC. So far, Steam user reviews are 'Mostly Positive' at 75% on average. The game has improved graphics features (better character models and lighting) over the PlayStation 5 version, though it lacks some common PC-specific features. For example, while it does support NVIDIA DLSS and DLAA, there's no native support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution or Intel XeSS.</p>
<p>Moreover, there's no frame generation, and the maximum frame rate is capped at 120 by default.&nbsp; However, there are workarounds for that, too. You can either use <a href="https://github.com/Lyall/FF7RebirthFix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Fix</a>, which also lets you tweak the field of view (FoV), disable vignette, and adjust the size of subtitles, or FFVIIHook, which is an INI and dev console unlocked that lets the game read variables as with a regular Unreal Engine 4 title, allowing for greater tweaking.</p>
<p>If you're still on the fence about Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, make sure to read our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perfect score review of the PlayStation 5 version</a>.</p>

<p>An insider has said that PlayStation next State of Play is on its way in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>That’s according to gaming insider <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NateTheHate</a>, who’s had a good track record of revealing gaming announcements and reveals prior to being official.</p>



<p>According to Nate, the next PlayStation State of Play is in February, with the insider teasing that it could be on Valentine’s Day.

<p>PlayStation’s last State of Play took place in September 2024, featuring games like Astro Bot, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-revealed-at-state-of-play-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>.</p>



<p>As of the time of writing, it’s currently unclear on what the next PlayStation State of Play could feature, but it’s likely to include Kojima Productions Death Stranding 2: On The Beach and Ghost of Yōtei, both of which are scheduled to release later this year.</p>



<p>Other announcements could include the Horizon multiplayer game, Fairplay$, or Bungie’s Marathon, which was rumored to release later this year.</p>

<p>Atlanta FaZe just pulled off a remarkable reverse sweep at the Call of Duty League Major in Madrid. After a fairly dominant opener that saw LAT blitz FaZe, Atlanta switched things up during the mid-series Control and never slowed down. It boiled down to a round eleven showdown during map five that was quickly mopped up by FaZe.</p>



<p>The LA Thieves will now fall into the final fixture of the elimination bracket, going head-to-head (again) with the Miami Heretics. Earlier in the tournament, the LA Thieves booted Miami into the lower bracket after a 3-0 sweep.</p>



<p>Talking on stage after the match, Drazah had some choice words for the LA Thieves.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rivalry-renewed">Rivalry Renewed</h2>



<p>The LA Thieves and Atlanta FaZe represent two of the biggest dogs in the CDL fight. They’re fronted by some of the sharpest talent in the Call of Duty League, and they have the most valuable rosters to boot.</p>



<p>This face-off series was never going to go any other way than to the wire – which is exactly what happened. With it coming down to single-digit kill counts, Atlanta FaZe prevailed, earning the first ticket to the grand final series of the Madrid Major.</p>



<p>On stage in the post-match interview, Drazah fired shots at LA Thieves:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m feeling great – those guys are <strong>frauds</strong>. It’s Sunday, we’re on LAN, reverse-sweep, this shit is easy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the last few weeks, the LA Thieves roster has been wrestling with the title of ‘Super Team’, which was branded upon the squad when it was assembled last year. For many, LAT hasn’t yet lived up to those lofty expectations, which is a sticking point for sure.</p>



<p>LA Thieves will now contend with the Miami Heretics for the sole remaining spot in the grand final. There’s a $150,000 prize awaiting the winner of Major I – who will secure it? Find out in just a couple of hours.</p>
