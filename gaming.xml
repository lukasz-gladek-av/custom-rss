            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> has now sold over 28.6m copies worldwide, outselling the entire Dark Souls series prior to its release.</p>
<p>Announcing the news of spin-off game Elden Ring: Nightreign last week, publisher Bandai Namco revealed the new sales total for Elden Ring as of September 2024.</p>
<p>Back in June, the open-world epic had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-shipped-25m-units-worldwide">shipped 25m copies</a>, meaning since the release of expansion <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> the game has sold an additional 3.6m copies - and even more since September.</p>

<p>Prior to Elden Ring's release in February 2022, the entire Dark Souls series had sold 27m copies combined, according to Niko Partners director of research and insights Daniel Ahmad.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Fun Fact: The entire Dark Souls series had sold 27 million units combined prior to Elden Ring's release. </p><p>Now Elden Ring alone has surpassed that total. <a href="https://t.co/Y8yLNzdhfZ">https://t.co/Y8yLNzdhfZ</a></p></div>— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1868133441243394315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Now, the Dark Souls series has <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Soulsborne">reportedly sold over 39m copies</a>, suggesting Elden Ring has prompted a significant boost in sales of previous games.</p>
<p>In short, Elden Ring has been a phenomenal success for FromSoftware. It's now the 28th best-selling game ever, outselling the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, GTA: San Andreas, and Pokémon Sword and Shield.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-is-making-more-elden-ring-after-all-with-the-co-op-elden-ring-night-reign">Elden Ring: Nightreign was revealed</a> at last week's The Game Awards: it's an online co-op spin-off set in a parallel world with roguelite elements as players attempt to outlast a three day-and-night cycle before facing the Nightlord.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-co-op-spin-off-nightreign-network-test-announced-and-you-can-register-for-it-soon">network test for Nightreign</a> will take place in February next year, with registration starting on 10th January.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hideki Kamiya has stated if he'd continued working for Platinum Games his "artistic spirit [would] die".</p>
<p>The former Platinum vice-president has launched a new studio with another former Platinum employee, Kaneto Koyama, as discussed in a new interview with Japanese outlet <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/2412133p">denfaminicogamer</a>.</p>
<p>The pair have set up Clovers, which will develop a sequel to the much-loved Okami, originally developed by Kamiya at Clover Studio.</p>

<p>"This is purely my personal opinion, but I thought, 'If I continue working here, my artistic spirit will die'," said Kamiya on his reasons for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bayonetta-creator-hideki-kamiya-leaving-platinumgames">leaving Platinum last year</a> (via machine translation).</p>
<p>"I can understand the way PlatinumGames is as a company and its logic, and I was in the position of vice president myself, but as an individual named Hideki Kamiya, I was unable to embrace that way of thinking."</p>
<p>As vice president, Kamiya was "field-first" at Platinum Games - he described himself as the muscle and CEO Atsushi Inaba as the brains.</p>
<p>"The signals sent from the cerebrum are essential for muscles," Kamiya continued. "At the same time, those signals must be reliable for muscles. Until then, I had received those signals, trusted them, and worked to maximize my own strength...but with regards to the future direction of Platinum with Inaba at the helm, I was no longer able to place my trust in them and exert my strength as a muscle."</p>
<p>Kamiya has been quite vocal about his decision to leave Platinum Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-left-platinum-games-due-to-issue-of-trust">previously stating there were issues of "trust"</a>.</p>
<p>He then launched a YouTube channel where he discussed his next project. "I already have a clear idea in mind," he said. "I would like to translate this vision in my head into a full proposal as soon as I am able to do so. And of course, I also have an idea of what I can do to make the project a reality. But if you ask me specifically what kind of game it will be, all I can say at this stage is, 'It'll be a Hideki Kamiya game'."</p>
<p>It's unclear if that project is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">new Okami sequel</a>, announced as in-development at this year's The Game Awards last week.</p>

</figure>
<p>In this new interview, Kamiya and Koyama explained the Clovers name of the new studio. It's been interpreted as "C lovers", with four Cs relating to the four leaves of a clover.</p>
<p>Only three Cs are set in stone though: challenge, creativity, and craftsmanship. The fourth C is for employees to decide upon themselves.</p>
<p>In a previous interview, Kamiya stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okamis-initial-sales-were-huge-failure-says-director-hideki-kamiya">Okami's sales were a "huge failure"</a> and that had the game been more successful Clover Studio probably would have continued.</p>
<p>Little is known about the new Okami game, beyond the above teaser image.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> producer and Game Science CEO Feng Ji has posted a lengthy statement following the action game's apparent snub for the top prize at this year's The Game Awards.</p>
<p>"The games nominated this year were all exceptional, but honestly, I still can't figure out what the criteria were for Game of the Year. I feel like I came all the way here for nothing!" he wrote in a post on <a href="https://weibo.com/6603744955/5111567333196223">Weibo</a> (translated on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1he81dp/game_producer_of_black_myth_wukongs_post_after_tga/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a>).</p>

<p>"Since last night, I've seen a lot of strong dissatisfaction and frustration in players' comments - often expressed humorously or ironically, which made me laugh," the producer continued.</p>
<p>"I completely understand these feelings and share the frustration, because behind these emotions lies not pain or malice, but dignity and confidence."</p>
<p>Feng Ji even admitted he wrote his Game of the Year acceptance speech two years ago, "only to never get the chance to deliver it".</p>
<p>It's unclear how joking he has been in his statement, especially considering the machine translation, but some have read it as rather salty. Eurogamer has contacted Game Science for further comment.</p>
<p>The producer continued to express his confidence in the game and his hopes the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> is the beginning of a new wave of high-quality, engaging games from Chinese developers.</p>
<p>Former Sony Santa Monica writer Alanah Pearce shared in a stream she witnessed a person from the Game Science team crying in the audience when the game didn't win. "It clearly meant a lot to them, they did an amazing thing, but I did find that surprising," said Pearce.</p>

			<p>Larian Studios prepared a nifty Christmas video for its large community of fans. First and foremost, greetings from every office worldwide are included: Kuala Lumpur, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-opens-new-office-in-warsaw-to-help-make-its-two-very-ambitious-new-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warsaw</a>, Ghent (the headquarters), Barcelona, Guildford, Dublin, and Quebec.</p>
<p>Then, the focus returns to Senior Communications Developer Aoife Wilson, who claims she's got one more thing. It's a big gift with a 'Larian's Next Game' tag on it. She's got just enough time to shake it once before Larian CEO Swen Vincke jokingly tackles her off-screen, though. Vincke said:</p>
<p><em>Oh no, you don't! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sorry, sorry about that. No, this thing, it needs a lot more time in the oven. By the time it's going to be finished, it's going to be so big! For the time being you're going to have to wait.</em></p>
<p>And then he proceeds to kick the package far away. I have to say, I certainly wasn't expecting them to start teasing the game so soon. After all, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Baldur's Gate 3 in August 2023, and we only <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-no-sequel-dlc-larian-dropping-dungeons-and-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> they wouldn't do DLCs or a sequel in March.</p>
<p>Moreover, Vincke himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-says-next-game-may-come-in-2029/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> not long ago that the next title could come as late as 2029. Sure, he also later added that it was kind of a throwaway line, and he did not want Larian to be beholden to a date. However, a lot of time is clearly needed. After all, Baldur's Gate 3 was revealed ahead of E3 2019 and only launched out of early access more than four years later. From the sound of it, this one will be similarly big, and triple-A development times are only increasing with each new release.</p>

<p>Perhaps this very early tease is an indirect confirmation that the studio's next project will also be released on early access. While this won't make its full launch come any quicker (in fact, the opposite might be true), it would put an early version of it in the hands of the players a lot sooner, probably in the next two to three years.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the studio's fans must be patient. In the meantime, there's their <a href="https://advent.larian.com/intro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent Calendar</a> Web game to go through. Speaking of actual videogames, Larian has at least one major Baldur's Gate 3 update <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-to-get-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-and-photo-mode-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled</a> for next year. It will add cross-play for cooperative multiplayer, a built-in Photo Mode, and twelve new subclasses to the award-winning cRPG.</p>

			<p>According to a new rumor, LEGO Horizon Adventures might be coming to Xbox after all. As you might remember, Microsoft's console was the only one left out of the fun, with the game launching right away on PC, Nintendo Switch, and, obviously, PlayStation. Ahead of the game's launch, Guerrilla Games (which partnered with Studio Gobo to make the spin-off) <a href="https://wccftech.com/guerrilla-games-provides-unconvincing-reason-as-to-why-lego-horizon-adventures-isnt-coming-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a rather unconvincing explanation for the absence:</p>
<p><em>Right now, we're just very much focused on pushing this hardware to its limits and making this game look as absolutely amazing as it can possibly be on this hardware, and you know, we don't really have anything to announce about Xbox right now.</em></p>
<p>The rumor was <a href="https://justplayit.info/news/sony-game-coming-to-xbox-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by Just Play It, though, which doesn't really have a track record when it comes to these leaks. Take it with a big grain of salt, but they're saying the reason is LEGO Horizon Adventures only had a modest commercial performance. They also provide a potential release window for the Xbox version: early 2025.</p>
<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures attempted to retell Aloy's first adventure in a manner more befitting for younger audiences. However, the game wasn't quite as successful as the original. It got 6.5 out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lego-horizon-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, a much lower score than Horizon Zero Dawn. Reviewer Nathan Birch shared these final thoughts about the game:</p>
<p><em>Lego Horizon Adventures just feels a bit… underbuilt. The main campaign can be finished in around 7 hours, and while there are some extras you can pursue, like rebuilding the game’s Mother's Heart hub and revisiting levels to take down high-level machines, even dedicated players probably won't spend much more than a dozen hours with the game. A kid's game being on the short side isn't the end of the world, but the bigger issue is that I didn’t really want more -- by the end of its short campaign, I was already feeling ready to return this one to the Lego bin.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot Games Confirms Policy Change Regarding Betting Sponsorships]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-policy-change-betting-sponsorships/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot-games-confirms-policy-change-regarding-betting-sponsorships.1062237/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-policy-change-betting-sponsorships/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Last week, I covered a rumour suggesting that Riot Games was preparing to make a major policy change. It was said that the gaming titan was about to allow VALORANT and League esports teams to accept betting companies as sponsors for the first time.</p>



<p>Riot Games has confirmed to Insider Gaming that this is the case. In 2025, partnered League of Legends esports teams and VALORANT Champions Tour teams in the Americas and EMEA <strong>will be allowed </strong>to explore such partnerships.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cultural-shift">Cultural Shift</h2>



<p>For the longest time, Riot Games has been against gambling sponsors in the esports scene it upholds. It has also been against cryptocurrency-based sponsors.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://x.com/RiotMagus/status/1868476361884774487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a> that was issued by Riot Games Esports’ COO, it has been made clear that things are about to change:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>A few weeks ago, we told partnered LoL Esports and VCT teams in Americas and EMEA that starting in 2025, they’ll be allowed to explore partnerships with Riot-approved betting platforms. This decision wasn’t made lightly—it’s the result of careful study and planning to settle on a move that will unlock new revenue opportunities for teams while also protecting competitive integrity and the overall fan experience.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Here are two important things to know:&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>1. Riot-owned channels will stay betting-free. No betting brands will appear on our broadcasts, socials, or jerseys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>2. Riot will vet all potential betting partners to meet our standards for integrity, transparency, and fan engagement. All sports books partnering with teams will need to meet local regulatory and licensing requirements and match Riot requirements around content and promotion for this category.</em></p>



<p><em>This is a new sponsorship category for our esports, and we’ll approach it thoughtfully. We’ll learn a lot along the way, and we’ll make changes if at any point this compromises the integrity of the sport or impacts the high-quality experience our fans have today. Depending on how this initial implementation goes, we’ll evaluate opportunities to expand—or refine—our approach in the future.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Naturally, this announcement garnered blowback from the fans of the competitive scenes who are vehemently against gambling.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that esports betting makes up around 50% of the industry’s global revenue, but that doesn’t mean everyone agrees with the notion of it.</p>



<p>What do you think about this policy change? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Regardless of which one you pick, Horizon Adventures will unsurprisingly look and run better on PS5 than Nintendo Switch. If you have both consoles, the PS5 version is the better choice--unless you want the portability of the Switch. Regardless of which you pick, though, this is the best-looking Lego game on either platform (and just in general).</p><p>It's a fun, lighthearted take on Guerrilla's Horizon franchise. No prior knowledge of the series is needed to enjoy it, as the story borrows from Zero Dawn and is self-contained. That said, the story is secondary to the action and exploration. It's a fun, if familiar, adventure for fans of licensed Lego games, especially if you play couch co-op with another player.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-gta-6-most-expensive-game-ever/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, rumours have been circulating suggesting that GTA 6’s development cycle has – so far – set Rockstar back between $1 – 2 billion. This would easily make it the most expensive game ever developed, sitting some way ahead of Destiny (2014 – $500m), Cyberpunk 2077 (2020 – $330m), and Modern Warfare 2 (2009 – $310m).</p>



<p>Even Grand Theft Auto V, released in 2013, only cost Rockstar around $250m to develop. But, when that game launched, it raked in more than $1 billion in just three days – so it’s safe to say that the exorbitant development fee was well and truly earned back.</p>



<p>But is GTA 6 set to dwarf all of these previous titles? If the budget <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/gta/news-gta-6-reportedly-going-expensive-video-game-ever-made" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">‘leaked’ in 2023</a> is accurate, then it will be.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-could-be-the-most-ambitious-game-ever">GTA 6 Could Be The Most Ambitious Game Ever</h2>



<p>Well, it depends on how you define ‘ambitious’. </p>



<p>What about Starfield, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-starfield-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with 1000 fully explorable planets</a>? Or how about Ghost Recon: Wildlands, which was <em>supposed </em>to boast a living, breathing world, with every NPC having a purpose and a life of their own?</p>



<p>If <a href="https://twitter.com/DexertoGaming/status/1655987337669509177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the rumours are true</a>, then GTA 6 will be the most expensive game ever developed. It’s also the most highly-anticipated title in history, and for more than a decade, players have been locked firmly in on GTA 5, desperately awaiting concrete news regarding the development of the next game in the series.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-leaks-online-with-90-gameplay-videos/">a massive leak</a> that saw 100GB of data posted online, Rockstar Games had no choice but to come out and admit that it was working on the next Grand Theft Auto game, but that was it. For a while, anyway. In December 2023, the team released the first trailer for GTA 6, uncovering what could be the best game ever made:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>There has been an exponential increase in the development cost of Grand Theft Auto games since the series began, but if the rumours are to be believed, then GTA 6 has set a new bar for monumentally expensive games:</p>



<ul>
<li>Grand Theft Auto (1997) – $1 – 2 million*</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto 2 (1999) – $3 – 4 million*</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto 3 (2001) – $5 million*</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002) – $5 million</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004) – $10 million</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto IV (2008) – $100 million</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V (2013) – $250 million</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto 6 (2025?) – $1 – 2 billion</li>
</ul>



<p>(*Estimated based on research)</p>



<p>If we work with that data, then we can assume that both time-wise and financially, the next GTA title might cost around $3 billion to produce and it’ll take around fifteen years for it to be released. But that’s just me having fun with the numbers – don’t quote that.</p>



<p>At the time of publishing, <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/0LCX:LON?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiCmPiIyOz-AhVHdcAKHWBkB_0Q3ecFegQIFxAa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two is worth some $32.5 billion</a>, so around $1.5 billion spread out over the course of a decade to develop GTA 6 doesn’t really seem all that unrealistic – especially when you consider how much this game is going to make when it finally does release.</p>



<p><em>Finally</em>.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 has finally been revealed by Rockstar Games, and we have received our first detailed look at the map. In the trailer that was released by Rockstar, we saw a showcase of sorts, with much of the GTA 6 map being shown, revealing swamps, forests, white beaches, islands, and a dense, urban sprawl, dripping with neon. That’s all well and good, but where is GTA 6 set, and is it somewhere we’ve been before?</p>



<p>Let’s learn about the new GTA 6 map.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-gta-6-map-is-massive">The GTA 6 Map Is Massive</h2>



<p>We now know that GTA 6 is set in Leonida, a fictional state that’s reminiscent of Florida. Like GTA 5’s San Andreas, there’s a city at the heart of the map, which back then was Los Santos. This time around, the beating centre of the map is Vice City, which players will remember from 2002’s game of the same name. It’s a modern-day rendition, though – but it retains much of that ‘1980s vibe’. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c12j12N4yVU">the GTA 6 trailer</a>, we got a relatively full look at the new map for the game, which is scheduled to be released in 2025. We saw airboats skimming through dangerous swamps, planes soaring over glistening blue oceans and white, sandy beaches, and thick traffic sitting bumper to bumper amidst skyscrapers and neon-toting nightclubs. </p>



<p>Check out the trailer here:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>It certainly looks like a diverse map, and it’s going to be bursting at the seams with opportunities to explore it for hundreds of hours. </p>



<p>If you came here wondering where is GTA 6 set, we hope that answers your question!</p>

That’s the idea behind Retro Mod Works’ <a href="https://www.retromodworks.com/product-page/ps-placeable">PS Placeable</a>, a mod that “consolizes” the PSP and was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMQ-yDYdgks">featured yesterday in a video</a> from the YouTube channel Macho Nacho Productions. </p><p>Retro Mod Works charges $274.99 for a prebuilt PS Placeable. Those are waitlisted at the moment, though — a message on the site says the project is a “one man show” and that the demand for the Placeable was higher than anticipated. </p><p>Retro also offers to mod customer-provided PSPs for $100 less, and there’s an option <a href="https://www.retromodworks.com/product-page/psp-bt-mod-kit">preorder DIY parts</a> and do the conversion work yourself. The mod requires either a PSP-2000 or PSP-3000 revision, as the first PSP didn’t have a video output. It’s not clear when the DIY parts will ship — we’ve asked Retro Mod Works and will update if we get a reply.</p><div><figcaption><em>A stack of PS Placeables.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Retro Mod Works</cite></p></div><p>The primary person behind the project, named Dan, told Macho Nacho host Tito Perez that he “hated the idea of buying digital games” for which he has physical copies, and wanted a way to add Bluetooth controller support while preserving the UMD drive. He’s also mentioned in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSP/comments/1e3bw4a/what_should_we_name_this_the_play_station/lddy4me/">replies on Reddit</a> that his goal is to help people revive broken PSPs with the mod, which doesn’t need the console’s screen.</p><p>But buying one of these mod kits can be pricey or require skills most people don’t have.

<p>Call of Duty has been one of the most popular franchises in gaming for quite some time now. The series has worked hard to release titles every year, making it one of the biggest franchises in the world. </p>



<p>Games like Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops and more have stolen the spotlight as some of the greatest games of all time. Here is a list of all Call of Duty games in order.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-call-of-duty-game-in-order">Every Call of Duty Game in Order</h2>



<p>Call of Duty has made its staple as one of the most consistent franchises of all time. The series has been releasing a new game every year, with them only recently announcing they were switching to releasing a game every other year. </p>



<p>Still, with a new game every other year, Call of Duty continues to keep fans excited, and even pull back old players. Their constant remaking of famous maps and continuous storylines (Modern Warfare series, Black Ops series and more) has also grabbed the attention of players. </p>



<p>So, when <strong>was </strong>every Call of Duty game released?</p>

<p>Call of Duty is one of the most exciting esports titles on the market, offering fans a dense schedule packed with entertainment for around eight months of the calendar year. From Warzone to the traditional multiplayer offering of Modern Warfare or Black Ops, there’s a diverse spectrum out there that millions of fans worldwide can appreciate.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m breaking down the highest-earning Call of Duty pro players of all time. There are thousands of competitors out there, but which among them have earned the most money during their careers?</p>



<p>Read on to learn which Call of Duty players have won the most money.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cod-players-ranked-by-earnings">COD Players Ranked by Earnings</h2>



<p>Most of these players are still actively competing, so expect their earnings to change over time.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-dylan-envoy-hannon-984-000">10. Dylan ‘Envoy’ Hannon – $984,000</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Envoy won COD Champs in 2022 while playing for the LA Thieves, which is where the bulk of his winnings came from.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-seth-scump-abner-992-000">9. Seth ‘Scump’ Abner – $992,000</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Scump is arguably the most iconic (retired) competitor in the Call of Duty esports scene. In 2017, he won the Call of Duty Championship.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-anthony-shotzzy-cuevas-castro-1-03-million">8. Anthony ‘Shotzzy’ Cuevas-Castro – $1.03 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Shotzzy is one of the best and most capable COD players in the world. He’s a two-time world champion <strong>and </strong>a world champion in Halo.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-james-clayster-eubanks-1-15-million">7. James ‘Clayster’ Eubanks – $1.15 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Clayster was, when he retired, the most veteran competitor still playing in the COD League. He’s one of the few three-time Call of Duty world champions.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-kenneth-kenny-williams-1-19-million">6. Kenneth ‘Kenny’ Williams – $1.19 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Kenny is a two-time world champion, having secured the trophy in both 2022 and 2024. </p>



<h3 id="h-5-ian-crimsix-porter-1-32-million">5. Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter – $1.32 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Crimsix is the winningest competitor in COD history, having won more tournaments than anyone other player. Before retiring, he’d claimed three world championship titles.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-alec-arcitys-sanderson-1-39-million">4. Alec ‘Arcitys’ Sanderson – $1.39 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Arcitys is no longer in the Call of Duty League, but he has claimed two world championships in almost a decade of active competition, along with many chips.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-mcarthur-cellium-jovel-1-53-million">3. McArthur ‘Cellium’ Jovel – $1.53 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Cellium has represented Atlanta FaZe for years and is often considered one of the best players in COD esports. He secured his first world championship in 2021 and also won the first Esports World Cup in Call of Duty.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-chris-simp-lehr-1-77-million">2. Chris ‘Simp’ Lehr – $1.77 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Simp is a phenomenal player with two world championship wins under his belt at just 23 years of age. He also won the Esports World Cup in Call of Duty in 2024 alongside Cellium and aBeZy.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-tyler-abezy-pharris-1-78-million">1. Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris – $1.78 million</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris is the highest-earning Call of duty player ever, but it’s close. He has won two world titles and secured the top spot at the Esports World Cup in 2024 in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>"Ciara Berkeley was cast as Ciri for The Witcher 4 cinematic reveal trailer," the studio said in a statement to <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-witcher-4-ciri-voice-actor-jo-wyatt-recast-rumours/">TheGamer</a>.</p>
<p>"Ciara is a talented actress who impressed us with her enthusiasm and vocal acting skills, and in this trailer we believe she truly brought Ciri to life in a way that is both faithful to the character and exciting for fans of the series."</p>
<p>The studio did not expand on why Berkeley had been brought in to replace Wyatt, but did confirm to press that Berkeley wasn't only brought in for the trailer, but will portray Ciri in the full game, too.</p>
<p>No, your ears were not deceiving you about Geralt, either. T<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">hat was definitely Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle</a> popping up at the end of the Witcher 4's reveal trailer, and yes, the white-haired monster hunter will absolutely feature in some way in the upcoming game.</p>
<p>While many had assumed as much - let's be honest, it is hard to miss the gravelling tones of Cockle's Geralt - developer CD Projekt has now officially confirmed what we all thought.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Don’t worry about it. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124">Read More</a></span></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/balatro&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/balatro">You can find all our <em>Balatro</em> coverage here</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9b347437446762a60a86cdb8888a3f95" data-recommend-id="image://9b347437446762a60a86cdb8888a3f95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="740" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Strohl, the protagonist, Gallica, and Hulkenburg look at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Strohl, the protagonist, Gallica, and Hulkenburg look at the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9b347437446762a60a86cdb8888a3f95" data-recommend-id="image://9b347437446762a60a86cdb8888a3f95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="740" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Strohl, the protagonist, Gallica, and Hulkenburg look at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-review-pc-ps5-xbox-persona-atlus-1851665876&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-review-pc-ps5-xbox-persona-atlus-1851665876"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a></span>, the new fantasy RPG from the minds behind <em>Persona</em>, is a pretty dense game.

Over a million people have since told Atlus, “<em>We’ll</em> tell <em>you</em> when we’ve had enough,” and bit the bullet on the full game. That’s excellent news for us JRPG sickos, but that demo might give you delusions that all the bosses are just random collections of minions. That is quickly dispelled when you hit the game’s first <em>real </em>challenge. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-zorba-boss-how-to-beat-1851672980&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-zorba-boss-how-to-beat-1851672980">Read More</a></span></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/metaphor-refantazio&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">You can find all our <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> coverage here</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7ee0223cb7d07cb1e5c37490d4dcc463" data-recommend-id="image://7ee0223cb7d07cb1e5c37490d4dcc463" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="740" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Senua looks past the camera with her face half-submerged in water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua looks past the camera with her face half-submerged in water." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ee0223cb7d07cb1e5c37490d4dcc463" data-recommend-id="image://7ee0223cb7d07cb1e5c37490d4dcc463" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="740" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Senua looks past the camera with her face half-submerged in water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em></a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677">Ninja Theory’s</a></span> latest narrative action-adventure game, arrived on May 21, 2024 for Xbox and PC.
