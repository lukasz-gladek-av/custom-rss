            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a PlayStation Portal update that introduces cloud streaming to the device, allowing you to stream over 100 PS5 games to your Portal, but there's a catch, as you might expect.</p>

<p>As outlined in a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, cloud streaming will only be available for PlayStation Plus Premium members. That's right; you won't even be able to take advantage of this feature if you're signed up to PlayStation Plus Extra.</p>

<p>If you do happen to be a Premium member, however, you'll gain access to cloud streaming for "over 120 PS5 games from the PS Plus Game Catalog", including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dave-diver" rel="nofollow"><em>Dave the Diver</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/monster-hunter-rise" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart" rel="nofollow"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></a>, among many others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-playstation-portal-cloud-streaming.jpg?itok=FTRXyhP9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-playstation-portal-cloud-streaming.jpg?itok=oooDm3IT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PlayStation Portal can now stream certain PS5 games via the cloud, but you'll need a PS Plus membership.</figcaption></figure><p>Games will stream at up to 1080p resolution and 60fps on the PlayStation Portal, and you'll also be able to access DualSense features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, as well as the touchpad, which will be emulated via the Portal's touchscreen.</p>

<p>Naturally, cloud storage will also be accessible on the Portal, so you'll be able to access any save files you've got on the cloud for the PS5 games the Portal supports.</p>

<p>In order to access this update, you'll need a PS Plus Premium membership, as well as access to the internet and "minimum 5Mbps of upload and download speeds". That number increases to 7Mbps for 720p and 13Mbps for 1080p.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Portal won't support streaming PS4 or PS3 games, and it also won't support features like party voice chat, 3D audio, or Game Trials.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-miles-morales-playstation-portal-cloud-streaming.jpg?itok=z7LQ69iJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-miles-morales-playstation-portal-cloud-streaming.jpg?itok=7khsLMgq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales&nbsp;</em>and many other PS5 games can now be streamed via your PlayStation Portal.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with the PlayStation Portal, it's a rather curious handheld device that is designed to be used with a PS5 console.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional handhelds, the Portal <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonys-playstation-portal-gets-release-date-while-fans-keep-asking-for-real-portable" rel="nofollow">doesn't support games of its own</a>; rather, it streams games from a linked PS5, allowing you to enjoy PS5 games without needing to hook the console up to your TV (although you will need to do that to complete the initial setup).</p>

<p>As such, it's not a true successor to the likes of the PSP or the ill-fated PS Vita, although this latest update arguably puts the Portal one step closer to being the device it always should have been. The new update started rolling out yesterday, so if it hasn't been released where you live yet, it should arrive soon.</p>

Sony already owns a 2 percent stake in Kadokawa, as well as 14 percent stake in FromSoftware. </p><div><p>Sony’s recent acquisitions have been a sore point for the console maker.

            <p>Did last week's paranormal body-swapper <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slitterhead">Slitterhead</a> leave you cold? Do you consider its brain-jacking of rando cityfolk for monster-hunting purposes a sad waste of potential? Perhaps you'll prefer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ram-random-access-mayhem">RAM: Random Access Mayhem</a>, out now in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2256450/RAM_Random_Access_Mayhem/">Steam early access</a>, in which you're a fugitive AI hopping between warlike robot bodies in top-down view.</p>
<p>Yes, the subtitle involves both a colon and a dad joke, but the demo is entertaining - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nuclear-dawn">Nuclear Dawn</a> meets <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ctrl-alt-ego">Ctrl Alt Ego</a>, in short. The one major criticism I have after 20 minutes or so is that the flat pixelart perspective makes walls and walkable surfaces look interchangeable, and this feels more like a question of acclimatisation than a real complaint.</p><!--more-->

<p>Those robot bodies, then. They range from cheery grenade-throwing dustbins on wheels to punchy gladiators equipped with a grapple. You'll switch between by aiming the cursor and pressing space, but you'll need energy to do so, and energy is, of course, obtained by killing.</p><p>Early-game gambits include teleporting into the head of the robot behind an attacking horde and shooting all the others all in the back. Beyond that, you'll want to possess bots that are strong against the types in play. It feels like there's decent variety: each bot has a primary and a secondary attack, and you can customise them with collectible upgrade sticks, picking from three techs each time. You'll get more of those upgrades if you pull off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bulletstorm">Bulletstorm</a>-esque trickshots such as punching one robot into another or using your flamethrower to propel yourself around like a battering ram. I mean, a battering RAM. See, I can do dad jokes too. </p>
<p>"Cor, this top-down roguelike shooter is quite something, lemme tell ya," a jovial Katharine (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/15-steam-next-fest-demos-you-should-play-first-this-february">wrote in February</a>. "With its twinstick controls and bevy of robot opponents to mow down, this is a fast-paced action game that doesn't pull any punches."</p>
<p>The devs estimate that RAM's early access period will "last around a year, depending on how the feedback around the game develops, with large updates every 3-4 months." The current early access version offers six robots, two stages, daily challenge runs and minigames in a hub area, together with the beginning of the story. The final version will have a complete storyline, an expanded endgame difficulty modifier system, more stages and more bots.</p>
<p>To return to Slitterhead briefly - I keep seeing this described as a game we will one day call a cult classic. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slitterhead-review">Ed Thorn's review</a> strongly suggests otherwise. If you've played, how are you finding it?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is out now, and a senior developer on the project has said the game needed to embrace machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies to come to market. Jorg Neumann said in an interview that it would not have been possible to create the game's map data "by hand."</p><p>"We would have spent our entire lives and then some just marking up terrain, which is not really the core of the thing. So it's just a tool that helps us," he told <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-uses-machine-learning-ai-and-how-much-of-your-data-it-might-need" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rock Paper Shotgun</a> of machine learning and AI.</p><p>One major fear is that advancements to machine learning and AI will lead to job losses, but for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, this was not the case. "The only thing we've done is grow," Neumann said.</p><p>A team of 100 people made 2020's Microsoft Flight Simulator. For this new release, 200 people at Asobo worked on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, with another 600 people at support studios for a total of 800 people working on the game.</p><p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 uses machine learning to generate terrain detail. The team marked up around 28,000 "tiles" that were representative of Earth--these included textures meant to replicate the forests, deserts, rivers, and so on. This data was then fed into a machine learning platform that creates a potential asset, which is then reviewed by a human, and then the system is re-trained.</p><p>"You basically say: 'Oh, OK, got this wrong.' And then you retrain it. We did that in four different stages," Neumann said.</p><p>Before this, EA Sports management said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">wouldn't have been possible to release EA Sports College Football 25 on time and up to quality</a> without the use of machine learning and AI to generate all manner of assets.

Staff members who worked on Unknown 9: Awakening report layoffs across the team at Canadian outfit Reflector Entertainment.
</p>
<p>
Jobs lost include roles within Reflector's art, marketing, narrative and quality assurance (QA) teams, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-reflector-entertainment-cuts-jobs-after-launching-debut-title-unknown-9">Game Developer</a> reported. 
</p>
<p>
Unknown 9: Awakening launched last month to mixed reviews. On Steam, where it sits with a Mixed rating, less than 100 players have rated the game.

<p>
Published by Bandai Namco, Unknown 9: Awakening felt like an attempt to recapture the sci-fi adventure of Assassin's Creed, in a modern Tomb Raider-style globe-trotting story that featured secret societies vying over the remnants of an ancient civilisation. 
</p>
<p>First announced in 2020, the project drew interest due to its intriguing debut trailer featuring a younger version of protagonist Haroona (played in the final game by Anya Chalotra, AKA Yennefer in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s The Witcher). It was the first project from the Montreal-based Reflector, co-founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a> creative director Alexandre Amancio. </p><p>
The game was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unknown-9-awakening-is-an-ambitious-new-transmedia-bid">meant to act as a central point for the franchise as a cross-media brand</a>. Just this week, a second season of the Unknown 9: Out of Sight tie-in podcast was launched, while the fourth issue of its graphic novel series Unknown 9: Torment arrived. There's also a web series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-juTgG_tIEeJ4DSnPrGAUMYAK9o-JW9H">Unknown 9: Passage</a>, which you can go watch on YouTube. 
</p>
<p>
"Unfortunately, I was affected by the layoffs at Reflector Entertainment, which means I'm currently looking for a job as a Narrative Designer or Game Writer. If you hear of any opportunities, please let me know," one staff member who lost their job wrote.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Bandai Namco for comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/sony-announce-black-friday-playstation-deals-starting-friday/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced that the PlayStation <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> 2024 sale will start on 22nd November and run until 2nd December, with the pretty familiar spread of offers across games, hardware and accessories, whether you’re buying direct from PlayStation or with participating retailers.</p>
<p>Possibly the most important part of this is the huge sale that will sweep onto the PlayStation Store for digital <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and PS4 games. Sony highlight that this will include <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">EA Sports FC 25</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/06/hogwarts-legacy-review/">Hogwarts Legacy</a>… and they’ll probably match the prices seen in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/15/xbox-black-friday-sale-cuts-50-off-xbox-series-xs-consoles-discounts-over-1000-games/">Xbox Black Friday sale</a> that’s already underway.</p>


<p>Second most important for existing PS5 gamers is the annual <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> subscription discount. From 22nd November you’ll be able to save up to 30% across a 12-month membership. Existing subscribers can also save 25% when upgrading from Essential to Extra, or 30% when going from Extra to Premium/Deluxe – Premium members will now get <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/the-playstation-portal-is-finally-getting-ps-plus-cloud-streaming/">cloud gaming for PS Portal</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re after some new hardware, then you can look to PlayStation Direct, or your chosen retailer for discounts across PS5 consoles, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR2</a>, games, and PS5 accessories including DualSense wireless controllers, Pulse Elite wireless headset, Pulse Explore wireless earbuds. They’re also launching a special PS5 Fortnite Cobalt Star Bundle. These will take the form of an MSRP drop, but retailers are always able to compete and create their own bundles from it.</p>
<p>What will those discounts be? Sony ain’t saying just yet… but we do have the ever-reliable billbil-kun on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/black-friday-2024-des-remises-interessantes-attendues-sur-les-consoles-ps5-chez-plusieurs-marchands-59662">French deals site Dealabs</a>. They claim that following PS5 and PSVR 2 discounts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PS5 Slim Console – Standard Edition</strong>: €474.99 instead of €549.99.</li>
<li><strong>PS5 Slim Console – Digital Edition</strong>: €374.99 instead of €449.99.</li>
<li><strong>PlayStation VR2 headset</strong>: €399.99 instead of €599.99.</li>
<li><strong>PlayStation VR2 <a title="Games > Horizon Call of the Mountain [30 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/games/horizon-call-of-the-mountain/">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a> Pack:</strong> (contains the PS VR2 headset + Horizon Call of the Mountain game activation code): €399.99 instead of €649.99.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a huge up to €250 off a PSVR 2! And a more sensible €75 off on PS5 Slims.</p>

						<h5>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</h5><p><span>November 20, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, Xbox Series S|X</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>Yes, I've played STALKER 2's final version. It's real, and yet it feels surreal to write this review after all the problems this project has gone through across more than a decade. This could have easily gone the way of Duke Nukem Forever, and I'm glad it didn't.</p>
<p>We first <a href="http://wccftech.com/stalker-2-set-release-2012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> the name STALKER 2 fourteen years ago, just a few months after the launch of Call of Pripyat. GSC Game World founder and CEO Sergiy Grygorovych commented that the franchise's four million sales more than warranted a proper sequel, which the developer estimated to be coming in 2012. Unfortunately, the Ukrainian team faced financial hardships and had to be dissolved in late 2011. At that point, everyone thought STALKER 2 would never be made, but the team was put back together three years later.</p>
<p>GSC Game World's first order of business was releasing a new entry in their real-time strategy series Cossacks, but their true objective was to make the next STALKER title. The second announcement <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-in-development-targeting-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came</a> in 2018, with a tentative release window set for 2021. Of course, game development is complicated, and the studio was never particularly famous for its punctuality. As such, there were two entirely unsurprising delays to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-debut-gameplay-trailer-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April</a> 2022 and then to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-delayed-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December</a> 2022, with a bonus NFT-based controversy (the idea was quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-wont-have-blockchain-nfts-anymore-after-massive-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set aside</a> following the community's massive backlash) spruced in the middle for good measure.</p>
<p>The real problems were yet to begin, though. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, GSC Game World was <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-development-sidelined-ukranian-russia-invasion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced</a> to stop working on STALKER 2 for a few months before <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-developer-gsc-game-world-moving-ukraine-prague/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relocating</a> to Prague. Still, even after that, the impact of the nearby war inevitably slowed the Ukrainian developers. There were also more incidents, such as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-studio-gsc-game-world-hacked-russian-hackers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyberattack</a> from Russian hackers and&nbsp;an office fire <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-dev-suffers-office-fire-due-to-electrical-installation-malfunction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused</a> by an electrical malfunction. Still, the team persevered throughout this veritable ordeal, and we can now play the game at long last. Is it any good, though? I would say mostly, with some fairly sizable caveats.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/stalker-2-screenshots.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the STALKER series, the first thing to understand is that this is not your average shooter game. The protagonist of this sequel, Skif, is not some sort of superhero or even an incredibly hardened veteran soldier. He's just another stalker who had happily returned to the Mainland from the Zone but is forced to go back to the irradiated Chornobyl area after an anomaly inexplicably destroys his home.</p>
<p>In gameplay terms, this means you'll not be murdering foes left and right with incredible ease and a nearly infinite amount of ammunition at your disposal. Quite the contrary. It could be said that STALKER is the Soulslike of shooters, although the original game predates Demon's Souls by two years, making such a definition incorrect from a chronological standpoint. Even so, it gets the point across: you're going to have a hard time in this game compared to most single player shooters.</p>
<p>There's tons of things that can kill you in the Zone, such as various mutated monsters and humanoids, bandits and enemy stalkers, several anomalies scattered throughout the map, intense radiation pockets, mere fall damage from a sufficient height, and more. To give even more credit to the Souls comparison, GSC Game World actually included an actual death count on the game over screen, as you can see below. I swear most of mine were probably caused by dog and rat packs, which are arguably the most dangerous enemies in this game due to their erratic movement patterns that make them difficult to shoot at.</p>
<p>Thankfully, unlike FromSoftware, the studio behind this game added three difficulty settings to make the experience more accessible. While I play most games, including shooters, at least on Hard settings, here I had to switch to Rookie (the lowest available) after a little while due to sheer frustration. I mentioned that the game is difficult, but it's not just because of the sheer challenge provided by the AI. There's also the whole injury system and the stamina-based inventory system that add layers of complexity, perhaps too much.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-2-Heart-of-Chornobyl-Game-Over-Screen-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When you're hit in STALKER 2, there's a decent chance you'll not only lose health (which does not regenerate on its own), but you'll also start bleeding. While medkits restore health, you need bandages to stem the bleeding. Similarly, you need to bring food and drinks, anti-rads, and enough ammunition whenever you venture out of the safe zones. You'll want to stock up on all these things because there is no fast travel in this game, and there's no telling when you might need them while roaming the ever-dangerous Zone. However, everything has its own weight; even quest items have weight, and the more you carry, the quicker the stamina drops.</p>
<p>While that is perfectly understandable within the context of the game's design, I feel that it is absolutely overtuned and ends up being too penalizing. Even when the inventory's weight is in the green range, it only takes a little sprint to deplete the stamina, leading to fairly slow and long treks to travel across the map. I literally wished there was some kind of auto-run functionality, as you're just pushing the forward button for minutes at a time on certain occasions with nothing else to do. A modular approach to difficulty, which is becoming more common in recent game releases, would have been preferable to set the challenge level of combat, travel, injuries and survival separately depending on the player's preferences.</p>
<p>There's more. The equipment's durability depletes over time, as you'd expect given the realistic theme. Tech NPCs can repair them in the safe zones, provided you've got enough coupons to spare. The problem is that, in some cases, the cost is simply outrageous. I had found an extremely effective armor suit that was worth over 20K coupons. However, when I went to repair it, I was appalled by the NPC requesting 70K coupons - far more than I had available. When repairing something costs over three times its worth, you know something's wrong. I also believe that the side missions could be more rewarding at handing coupons; you don't loot coupons from fallen foes, as they are transmitted digitally to your PDA. You could gather items and then sell them, but there's the little problem mentioned above with taking on too much weight. In short, the economy needs a balance pass, too.</p>
<p>Moreover, it might be helpful to allow players to wait time everywhere, even at the peril of hostile encounters. This is because the day/night cycle is slower than most open-world games, and at nighttime, it is sometimes nearly impossible to find things in certain quests. In one instance, I had to leave the game running while I waited for the sun to rise.</p>

<p>Speaking of gunplay, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is solid in this area, although not quite the best in the business. I noticed that weapon sounds do not always seem to play properly, sometimes giving a muffled sound to the bullets that was inappropriate for the weapon. A proper sound is critical to enjoying firing a gun, but it may have been a bug, so I won't dwell on this too much.</p>
<p>The game offers a leaning feature to poke around angles when in cover. You better use it with care, as it doesn't take long to die from gunshots, especially if you're playing on Medium or High difficulty, and the same is generally true for your foes. There's not a great amount of weapons, although that's understandable given the lore - there wouldn't be that many choices in the Zone. You can improve them with several attachments, though they're not that much of a common find.</p>
<p>As with everything, they require maintenance; a nearly-broken weapon could very well jam at the wrong time, leaving you at the mercy of your enemies. I did appreciate that being on the receiving end of a grenade not only damages Skif but also stuns him for a couple of seconds due to the explosion. Overall, the most interesting fights are those against other humans, as that's where the AI really shines, while encounters with mutants and especially animals may be more annoying than anything.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/STALKER-2-Sunset-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The best part of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is easily the Zone and its exploration. The developers referred to the world as its own character in the review guide, and they were not wrong. All the design choices—even those that I consider currently unbalanced—certainly contribute to the feeling of the Zone as a huge, hostile, and hauntingly beautiful environment that players can explore without loadings from the get-go. But the atmosphere is also perfectly nailed down from both a visual and audio standpoint, providing maximum immersion in this post-apocalyptic setting.</p>
<p>Epic's Unreal Engine 5 renders the Zone with excellent fidelity, and Lumen doesn't disappoint even without the hardware ray tracing option that might be <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> post-launch. I did notice a little pop-in on the trees occasionally, probably because GSC did not use Nanite-powered trees, but it wasn't too distracting anyway. On the other hand, the repetitive visual appearance of most NPCs is a little distracting; the developers could have definitely done a better job in this regard, as in some cases you're left wondering if they're all genetically related.</p>
<p>Overall, performance was acceptable on my rig (7800X3D, RTX 4090) when playing at 4K, max settings, NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution set to Balanced, and Frame Generation turned on (by the way, all upscalers are supported, including AMD FSR FG). There were a few stutters here and there, but compared to most of the UE games we've seen recently, it wasn't too problematic.</p>
<p>I did not have enough time to complete a full playthrough of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. That's partly because GSC only shared review codes a week ago for a game that lasts an average of 35 to 40 hours and partly because I encountered many bugs that slowed down my playthrough, even blocking progress to the main quest. Yes, this sequel is buggy, too. Perhaps not like the original, but not too far off, at least for the time being. GSC says they've fixed 1125 issues since sharing the review build, including the critical path bug that got me stuck for a couple of days. Still, it will clearly be an ongoing project for them post-launch for quite a while, which is not unexpected for such a big open-world game.</p>
<p>For now, here's my current take on STALKER 2: this is a game that knows precisely what it wants to be, although that doesn't mean it is balanced enough to be fun all the time. The feeling of playing a stalker thrust into this inhospitable world against seemingly impossible odds is always present, for better or worse. However, unless you're really dying to enter the Zone right away, I would recommend waiting a little longer while the developers (and possibly modders) fix and improve the game further. After all, you've waited this long; what's a few more?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-will-definitely-find-its-fanbase-in-survival-gamers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It has been a long time coming for <em>STALKER</em>, as a franchise we haven't had a new title since 2009, but with the release of <em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> players get to return to The Zone and attempt to survive against a variety of factions, strange creatures, and even odder anomalies.</p>

<p>In <em>STALKER 2</em> you take on the role of Skif, a stalker who has headed into the zone to gather more information on a strange Artifact that appeared in his kitchen. Once inside a key piece of equipment is stolen from you and you're left for dead. From there, you begin your quest to track down just who ambushed you and how you can recover your scanner.</p>

<h2><em>STALKER 2</em> reminds me of <em>New Vegas</em>, for better or worse</h2>

<p>The setup reminded me heavily of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6685d7d-626b-40a4-8641-face640c606d" href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-new-vegas" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a>, with just a brief introduction to the post-apocalyptic world before you're out on your ass with a major MacGuffin to hunt after. While you can tell there's a drive for Skif to recover what he's lost, as a player with very little connection to this world that kind of motivation is a bit difficult to relate to though.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-early-story.jpg?itok=M5NlH9pp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-early-story.jpg?itok=7Se-zmmO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Early on following the scent of your attackers, you'll run into others who brave The Zone, each able to drip-feed you a bit of information to get you to your next location. The overall quest structure of the game did feel a bit like a goose chase.</p>

<p>Each new lead you obtain would get you to someone who knows just a little bit more information, but you need to help them clear out a settlement or recover an important item before they share it with you. In that way, you'll find yourself bouncing around the world doing odd jobs working towards your goal.</p>

<p>The shallow nature of the primary story definitely made the start of the game slow and difficult to get into. Many quests feel like checking boxes rather than something I would really be pushing myself to explore or complete on my own. There's a lot more to <em>STALKER 2</em> than the story though.</p>

<p>If you do make it past the initial 8-10 hours then the story does bring in more ideas and concepts from the original games. You'll see what has happened to the Monolithians, among other factions, and even take steps to align yourself with them.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-boss-fight.jpg?itok=pxCk61jI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-boss-fight.jpg?itok=KFKr-vZP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Enjoyment from exploration, not plot</h2>

<p>Each new area is filled with different side-quests and activities. There are a variety of settlements that you can travel to that can be looted or are populated with others who need some help. You can even stumble into turf wars that you can watch from a distance or hop into the fray yourself.</p>

<p>These side-quests aren't just a chance to explore the world as they're also one of the best ways to obtain very necessary equipment whether it be currency for purchasing new items or repairing your gear, or more powerful weapons and armor.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-friendly-fire.jpg?itok=r0IbuKh- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-friendly-fire.jpg?itok=EaMgaIE7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Survival mechanics will make or break your experience</h2>

<p>The Survival mechanics of <em>STALKER 2</em> is really what will decide if this is the game for you. Jumping into the game you'll immediately notice features that other games offer, like detecting the rough direction of where you're being shot from or a map-based fast travel aren't present.</p>

<p>These survival features continue to add as you play further. You'll be avoiding radiated areas for fear of getting sick, be reminded to eat food continuously, and see some extremely debilitating effects if you start to push your carrying capacity.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-comparing-gear.jpg?itok=to6XBTHh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-comparing-gear.jpg?itok=ZKXsaGB5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The combination of carrying capacity limits alongside the lack of fast travel unfortunately is a slog. Going out with equipment, bullets, health and food items, and only three guns I'd regularly find myself at 45-50kg of the 80kg carrying capacity. Carrying much more and suddenly my speed is down to a crawl and my stamina drains faster and recharges slower.</p>

<p>From an on-paper perspective, I can see how this promotes the idea of going 'light' or making returning to a base with a variety of valuable items a more stressful situation. Unfortunately outside of settlements, there's very little else to run into in the overworld. What this results in is a lot of dead time just slowly walking across the map.</p>



<p>Chances are if you played the original <em>STALKER</em> you've got some idea of what you're in for but if not imagine a mix between a Fallout and Metro game, with a large open world and more intense survival mechanics. If that is something that you're attracted to then now is your time to hop on. If that doesn't take your fancy then you'll likely not reach a point where the story picks up.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-officially-revealed-launching-in-china-first.1040565/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix and Tencent subsidiary LightSpeed Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em><em>Mobile</em>, a mobile adaptation of the critically-acclaimed MMORPG that's set to launch in China before being released around the world.</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/news/detail?lang=en&amp;id=8ed7df04-8e80-47dc-a6be-3339dc3faaf8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official announcement</a>, the game will capture "the immersive experience of the original title in a fresh, mobile-friendly format", so it won't be a direct port; rather, it will be a slightly reimagined version that presumably takes the mobile environment into account.</p>

<p>No release date has been given, but&nbsp;<em>FFXIV Mobile&nbsp;</em>will launch in China first, followed by "a global release soon after". That makes a certain degree of sense given that the developer is a subsidiary of a major Chinese company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-titan-fight.jpeg?itok=n1mdPgTK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-titan-fight.jpeg?itok=8-Z43Qtq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile&nbsp;</em>will serve as an adaptation of the popular MMORPG for mobile devices.</figcaption></figure><p>It seems the studio handling development on&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile&nbsp;</em>won't be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios" rel="nofollow">Hideaki Itsuno's LightSpeed Studio Japan</a>, but the core LightSpeed team, which makes sense given Itsuno's desire to focus on action games.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/news/detail?lang=en&amp;id=6902e2b0-8ec9-4c15-ab88-a81935362931" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an introduction</a> to&nbsp;<em>FFXIV Mobile</em>, Square Enix and LightSpeed promise "controls optimized for mobile devices", a "variety of playable races", and nine jobs for the game's launch, with more presumably to be added over time.</p>

<p><em>FFXIV&nbsp;</em>producer Naoki Yoshida says the mobile version of the game will feature both combat and non-combat jobs, describing&nbsp;<em>FFXIV Mobile&nbsp;</em>as "a sister" to the main game that will aim to "recreate the grandeur of the original's story and combat mechanics" in mobile form.</p>




<p>Side activities like fishing, chocobo racing, and Triple Triad will also be available in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile</em>, as will the game's "signature social experience" and "unique, welcoming social atmosphere".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't yet know when&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile&nbsp;</em>will be available, but the game will be undergoing "multiple play tests in China" first, and a global launch will follow "soon after".</p>

<p><em>FFXIV&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game to be getting the mobile RPG treatment from Tencent soon. Recently, Capcom and the Chinese gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg" rel="nofollow">announced&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em></a>, an open-world survival RPG developed by Tencent and published by Capcom.</p>

<p>It's not just Tencent, either. Bungie and NetEase, another massive Chinese gaming company, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising" rel="nofollow">recently announced&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising</em></a>, a mobile spinoff of popular FPS-MMORPG&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>. The mobile market is lucrative, after all, so all of these spinoffs and adaptations make a lot of sense.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-heart-of-chornobyl-is-a-glorious-and-beautiful-pain-in-the-ass.1040562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300652/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>There’s a particular feeling when you’re wandering alone in <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em>. Perhaps you’re squelching through wet, misty marshland, flanked by gigantic reeds. A dark purple sky of unbroken cloud takes up half of the screen; gigantic rusty machinery creates an odd and unnerving silhouette. You hear gunfire in the distance. The sound moves closer, followed by the unmistakable groans of a mutated beast. The sensation sharpens of being pitted against a wilderness that doesn’t care whether you live or die. This is not an unpleasant type of survival. To call the Zone home is to feel an almost elemental sense of freedom: a fantasy of existing purely in the moment, putting one foot in front of the other.&nbsp;</p><p>You had better like walking because in <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>, the absorbing and currently buggy sequel to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/on-the-importance-of-s-t-a-l-k-e-r">trailblazing</a> trilogy of shooters from the 2000s, you do a lot of it. The map, based on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22403796/stalker-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-tourists">real-world exclusion zone</a> created in the wake of the 1986 nuclear disaster, is 64 kilometers squared. Objectives tend to be found in derelict buildings dotted about the hostile terrain. You set out on another long trek (hopefully with a functioning gas mask), clasping a metal bolt alongside your rifle. It’s wise to toss the bolt in front of you regularly to test for anomalies: some cause the air itself to warp and bend; others make tiny shards of skin-shredding glass to hover in the atmosphere. Coming into contact with any of them can prove swiftly fatal.</p><p>This version of the Zone is a glorious and beautiful pain in the ass, able to hold its own with other Zones littered throughout pop culture: the restricted site found in Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1979 movie <a href="https://youtu.be/YuOnfQd-aTw"><em>Stalker</em></a> or Area X in Jeff VanderMeer’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275853/jeff-vandermeer-interview-absolution-area-x-southern-reach">Southern Reach</a> novels. It’s thrilling to see Ukrainian studio GSC Game World depict its native landscape so evocatively and in a way that runs counter to much of the prevailing wisdom about how an open-world video game should look and function.</p><p>In <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>, the Zone is conspicuously horizontal. Forget about “<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/see-those-mountains">see that mountain</a>”; when you do get a good view, all you see is a shimmering expanse of bog and grassland. The color palette is notably muted: a smudge of murky browns, queasy greens, and charcoal blues — rich, earthy, sometimes squalid. The Zone’s inhabitants are almost all depressed men swilling energy drinks. Have they come to this extreme environment because they are in flight from something at home? Or because the environment mirrors some hidden part of their own psychological makeup?</p><p>For Skif, our spiky protagonist, the answer turns out to be both. His home outside the Zone is set ablaze by a rogue anomaly. He enters looking for answers before getting embroiled in a plot to seize a valuable piece of tech. From there, the narrative branches. You’re free to chum up with various factions like a professionalized military group called the Ward or a band of metaphysical dreamers led by a guy called Scar. But I quickly lost track of who I was in cahoots with and who I wronged. The tangled web of motivations, grudges, and backstories was often inscrutable. Like Tarkovsky’s <em>Stalker </em>or <em>Annihilation</em>, the quest here felt slippery and ever-changing, so I simply stalked toward my quest marker with the score of evocatively discordant synths swirling in my ears.</p><p>The first few hours are punishing. Without much cash, you scavenge damaged weapons prone to jamming. In time, and with a gradually expanding arsenal of exactingly rendered weaponry, the game softens. The kind of emergent, AI-driven moments that made the original<em> S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> franchise a cult classic also begin to materialize from the metaphysical ether. At one point, I agreed to flush out some mutants from a building for a pair of fellow stalkers. As I was doing so, a rival group opened fire on us, all while a pack of rabid dogs ravaged both parties. The ensuing three minutes were bloody, chaotic, and quite brilliant. At another moment, I led a group of enemy stalkers back to the base of a faction that lives on a gigantic, irradiated trash heap. As my enemies neared the perimeter, guards assumed their defensive positions and unleashed fire in one seamless, dazzlingly orchestrated concert.&nbsp;</p><p>But <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em> doesn’t just replicate the achievements of its forebears. The open world furthers the moody, proto-walking sim elements of the originals. Because this Zone is so large, preparation is even more key than in previous games. This occurs alongside a tapestry of navigation, combat, resource management, and crucially, rest, all set against a day-night cycle that genuinely affects gameplay. During especially long stretches of walking, there is much space to contemplate your own actions. In my own case, why did I feel compelled to ruthlessly murder nearly every major NPC despite being on otherwise good terms with them? The Zone has a habit of remaking anything that comes into contact with it, and I fast transformed into another of its monsters.</p><p>When <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 </em>works as intended, it’s an emergent sandbox capable of producing simultaneously bleak and hilarious moments, all while giving the illusion of a world functioning independently of the player’s inputs. But perhaps inevitably because of the game’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/arts/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-ukraine-war.html">troubled development</a> — which saw over half of the development team move to Prague from Kyiv because of the Russia-Ukraine war — there is some unevenness.</p><p>The biggest issue is combat. While gunplay is crisp and responsive, enemies frequently look in the wrong direction to the threat that they should be facing. Stranger is the way that some human foes (not the mutants that actually possess the ability to become invisible) miraculously appear out of thin air. Another odd glitch saw a character’s head become detached from their body during a cutscene. The following gunfight had a farcical quality. Should I be aiming where the head is hovering or where it should be? These moments, which appear too frequently to be waved away, dispel the Zone’s otherwise convincing illusion.&nbsp;</p><p><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em> has arrived in a manner that feels tantalizing close to greatness. About 10 hours into the game, the wide-eyed poetic outsider, Scar, lays out his take on the Zone. There is a “dark” side, which has the capacity to strip humans of their free will, and there is the “shining” side — the wondrous, miraculous aspect of this changed place that casts the very essence of life in a new light. “We want the shining Zone to reveal itself,” says Scar longingly.&nbsp;</p><p>With a few patches, <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em> may yet become this “shining” version of itself. As it stands, the game requires you to submit to the spell that is being cast. The rewards for those who can overlook the wonky combat, bodies that glitch through scenery, and other audio-visual quirks are considerable. That core feeling of raw survival in an uncaring environment — lightning cracking in the distance, rain lashing down, and the disquieting noise of far-off gunfire — never wanes.</p><p><small>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl <em>launches on November 20th on Xbox and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-stalker-2-have-a-photomode-answered.1040556/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-stalker-2-have-a-photomode-answered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>STALKER 2 is a beautiful game, there’s no doubt about it. It’s hard to imagine a post-apocalyptic wasteland looking good, but here we are – and it does. One of the first questions on the minds of fans worldwide is whether STALKER 2 has a photomode, as it’s not something that has been explicitly confirmed by GSC Game World.</p>



<p>Does STALKER 2 have a photomode? And if it doesn’t, what can you do as an alternative?</p>



<p>Read on to find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-photomode-in-stalker-2">Is There a Photomode in STALKER 2?</h2>



<p>STALKER 2 doesn’t have a photomode yet, but it could be added further down the line. This Unreal Engine-powered game looks phenomenal on the surface, and it has so much potential for a photomode, but it hasn’t been added by GSC Game World for the game’s launch.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t mean that you’re out of luck when it comes to taking pictures like this in STALKER 2:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s easy to take first-person perspective shots in STALKER 2 and have them look amazing. That’s mostly because the game looks fantastic, but there’s one option you can quickly tweak to secure brilliant shots without a photomode in STALKER 2.</p>



<p>Head into the settings menu and select the UI tab, then scroll to the bottom and drag ‘HUD opacity settings’ to 0%. By doing this, you’ll remove the HUD entirely, presenting yourself with a clean, untarnished image of the game.</p>



<p>Bear in mind that this won’t remove subtitles or character tags, so if you’re looking at someone or talking to them, you’ll have text on the screen.</p>



<p>As STALKER 2 doesn’t have a photomode, this is the best you can do to take great screenshots without worrying about on-screen clutter.</p>



<p>Don’t worry – it’s the number one thing suggested by the community, so it shouldn’t be too long until a photomode is added.</p>

<p>There’s a new contender in the Game of the Year debate, and it’s called STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. I was fortunate to pour <strong>many </strong>hours into STALKER 2 before it hit the shelves. During my time with the game, I came to be immersed in a gorgeous and harrowing open-world environment that pulled me in harder than a gravitational anomaly.</p>



<p>In a line, STALKER 2 is nothing short of phenomenal, and every minute I spent exploring The Zone made me thankful that GSC Game World never gave up on this project over the ten-plus years<strong> </strong>it took to piece it together. It’s technically impressive and deeply authentic, and it’s guaranteed to hit you like a hearty dose of radiation.</p>



<p>It’s finally here, and my STALKER 2 review will tell you everything you need to know about this game.</p>



<p>If you’d rather check out the video version of this review, <a href="https://youtu.be/Tk9dJjP0lgw"><strong>simply click here to head to YouTube</strong></a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-zone">Enter The Zone</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>I’m sorry to say that I never played a STALKER game to any decent length before I picked up STALKER 2. However, I’m a huge fan of games like Fallout, Metro, and Escape from Tarkov, so the base concept of STALKER fits nicely within my wheelhouse.</p>



<p>That meant that I had almost no expectations going in, but from what I’ve come to experience in The Zone, I get the impression that it’s an authentic and remarkable representation of the series thus far. I’m not dim – I know what STALKER is and I’ve long heard about the game’s elements, factions, story, and mutants, and so much of STALKER 2 was at the least <strong>recognisable </strong>for me.</p>



<p>Even I was able to spot Rookie Village in Cordon when I came across it later in the game.</p>



<p>From the moment I was plunged into The Zone, I was marvelling at STALKER 2’s visuals. The transition to Unreal Engine has paid off nicely, and everything from the game’s foliage to the small details littered around building interiors is intricate and – most importantly – <em>realistic</em>.</p>



<p>I constantly found myself wandering across the <strong>enormous </strong>open world just taking in the ambience. The game’s sound engine and weather systems are second to none, and from the birds singing in the trees of a windswept forest to the booming power of a lightning strike landing mere feet from me amid a screaming storm, everything kept me in awe as I played STALKER 2.</p>



<p><em>Seriously, the game’s audio is impeccable. For instance, I stood next to a truck while it was raining, and the sound of drops landing on a rusted metal surface was so accurate, that I had no choice but to marvel at it. I moved through an old, decrepit compound and my feet brushed glass bottles across the floor, and with a surround-sound headset, it was flawless.</em></p>



<p>The Zone can be terrifying, and at times I was <strong>jumpscared </strong>heading into a dark bunker and running into a Burer or a group of Bloodsuckers, but it’s also a beautiful and unique environment that I never got tired of exploring.</p>



<p>GSC built every inch of this map by hand, without any procedural generation, and it shows. The sheer depth of miscellaneous events, secret locations, and hidden stashes that you’ll uncover as you explore STALKER 2 is mind-blowing, and as you walk around the world, you’ll constantly find neat little spots off the beaten track that you’ll want to just <strong>look at</strong>.</p>



<p>If I have one complaint about all this, STALKER 2 doesn’t have a photomode, and I could snap thousands of images.</p>







<h2 id="h-into-the-adventure">Into The Adventure</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>STALKER 2’s story is one of the game’s shining gems. It’s intriguing, pitted with twists and turns, and from what I’ve learned, it’s very well connected to the rest of the series. It is loaded with enough mysteries to keep players guessing, and there are many opportunities to explore various playstyles as you run through the campaign.</p>



<p>I’ll admit that stealth in STALKER 2 feels a little tricky, but I much prefer going into any engagement guns blazing, and STALKER 2 accommodates that playstyle <strong>very </strong>nicely.</p>



<p>STALKER 2 isn’t a hold-your-hand game – to any real extent. It’s much more accessible than the other games in the series, but that’s because GSC wants to appeal to a more widespread audience. To that end, it’s mostly obvious where you need to go and what you need to do, and the game is light on puzzles, but even on the easiest difficulty, I died a few dozen times.</p>



<p>On several occasions, I found myself reloading earlier saves just to see what would happen if I picked a different choice at a critical point in the story.</p>



<p><em>I’ll be honest, though – I was looped into the development side of things and the team patched out more than 1000 bugs, ranging from game-breaking to minor, in the days before STALKER 2 was released.</em></p>



<p>As I played, I took these issues in my stride, determined to work around bugs rather than admit defeat in the face of them. I also recognised that I had a beta build, and I was appreciative that it was a work in progress at that point.</p>



<p>As I dove deeper into the story, I found myself fully invested and desperate to reach the next chapter or accomplishment. As a completionist, I felt compelled to tackle every side objective and hidden location I came across, and I never got bored of doing so.</p>







<h2 id="h-sheer-energy">Sheer Energy</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>In my opinion, it’s not fair to take points away from STALKER 2 because of the bugs I experienced – that’s because of the build I was playing on — <em>I hope</em>.</p>



<p>If I look past those issues, I see a game that <strong>I cannot fault in one major way</strong>. From the combat sequences to the direct and fully-acted cutscenes, and the survival mechanics to the random encounters that make the world feel so alive, I couldn’t find one <strong>serious</strong> flaw in STALKER 2.</p>



<p>Minor flaws? Sure.</p>



<p>Killed enemies ragdoll more than you’d like, the AI of human enemies isn’t as advanced as you might prefer, and I’d like to see more loot scattered around the place to add a little variation, but it’s all very livable. </p>



<p>The voice acting is superb and very diverse, and even the piecemeal characters have some great lines, which only adds to that ‘alive’ sensation of the world you’re exposed to.</p>



<p><em>For instance, I left a fellow Stalker stranded in a field of electric anomalies because I was in a rush, and was subjected to abuse being hurled over the radio as I walked off, with the Stalker branding me a ‘rotten Flesh fucker’ in his dying moments.</em></p>



<p>The effects of the anomalies feel stellar, and the handiwork applied to bringing mutants to life is awe-inspiring. They’re genuinely terrifying and more than once I found myself killing an enemy and getting up close to them just to study the character model. In some ways, it was like the game was adjusting to my preferences as I played, too</p>



<p>Let me explain that. Early on, I had a concern that packs of dogs were far too common and irritating, and then as the hours unravelled, I found that I was brushing up against them much less. Perhaps the spawn rate was tweaked by GSC or something, but it felt as though the game heard me and responded to my worries.</p>



<p>Even without a photomode, I found myself snapping countless images of the world of STALKER 2. There wasn’t one location that failed to snatch my attention, and even a random truck stranded in a field felt like it had a point in being there and a presence. </p>



<p>I came to attach myself to the game’s characters very quickly, and when a quest led to an untimely death being revealed, <strong>I felt it</strong>. I became a character hellbent on helping as many people as I could, and pleasing factions became a mission of mine rather than a chore.</p>



<p>There’s enough meat on the bones already for me to declare this: <strong>STALKER 2 is the best game I have played in years</strong>.</p>



<p>Being a fan of a post-apocalyptic adventure, STALKER 2 speaks to me on an intimate level, and every moment I spent in The Zone was sheer bliss. Every time I turned the game off, I had <strong>an itch</strong> to get back to it, and I’ve not felt like that about a game for a very long time.</p>







<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Even the simple things, like the game’s intuitive UI and satellite-style map screen, won me over. The game’s visual palette is diverse and sumptuous, customising and using weapons feels satisfying and energetic, and every mission feels like it has <strong>a point</strong>.</p>



<p>Believe me when I say you will be blown away by the depth and detail in STALKER 2. The sheer level of attention and painstaking effort poured into the creation of STALKER 2 by GSC Game World is nothing short of utterly incredible, and I am so happy that this game was <strong>finally </strong>delivered after all these years.</p>



<p>I cannot dredge up a single reason why you shouldn’t invest in STALKER 2. This enormous, immersive survival FPS is the cream of the crop, and it’s a bar to which every developer in the genre should aspire to reach. Every minute you pour into this epic adventure will be well spent, and despite the horrors lurking within, The Zone will become your second home.</p>



<p>For a numerical rating, I give STALKER 2 a 9 out of 10. When the mods start flowing and the game’s core issues are addressed, perhaps with modders adding in some more immersion or customisation mechanics, I could see this being pushed to a 10 out of 10.</p>

The Company has received an initial letter of intent to acquire the Company's shares, but no decision has been made at this time.

Kadokawa is a prolific publisher of anime, and Sony already owns anime streamers Crunchyroll and Funimation. As well as FromSoftware, Kadokawa owns Danganronpa developer Spike Chunsoft, Octopath Traveler developer Acquire, and RPG Maker and Pixel Game Maker developer Gotcha Gotcha Games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa is the majority owner of FromSoftware, with around 70% of the company. Sony already owns around 14% of the developer, with Tencent owning around 16%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Piers Harding-Rolls, Research Director at Ampere Analysis, told IGN that news of a potential deal isn’t that surprising. "Sony’s interest in Kadokawa’s games publisher FromSoftware was made more concrete in 2022 when it acquired a roughly 14% share of the company following up on its long-time collaboration with the company," Harding-Rolls said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the time, Sony mentioned a broader interest in cross-media development of anime and games IP to support its other media businesses. So, in that sense any deal for the parent company Kadokawa, which also operates extensively in manga and anime, is a natural extension of this earlier deal. These other areas align nicely with Sony’s anime businesses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The market conditions for acquisitions have changed dramatically over the last two years but Sony will always be looking for opportunities that can fuel its growth and that bolster its IP portfolio, and that represent value. There may also be a defensive element to this move. FromSoftware is an important partner for Sony’s games business, and it will not want a competitor taking control of Kadokawa and potentially disrupting that relationship. It helps that Kadokawa is also active in areas which are a strong fit with Sony’s wider business."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Sony, its gaming business has already suffered significant layoffs this year and the closure of multiple studios, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-it-should-have-done-user-testing-and-internal-evaluation-earlier-on-concord"><u>Concord developer Firewalk</u></a>.

			<p>A few hours ago, Bethesda Game Studios revealed that Starfield has now <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1858930054572523833" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 15 million players. The game had <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-13-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> 13 million in December 2023 and 14 million this past <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June</a>. To celebrate the occasion, the team not only released a new patch (previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-beta-update-1-14-74-reintroduces-uncapped-frame-rate-on-xbox-series-x-improves-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> on the Steam beta build) that unlocks uncapped frame rates on Xbox, but they also released a free quest and vehicle.</p>
<p><em>As a special gift to our players for our 15 million player landmark, get ready to conquer the terrain of unexplored planets with the all-new Deimog, the latest addition to Starfield’s lineup of high-performance land vehicles. Built for speed and endurance, the Deimog features a fully enclosed cabin to keep you protected as you race through rugged landscapes. Its exceptional handling allows you to navigate even the trickiest terrain with ease, while a powerful rocket launcher ensures you’re prepared for any threats—be it hostile wildlife or clusters of enemies.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield Creations: Deimog" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BotRDlQZYhw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Starfield questline is centered around cooking:</p>
<p><em>In the spirit of Thanksgiving, The Perfect Recipe invites you on a heartwarming journey through Akila City, where the past and present collide in the hands of an unlikely dreamer. This character-driven questline introduces you to Harbhajan, a gifted mechanic with a hidden passion for the culinary arts. When you stumble upon a dusty recipe book during your travels, you learn it belongs to Harbhajan—a once-hopeful chef whose ambitions were set aside for a more practical life. Returning the recipes ignites a spark, rekindling old dreams of becoming a galaxy-renowned chef. But could it be too late for a second chance?</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield Creations: Perfect Recipe" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/urwankF0m64?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moreover, following the request of the community, Creations released through the Verified Creators Program will have the option to be achievement-friendly. In simpler terms, they won't block achievements unlocked during your Starfield playthrough. Do note that Achievements won't retroactively unlock on previous game saves with Creations, even if those Creations are now achievement-friendly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-shipments-7-million/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launch could be one of the biggest to date, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gvm2fa/alleged_information_on_switch_2s_initial_shipment/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, the same user who provided a basic sketch of the system last month on the Famiboards forums, which was sort of corroborated by more reliable insiders, provided some more information on the Nintendo Switch 2 launch stock, which was apparently recently finalized. The user couldn't disclose the exact number, but in the United States alone, the volume should be 2.5 times higher than the volume for the original system. If the 2.5 times increased volume will apply to worldwide shipments, Nintendo is planning to ship between 6.5 and 7 million units, which would indeed make it one of the biggest console launches of all time.</p>
<p>While we have to take the information shared today with a grain of salt, hearing that the Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be massive isn't particularly surprising. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-easy-find-stores/">Earlier this year</a>, we heard that 10 million units would be produced for the first fiscal year of availability, and Nintendo itself later confirmed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-enough-units/">July</a> that the company was focused on producing enough units to meet demand and prevent scalpers from taking advantage of shortages like they did with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles, although the difficulty to find consoles in stores at launch was decisively made worse by other factors, including the pandemic.</p>
<p>As of now, very little is currently known about the Nintendo Switch 2 console, other than the fact that it will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/">backward compatible</a> with its predecessor. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation Portal's latest firmware update, which went live a few hours ago, finally addresses one of the biggest issues that has impacted the system since its launch last year.</p>
<p>The 4.0 update, which also introduces the Cloud Streaming beta that expands the system's functionality by allowing PlayStation Plus Premium members to play select streaming games for PlayStation 5 on the console, also introduced some unspecified system software performance and stability improvements. According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/1gvjh1w/update_40_microstutter/">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/1gvmd5y/the_microstutter_issue_is_completely_gone_with/">online reports</a>, these improvements are far from being minimal, as with the new firmware update, Sony finally addressed the widely reported micro stuttering issues that the vast majority of users experienced on the PlayStation Portal since launch.</p>
<p>With a single firmware update, Sony managed to improve the system considerably, as the streaming quality issues and the lack of cloud gaming support were undoubtedly the PlayStation Portal's biggest issues that prevented it from being a much more appealing system. You can learn more about what the console did great right from launch in Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The PlayStation Portal isn’t quite the portable successor that players have been asking for from Sony since the decline of the PlayStation Vita. That being said, the PlayStation Portal does one job and does it exceedingly well. It might not reinvent the remote play experience, but for those relying on controller clips to mount a phone to the top of a DualSense controller or third-party controllers that use a mobile device as the display, an official Sony product just makes sense for a unified solution. It might not replace those Backbone controllers and other devices that players might have in their home, but the PlayStation Portal might wind up being the controller that players start reaching for first.</em></p>

                <p>This week marks the 20th anniversary of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/half-life-2-review/1900-6113062/" data-ref-id="1900-6113062">Half-Life 2</a>, Valve's seminal first-person shooter and arguably one of the genre's greatest games. To celebrate the occasion, Valve released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-2-gets-big-20th-anniversary-update-as-new-information-on-episode-3-revealed/1100-6527820/" data-ref-id="1100-6527820">a nearly two-hour documentary</a> on the making of the game, which included the story of how Valve's future was threatened by a lawsuit from its former publisher, Vivendi.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YCjNT9qGjh4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As related by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/a-summer-intern-once-saved-valve-from-a-near-fatal-lawsuit-after-a-publisher-decided-to-go-world-war-3-on-it-and-it-all-hinged-on-one-email/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> and <a href="https://80.lv/articles/valve-steam-the-entire-pc-gaming-industry-were-saved-by-a-single-intern/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">80 Level</a>, the story behind the lawsuit begins about one hour into the documentary, and that tale flows in and out of the background of Half-Life 2's development over the next 43 minutes of the movie. At the heart of the lawsuit was Valve's assertion that Vivendi was distributing Counter-Strike to South Korean cyber cafes without permission from Valve itself.</p><p>In response to Valve's lawsuit asserting its rights, Vivendi responded with multiple counter-claims against the former, as well as Valve COO Scott Lynch and co-founder Gabe Newell. The legal battle was such a drain on Valve's resources that the company nearly went bankrupt. Newell also revealed that he was nearly personally bankrupted as well, and he had to put up his house for sale in order to keep fighting.</p><p>A deal with another publisher gave Valve some much-needed breathing room. But the turning point in the case came when Vivendi handed over millions of pages of emails during the discovery phase, which were all in Korean. As it happened, Valve had a summer intern--a native Korean speaker who is only mentioned by his first name, Andrew--who found the proverbial smoking gun in all of those messages. In an exchange between two of Vivendi's vice presidents, one of them mentioned that he had "destroyed those Valve documents like you asked."</p><p>"I did a lot of lawsuits for a long time," recalled Valve general counsel Karl Quackenbush. "I never saw anything like that. Never. Maybe there was document destruction that couldn't be proved, but that was like, 'We're talking about it in writing.' I'd never seen that before. At that point, Judge Zilly said, 'All matters of fact are now according to Valve. You don't get to contest any of those. Now we're just discussing the [settlement], how much you're gonna have to pay and what the damages are.'"</p><p>Valve emerged from that lawsuit with a settlement that returned its IP from Vivendi and secured its future as a publisher and as a distributer for other publishers through Steam. That bright future might never have happened without Andrew. But the documentary never mentions whether Andrew was offered a job with Valve, which would have been a fitting reward for saving the company.</p>

                <p>The latest update for the PlayStation Portal is introducing a highly requested feature for the handheld remote play device: cloud streaming without using a home console. The feature launches in beta this week, allowing PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers to stream select PS Plus games directly from the cloud.</p><p>The addition of cloud streaming is set to be a major upgrade for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-playstation-portal-just-isnt-good-enough/1100-6519416/" data-ref-id="1100-6519416">handheld PlayStation device</a>, which currently uses a remote-play system requiring a strong internet connection from both the Portal and the PS5 it's playing off. With cloud streaming, PS Plus Premium subscribers will be able to use the Portal to stream PS5 games, even without a PS5 console, similarly to how Xbox Cloud Gaming works for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. </p>

<p>The beta includes support for select PS5 games in the PS Plus game catalog, including Dave the Diver, Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Monster Hunter Rise, and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, among others. The beta doesn't currently allow for streaming games that have been purchased off the PS Store.</p><p>Players will be able to stream up to 1080p/60fps, with a 1080p stream requiring minimum 13 Mbps, and 720p requiring at least 7 Mbps. The cloud streaming beta is opt-in, and interested players with an active PS Plus Premium subscription can enable it under "Cloud Streaming (Beta)" in the setting menu of their Portal device.</p><p>"PS Portal was an ambitious product for us, and we have been delighted by the positive response from our fans and to see that our vision has resonated with the community," Sony said in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a> post about the new update.
