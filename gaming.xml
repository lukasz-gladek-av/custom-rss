			<p>It's been nearly three years since Deadline first <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-deal-nearly-completed-by-amazon-says-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Amazon was closing on a deal to adapt Mass Effect into a TV series for its Prime Video channel. Today, Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-writer-marvel-1236203755/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> that the deal is finally done, featuring Daniel Casey as the writer and executive producer of the show. Casey is known primarily for the screenplay of 2018's Kin, a sci-fi feature film, and 2021's Fast &amp; Furious 9. Neither of which were exactly masterpieces, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Anyway, Variety also reports that Karim Zreik will executive produce under his Cedar Tree Productions banner. Ari Arad and BioWare's Michael Gamble will also executive produce. Zreik has worked on several successful TV series, such as Jericho and a plethora of Marvel shows (Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Defenders, Runaways, The Punisher, The Gifted, Cloak &amp; Dagger, Legion, and Helstrom). Ari Arad has produced several feature film adaptations, such as 2004's The Punisher, 2007's Ghost Rider, 2008's Iron Man, 2017's Ghost in the Shell, 2022's Uncharted, and 2024's Borderlands. Finally, Michael Gamble is a BioWare veteran who has worked on every Mass Effect game since the second. He is also leading the project for the next game installment and recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-next-will-stay-photorealistic-and-mature-confirms-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that it would retain the photorealistic style and mature tone of the previous entries.</p>
<p>No details are currently available on the plot or on the casting. For Prime Video, this is yet another gaming adaptation. They've had massive success with Bethesda's Fallout, of course, and they also <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-is-a-live-action-tv-adaptation-of-the-game-series-due-this-october-on-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Like a Dragon: Yakuza last month. Amazon has two more heavy hitting gaming TV series on the way: <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tomb Raider</a>.</p>
<p>As for Mass Effect, today is N7 Day, so it's a good day for fans to get this near-announcement. There won't be much else, given that BioWare has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Dragon Age: The Veilguard, beyond a return of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-adds-cross-save-brings-back-mass-effects-normandy-on-n7-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaboration with No Man's Sky</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-177-weapons/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a blog post highlighting everything coming to Warzone and Black Ops 6 in season one, it was revealed that the battle royale platform will have <strong>177 weapons </strong>for players to choose from. The funny thing is that they’re almost entirely useless as a collective, and players will split their time between just a handful of them.</p>



<p>That collection includes a whopping 33 assault rifles and 30 SMGs.</p>



<p>When is enough enough?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-too-many-weps">Too Many Weps</h2>



<p>Warzone needs something of a reset. Over the years, games have fused with the Warzone ecosystem and had their weapons pulled into the fray, but as time has gone on, it has become increasingly ridiculous. Now, with the delivery of season one, Warzone will have 177 weapons to choose from.</p>



<p>That breakdown looks something like this:</p>



<ul>
<li>Assault Rifles – 33</li>



<li>Battle Rifles – 10</li>



<li>SMGs – 30</li>



<li>Shotguns – 13</li>



<li>LMGs – 16</li>



<li>Marksman Rifles – 17</li>



<li>Sniper Rifles – 16</li>



<li>Pistols – 17</li>



<li>Launchers – 9</li>



<li>Melee – 15</li>
</ul>



<p>The split includes 60 weapons from Modern Warfare III, 77 from MW II, and 40 from Black Ops 6. At some point, something has to give, because surely keeping up the balancing and maintenance on all 177 weapons is getting a bit tiresome for Activision’s teams.</p>



<p>On November 14, Warzone will also get a new Resurgence map named Area 99, a small-form map inspired by Nuketown. It’s set in the Nevada desert and replicates a top-secret weapons testing facility that was built in the 1950s. It’s almost post-apocalyptic in how it looks, and it should play pretty nicely as well.</p>



<p>Also in the season one update, Urzkistan and Rebirth Island will be returning to the Warzone ecosystem.</p>



<p>Next year, we should have our first return to Verdansk since 2021, which will be a monumental moment for Warzone fans worldwide.</p>



<p>What weapons do you use in Warzone? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>It has been five months since Gears of War: E-Day was revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase, and not much else has been said about the project. Today, The Coalition revealed that both John DiMaggio (Marcus Fenix) and Carlos Ferro (Dom Santiago) will be returning to reprise their characters in E-Day.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-glory-days">The Glory Days</h2>



<p>Gears of War surfaced in 2006, and since it dropped, it has spawned several follow-up titles, widely becoming known as one of the best Xbox-exclusive franchises ever created. It has been five years since the last major release in the series, and it could still be a while yet until the next one drops, given that Gears of War: E-Day doesn’t have a release window.</p>



<p>In June, the next game in the Gears of War series was revealed:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine) - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EC20gLfUHeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In a post on social media, the team at The Coalition revealed that both John DiMaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their iconic roles in E-Day:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>On today’s 18th anniversary of Gears of War, we’re proud to share that John DiMaggio and Carlos Ferro are reprising their roles as the iconic voices of Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago in Gears of War: E-Day.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It wouldn’t have been right to have anyone else voice them – especially Marcus Fenix. That gravelly, foreboding tone has been instantly recognisable for almost twenty years.</p>



<p>E-Day will be a prequel of sorts, taking players back to the beginning of the storyline that saw the Locust rise up and lay siege to the world of Sera. The first Gears of War game was the closest we got to that part of the timeline, but now we’re going even further back.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Gears of War E-Day? Let us know your expectations in the comments.</p>

Daniel Casey from F9: The Fast Saga will write and executive produce the series. Karim Zreik, Ari Arad, and Michael Gamble from EA will join as executive producers. At the moment, the plot details haven’t been revealed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mass Effect TV’s Karim Zreik has experience with Marvel TV shows like Daredevil, The Punisher, and more. Ari Arad has worked on other game adaptations, such as Borderlands, Uncharted and more, along with Marvel Movies like Iron Man.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mass Effect is a third-person shooter franchise set in a distant future, where humans and aliens have colonised the Milky Way. Microsoft Game Studios previously published the game series, which EA later acquired.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main series features four titles: Mass Effect (2007), Mass Effect 2 (2010), Mass Effect 3 (2012) and Mass Effect: Andromeda (2017). The original trilogy follows the journey of Commander Shepard as the character tries to save the galaxy from the hands of the Reapers. Andromeda was unrelated to the trilogy and featured a new setting and fresh characters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 is getting a stacked roadmap for season one. It all starts on November 14, and Treyarch has well and truly outdone itself in preparing a sumptuous content drop. There are seven new weapons and new attachments coming to Black Ops 6 from November 14, with some dropping midway through the season just to stagger things a little.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here is every new weapon coming in Black Ops 6 season one.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-guns-guns-guns">Guns, Guns, Guns</h2>



<p>There are seven major weapons being added to Black Ops 6 in season one, but they won’t all be easy to obtain. Some will only be available to unlock during special events, while others will be battle pass rewards – so you’ll need to grind a little to get to them.</p>



<p>Here’s the full breakdown of new weapons in Black Ops 6 with a note on how to unlock them:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Krig C </strong>(AR) – Battle Pass unlock</li>



<li><strong>SAUG</strong> (SMG) – Battle Pass unlock</li>



<li><strong>SIRIN 9MM </strong>(SMG) – Event unlock</li>



<li><strong>Power Drill </strong>(Melee) – Event unlock</li>



<li><strong>Maelstrom </strong>(Shotgun) – Event unlock</li>



<li><strong>Cleaver </strong>(Melee) – Mid-season unlock</li>



<li><strong>AMR MOD 4 </strong>(Sniper Rifle) – Mid-season unlock</li>
</ul>



<p>And here are the two new attachments coming to the game:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Buffer Weight Stock</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dragon’s Breath</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>That’s right, Treyarch is adding <strong>Dragon’s Breath </strong>to Black Ops 6. In case you’ve never heard of that, it’s the incendiary shotgun attachment that turns each shot into a blast of pure heat, lighting your enemies up in a ball of fire.</p>



<p>There are also two new conversion kits coming: XM4 and Kompakt 92 Burst Fire.</p>



<p>Treyarch has promised that there’s more to come as the season unfolds, so this might not be it.</p>

<p>Competitive fans are celebrating as Treyarch announces the impending arrival of Ranked Play in Black Ops 6. It’s bizarre that it’s surfacing before the Call of Duty League’s 2025 season has been formally announced but never mind.</p>



<p>From November 14, Ranked Play will be live in Black Ops 6, giving the more talented players a place to flex their abilities. Let’s just hope it doesn’t end up like Modern Warfare III and have the Top 250 ranks overflowing with cheaters, right?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-will-you-rank">Where Will You Rank?</h2>



<p>Treyarch revealed the roadmap for season one of Black Ops 6 and Warzone, all of which kicks off on November 14.</p>



<p>There’s a stacked content drop coming, including new maps, a fresh Resurgence experience, new modes (including Prop Hunt), and a massive host of new weapons. It’s an exciting time to be a Call of Duty fan, and hopefully, you’ve finished your Dark Matter grind in time to pick up everything that season one has to offer.</p>



<p>It’ll be as typical a competitive system as you could hope for.</p>



<p>It’s good to see that Activision has learned from past mistakes. In previous games, Ranked Play didn’t arrive for several months. Last year’s Call of Duty – Modern Warfare III – was released in October, but Ranked Play didn’t arrive until February. That was an insane gap that left ambitious fans hungry for a bigger challenge, and it harmed the game’s ecosystem to no end.</p>



<p>Will you be diving into Ranked Play when it arrives? Let us know in the comments.</p>

                <p>8BitDo has released some great keyboards, but so far, they've all been tenkeyless (TKL) models that don't include a traditional numpad (although these are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Supports-Calculator-Bluetooth-Gaming-Console/dp/B00PN9S6JU?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sold separately as add-ons</a>). However, that's about to change as 8BitDo is finally launching full-size models of its Retro Keyboards based on its popular<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKXH5WCD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="nofollow "> NES</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKXDH8BG?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="nofollow ">Famicom</a>-inspired designs.

Like other 8BitDo products, these keyboards can also be heavily customized using the company's in-house Ultimate Software program, or if you're in a hurry, fast-mapping on programmable buttons won't require booting up the 8BitDo client.</p>                      </div><p>These also support wireless connections via 2.4GHz and Bluetooth as well as wired via USB-C, and the included Super Buttons are a pair of big microswitch keys that can be customized to serve a wide selection of functions. The form factor on these keyboards are also very ergonomic, as the contoured design makes them feel great to work on. If they're anything like the smaller models, these will work great on not only Windows and Android devices, but also wirelessly on iOS, Mac, and Steam Deck.</p><hr><h2>More 8BitDo Keyboard Deals</h2><p>Alternatively, you can grab the current TKL models as well, as these are available in a wider selection of retro-inspired designs.

            <p>
It's been a good few years since reports surfaced Amazon was looking to adapt <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> for television, but finally - as N7 day rolls around once more - the show has been made official.
</p>
<p>
A Mass Effect TV show was first touted back in 2021, when former BioWare lead writer Mac Walters explained various factors has contributed in the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-explains-why-the-mass-effect-movie-fell-by-the-wayside">shifting its initial vision of a movie adaptation toward something for the smaller screen</a>. Later that same year, reports surfaced claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-nearing-a-deal-for-mass-effect-tv-series">Amazon was "nearing a deal" for a Mass Effect TV series</a>, as part of its ongoing push into sci-fi and fantasy storytelling.
</p>
<p>
And now those reports have been confirmed. Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-writer-marvel-1236203755/">says</a> a Mass Effect TV series is now officially in development at Amazon, with Fast &amp; Furious 9 (AKA F9: The Fast Saga) scribe Daniel Casey on writing and executive producer duties. Casey isn't a complete stranger to sci-fi, having previously written 2018 movie Kin and done rewrites for 2016's 10 Cloverfield Lane.

<p>
Also executive producing are Karim Zreik, EA's Michael Gamble, and Ari Arad, who's served as producer on everything from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a> movie and last year's terrible Borderlands adaptation, to the Spider-Verse series and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-film-releases-some-time-within-this-decade-so-thats-something">Nintendo's upcoming Zelda film</a>.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, details of Amazon's Mass Effect adaptation are limited, but we do know ardent gamer and former Witcher Henry Cavill at one time had an interest in the project. Back in February 2021, Cavill was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-teases-secret-project-that-appears-to-be-related-to-mass-effect">snapped alongside a script</a> apparently related to Mass Effect; then in December that year, not long after Amazon was said to be nearing a deal, Cavill casually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-would-love-to-discuss-being-in-the-mass-effect-tv-series">revealed</a> he'd "love to have a conversation" about it. However, with Cavill now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-reportedly-set-to-star-in-a-warhammer-40k-series-at-amazon">confirmed to be involved with Amazon's Warhammer adaptation</a>, it's likely things have change.
</p>
<p>
One person probably <em>not</em> excited about a Mass Effect TV series is ex-Bioware lead writer David Gaider, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-bioware-writer-mass-effect-tv-show-cringe">previously said</a> the idea of BioWare television adaptations made him "cringe".
</p>
<p>
"For starters, Mass Effect and Dragon Age had a custom protagonist," he explained. "Meaning said TV show will need to pick whether said protagonist will be male or female. Boom, right off the bat you've just alienated a whole bunch of the built-in fan base who had their hopes up... Secondly, those protagonists are designed to be a bit of a blank slate, one that the player fills out with their decisions. That's not going to work for a passive medium. So, suddenly, the protagonist will have their own personality... and their own <em>story</em>. That will be weird."
</p><p>
"Both Mass Effect and Dragon Age's plots were, at best, serviceable," he continued. "Those plots had to take into account the player's agency. They were kind of the shell upon which that player's emotional engagement was delivered - usually through the companions and the choices themselves. Choice heightened engagement. Interactivity was the star, not the plot."
</p>
<p>
"Take all that out, lose most of the companions, and you potentially end up with... a pretty run-of-the-mill fantasy or science-fiction show, one where a lot of the built-in audience has possibly been turned into outraged, howling malcontents before it's even released."
</p>
<p>
Amazon has, of course, already navigated similar issues with this year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> TV adaptation, and that ended up releasing to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">significant acclaim</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">commercial success</a>. So time will tell if Gaider's concerns prove warranted.

		<p>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, the grimdark sci-fi successor to Fatshark’s popular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/25/vermintide-2-review-worth-playing-2022-warhammer-games/">Vermintide</a> series, is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> on 3rd December, the studio has announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Coming to PS5 December 3 | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_XqYUfiY7Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Darktide on PS5 will have all of the content and improvements made to the game since the PC launch, and on top of that comes with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro Enhanced</a> marker. That means you’ll see the following performance targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frame rate of 60 FPS on a 4K resolution for PlayStation 5 Pro</li>
<li>Performance mode (60FPS on a 1440p resolution) for PlayStation 5</li>
<li>Quality Mode (30FPS on a 4K resolution) for PlayStation 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PS5 version will likely be a pretty close match to the game on Xbox Series X, but there’s naturally that further step available for the game when playing on PS5 Pro that matches Sony’s vision for the best of both worlds between Quality and Performance modes.</p>
<p>Darktide first launched for PC in November 2022, but was met with no small amount of negativity from the Vermintide community over performance, bugs and the game progression in general. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/25/warhammer-40k-darktide-xbox-release-delayed-as-developer-focusses-on-improvements/">Fatshark postponed the Xbox Series X|S release in order to address those problems</a>, eventually launching the game on console in October 2023. Now, whether there was an exclusivity contract or not, the game is coming to PS5.</p>

<p>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide sees you joining a team of Inquisitorial Operatives, embarking on a series of missions, attempting to free a city from the clutches of the corrupted forces of Chaos. The twist is that, where you might expect to be a loyal member of the Space Marines in most 40K games, you’re actually a criminal given a chance at redemption after saving the life of an Imperial Guard officer from Chaos worshippers. That means that you won’t have all the best weapons and gear that you’d see in something like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a>, so there’s still a fair bit of melee combat alongside the gunplay.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed the game, with Dom saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/19/warhammer-40000-darktide-review/">our review</a>, “Darktide is an absolute blast. Its heavyweight blend of melee and gunplay ensure that the flow of frantic runs into the hive city just keep on coming.”</p>

But this year, the team just put out another game, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> and doesn’t want to steal the game’s thunder with a bunch of teases for a game that’s still a ways out. However, brand synergy is strong, and BioWare has put some <em>Mass Effect</em>-themed armor sets in <em>The Veilguard</em> for free.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The <em>Mass Effect </em>clothing can be found in the Lighthouse base. If you’ve finished Harding’s mission, “The Singing Blade,” you’ll find a chest next to the Workshop. Inside are two armor appearances called Specter of Battles Past and Paragon of Leadership as well as a helmet called Command Helmet. These aren’t armor sets with new stats, but instead are appearances you can set to wear in Rook’s room while maintaining the defense and effects of other armor sets. The Specter of Battles Past includes the recognizable red stripe down the sleeve that any <em>Mass Effect </em>fan would recognize as an homage to Commander Shepard’s armor in the original trilogy. That’s a fun way to pay tribute to the dormant series as <em>Dragon Age </em>is having a moment.</p><p>Outside of <em>The Veilguard</em>, BioWare has also tapped <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-mass-effect-n7-armor-garrus-liara-cosmetics-1851209161&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-mass-effect-n7-armor-garrus-liara-cosmetics-1851209161"><em>Destiny</em></a></span> developer Bungie and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hey-they-got-mass-effect-in-our-no-mans-sky-1846939847&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hey-they-got-mass-effect-in-our-no-mans-sky-1846939847"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a></span><em> </em>studio HelloGames to bring back their respective <em>Mass Effect</em>-themed events.

<p>Prop Hunt is a fan favourite mode that offers a change of pace from storming around online and sweating to grind camos. However, it hasn’t been seen in a Call of Duty game since 2020’s Black Ops Cold War.</p>



<p>That’s set to change, though. Treyarch has just revealed that on November 14, when Black Ops 6’s first season goes live, it’ll bring with it a new iteration of Prop Hunt.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-proper-fun">Proper Fun</h2>



<p>Prop Hunt has been in a few Call of Duty games, but it’s by no means a common game mode. In recent years, it appeared in Black Ops 4, Cold War, Modern Warfare, and COD Mobile, but it has been almost four years since it was in a Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>On November 14, Treyarch and Raven Software will deploy the first season of Black Ops 6 and Warzone, and along with that comes Prop Hunt.</p>



<p>In case you’re not familiar, Prop Hunt sees one team assume the role of prop hunters, while the other team becomes a series of ‘props’. That means that they become barrels, crates, lamps, vending machines – anything around a given map that makes sense. They’ll then need to ‘hide’ as a prop while the hunters try to weed them out.</p>



<p>It’s great fun and it’s nothing competitive at all. It’s one of the most casual modes in the Call of Duty ecosystem, and that’s why gamers appreciate it. It makes a nice break from the cacophony of traditional multiplayer modes.</p>



<p>In season one, alongside Prop Hunt, Black Ops 6 players will also get access to ‘Ransack’ and Ranked Play, which is sure to ignite a vibrant competitive ecosystem that’ll last until the next Call of Duty game comes around.</p>



<p>Are you going to play Prop Hunt? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>We thought it would happen, and Treyarch is delivering. From November 14, The Replacer will surface in Black Ops 6 as a playable operator, being added to the game in a tracer pack named for the character himself. In the weeks leading up to the launch of Black Ops 6, The Replacer was<strong> everywhere</strong>, and it was the most successful part of Activision’s marketing campaign for the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-replace-your-operators">Replace Your Operators</h2>



<p>On November 14, Black Ops 6’s season one update will go live, introducing new maps, modes, weapons, events, and <strong>much </strong>more. One of the most exciting things about the season one patch is the arrival of The Replacer in playable form.</p>



<p>Given his involvement in the marketing campaign before Black OPs 6 hit the market and his long-time connection to the Black Ops series, he’ll likely be a fan-favourite tracer pack purchase as soon as the first season drops.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that he’s being added within a tracer pack bundle, so he won’t be a unique operator. Instead, he’ll <strong>replace </strong>an existing one as a playable skin. So, he’s technically an operator, but kind of isn’t. Similarly, midway through the season, a bizarre, neon-fuelled character named Brightmare will be added, also to replace an existing operator.</p>



<p>The only new operators this season will be Sev (Tier 100) and Goliath (Blackcell).</p>



<p>Black Ops 6’s season one update introduces a huge amount of content, from the new Area 99 resurgence map in Warzone to Prop Hunt in multiplayer. It’s a stacked roadmap for sure.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the first season of Black Ops 6?</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games has announced what's next for Grand Theft Auto Online, and November's updates to the multiplayer game is all about what some believe be the game's best and most exciting feature: <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Heists_in_GTA_Online" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heists</a>.</p><p>Every week in November will focus on a different GTA Online Heist. This kicks off this week with the Cayo Perico Heist, with more to come throughout the month.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, GTA Online's heists call on players to take part in multi-mission campaigns with the aim of committing a high-profile crime with a lucrative payout.</p><p>The <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/GTA_Online:_The_Cayo_Perico_Heist" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cayo Perico heist</a>, which was first released in 2020, has players trekking to the private island of Cayo Perico, fighting against armed guards, and getting away with all the money you can find. Players can take on heists solo or with friends, and coordinating with teammates makes it pretty thrilling.</p><p>November also brings a new Community Challenge, and this one is all about heists, naturally. Rockstar is calling on players to collectively steal $20 trillion worth of in-game cash between now and December 4, and if successful, Rockstar will give out "a vault full of rewards" to players.</p><p>Players who successfully complete the Cayo Perico heist between now and November 13 will earn the Panther Statue, with other rewards to be revealed later for completing more heists in November.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396180-screenshot2024-11-07at10.42.18am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396180" data-ratio="0.561850802644" data-width="1059" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396180-screenshot2024-11-07at10.42.18am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396180"></a><figcaption>The Panther Statue</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396180-screenshot2024-11-07at10.42.18am.png"></figure><p>For more, be sure to <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/9kk3243ka35572/break-into-the-heist-challenge-all-month-long" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read Rockstar's full blog post</a> to get up to speed on everything new in GTA Online this week and beyond.

I considered this a solid investment because it cost a lot of money but I was trapped in my house, thus necessitating a smooth internet experience. Over the years I have come to loathe this router, in part because I have gotten more savvy with networking generally, but mainly because it has slowly started to deteriorate and caused me nothing but grief.</p><figure><figcaption>Several options exist from companies like Protectli, CWWK, Topton, and more. Credit: CWWK, Gowin.</figcaption></figure><p>If you have lived with a mediocre Wi-Fi router, I want to let you know that a better way is possible. Affordable wired routers and access points exist. You can just make your own mesh network, building a router like it was a computer or using premade accessible mini PCs. While it’s more technically complicated than just buying a router, there’s a massive quality of life improvement.</p><h2>Splitting the difference — using Wi-Fi Access points and wired routers</h2><figure><figcaption>I went with Grandstream, although it has its annoyances. People seem to like TP-Link. I tried UniFi and hated using them.</figcaption></figure><p>One reason why I hate consumer Wi-Fi routers is because they’re all-in-one devices. Wi-Fi standards get updated fairly frequently, and combining the router part with the wireless part often leads to an experience that becomes obsolete faster. What’s more, this is often not ideal for getting the best Wi-Fi coverage in your home. And while consumer mesh systems do address this, I prefer to just go with something closer to business or enterprise grade.</p><p>One way you can approach this is by just getting a wired router and using wireless access points to handle the Wi-Fi traffic. You can get a rock solid wired router for 50 bucks if you don’t need to go over a gigabit. For wired products I’m a huge fan of Latvian company Mikrotik. Their RouterOS is as solid as a rock, and they have an endearing YouTube channel. Additionally, you can just make a teensy hardware router using Single Board Computers like the NanoPi, but I’ll get to that later.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="hEX - the most affordable Ethernet router RE-RELEASED" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zrzq_zPWoQ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>MikroTik makes really good wired routers that don't break the bank and have a delightful youtube channel. If you don't need more than 1 Gigabit Ethernet, they have a lot of very inexpensive routers. </figcaption></figure></div><p>For wireless access points a lot of people enjoy Unifi by Ubiquiti. I had these in the past and personally do not enjoy them. They exist in a weird zone between enterprise and enthusiast, costing too much to justify the quality of service. The software needed to manage them requires either buying their hardware or running that proprietary software locally on a docker container or Raspberry Pi. This entire process is needlessly annoying. For the same money you can buy access points from companies like Grandstream or TP-Link’s Omada system, which <a href="https://dongknows.com/tp-link-omada-class-diy-mesh-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people seem to like</a> and which offer way more features for your money. You can even buy decommissioned older enterprise hardware from brands like Ruckus, Cisco and Aruba. Older enterprise hardware isn’t going to be the latest and greatest, but it’s solid as a rock.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Finding the BEST Cheap 2.5GbE Switch... by Testing 21 of Them" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-pYQvEX9Ct0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>2.5 and 10 gigabit network switches have gotten ridiculously cheap. Most people won't take advantage of that kind of performance, but it's gotten so cheap you may as well.  </figcaption></figure></div><p>I ended up going with Grandstream’s access points. Though they have their annoying quirks if you don’t use <a href="https://www.grandstream.com/products/networking-solutions/wi-fi-management/product/gwn-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GWN Manager</a> (I had to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ssh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ssh</a> into one of them to update a firmware URL), they can manage themselves if you prefer that and are an incredible deal for the money. A lot of these access points have PoE (Power of Ethernet), which means they can be powered over the same ethernet cable that transfers data. In the last few years, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">network switches</a> have gotten very cheap and fast, and you can often find units that go up to 2.5 GbE and will power all your access points for not a lot of cash. Multiple access points, powered by a network switch, into a wired router can give you fast, reliable coverage for about the price of a high end consumer router or mesh system. Since the individual parts are distinct from each other, you have a better route for upgrading each of those things down the line.</p><h2>Making your router suck less with OpenWRT</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Here's how to make your router BETTER! (OpenWRT)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HgOA9oUSpmM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Another path you can take to make your router suck less is, hardware permitting, have it run a different OS, specifically OpenWRT. OpenWRT is a Linux-based OS for embedded devices like routers that provides a standardized, open source and frequently updated platform for your router. This is great in particular if you’d like to repurpose an older Wi-Fi router which is not getting updated as frequently as it used to. Not all routers support OpenWRT, although I wish they did. In my case, there is some experimental support for my cursed Netgear, but<a href="https://openwrt.org/inbox/toh/netgear/netgear_rax120_nighthawk_ax12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> only the V2 model</a>, which I do not have. What’s more, there’s always the potential to brick your router, although if you’re planning on getting rid of it anyway this is a great way to breathe life into an old device.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="NanoPi R5C OpenWRT Router" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GsxuoSXb9A4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>OpenWRT also runs on a variety of devices. My <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934731/valetudo-robot-vacuum-hacking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hacked robot vacuum </a>actually runs on a <a href="https://robotinfo.dev/robotinfo_dreame.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modified version of the OpenWRT</a>. FriendlyELEC makes a variety of single board computers like the NanoPi series that can be effectively used as routers by installing OpenWRT.&nbsp;</p><h2>Block ads before they get there: Pihole, Adguard and Blockly</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Block ALL ads with this…(and speed up your internet)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2V_8M9cjYw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Whenever someone starts screwing around with Raspberry Pis, the first thing everyone recommends is installing Pi-hole. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi-hole" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pi-hole</a> is a DNS sinkhole that’s really easy to install and effectively blocks a bunch of ads and internet tracking and prevents certain unwanted traffic. However, over the years since it has been created, other more robust options have come along. <a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AdGuard Home</a> is one option, and has a really robust interface and set of filters. If you have kids, it does a great job at blocking adult-oriented traffic across an entire network. There’s also <a href="https://0xerr0r.github.io/blocky/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blocky</a>, which is newer but runs very lean, although it has to be set up on the command line. All of these options are valid ways to rapidly improve your overall network experience with only a little bit of work. If you go down this route using a Raspberry Pi, I personally prefer <a href="https://dietpi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DietPi</a> - an exceedingly lean OS that runs on a variety of single board computers and is a cinch to set up.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Pi-hole vs AdguardHome vs Blocky" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfBh2VVOVZA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><h2>The invasion of the Mini PCs: Topton/CWWK/Gowin and running ProxMox</h2><figure><figcaption><span>Several options exist from companies like Protectli, CWWK, Topton, and more. Credit: CWWK, Gowin.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over the last year I have become obsessed with a series of strange miniature PCs coming out of China. Often featured on the forums and YouTube channel of networking website Serve The Home, these firewall devices seem very similar to offerings from <a href="https://protectli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Protectli</a>. They often feature powerful processors for what they are, have a robust amount of I/O for a single device and run on a tiny amount of power. You will often see them from companies like Topton, CWWK, and GoWin.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Best EVER Fanless Mini PCs for Virtualization and Firewalls?" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bM6Ivy_KLR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>When it comes to using one of these as a router and firewall, these things are beasts. There are tons of ways to approach this, but two of the most common ones are PfSense and the open source alternative OpnSense (other options include VyOS and Mikrotik’s CHR platform, which are worse as firewalls and better at routing traffic). You can install these directly on the device, or you do what a lot of people do and install them via Proxmox. Proxmox is a virtualization platform that lets you run several virtual machines on the same machine. This means that in addition to running something like OpnSense for traffic, you can run several other things on the same device. This is what I did.</p><p>I decided to go with an Intel N100 based unit from CWWK. You can order these on Aliexpress, Amazon or directly from CWWK, although there are enough horror stories on the STH forums of people who got dud units and the latter is a bit easier when it comes to returns. When I got mine, I threw a 1TB SSD inside of it and 16 gigs of ram. I also made sure to reapply the anemic thermal paste on the unit with Thermalright TF8, which costs next to nothing and wowed reviewer <a href="https://www.igorslab.de/en/thermalright-tf8-thermal-compound-in-test-new-front-runner-at-the-limit-of-what-is-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Igor’s Lab</a> when compared to higher priced thermal paste.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Ultimate Beginner's Guide to OpnSense -  Installation - Part 1" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vJBoCgptF-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There are plenty of great tutorials out there on how to install OpnSense on Proxmox, and I will admit that I ran into some trouble that necessitated calling my ISP. But the process itself, despite being stressful, was very instructive, and now I feel very comfortable running new virtual machines on the device. Both Proxmox and OpnSense have bright, beautiful interfaces, my internet screams now, and the actual service runs so efficiently that I have tons of room left over to run other services on my network.</p><p>Everything in my house is running beautifully now. As I wrote this, I found a wonderful resource – a series of easy-to-use scripts by a user named tteck that automate the process of installing new Linux containers making it as easy as copy/pasting a simple command. I had also found out, suddenly, that tteck has told people that they will no longer be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1gk19gm/ttecks_proxmoxve_helper_scripts_changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maintaining the repo due to moving into hospice care</a>. “I have very limited time left on earth. weeks.” Since then, the scripts have a new home: <a href="https://community-scripts.github.io/Proxmox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community-Scripts</a>.</p><figure><a href="https://community-scripts.github.io/Proxmox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><figcaption>The old vs. the new: tteck's contributions are now a community effort.  <a href="https://ko-fi.com/proxmoxhelperscripts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tteck's ko-fi is here</a>, where you can see an outpouring of support. Credit: <a href="https://tteck.github.io/Proxmox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tteck</a>, <a href="https://community-scripts.github.io/Proxmox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community-scripts. </a></figcaption></figure><p>Easy to use, open source software like this only exists because people come together online to share knowledge. Without YouTube tutorials or forums like STH, I would not know where to start with building a Proxmox box. OpenWRT is maintained and worked on by volunteers attempting to unfuck the mess left by major companies. People like tteck selflessly maintain scripts even as they get sick. Companies are often not interested in maintaining their hardware unless they are forced to – they are happy to just sell you something that slowly disintegrates until you have to buy something new in a few years.&nbsp;</p><p>I have seen the glimpse of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPL</a> future where things are open, where old routers are given a second life, where things are self-hosted and where everyone has adult tools at their disposal. I want these things to be easy for everyone. These things are built on the sweat equity of nerds everywhere, but when you experience it, you realize it is a beautiful way to live. If we all put our minds to it, none of us have to deal with awful home Wi-Fi ever again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

						<h5>PlayStation 5 Pro</h5><p><span>November 7th, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>
					<p>Mid-generation console refreshes are nothing new in the gaming industry. Everything from the pre-market crash Atari 2600 up through just about every Nintendo console to hit the market, console manufacturers have found ways to introduce additional purchases into the lifespan of a console, usually accompanied by a form factor change or addition of new features in the box. The concept of introducing a console that could run all of the very same games but with added performance was something unique to the Sony ecosystem with the PlayStation 4 Pro or Microsoft’s Xbox One X. Companies like Nintendo tried something similar with the New Nintendo 3DS but these introduced games that were exclusive to the upgraded hardware (Xenoblade Chronicles being one of these rare titles). Sony’s PlayStation 5 Pro aims to be the console that can achieve a higher benchmark across all of their titles, but is that boosted flagship console worth the investment if you’re already a next-gen player?<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>What comes in the package is the same usual assortment of parts that Sony has bundled with all of their consoles. To get a deeper look at what's in the package and my powered-off impressions, check out our unboxing article <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-unboxing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. One of the first purchases I will be making this weekend will be to get the external disc drive so I can finally check out the latest Prince of Persia and several other titles from my backlog that I own the discs for and couldn't justify double-dipping on a digital version just to play on this particular piece of hardware. I know I will keep banging the same drum here, but I am really disappointed with Sony's answer to the horizontal stand on the PlayStation 5 Pro. It lacks stability, and nothing short of a hardware update could improve that stability, whether it's a third-party stand or purchasing that disc drive. The vertical stand that Sony provided would work for most people, but given how my consoles are set up directly below my wall-mounted television, there isn't space to have the PlayStation 5 Pro stand upright and not block the screen.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>PlayStation 5 Pro owners won't find a secret menu that gives players superuser access to overhaul the appearance and performance of a given game. Instead, Sony's PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) runs behind the scenes at all times. If players didn't have a list of PS5 Pro Enhanced titles or a base model PS5 sitting side by side, there's a good chance that the secret sauce wouldn't even be visible to the player. For some titles, such as Naughty Dog's The Last of Us, which features a Quality mode that runs at 30 FPS, the same mode running on PlayStation 5 Pro is a significant gameplay boost.</p>
<p>Personally, I found the Quality Mode on PS5 to be sluggish and not as responsive when it mattered most. The same game and graphical mode instead ran much closer to 60FPS, the same performance I was getting out of the aptly named Performance Mode. Right out of the box, for players booting up a PlayStation 5 Pro enhanced title, It Just Works™. One option available to players in the Screen and Video menu is the toggle for 8K Output (which, truth be told, I don’t have a capable display in my office and most likely won’t unless Sony does a massive upgrade to their InZone monitor line).<u></u><u></u></p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>Another graphical toggle on the PlayStation 5 Pro is to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-significantly-performance-improvements-game-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhance the image quality for PS4 games</a>. Interestingly, the toggle is disabled when the console is attached to a FullHD display, and the PS5 Pro will advise that this option is only for a display that supports 1440p or 2160p output. This doesn’t seem to be the only way to enhance a last-gen title as I started up Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven to take a peek at the image quality and was quite surprised at how much the console cleaned up and applied anti-aliasing to the character models and environment.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a 100% perfect enhancement as some strange artifacts and image warping appeared while I was focused on a particular character’s idle animation and the way the image would bend and partially distort as hair clashed with their helmet, something I hadn’t seen on the same version running on the base PS5. The fact it took me to stop and focus so intently on a specific character to notice a flaw meant that in action, I didn’t see much issue with the native upscaling in actual practice. I intend to revisit some of the other titles in my collection, Persona 5 Strikers for one, to see how much the aliasing and jagged edges I observed while reviewing that title have been addressed with the native PSSR support.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>I touched upon this during my unboxing, but the PlayStation 5 Pro design feels built for the optional disc drive attachment or the vertical stand, at the very least. The two white stand pieces offer a quick and dirty way to lay your PlayStation 5 Pro down horizontally, but with how much it would wobble, there's stability at play here that hurts the presentation and overall aesthetic of Sony's flagship console. Consider investing in something like Sony's vertical stand or the disc drive that'll permit playing the rest of your disc-based library, both of which will add to the total bill to the point of being in the ballpark of simply buying two PlayStation 5 Slim units.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>It will take some time to dig into and fully appreciate what Sony is bringing to the table with their mid-generation refresh of the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/ps5-pro/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>. With nearly 100 <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-an-incredible-feat-of-engineering-says-hello-games-no-mans-sky-8k30fps-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5 Pro Enhanced titles</a>, Sony has already shown a big commitment to proving their $699 console refresh is an initial value, but it will take through next year to see what the barriers of entry will be for every developer to take advantage of the PlayStation 5 Pro's unique feature set or the automated PSSR running behind the scenes. Many gamers might balk at the premium price tag of the PlayStation 5 Pro or use it as fuel for the ongoing console wars, but it's important to consider its role in the console ecosystem as more along the lines of an upgrade from the base GeForce RTX series to a SUPER. If you're guilty of upgrading your graphics card for $600 or more to achieve ten or fifteen more FPS in Cyberpunk 2077, you already know the value Sony's bringing to the table with the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p><em>[Editor's Note: Sony provided Wccftech with a PlayStation 5 Pro review unit for editorial purposes.]</em></p>

					
					

<p>Mark Cerny has crafted something amazing with the PlayStation 5 Pro, introducing new AI upscaling and PSSR rendering techniques that will make existing games look their best. Rather than being a new console entirely, Sony is positioning themselves as the graphics card upgrade that players have been asking for for years.</p>
