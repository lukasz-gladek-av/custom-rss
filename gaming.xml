			<p>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide already enlisted the dregs of the grimdark future’s society to fight back against the forces of Chaos, but the Hive Scum goes a step further by getting into bed with organised crime. It’s honestly a bit like a classic film noir set-up, with the gangsters of Tertium choosing to team up with the law and order of the Inquisitorial Warband to fight back against Chaos. And why? Just because the growing war has been really bad for business.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Hive Scum Class Reveal | Cinematic Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZetaKE7KQo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Put any images I’ve just conjured of Tommy guns, zoot suits and spats out of your mind, because the crime cartels of the 41st Millennium are much more punk rock than that. Literally, they look like old British punk rockers, slathered with full-body tattoos, with mohawks and spiked hair or… uh, just some really long sideburns, and uncomfortable-looking spiked leather outfits.</p>


<p>Darktide captures this look and feel perfectly, and there’s a bunch of new customisation options in the character creator to accommodate this. There’s new Hive Scum exclusive hairstyles, and you can dye hair different colours too, new tattoos, face paint and more besides. You also get to choose from four gangs to be aligned with –&nbsp;the Water Cartel, Iron Riders, Show, and Tread Lightlies. Necromunda fans will have a field day with all of this, or they would if they knew what a field was.</p>


<p>For as distinctive as the Hive Scum are compared to the rest of the Inquisitor’s gang, they play even more differently. It starts with the weaponry, and in true gang runner fashion, there’s absolutely no common sense applied to always running around with twinned blades and twinned automatic pistols. Heck, they even blast away with the guns in side grip half the time. This is very much the rule of cool, and plays into the indiscriminate firing style that the Hive Scum is really all about. It’s spray and pray more than precise aiming, and should be good for dealing with hordes of more basic enemies. For the melee side of things, you can also swap to a vicious looking bone saw, or a crowbar, which you can flip in hand to go from blunt-sided enemy-staggering sweeps to pointy end stabby stuff.</p>
<p>There’s a new Toxins damage type that comes with the Hive Scum. Alongside a concussive grenade and missile launcher, you can pick the chem grenade that is able to make a toxic gas cloud, and there’s also the needle pistol as a main gun option, which has been realised to deal this special type of damage. This actually bleeds through armour to affect tougher enemies, which is a really interesting twist, but it also acts a bit like the classic Virus Outbreak stratagem card from the 2nd Edition Warhammer 40K era. While it won’t be quite so devastating, the Toxin effect is able to spread between enemies, dealing damage over time throughout an onrushing horde.</p>

<p>As with all the other classes in the game, there’s a lengthy skill tree to work through as you level up, building up to playstyle defining ultimate abilities. the Desperado goes all in on Gun Fu-inspired shenanigans, making you impossible to hit with ranged attacks throughout and giving you unlimited ammo. The effect is prolonged by killing marked enemies, so you can keep it going for a good long time, though this time boost diminishes. On the other side is Rampage, which ramps up your melee damage, again prolonging the effect by hitting and killing enemies, making you a bit of a glass cannon.</p>
<p>The most interesting one, though, is the Stimm Supply ability, dropping a box that will spew out a cloud of enhancing drugs for you and your teammates –&nbsp;either a strong effect when within the cloud or to “Huff and Go”a bit reduced but sticking with people who’ve left the smog. This ties in with the Hive Scum’s second talent tree, which can be used to cook up their own custom stimms.</p>
<p>Essentially, this takes all the possibilities from the stimms other characters can find and use and turns them into a mix-and-match skill tree of their own. You add different components and buffs, and can either go all in on one effect category or blend them together. The most powerful aspects are that this is on a cooldown, making it as integral to the character as their weapons and ultimates, and that it’s instantly used right in the middle of the fray, just by hitting the button. The only thing you really need to balance is how strong to make the stimm, because the more powerful the effect, the longer the cooldown will be.</p>
<p>Hive Scum feels like it will be a really fun addition to explore through Darktide, and there’s great potential for this criminal class to interact with some of the more reputable parts of the Inquisitorial Warband when on missions together.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, Hive Scum will launch alongside a free update to Darktide that brings a new mission and narrative arc to the game. The No Man’s Land operation will show how this war against Chaos is evolving yet again, spilling out to the outskirts of the hive city, letting you see the dim grey skies and visit a sprawling trench network. Lovely.</p>
<p>Your mission here is to escort the tank of Knight Commander Dragor through to breach some stronghold walls as you battle down in the trenches. These are really wide and open trenches compared to WWI, but do lead to a rather linear feeling level thanks to the sharp 90º corners. One thing that old 40K fans will appreciate is the scenery around the main channel of battle, as you might see some iconic 3rd Edition plastic ruins rendered in all their polygonal glory in the periphery.</p>

<p>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide looks to be going from strength to strength, with Fatshark having settled into a practised groove for producing new characters and meaningfully continuing the narrative of this co-op shooter through new levels and story arcs. As they arrive next week on 2nd December, Hive Scum and No Man’s Land are just the latest examples of this, both great visual and thematic changes of pace that I’m keen to see evolve further.</p>

<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips">LinusTechTips</a> has built a gaming PC featuring specs similar to Valve's upcoming system, providing a good preview of the performance the system is expected to offer (which is speculated to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-rely-amd-fsr-4k-60/">heavily rely on AMD FSR to deliver 4K resolution at 60 FPS gameplay</a>). Building this system with off-the-shelf parts (some of which offered nice-to-have features that didn't significantly impact performance), purchased at their lowest historical price, resulted in a total cost of $602.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Component Type</strong></td><td><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)">Componen</strong><strong>t</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)"> Name</strong></td><td><strong>Historical Lower Price</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>AMD Ryzen 5 8400F</td><td>$84</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Motherboard</strong></td><td>Asrock B650M-H M.2+</td><td>$100</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>Crucial (2x8) 16 GB 5600MT/s CL46</td><td>$44</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Case</strong></td><td>Player's Choice</td><td>$50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>PSU</strong></td><td>Seasnoic GX-550 550W</td><td>$55</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>Asrock Challenger Radeon RX 6600</td><td>$175</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SSD</strong></td><td>Kingston NV3 500 GB</td><td>$38</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Controller</strong></td><td>Gamesir Cyclone 2</td><td>$56</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>On the other hand, if this system were to be built today under current market conditions, which are severely impacted by<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/memory-markets-have-entered-a-panic-buying-phase/"> memory shortages</a> that are already forcing companies such as <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpowerpc-announces-price-changes-for-its-gaming-pcs-due-to-higher-ram-and-ssd-prices/">CyberPowerPC to increase the prices of their gaming PC</a>s, the cost would rise to $900. Going for cheaper parts that would keep the system's performance as is, the cost would be $813.</p>



<p>However, since Valve benefits from a direct-to-consumer model that lets them retain both brand and retailer margins, the total cost of the system (unlikely to be below $600–$650) will ultimately be decided by the markup Valve targets</p>



<p>If market conditions don't change further, Linus estimates that the system may cost $699.99, as this price is above the company's current cost. As the Steam Machine will be on sale for years, there will be plenty of opportunities for the company to improve its margins.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The STEAM Machine Won't Cost What You Think" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iHkBcqW-ExY?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Although Linus' estimate sounds reasonable, based on the analysis, it's challenging to predict the Steam Machine's price accurately at this point. Valve has yet to confirm it, but has already stated that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/">it will be really competitive, and in line with the cost of building a PC with similar specs</a>, and that <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/">the system won't be subsidized</a>, meaning that the company is not going to sell it at a loss at launch - something other console makers like Sony and Microsoft have done in the past thanks to the 30% cut on games sales from their own digital stores, a cut Valve also takes from every game sold on Steam.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roborock Dumps 22,000Pa Robot Vacuum at Zero-Profit, Self-Emptying Tech Now at All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-dumps-22000pa-robot-vacuum-at-zero-profit-self-emptying-tech-now-at-all-time-low-2000648426</link>
            <guid>1367527</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cheap robot vacuums that bump randomly around rooms, miss entire areas and get stuck constantly serve no purpose beyond cluttering the market and disappointing <strong>buyers who conclude that robot vacuums fundamentally don’t work</strong>. These failures damage the category’s reputation while advanced models demonstrate what’s actually possible when engineering takes priority over cost-cutting that creates barely functional products.</p>
<p>The <strong>Roborock Saros 10R</strong> represents ultra-premium robot vacuum technology that handles everything, and it is now available at <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/">$999 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $1,599</a>. The $600 reduction brings this flagship model to pricing closer to Roborock’s mid-tier offerings before this sale, and makes the best autonomous cleaning accessible without the usual four-figure investment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>3.14-Inch Ultra-Slim Design That Fits Everywhere</h2>
<p>The <strong>new slim 3.14-inch profile gets rid of the raised LiDAR towers</strong> that stop regular robot vacuums from getting under furniture with low clearance, where dust builds up without being disturbed. Cleaning beds, sofas, cabinets, and coffee tables is now possible instead of having to manually vacuum or let dust build up all the time.</p>



<p>The <strong>22,000Pa suction gives it cleaning power that rivals high-end upright vacuums</strong>&nbsp;and the robot itself is small and can move around on its own. This powerful suction pulls out pet hair that is stuck deep in carpet fibers that weaker robots can’t reach, lifts dirt that has been ground into tile grout lines, and picks up fine dust from hardwood floors in one pass without needing to clean again. The <em>DuoDivide</em> main brush and <em>FlexiArm</em> <em>Riser</em> side brush don’t get tangled up so they can handle hair up to 40 cm long without the problems that other robots have.</p>
<p>The <em>FlexiArm Riser</em> technology is the first of its kind in the industry: It lets <strong>both the side brush and the mop automatically reach corners and edges</strong> that fixed-position cleaning heads can’t get to. Watch the arm swing out when it gets close to baseboards. It cleans all the way up to the walls instead of leaving the one-inch dirt lines that regular robots leave along the edges.</p>



<p>The <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis has wheels that can be <strong>adjusted independently and can climb over things up to 4 cm high</strong> like door thresholds, thick rugs, and cable runs that stop regular robots from working without help. The system changes the height of each wheel based on the terrain, keeping the robot stable as it goes over obstacles that would tip or beach standard robots with fixed chassis heights.</p>
<p>The dock does all of the maintenance work such as removing the mop automatically for vacuum-only modes, washing the mop with 176°F hot water to get rid of tough stains, drying it with 131°F hot air to stop mildew, c<strong>ollecting dust automatically every 60 days</strong>, refilling the tank automatically, dispensing detergent automatically, and cleaning the hot water dock itself.</p>
<p>Roborock’s best technology costs $999 on Black Friday which is the lowest price ever and it saves you $600. Their mid-range models don’t have the ultra-slim design, <em>FlexiArm</em> extension, <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis, or full dock automation that their best models do. If you want to really get rid of manual floor cleaning with technology that works, this is the deal for you.</p>

              <p>Amazon is on a mission to make streaming easy for everyone with its compact, feature-packed devices, and the retailer is now letting you bring one home without paying the full price.</p>
<p>Black Friday kicks off tomorrow, but Amazon is already offering up to 50% off its top-rated entertainment gadgets, smart home devices, TVs, and more.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/"> The sale also brings the price of Amazon’s fastest-ever streaming media player — the Fire TV Cube — down to just $90.</a> That’s after a whopping 36% drop on the retail price of $140. Best of all, using the code ALEXAPLUS10 at checkout nets you another $10 discount in Amazon Credit with your purchase.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you have an older Fire TV device lying around, you can trade it in to get an additional 20% off your total, plus an Amazon gift card, making the purchase even sweeter. But just note that such offers tend to wrap up fast, so you don’t have a lot of time left to bag the discounts. If you have been looking to give your entertainment experience a boost, now is the time to make that happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Hands-Free Streaming</h2>
<p>The cube, in a way, blends the functionality of both a streaming stick and an Echo. It comes with a built-in HDMI input and features additional ports for you to connect other entertainment devices for a fuller setup.</p>
<p>The new octa-core 2.0 GHz processor at the center makes it twice as fast as the Fire TV Stick 4K Max, letting you launch apps and browse content within seconds. Support for Wi-Fi 6E translates into smoother 4K streaming with faster speeds, more bandwidth, and low latency, meaning you can search your favorite content fast, plus enjoy an uninterrupted, cinema-like viewing experience right from your couch. Visuals and sound don’t take a hit, either. 4K Ultra HD keeps picture quality lifelike, while Dolby Atmos Audio support puts the sound all around for a 3D experience. Super Resolution Upscaling makes it easy to convert an HD picture to 4K for better detail, so all your favorite classics are going to come to life, as well.</p>



<p>Navigating around is made easy with voice control. Not in the mood to press some buttons? Just ask Alexa to do it for you. You can find movies by actor, plot, and even iconic quotes. Just say something like “Alexa, show me the latest Christmas movies” or “Alexa, show me crime thrillers with unexpected endings”, and it’s going to pull every relevant title up in no time. Entertainment options come built right in, as well. The cube lets you stream more than 1.8 million movies and TV episodes. You’ll have all your favorite streaming platforms (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more) in a single place. It even doubles as a speaker when you’re in the mood to listen to some songs in the background as you finish house chores.</p>
<p>Setting everything up couldn’t be easier. Simply connect the Fire TV Cube to your TV’s HDMI port, and then your WiFi. Follow the on-screen prompts to finish the process; as simple as that. If you have speakers around, it’s recommended to place the cube at least 1 to 2 feet away from them to avoid interference. The device also comes with early access to Alexa+, which is an advanced, more sophisticated version of the OG Alexa. It communicates better, understands context well, and can remember information from previous parts of a conversation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Thanks to Black Friday, the Fire TV Cube is now sitting at just $90, plus there are additional offers you can take advantage of to maximize your savings.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Anti-Cheat Has Blocked 2.4 Million Cheat Attempts]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-million-attempts/</link>
            <guid>1367518</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent article published by the Electronic Arts teams behind Battlefield 6, it was revealed that a staggering 2.4 <strong>million </strong>cheat attempts have been blocked by EA’s Javelin anti-cheat system since the game came out on October 10. It was additionally noted that, in the week after launch, <strong>98% of matches </strong>were ‘fair and free of cheater impacts.’</p>



<p>This is only just the beginning for Javelin. It was stressed that Electronic Arts is shaping up to deal with this ‘war on cheating’ in an evolutionary way, and has several steps lined up to combat wrongdoers.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-anti-cheat-is-making-waves">Battlefield 6’s Anti-Cheat is Making Waves</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, it was revealed that <strong>2.4 million cheat attempts </strong>were actively blocked by EA’s Javelin engine, an anti-cheat solution that keeps Battlefield 6 free from abusive operators. To put some numbers into perspective, it was also noted that, during the open beta alone, a whopping <strong>1.2 million </strong>cheat attempts were closed down.</p>



<p>People just won’t give up.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1994436727516107251">team wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are presently aware of, and have multiple detections for, <strong>190 cheat related programs, hardware, vendors, and resellers and their communities</strong>. Since launch <strong>183 of them (96.3%) have announced feature failures, detection notices, downtime, and/or taken their cheats offline entirely</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This phenomenal effort by Electronic Arts is set to expand with several key initiatives being lined up:</p>



<ul>
<li>Explore Additional OS Security Features</li>



<li>Enforce Against Cheating Hardware</li>



<li>Improving Reporting Flows</li>



<li>Improving Internal Operations Tools</li>



<li>‘Classified’</li>
</ul>



<p>That final note is legitimately taken from the document. Some things are being kept under wraps to avoid ‘tipping off’ the cheat manufacturers as to what’s coming next:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have multiple teams working on various new anti-cheat features and detections across our multi-layered suite of tools across Javelin, the game client, server, and beyond coming online as fast as we can get them ready. As soon as any of these new ways of delivering ban hammers are fully tested and ready we’ll share more but for now we don’t want to tip our hand to any bad-actors looking to ruin your game experience.</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">30 years ago, LEGO made its tentative first step beyond physical toys with the launch of Fun to Build, a Japanese-only game for the largely forgotten Sega Pico console. Three decades later, the mighty LEGO brand's video game ambitions are now a diverse empire all of its own, a set of digital experiences designed to cater to diverse and tastes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for good reason — because as anyone who follows video games knows, the industry's growth has also come alongside massive change, including an ongoing shift in how players access and own games — and a generational difference in why they're so important.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For many, the idea of a LEGO video game is something still synonymous with the prolific output of TT Games, the British development studio behind dozens of licensed titles featuring blockbuster franchises like Star Wars, Batman, and Harry Potter. But the LEGO brand now adorns numerous other experiences from other established creators, such as the recent Annapurna-published LEGO Voyagers, or the Nintendo-like LEGO Party. And then there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-fortnite-odyssey">LEGO Fortnite</a> — but more on that in a moment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to the bosses of LEGO's sprawling gaming portfolio, the company's new SVP of LEGO Game, Fredrik Löving, and its veteran Head of Product, Kari Vinther Nielsen, its clear the company knows the world of video games has already changed — and will continue to do so, as a younger generation raised on the likes of Minecraft, Roblox and Fortnite — LEGO's key audience demographic — seeks connected social experiences on a wider range of platforms. At the same time, however, the brand knows it must still cater to more traditional gamers as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Really understanding today's kids is just always the most important thing," Löving says. "There's been a big shift in gaming and we all know it, we have all seen it. Games mean something different for the generation growing up today than it did for me. When I grew up on my Amiga 500, I was escaping into a world, I was escaping into a screen and I was playing these games with a very set objective. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The primary objective today for kids growing up is to find an activity to do in a social space together with their friends. Secondarily, it's whatever the activity actually is around it." It's an observation that rings especially true following the huge spike in players this summer for games such as Grow a Garden and Steal the Brainrot, experiences that helped smash engagement records on Roblox — a social gaming platform that LEGO has so far steered clear of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The gamers are very fundamentally different," Löving continues. So, where does that leave LEGO?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">We Build LEGO Star Wars Gingerbread AT-AT</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was very lucky to work on LEGO Worlds," Nielsen recalls, a LEGO-y sandbox game that let players build intricate models using digital blocks. While successful enough, it was a product of its time — and despite the LEGO branding, it never seemed to trouble the already-dominant Minecraft, the game it was frequently most compared to. Still, its ambitions were clear. "That for me was a testament of what the physical brick was in a digital space," Nielsen continues. "We had fans creating models, creating worlds, creating stories, and I think that's really the power of digital play where you can create and share in different ways versus what you can in the physical world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After working at LEGO for over a decade, Nielsen said the conversations she had working on the idea for Worlds remain "the same stories and the same things we talk about" today. "We need to mix IPs, we need to figure out what's the digital version of the physical expression. What's the real true game version of that? I don't think the conversations have changed a lot," she continued. "It's more about actually adapting to how kids play today and being open-minded about how you diversify play, how you become inclusive so that you make the right type of play for kids in the world they live in. I think that's where we've moved a lot through the last couple of years actually.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Kids really use video games as a way to stay social and a place where can they meet up with their friends," Nielsen continues, echoing Löving's earlier words. "Of course we want to show up in safe and positive ways, but I think that just speaks to the type of games and the type of play we really need to serve as the LEGO brand. It's not about only having one version that fits for gamers, it's about having a diverse portfolio, for different play needs and different moments."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an approach that LEGO has demonstrated over the past few months, launching the Mario Party-esque LEGO Party to foster cross-generational multiplayer, the same month as indie puzzle platformer LEGO Voyagers. "LEGO Party, that's really where I want to play with my friends or with my family," Nielsen notes. "LEGO Voyagers meanwhile, was a test of my relationship, I'm not going to lie. There was a little bit of 'go away, this is me playing now.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there's LEGO Fortnite, which continues to evolve week by week. Its hard to gauge the current level of its overall success versus expectations, especially when comparing it to something like Grow a Garden's viral popularity. But its most substantial offering, LEGO Fortnite Odyssey, remains an evergreen hit and will soon receive its next big update (which fans expect will add characters from the hugely popular Ninjago franchise). Role-playing sim option LEGO Brick Life, meanwhile, enjoys a smaller audience, though is currently hosting a big The Simpsons takeover. And a core attraction for LEGO here remains the ability for players to build and make their own mini-games — something which should only become easier to do and more advanced in potential over time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">LEGO Fortnite</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"My daughter loves the universe, the characters, the stories, the narrative," Nielsen says of LEGO Fortnite's modes. "We're starting to really grow and expand the opportunity for creators to make their favorite LEGO game, to tell their stories through gaming. It's still early days actually in that space," she continues. "It's not that we haven't had digital building or digital creation in our portfolio for the past 30 years, but the world around it has changed, as has the platforms and the pace of creation. When Fred joined, we had this sort of [joke] like, 'You've been used to making a game and it takes five years, I can do what you do and do that in four hours instead.'" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While that may not be true — yet — of something that looks as polished as TT Games' upcoming LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, some of LEGO's earlier output could certainly be recreated in Fortnite today, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-island">LEGO Island</a>, the brand's second video game (and its first real digital hit). "It's just a different reality of making experiences and testing new things and trying them out in a way faster engine with the right partner, with the right creators," Nielsen says. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And going back to what I mentioned around really understanding gamers of today," Löving adds. "Co-creation, agency, all the things that you just mentioned. They are becoming very quickly, if not already, table stakes for a lot of experiences out there, especially the big platforms."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that said, LEGO's more traditional gaming experiences are also not fully going away — as next year's arival of LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight proves. It was one of this year's biggest and best-received gaming reveals, and was recently shown to a hugely positive reception during Gamescom 2025. For LEGO, experiences like it is set to provide also remain a cruical part of its brand offering. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I passed down Star Wars to my son through a Lego game, Skywalker saga," Löving said. "That is a lot for a dad, to actually have that experience together with your son — not just playing together but passing down a fandom, enabled through the fact that it's a LEGO game. Even before I joined the company, I was just inspired to see, 'how do we even dial that up? How can we do that and really make it intergenerational play?'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our brand stands for a lot of things and I think in some moments you're really diving in and you're immersing yourself in like a six-hour session," Nielsen affirms. "I play legacy board games, I know it's going to take a long time. I'm invested, and it's even better if I can actually play along or couch co-op with some of my friends or family members. That's fantastic and I think that's what TT Games does so well."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Cosmetics</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As LEGO enters its fourth decade in the digital space, the company clearly has ambitions that range beyond simple, static plastic. Ever since it dipped its toe into the world of simple robotics with MindStorms, through to its much more recently interactivitiy melded into LEGO Super Mario bricks, its clear the company is keen to experiment with what's possible with play. LEGO Dimensions, the brand's experiment in the toys-to-life category, was another example of that — and with its focus on IP mashups and adventure, could be seen as a precursor to LEGO Fortnite today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the day, though, Nielsen says it's all about finding the right kind of play for the right audience. "Sometimes there's a time for a game and then you can almost take that game and bring it into the now — or to the future with different flavors and twists," she says. "It's no different than what is our LEGO version of Darth Vader or Batman. I think there's something generational to it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Sylux will save you some time.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a long wait, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is finally coming to Switch 1 and Switch 2 on December 4. Nintendo recently revealed exactly what each of its Metroid Prime amiibo figures will allow you to do in the game — ranging from customizing Samus’s new ride to letting you unlock a secret movie without having to 100% the in-game collectables.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is releasing three new amiibo figures for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond — namely Samus Aran herself, Samus riding the Vi-O-La motorbike, and bounty hunter antagonist Sylux. According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/hardware/amiibo/game/bgw5a_2/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>announcement</u></a> on Nintendo’s official Japanese website, the three Metroid Prime 4 amiibos will let you do different things with the game — with Sylux’s greatly lowering the threshold for what you need to do to unlock a secret movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Basically, the Sylux amiibo will allow players to view a special movie straight after beating the game’s main story. The movie will apparently be an edited-together cutscene of fragmented clips featuring the bounty hunter that play during your journey through Metroid Prime 4: Beyond’s story. It seems that watching the special movie will likely help players further understand Sylux’s motivations. Sylux has always been a bit of a mysterious antagonist and hopefully Metroid Prime 4 will shed more light on Sylux’s backstory and his apparent hatred of the Galactic Federation and Samus. As an added bonus, Sylux will say a random line of his dialogue each time you touch his amiibo to your Switch console.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don’t fancy forking out the money for the Sylux amiibo ($29.99) or would much rather put in the hard work yourself, then the special movie can also be unlocked by achieving a 100% scan rate and finding every single item in the game (so get ready to have guides and checklists on hand).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Metroid Prime 4 Samus and Vi-O-La amiibo features the tough protagonist astride her brand-new, high-tech motorbike, Vi-O-La. Making its debut in Metroid Prime 4, Vi-O-La will allow Samus to speedily travel around the vast planet of Viewros. Therefore it comes as no surprise that the amiibo gives you several Vi-O-La related benefits. The Samus and Vi-O-La amiibo lets you quickly replenish your bike’s boost energy once per day, as well as allowing you to change the motorbike’s color. Touching the amiibo will tell you the distance you have travelled on the Vi-O-La.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Metroid Prime 4 Samus amiibo lets you do a couple of things. Once a day, you can activate a handy shield that will not only restore Samus’s life but also blocks up to 99 damage. As an added bonus, you can use the Samus amiibo to change the music when riding the Vi-O-La across Sol Valley, Viewros’ vast desert. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/28/81ygnbuotrl-ac-sl1500-1764345325988.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo Sylux for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you happen to have any older Metroid-related amiibo lying around, you can also use these with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Although not as exciting as Sylux’s movie unlock, the following Super Smash Bros. amiibo will play a random sound from Metroid Prime 4 when touched: Samus, Zero Suit Samus, Dark Samus, and Ridley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Metroid Prime got a remake in 2023, Metroid Prime 4 is the first new numbered entry in the Prime series of Metroid FPS’s since Metroid Prime 3: Corruption on the Wii back in 2016. Players will step into the boots of Samus Aran — this time responding to a distress call from the Galactic Federation, which will see her explore the mysterious and unknown planet of Viewros.

Over the course of 14 days, it "welcomes you into encounters that test your obedience, complicity, and restraint." The player experiences "the farm's unspeakable horrors through daily unique interactions," as they must "withstand 14 days of spiraling dread as the reality of the farm unfolds."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As IGN reported this week, Horses is currently preparing to launch on December 2 on the Epic Games Store, GOG, Itch.io, and the Humble Store, but not on Steam because Valve has banned the game from release on its platform.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">IGN’s original report for the details of the situation</a>, which Italian developer Santa Ragione (Saturnalia, Wheels of Aurelia, MirrorMoon EP) has said leaves it with a “high risk” of closure, such is the PC gaming market dominance enjoyed by Steam. Valve has released a statement of its own, confirming its decision not to release Horses on Steam is "final.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We reviewed the game back in 2023,” Valve said. “At that time, the developer indicated with their release date in Steamworks that they planned to release a few months later. Based on content in the store page, we told the developer we would need to review the build itself. This happens sometimes if content on the store page causes concern that the game itself might not fall within our guidelines. After our team played through the build and reviewed the content, we gave the developer feedback about why we couldn’t ship the game on Steam, consistent with our onboarding rules and guidelines. A short while later the developer asked us to reconsider the review, and our internal content review team discussed that extensively and communicated to the developer our final decision that we were not going to ship the game on Steam."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, GOG has released a statement saying it is “proud” to give Horses a home on its platform, pushing pre-orders live, showcasing the game on its homepage, and alerting press and its followers across social media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re proud to give Horses a home on GOG, giving players another way to enjoy the game,” GOG said. “We’ve always believed that players should be able to choose the experiences that speak to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To support the Santa Ragione studio in this difficult time, we’ve decided to launch pre-orders on Horses today — grab yours and celebrate their creativity!”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Horses Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve still hasn’t explained why it refused to reconsider its position on Horses even after the developer tweaked the game. Speaking to IGN, Pietro Righi Riva of Santa Ragione urged game developers to stand up together to demand transparency from Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I know developers are understandably scared of voicing their complaints about Steam, but I hope we can collectively ask for better conditions to make our work more viable and more creatively free," he said. "The current landscape is one where very few actors control the distribution of almost all games that are produced, and that should mean they are responsible not just for the commercial sustainability of the industry, but also for the growth of games as an artistic medium."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve watched the latest episode of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/south-park">South Park</a>, you might have noticed a surprise appearance from one of the hottest video games on earth: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios’ extraction shooter is one of the most-played video games on PC and console right now, with an impressive 4 million copies sold so far. At one point, it hit over 700,000 concurrent players across all platforms — an impressive achievement indeed for a new IP at a time when so many refuse to be prized away from established live-service behemoths.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, among Arc Raiders’ many fans is someone behind the making of South Park. In the latest Season 28 episode broadcast this week, called "Turkey Trot,” Cartman finds Tolkien Black playing Arc Raiders on Xbox. The game appears in multiple scenes, one of which shows gameplay footage on a TV.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/28/sp-main-1764341295124.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Arc Raiders makes a surprise appearance in the latest episode of South Par.

On Monday South Park inquired if a character could play ARC Raiders in an upcoming episode, on Tuesday we provided footage, and on Wednesday we were in S28’s “Turkey Trot” episode. Like Tolkien, I guess a lot of us just can’t put down ARC Raiders. Happy Thanksgiving! 🦃🍁</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s… really close to the wire! But it should come as no surprise to South Park fans who know a little about how its creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, put the show together.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditionally, Parker and Stone create each episode week-by-week, which makes for a chaotic production but topical shows. But they switched to a biweekly schedule for Season 27, with the elongated production time allowing the pair more room to work on each episode. Season 27 had enjoyed big ratings and sparked much debate, but it also suffered an erratic release schedule. The first two episodes arrived on the standard weekly schedule, but then the series switched to a biweekly schedule before the delayed fifth episode, which ended up going down as the series finale, aired three weeks later on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Comedy Central had delayed the Season 27 ender just hours before it was due to air, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-one-pulled-the-episode-no-one-censored-us-and-you-know-wed-say-so-if-true-south-park-co-creator-matt-stone-insists-this-weeks-delayed-episode-is-gonna-be-great"><u>with Parker and Stone insisting the blame lay at their door</u></a>. “Apparently when you do everything at the last minute sometimes you don’t get it done,” the pair told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/south-park-delays-episode-1236522027/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a>. “This one’s on us. We didn’t get it done in time. Thanks to Comedy Central and South Park fans for being so understanding. Tune in next week!” As far as we at IGN are aware, Parker and Stone have missed the scheduled release of South Park just once before, due to a power outage, but never for not getting an episode done in time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">South Park's Most Topical Episodes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-park-creators-talk-season-27-premiere-after-skewering-trump-in-hotly-anticipated-comic-con-panel-sdcc-2025"><u>during their San Diego Comic-Con 2025 panel</u></a>, which took place the day after the Season 27 opener aired, Parker said the pair were unsure what the next episode would be, revealing the decision was “super stressful.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, South Park has a history of featuring video games, perhaps most famously World of Warcraft. Indeed, Blizzard's MMORPG was the focus of the episode, Make Love, Not Warcraft, at a time when it was one of the hottest video games on earth. Other games featured on the show include Valve's Counter-Strike, Rock Band, and Call of Duty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only one episode of South Park Season 28 remains, to be broadcast on December 10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

<p>This news <a href="https://x.com/Hytale/status/1994421030991904777?s=20">was posted on social media via the official Hytale account</a> earlier today, alongside a disclaimer for those eager to hop in and try it out next year. Prepurchasing opens up on the 13th December, though the team has actually urged fans to pre-order the game with caution.</p>
<p>The reason? Rather than an Early Access release where all is polished and feature complete, Hytale instead seems to be launching with a ways to go.</p>

<p>The Hytale social media account states: "If you don't feel comfortable pre-ordering, please don't. This is true early access, meaning it's still very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while, but you have the team's commitment to make Hytale the game we've always wanted it to be. More details are coming soon. Thank you, everyone, for your support. Hytale has been through a long journey, and soon, we will be home."</p><p>Such transparency is both laudable and understandable, especially given the surge of community support for Hytale in recent months. The game hit rocky waters earlier this year when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">its former publisher</a> Riot Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">pulled the plug on what was proving to be troubled development</a> for the game.</p>
<p>Following this, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">the game was saved by the aforementioned co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme</a> after negotiations with Riot Games. The result: a game that has been in development since 2015 is finally going to be playable, which is wonderful news.</p>

<p>Following Valve's controversial decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-responds-with-additional-context-following-horses-steam-ban-controversy">ban developer Santa Ragione's narrative horror game Horses from Steam</a>, rival storefront GOG - which <em>will</em> be selling the game when it launches next week - has weighed in, saying it wants "to give players the freedom to choose what they play, and [give creators] the space to bring their artistic work to them.".</p>
<p>Italian studio Santa Ragione - whose award-winning output includes Saturnalia and Meditteranea Inferno - announced Horses back in 2023. It's a three-hour horror adventure - blending monochrome visuals, live-action intermissions, and interactive sequences - that unfolds across 14 days on a farm where naked human "horses" are kept as livestock. It makes for some striking imagery as the game explores "the burden of familial trauma and puritan values, the dynamics of totalitarian power, and the ethics of personal responsibility".</p>

<p>However, Horses made headlines this week when its release date announcement was accompanied by the news it would be available on all PC platforms with the exception of Steam. It's a long story that Santa Ragione co-founder Pietro Righi Riva <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">discussed with Eurogamer in more detail</a> when the news broke, but the short version is Valve made the decision to ban Horses from its platform in 2023, saying it would not "distribute content that appears, in [its] judgement, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor."</p><p>Santa Ragione had a number of things to say about that. Firstly that it was a mischaracterisation of a brief mid-game scene - "not sexual in any way" - where a visitor to the farm lets his young daughter ride one of the horses, and secondly that the scene was altered, ageing the daughter into a 20-something woman, while the game was still in creative flux. Its belief is Horses would have passed Steam's approval process without issue if Valve - which has refused to re-examine the final build - had not requested an early version, and the fact no other storefront has taken umbrage with the game supports that.</p>
<p>And now, Steam rival GOG has weighed in on <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1994406374273318952?s=20">social media</a>, saying it's "proud to give Horses a home", and adding it "[believes] players should be able to choose the experiences that speak to them." In a seperate comment provided to Eurogamer, the storefront elaborated further, saying GOG will be distributing Horses because its platform "is the place on which we want to give players the freedom to choose what they play, and creators can have the space to bring their artistic work to them."</p>
<p>"At GOG, we aim to provide developers with a welcoming space for their projects and to make it simple for players to access the games they care about," it continued. "We're happy to give Horses a home... giving players another way to experience the game – and to support the Santa Ragione studio in this difficult time, we've decided to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">launch pre-orders on Horses today</a>."</p>
<p>Horses launches via <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a>, the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">Epic Games Store</a>, the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses">Humble Store</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses">Itch.io</a> on 2nd December. It costs €4.99/$4.99.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hytale Will Launch in Early Access in January 2026 as Creators Ressurrect Minecraft-Like MMO]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-january-2026/</link>
            <guid>1367470</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Minecraft-like MMO Hytale started its development journey in 2015, with Riot Games being one of the team's 'angel investors' that helped move production along, before <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/">Riot would eventually acquire Hypixel Studios</a>, the team behind Hytale. It would also die under Riot, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">with the game cancelled in June 2025, and Hypixel Studios disbanded</a>. However, just last week, the game's original creator, Simon Collins-Laflamme, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-minecraft-like-mmo-resurrected-will-launch-early-access-soon/">announced that he had repurchased the rights from Riot and would kick development back up</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Collins-Laflamme is making good on his promise to announce an early access release date "<em>soon</em>," with <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026">a blog post on the official Hytale website</a> confirming that the long-awaited and promising MMO will arrive in early access on January 13, 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>Two weeks ago, we, the original founders, repurchased Hytale, months after it was cancelled</em>," the post began. "<em>We revived the project, and we are returning to a four-year-old legacy build that had been abandoned. We are personally committing funding for many years to come.</em>"</p>



<p>"...<em>Since the cancellation, we’ve rehired more than 40 former and new team members, bringing the total to 50. Reacquiring a game from a AAA studio and preparing an early access launch within weeks is rare, and players will be able to watch the progress as it happens.</em>"</p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme doesn't try to sugarcoat what the state of the early access release will be, saying that the game will be exactly what you'd expect from an early access game, which is a game that is nowhere near done.</p>



<p>"<em>If you don't feel comfortable pre-ordering, please don't. This is true early access, meaning it's still very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while, but you have my and the team's commitment to make Hytale the game we've always wanted it to be.</em> <em>The first impression will be rough, but the path ahead matters more.</em>"</p>



<p>While telling your potential customers not to buy your product isn't exactly the best sales pitch, it's clear that Collins-Laflamme and the team are committed to making Hytale the game they always envisioned it to be. Part of this resurrection process has been stepping away from the newer engine the team was previously trying, with the team now working to revive the original version of the game.</p>



<p>"<em>This required picking, choosing, and merging more than 300 GitHub branches into a single working branch. It was a significant engineering effort, but we're now confident enough to launch early access</em>. <em>Hytale and Hypixel Studios are independent again, and we are returning to the original vision from the 2018 trailer."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Because we went back to an older game build that was now meant for prototypes, some parts of the game will feel behind, but momentum is strong, and we're working fast to make this into the game we all dreamed of</em>."</p>

            <p>Still fresh off of being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">bought from Riot</a> and revived by a team lead by Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> now has an early access release date. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y sandbox emerges from the cave it's spent years exploring early next year, with pre-orders kicking off next month.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026">dates</a> you'll want to circle on your calendar are January 13th, 2026, and December 13th, 2025. Yep, it seems that isn't an unlucky number in Hypixel's estimation. The first of those dates will see Hytale release in what Collins-Laflamme and co are being clear is "true early access", while the latter sees pre-orders go live at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-gets-a-cheap-price-point-all-because-its-devs-dont-think-the-game-is-good-yet">prices Hypixel have previously outlined</a>. So, about $20/equivalent for the base version.</p>
<p>"It’s still very much unfinished and broken, but you have my and the team's commitment to make Hytale the game we’ve always wanted it to be," Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1994430319580098783">wrote</a> of the Hytale you'll be getting if you dive in at this point. "The game isn't good yet; eventually, it will be. If you don’t feel comfortable pre-ordering or participating in Early Access, please don’t."</p>
<p>He added that while the decision to go back to an older build means "some parts of the game will feel behind", the now 50-strong team working on the project have momentum behind them. "Modding and creative tools are in a decent state; however, they’re not where we want them long term," the dev explained. "That being said, they’re ready for players who want to create content on day 1. This is a good moment for modders, server owners, and creators to step in early."</p>
<p>In summary, Collins-Laflamme declared that "the first impression will be rough, but the path ahead matters more" and promised more details about the release will be incoming.</p>
<p>If you want a taste of what Hytale's like at the moment, the group now helming it were quick to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-original-co-founder-wastes-no-time-showing-off-the-game-as-it-is-after-buying-the-rights-from-riot">show off some footage of the game in action</a> after it was mailed over by Riot.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forget $4,000 Apple VR Headset, Meta Quest 3S Drops to All-Time Low With 50K Units Sold on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-4000-apple-vr-headset-meta-quest-3s-drops-to-all-time-low-with-50k-units-sold-on-amazon-2000648422</link>
            <guid>1367458</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Meta Quest 3 established new VR standards when it launched but its premium pricing kept virtual reality aspirational rather than accessible for mainstream buyers. Meta addressed this barrier by releasing the Quest 3<strong>S</strong> as a lighter and more affordable variant that maintains core functionality while cutting costs through strategic compromises that most users won’t notice during actual gameplay.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">the Quest 3S costs $249 for the 128GB model during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $299</a>, which makes this the <strong>best entry point into modern VR</strong> without the $499 Quest 3 investment. The aggressive pricing combined with complete wireless freedom and instant access to 40-plus games creates exceptional value that explains why the 3S outsells its premium sibling.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 That Works Well</h2>
<p>Qualcomm’s newest XR-specific silicon is optimized for the unique computational needs of virtual reality and it gives the processor twice the graphical processing power of the previous Quest 2 generation. Games load quickly so you don’t have to wait around like you did with older headsets and complex scenes render smoothly at high frame rates, which is important for avoiding motion sickness.</p>
<p>The next-generation graphics make the<strong> visuals almost as good as those on the PlayStation 5</strong> and they do it in standalone wireless headset form factors, which means you don’t need a gaming PC like you did with older VR systems, which were expensive and hard to use. The performance is good enough for demanding games like realistic simulators, fast-paced shooters and detailed adventure games that would stutter or crash on hardware that isn’t powerful enough.</p>



<p>The <strong>8GB of RAM is 33% more than what most budget VR headsets offer</strong>: This makes it easier to switch between VR environments, load textures with more detail without pop-in, and generally make the game more responsive. With more memory, developers can make more ambitious experiences with bigger worlds, more things on screen at once, and better graphics without having to make the trade-offs that come with limited RAM.</p>
<p>The <strong>freedom of wireless technology gets rid of the cords</strong> that made early VR systems so annoying: Players had to always be aware of where the cords were so they wouldn’t trip or pull on the headsets while playing. During room-scale VR experiences for instance, you can move naturally through physical spaces. In shooters, you can spin 360 degrees to track enemies from all directions. This makes setup much easier and lets you use VR anywhere, not just in dedicated gaming rooms.</p>
<p>The <strong>two RGB color cameras let you see everything in full color and mix virtual objects with your real-world surroundings</strong> through mixed reality experiences. You can see your real furniture, walls, and surroundings in color, and virtual objects look like they belong there. This lets you play games that interact with real spaces. With passthrough, you can clearly see the real world instead of the grainy black-and-white feeds that made earlier systems confusing.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gorilla Tag bundle gives Quest 3S buyers special in-game items and 1,000 shiny rocks currency</strong>: This makes the social VR game even more valuable, and it’s become a huge hit. Instead of using traditional joystick controls, Gorilla Tag uses arm-swinging locomotion to simulate how gorillas move. This gives the game a unique physicality that makes it very popular even though the graphics are simple.</p>
<p>The <strong>included three-month trial gives you instant access to more than 40 games</strong> which means you won’t have to pay for software right after you buy new hardware. You can try out different types of VR experiences, like action games, creative tools, fitness apps, and social platforms, without spending hundreds of dollars on software before you know what types of games you like.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery lasts for more than two hours</strong> which is enough for most gaming sessions without needing to stop and charge in the middle of a game, which breaks immersion. However, for longer marathon sessions, you’ll need to use a power bank or take breaks to charge. The runtime is long enough for most people who play for 30 to 90 minutes, which is about the same as the average attention span for active VR gameplay, which is more physically engaging than passive screen entertainment.</p>
<p>Meta’s current-generation VR technology costs less than many game consoles at the record-low price of $249 on Black Friday. If you’ve been curious about virtual reality but didn’t want to pay a lot for it, this deal makes modern VR possible at prices that make it worth it to try.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nothing Headphone (1) Clearly Can’t Make Profit at This Record Low, Now Over 2× Cheaper Than AirPods Max]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nothing-headphone-1-come-down-to-their-lowest-price-yet-for-black-friday-2000647680</link>
            <guid>1367455</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="62" data-end="797">There are countless reasons to invest in a quality pair of headphones—especially ones equipped with active noise cancellation. Being able to shut out the world and immerse yourself in what you <em data-start="255" data-end="265">actually</em> want to hear makes a huge difference, whether you’re stuck on a long, noisy flight or trying to concentrate in a busy workspace. If you’re in the market for a stylish and capable option, the Nothing headphones are worth a look. With their distinctive transparent design and sleek, technical aesthetic, they stand out visually. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6042/">Currently, they’re available at a 20% discount. Normally priced at $299, you can pick them up now for $239, saving $60 for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a></p>
<p data-start="799" data-end="1484">These headphones feature advanced, intelligent noise cancellation technology. Using next-generation processing and adaptive microphones, they continuously analyze your surroundings and automatically adjust the level of noise reduction. The over-ear design further enhances isolation by forming a secure acoustic seal around your ears. The result is a listening experience free from interruptions—perfect for music, audiobooks, or podcasts. When you need to re-engage with your environment, you can switch it over to Transparency Mode which lets outside sounds pass through naturally. This is especially helpful when walking through busy areas or responding to a coworker without removing your headphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6042/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1486" data-end="1508">Hands-Free Control</h2>
<p data-start="1510" data-end="2171">The Nothing headphones conveniently offers an onboard control system that minimizes the need to reach for your phone. A dedicated side button allows quick access to apps like Spotify, letting you launch your audio without digging into your pocket. On the opposite earcup, a paddle lets you skip tracks or jump ahead in podcasts. Holding it down allows you to scrub through your audio with precision. Above this, a roller gives you intuitive control over volume, playback, and toggling between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode. Altogether, the controls are designed to keep your listening experience smooth and uninterrupted.</p>
<p data-start="2173" data-end="2652">Battery life is reliably long. With ANC turned off, you can enjoy up to an impressive 80 hours of listening time—enough for several days of use without recharging. Even with ANC enabled, the headphones still deliver around 35 hours of playback, which is more than sufficient for long workdays, commutes, or travel. And if the battery does run low, a quick 5-minute charge provides about 5 hours of additional listening time, ensuring you’re rarely stuck without sound.</p>


<p data-start="2654" data-end="3000">Comfort is equally important for long sessions, and Nothing has put real thought into the design. The ear cushions are made from memory foam wrapped in PU material, which resists oils and makeup to stay clean over time. The reinforced aluminum core adds durability while keeping the headphones lightweight, making them suitable for extended wear.</p>
<p data-start="3002" data-end="3186" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6042/">For a limited time, you can grab the Nothing headphones at a $60 discount on Amazon.</a> With them, you get style, comfort, and premium noise cancellation in one package. Makes for a great gift for any music lover this holiday season.</p>

<p>2024’s Game of the Year winner is as affordable as ever. It’s a fantastic walk down memory lane for Sony’s exhaustive catalogue of incredible franchises. It’s also the perfect reminder that 3D platformers aren’t dead, and Astro Bot is a premium product from back to front that appeals to all age brackets.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sucker Punch’s long-awaited and hotly anticipated sequel to Ghost of Tsushima. Ghost of Yotei is another spellbinding action-adventure game with slick swordplay, more weapons and options than its predecessor, and it’s just as good as the original (maybe better?). It’s the biggest PS5 exclusive of the year by far, and is a proper system-selling game.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>It feels incredible to have a proper Battlefield game back. Let’s not talk about the last BF game, because Battlefield 6 is fantastic from top to bottom. It features a campaign tailored for single-player enthusiasts, an extensive multiplayer mode packed with maps, mayhem, and a multitude of playlist options. Additionally, there’s Battlefield: RedSec, offering battle royale and extended game modes.</p>







<hr>







<figure><figcaption>Image via Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Metal Gear Solid 3 is considered to be the definitive MGA game for many. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater takes the 2004 original and shows everyone what a modern-day version of it looks like. It will likely scoop up many ‘Best Remaster of 2025’ awards, and it will reward you for investing some money into the epic remake.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Black Ops 7 will adorn the base of many Christmas trees in Holiday 2025. Treyarch has been given the privilege of delivering back-to-back CoD games, and while Black Ops 7 has had a mixed reception, its online multiplayer is a smooth and swift as any in recent memory. With a campaign, Zombies, and seasonal updates to come, Black Ops 7 is a shred investment and a top gift.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Turn-based gameplay hit the mainstream once more with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Following in the footsteps of old-school Final Fantasy games, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the first project from a studio very much in its infancy. The result of a GOTY-contending, 30-to-60 hour playthrough you shouldn’t miss at all costs.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us Part II (Remastered)</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Naughty Dog</figcaption></figure>



<p>Last year’s The Last Of Us Part II (Remastered) is the perfect way to capitalize on 2025’s The Last Of Us Season 2 on TV. The second season finally hit screens this year, and it’s based on the events of The Last of Us Part II (Remastered). It’s easily one of the cheapest games on this Holiday 2025 list, and is even cheaper with Insider Gaming’s link.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-ea-fc-26">EA FC 26</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p>If there’s a new Call of Duty, you’d better believe there’s a new EA FC game. The feedback-driven nature of EA FC 26 means it’s trying to appeal to you, the player, more than ever. You can grab EA FC 26 for cheap, take your favorite teams to gold and glory, make your own hilarious Pros, and assemble the Ultimate Team.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-is-the-best-selling-playstation-exclusive-launch-ip-in-history-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade is ‘The best-selling PlayStation-exclusive launch IP in history’ for PC</a>. It has a sequel on the way, is going <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform-shift-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplatform</a>, and for a game released in 2024, it still seems to be gaining momentum. You too can join this movement by making Holiday 2025 a stellar one.</p>

<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160848/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve spent years of your life waiting for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Silksong</a>, or one of the many other highly anticipated games that spent substantial time on the horizon, just remember that it could always be worse — you could be an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/inazuma_eleven">Inazuma Eleven</a> fan.</p>
<p>Developer Level-5’s RPG-tinged take on football (or soccer, if that’s your bag) started life back on the DS, where the original game and its sequels cemented the franchise’s status as a refreshingly wacky alternative to the hyper-grounded likes of genre counterparts like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/fifa_12">FIFA</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pro_evolution_soccer_2013_3d">Pro Evolution Soccer</a>. That success continued into the 3DS era with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/inazuma_eleven_go_light_and_shadow">Inazuma Eleven: GO</a> games, and in 2016 that the company revealed <strong>Inazuma Eleven: Ares</strong> as the franchise’s exciting next chapter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Inazuma Eleven: Ares didn’t hit its original 2018 launch window target. It was delayed. And then delayed again. And again, again, again. As years went by, amid changes to the project in name, scope, and gameplay — and a frightening period in which a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/10/professor_layton_dev_level-5_has_no_plans_for_future_games_outside_of_japan_says_report">report indicated that Level-5 was pulling away from English game releases altogether</a> — it was hard to hold out hope for Inazuma Eleven’s chances of returning to the field.</p>
<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160841/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet, here it is. Nearly 12 years since the last mainline entry, the newly-renamed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> has finally been released on Switch, Switch 2, and other platforms. It’s more of a relief than anything to finally have it out, but can a game with such an agonising lead-up to launch possibly live up to the hype? I’m happy to report that this return to the classic football franchise mostly delivers the goods and then some.</p>
<p>As with previous Inazuma Eleven titles, Victory Road’s big claim to fame is its core football gameplay. Across each of the game’s various modes, you build and customise teams of players with all sorts of specialised skills for the sole purpose of duking it out on the pitch against other teams. Matches follow the tried-and-true hallmarks of popular football games, with the added wrinkle of characters being able to pull off over-the-top, RPG-style moves that would most certainly get them disqualified in any sort of real-world scenario.</p>
<p>It’s classic Inazuma Eleven gameplay at its finest, with a staggering level of system depth and customisability that will feel rewarding to veterans and, admittedly, a bit overwhelming to newcomers. Level-5 does an adequate job of spoonfeeding the game’s most basic mechanics via Story Mode and optional tutorials, but for every concept that’s clearly explained, there’s another that’s left annoyingly opaque. It’s no stretch to say that having a solid understanding, let alone mastery, of all of the game’s intricate systems can only be accomplished with a <em>significant</em> time investment.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to spend time getting to know Victory Road. This long-awaited release can be summed up in one word: big. The game boasts two full-fat single-player campaigns, along with a bunch of side modes, including a social simulation-style town builder, as well as a robust PvP ecosystem for online matches.</p>
<p>It’s not strictly necessary to start with one particular mode over the others, but Story Mode feels like the most solid landing spot to start your journey. It follows new series protagonist Destin Billows (or Unmei Sasanami if you toggle to the Romanised Japanese character names), a teenager and new transfer to Nagumohara Junior High School. A former child athlete who was diagnosed with a heart condition, Destin has turned his back on his dream of playing football. However, a series of chance encounters with his new classmates reignites his passion for the sport, and he embarks on a challenging quest to restore the school’s long-neglected football club, build a team of unlikely star athletes, and take on Japan’s finest: Raimon.</p>
<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160839/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You control Destin and progress the plot via world exploration, traditional RPG-style battles, athlete-training minigames, and, of course, football matches. While the format will feel familiar to anyone who’s played an RPG before, and the mode-specific mechanics are pretty basic, it’s a solid little adventure that spices up the core football gameplay with a bunch of other activities.</p>
<p>It also tells quite the compelling tale, with a cast of likeable, well-developed characters and a whole host of surprisingly emotional story beats. The production values are high as well, as the story features full English and Japanese voice-acting, a grandiose soundtrack, and a ton of beautiful, fully-animated cutscenes courtesy of anime studio MAPPA.</p>
<p>If there’s a major downside to Victory Road’s Story Mode, it’s that the pacing is all over the place. While it’s nice to have such a meaty campaign to progress through, there’s a feeling at times that everything is more long-winded than it needs to be. The basic RPG battles and minigames, while generally entertaining, can get pretty repetitive by the time the late-game grind sets in. There’s one point in the story where you’re scouting new team members, and you have to play the same slow-paced passing minigame a whopping 15 times in a row. Some of the fat could have been trimmed here.</p>
<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160846/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps Story Mode’s most egregious pacing issue, however, is that it takes a surprisingly long time to actually start playing football matches with any level of frequency. The start of the mode is still entertaining enough on its own, but, strangely, you have to spend a decent handful of hours before football matches start factoring into the story in any meaningful capacity. That said, once it really gets going, Story Mode is a pretty fun ride all the way through its satisfying conclusion.</p>
<p>If Story Mode wasn’t enough, Victory Road also features a secondary campaign with its own distinct story and progression in the way of Chronicle Mode. This follows Victorio Cryptix, a boy from a post-apocalyptic future who travels to the past to assemble a team of the best football players from Inazuma Eleven history in the hopes of stopping the threat to his time.</p>
<p>Victorio’s journey retells the events of all six previous Inazuma Eleven mainline entries in visual novel format, and sees you progressing through all of the major story matches from each game. In essence, Chronicle Mode contains abridged versions of the series’ entire history of campaigns — an impressive feat that will tide voracious players over with hours upon hours of content.</p>
<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160840/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the mode can feel rather repetitive as it lacks Story Mode's gameplay variety and requires that each match be completed <em>twice</em> (once with a set story team and once with your own custom team) to progress.</p>
<p>Additionally, crucial bits of context for each historic match are often glossed over, making it far from the ideal way to experience previous games' narratives. It’s hard to complain too much, though, as having a bunch of the franchise’s history easily accessible in any form feels like gravy more than anything else.</p>
<p>If you’re still not satisfied, beyond the game’s two main campaigns are a plethora of side modes to sink even more time into. Battle Bay Stadium features playable dream matches between powerful teams from series history. Kizuna Station allows you to build your own Bond Town with collectible items and objects and interact with other players off the pitch. Meanwhile, Competition Mode lets you play free matches against the computer or other players online, testing the mettle of your hard-trained team.</p>

<p>Crucially, progression in most of Victory Road’s modes feeds into each other as you share obtained characters, items, and currencies within your central profile. That means that there’s really no wrong way to pass your time, and this freedom of choice in how you interact with its wealth of riches is commendable. Unfortunately, the game has far too many segmented currencies for obtaining items and summoning new characters to your roster, and determining what to do to gain a certain currency is way more complicated than it needs to be.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, Victory Road runs very smoothly on the Switch 2 with no visible frame-rate drops from its 60fps target during my time playing. Controlling everything feels just as responsive as it should. The game also looks decent graphically, though there’s a disappointing amount of shimmer in the background of various environments. Thankfully, the game’s clean and colourful art style keeps its visual identity strong and enjoyable to look at.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Having more content does not necessarily equal a better game, but there’s no denying that Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road’s massive wealth of modes, options, and gameplay variety make it feel like the franchise’s most premium experience yet. Between a fun and heartfelt story mode, a second story mode that includes the highlights of all previous games, <em>and</em> a bunch of additional side content along with robust PvP systems for longevity, it really does feel like you could play Victory Road forever.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, though, it all comes down to that core loop of teambuilding and playing football matches, and Victory Road’s take on the series’ trademark RPG-esque customisability and intuitive action on the pitch feels just as fresh and stylish as ever. Perhaps all those delays really were worth it.</p></section>

			<p>Resident Evil Survival Unit, the mobile game based on Capcom's iconic franchise and developed by JOYCITY Corporation, launched just 10 days ago on November 18, 2025. Since that launch, it has surpassed 2 million downloads on iOS and Android devices, JOYCITY Corporation and publisher Aniplex Inc. have announced.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Survival Unit <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-survival-unit-mobile-game-reveal-capcom/">was revealed this past July</a>, and was pitched as a "<em>fresh take on the 'Resident Evil' universe</em>" by Shinji Hashimoto, co-creator of Resident Evil and the Kingdom Hearts franchise. Hashimoto led development on the project, which takes the world of Resident Evil and blends it with real-time strategy gameplay. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>◤ Resident Evil Survival Unit Surpasses 2 Million Downloads! ◢</p><p>Resident Evil Survival Unit has officially reached 2 million cumulative downloads! <br>Thank you all so much for your amazing support.</p><p>To show our appreciation, we’re giving every Operative a special Promo Code.… <a href="https://t.co/96yaFHJ79J">pic.twitter.com/96yaFHJ79J</a></p></div>— Resident Evil Survival Unit (@RE_SU_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_SU_EN/status/1994347554163900725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>According to a press release, when Survival Unit launched, it immediately shot up to be the number one game on the Google Play Store's free charts in the US, and on the iOS App Store was the number one free downloaded app in over 15 countries, including Japan, the UK, France and Germany.</p>



<p>As part of celebrating the milestone, Aniplex Inc. and JOYCITY Corporation are giving players an in-game reward that can be redeemed with a promo code "<em>2M SURVIVORS"</em> through the game's official promo code redemption site.</p>



<p>While it's still early days for Survival Unit, it seems that this latest mobile effort for the Resident Evil franchise is faring much better than Capcom's previous attempts with porting Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village to iOS. Though the ports themselves <a href="https://wccftech.com/youtuber-plays-resident-evil-village-on-external-moniter-using-usb-c-cable-on-iphone-15-pro/">are impressive and open the door to a new avenue of gaming</a>, the ports were certified flops, with Resident Evil 7 reportedly selling less than 2000 copies.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If Survival Unit continues to be successful, then we'll probably see Capcom try more partnerships like this with its horror franchise, while keeping its mainline games on PC and console devices. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Dual Effect and publisher PQube have announced that survival horror game&nbsp;<em>Tormented Souls 2&nbsp;</em>has hit a major sales milestone just over a month after its release.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/tormented-souls-ii-sales-top-100000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Tormented Souls 2&nbsp;</em>sales have hit 100,000 since the game launched across PC and current-gen consoles on October 23rd. That means it's reached that figure in the span of just a little over five weeks.</p>

<p>PQube marketing chief Andy Pearson says his company had "high hopes" for&nbsp;<em>Tormented Souls 2</em>, and that PQube has been "blown away" by the reception to the game, which has received a much-coveted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2464280/Tormented_Souls_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Very Positive Steam rating</a> across just under 1000 reviews since launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tormented-souls-2-sales-100k-monster.jpg?itok=71JhQJ2c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tormented-souls-2-sales-100k-monster.jpg?itok=cxHDVO7S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tormented Souls 2&nbsp;</em>has hit 100,000 sales since release in October.</figcaption></figure><p>Pearson says that PQube and Dual Effect are also "working on some exciting new content", for which there will be more news "in a few weeks". Keep your eyes peeled for that if you're a&nbsp;<em>Tormented Souls&nbsp;</em>fan.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Tormented Souls 2</em>, it is, as the name suggests, the sequel to 2021 survival horror throwback&nbsp;<em>Tormented Souls</em>, which was inspired by classic tank control-fixed camera-style survival horror experiences like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>.</p>

<p>The followup once again sees you taking the role of Caroline Walker, who travels to a clinic in a remote town in order to deal with the horrifying nightmares she's been having since the events of the first game.</p>

<p>However, it soon becomes apparent that the clinic isn't all it's cracked up to be (after all, when are they?), and Caroline soon finds herself drawn into another survival horror adventure complete with resource management, puzzle-solving, and panicked combat against grotesque monsters.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Islanders Studio Coatsink Lays Off Half of Its Workforce]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/coatsink-layoffs-half-workforce</link>
            <guid>1367413</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Islanders&nbsp;</em>studio Coatsink has announced a round of layoffs targeting around half of the workforce, which parent company Thunderful hopes will result in cost reductions of around $3 million for the year.</p>

<p>As revealed on the Thunderful <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-11-24-thunderful-group-initiates-restructuring-in-its-co-development-segment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, about 50 to 60 Coatsink employees will be losing their jobs. Thunderful says Coatsink is "currently unable to support all existing employees", and that the layoffs are necessary to navigate a "more challenging co-development market".</p>

<p>Despite the hefty layoffs, Coatsink isn't closing down. Thunderful says the studio is still "a market leader in full-service co-development", and that it remains "well-positioned to deliver on all existing and upcoming top-tier projects".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/coatsink-layoffs-islanders-new-shores.jpg?itok=e0IiffM2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/coatsink-layoffs-islanders-new-shores.jpg?itok=UECnaL5W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Coatsink's best-known franchise is probably cozy city-builder series&nbsp;<em>Islanders</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>These Coatsink layoffs are part of what appears to be a downward trend for parent company Thunderful; over the last couple of years, Thunderful has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">laid off</a> a large <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development" rel="nofollow">number</a> of its employees and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-closes-studio-financials" rel="nofollow">closed down studios</a> as a result of declining financial performance.</p>

<p>Thunderful's struggles did not, however, prevent Atari from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-thunderful-majority-stake" rel="nofollow">purchasing a majority stake in the company</a> in July, although that, in turn, hasn't stopped Thunderful and its subsidiaries seemingly continuing to hemorrhage employees.</p>

<p>As for Coatsink itself, if you're not familiar with its name, you might be familiar with some of the games it's published, including cozy city-builder&nbsp;<em>Islanders&nbsp;</em>and its followup&nbsp;<em>New Shores</em>, as well as laid-back angling sim&nbsp;<em>Moonglow Bay&nbsp;</em>and "immersive tactical VR shooter"&nbsp;<em>Onward</em>.</p>

<p>The studio's latest effort,&nbsp;<em>Islanders: New Shores</em>, is a followup to the original&nbsp;<em>Islanders</em>, offering much the same relaxing city-building experience as its predecessor, albeit with some new bells and whistles.</p>




<p>Whether or not Coatsink and Thunderful can recover from this slump remains to be seen, but sadly, the studio is far from the only one undergoing layoffs, with both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs" rel="nofollow">big</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-development-ending-layoffs" rel="nofollow">small</a> companies across the gaming industry letting employees go on a regular basis in recent months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Gears Tactics&nbsp;</em>developer Splash Damage has announced a round of layoffs, although the exact number of staff members losing their jobs wasn't specified by the studio.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7399486098588196864/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on LinkedIn, Splash Damage explains its latest wave of staff cuts with the usual corporate jargon; the studio says it's letting employees go to "remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market".</p>

<p>The company goes on to say that it understands "this kind of change is emotionally tough", and that it will do what it can to ensure "those affected have meaningful support throughout" the layoff process. It's nothing you haven't heard before.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splash-damage-layoffs-gears-tactics.jpg?itok=NtWemNMz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splash-damage-layoffs-gears-tactics.jpg?itok=Lc2_8p6L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Splash Damage's last big release was 2020's&nbsp;<em>Gears Tactics</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Splash Damage didn't give a specific reason for this round of layoffs, but since the studio hasn't released anything big since 2020's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gears-tactics" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears Tactics</em></a>, it's probably pretty easy to guess why staff members are being let go.</p>

<p>What's more, this isn't the first time Splash Damage has come into contact with layoffs this year. Back in January, the studio canceled its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-reactivate-canceled-as-splash-damage-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy" rel="nofollow">online multiplayer-focused game </a><i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-reactivate-canceled-as-splash-damage-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy" rel="nofollow">Transformers: Reactivate</a>&nbsp;</i>and warned that a number of roles were now "at risk of redundancy".</p>

<p>As far as we know, Splash Damage is still currently working on open-world survival game&nbsp;<em>Project Astrid</em>, which was announced <a href="https://www.splashdamage.com/news/announcing-project-astrid/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in 2023</a>, although we haven't seen much of that game since its initial reveal either.</p>

<p>Splash Damage's most recent layoffs are part of an ongoing wave that continues to sweep the gaming industry, affecting studios both big and small.

If you've been struggling lately with the thought that everybody you interact with online is a closet serial killer, why not fire up Killer Chat, which will remove all uncertainty from your brain and flood it with delicious, sexy fear. Hitherto available on <a href="https://rosesrot.itch.io/killer-chat">Itch.io</a>, and just released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3476730/Killer_Chat__Original_Edition/">Steam</a>, it casts you as a reporter researching a book on serial killers. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
If it were me, I'd be watching Manhunter, but no, this reporter is the kind of snoop who accidentally joins a chatroom on the darkweb while googling "how to make ribcages decompose fast", and immediately gets cosy with users called "goreboy". You've got to pass yourself off as an embryonic Hannibal Lecter, as much for the sake of survival as to gather info for your book. And while you're getting to know this crowd, you might as well fuck a few of them. Yeah, that should pan out well. Here's a trailer.

Over the course of six in-game months, you'll rub shoulders with various extremely pretty anime murderers, catching up with them over text or videocall in a dating sim format. There are eight endings that presumably range from your character waking up dead through you calling the police to you becoming a killer yourself. Each route to the finish should take 2-3 hours. All told, you can expect 9-12 hours of slayer-slaying if you're committed to the cause. 
</p><p>
All this need cost you nothing, save the possibility of some worrying revelations about your own kinks. The base "Original" Steam edition of the game is free, having previously been crowd-funded. There are also various DLC packs and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378100/Killer_Chat__Expanded_Edition/">a forthcoming expanded edition</a> that will offer at least double the words, with over 20 possible endings. I am picturing those words scribbled all over the walls of a dingy apartment full of pickle jars. "Just his mind poured on paper," breathes an anime version of Morgan Freeman, before blowing you a kiss.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/portable-gaming-monitor-fhd-15-ips-hits-rock-bottom-amazon-offloads-stock-at-new-record-low-2000648418</link>
            <guid>1367395</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Portable monitors solve specific problems that laptops and tablets cannot address alone, particularly for gaming scenarios where you want larger screen real estate without lugging full-size displays. Nintendo Switch players confined to the 7/8-inch handheld screen gain dramatic improvement through 15.6-inch external displays that transform mobile gaming into living room experiences during travel or temporary setups.</p>
<p>The <em>KYY</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/">15-6-inch portable monitor costs $66 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $99</a>, and hits a record-low price that undercuts competing 1080p portable displays typically selling between $80 and $120 for identical specifications. The 34% discount makes <strong>secondary displays accessible</strong> at pricing approaching basic phone accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD IPS Display That Works</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch IPS panel with a resolution of 1920 x 1080</strong> makes images clear and readable, and games show sharp detail instead of the blurry compromises that lower-resolution portable monitors make. When you look at the screen from the side or share it with others,<strong> the 178-degree viewing angles keep the colors and contrast true</strong>. What’s more, HDR support improves the dynamic range of compatible content by showing more detail in shadows in dark scenes and keeping highlight information that SDR displays clip.</p>



<p>The <strong>two USB-C ports with full functionality</strong> let you connect a single cable to a laptop or phone that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode and Power Delivery. You don’t need separate power adapters or HDMI converters that make cable clutter to connect modern MacBooks, Windows laptops and flagship smartphones: They all work with simple USB-C cables. The <strong>Mini-HDMI port</strong> works with devices that don’t have USB-C video output, like gaming consoles, older laptops, and desktop computers.</p>
<p>The monitor is truly portable because <strong>it is only 0.3 inches thick and weighs only 1.7 pounds</strong>. The dimensions fit into laptop bags with other gear without needing special carrying cases or taking up too much room in luggage while traveling. Business travelers get presentation screens for working in hotel rooms, digital nomads set up dual-monitor workstations in cafes or coworking spaces, and students use laptop screens to do research-heavy assignments that need multiple document windows.</p>
<p>The <strong>included smart cover is made of PU leather and protects against scratches</strong> while being transported.The magnetic attachment makes it easier to attach and remove the cover than cases that need straps or closures, and the frameless design keeps it as small as possible. The grooves in the stand make it easy to find a comfortable viewing angle, whether you’re typing on a laptop or watching something hands-free.</p>



<p>The built-in dual stereo speakers let you listen to music without headphones or external speakers, but the sound quality is only okay because of physical limitations. The <strong>3.5mm audio jack lets you connect headphones</strong> or external speakers when you need better sound, but it also keeps things flexible for different uses. When sound quality isn’t as important as convenience, the speakers are good enough for video calls, watching videos, or playing games.</p>
<p>The <strong>landscape and portrait orientation support lets you work in different ways</strong> such as coding with vertical text display, reviewing documents in their native orientation, or editing portrait photos. You can change the brightness, contrast, color temperature, and input selection on the screen without having to use software or complicated button combinations.</p>
<p>The Black Friday price of $66 is the lowest ever, which means that KYY’s portable monitor costs a lot less than other 1080p displays that cost between $80 and $120 and have similar specs and build quality.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/take-34-off-the-sony-srs-xb100s-speaker-that-brings-life-to-your-favorite-music-2000648189</link>

              <p>If you’re looking to enjoy your favorite tracks on the go, having a solid portable Bluetooth speaker is a must. The market is filled with a ton of options, so picking the right one for yourself can get overwhelming fast, but that’s where we come in. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6040/">Our shopping team has been working hard to find the best Black Friday discounts out there, and those looking for something under $50 should consider grabbing the Sony SRS-XB100 speaker.</a></p>
<p>It’s now down to $43, after a whopping 34% discount. Multiple color options are discounted, including black, white, and the stunning orange. Keep in mind that Black Friday discounts move fast, so if you spot something you like, it’s best to grab it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6040/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Sound on the Go</h2>
<p>The super-portable XB100 features a basic, no-fuss design and comes with an engineered strap that makes it quite easy to travel with. Wrap it around your arm, attach it to your backpack, or toss it into a cupholder and get going. Don’t let the size fool you, though.&nbsp;The improved driver, paired with a full-range speaker, enhances low-end tones while boosting the bass. Sound is spread across the room with the Sound Diffusion processor, creating a cinema-like, 3D listening experience. Vibing to the latest Coldplay album or just catching up on your favorite audiobook as you finish boring kitchen tasks, audio comes through with great detail and clarity. When streaming movies, you’ll be able to hear dialogues just as well, making it an all-rounder.</p>
<p>There’s a built-in microphone that lets you take calls directly from the speaker, absolutely hands-free. The echo-canceling technology, as the name suggests, removes echo from your calls, meaning the other person won’t hear their own voice coming back. Catch up with friends, and take quick meetings on the go right from it.</p>



<p>An IP67 rating makes the speaker resistant to both dust and water, while a new UV coating prevents it from harsh sunlight. This year-round durability makes it easy to carry it with you anywhere you want, literally. Take it to a fun beach trip with friends, by the pool on a hot, sunny day, and even in the shower for a private jamming session with the songs you’d rather gatekeep. The sound is pretty solid on its own, but you can always pair two of these for a larger, more immersive setup. Just ask a friend to bring theirs, and have your very own mini concert right there in your backyard.</p>
<p>Battery life is just as solid. You’re looking at around 16 hours of playtime on a single charge, which is enough to go at least a couple of days without plugging it in. You won’t have to rush to grab a charger mid-party or hunt for an outlet when on the go. Top it up the night before, and dance to your favorite tunes like never before.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this speaker, but to wrap it up, if you’ve been on the lookout for an audio solution that brings your favorite music to life without blowing your budget, this deal makes that possible. The speaker is easy to carry, delivers powerful sound, and offers a reliable battery life. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6040/">It’s now down to just $43, after a nice 34% discount.</a> There are no complicated coupons or long checkout steps to worry about; just add the speaker to your cart, and the discount applies automatically.</p>
