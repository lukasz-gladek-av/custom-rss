            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aloft-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Funcom and developer Astrolabe Interactive have announced the Early Access release date for co-op survival game&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>, which takes place in a world in which you can transform floating islands into "your personal skyship".</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>launches into Early Access on January 15th, which is roughly two months off at time of writing. It's due to land on Steam, and there's no word about whether a console version is on the way anytime soon.</p>

<p>Unlike other Funcom survival games like&nbsp;<em>Conan: Exiles&nbsp;</em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-reveals-spectacular-gameplay-and-details" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>takes place in a bright, cartoony world in which you can freely soar through the skies, searching for resources and looking for an island to call your own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aloft-early-access-release-date-archery.jpg?itok=-CEo7HWX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aloft-early-access-release-date-archery.jpg?itok=_iyOw2sq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>takes place in a whimsical world overtaken by fungal corruption.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s world is more breezy (no pun intended) than other survival games offer, that doesn't mean there's no darkness lurking beneath the surface. A fungus-based corruption is taking hold of the islands, and it's up to you to put a stop to it.</p>

<p>With that said, though,&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s Steam page says the game is "more about rewarding positive action than punishing mistakes", so if you've been looking for a survival game that doesn't break you in half when you mess up, this seems like it'll be up your street.</p>

<p>Once you discover the island you want to call your own, you'll be able to build it into a skyship and use it to traverse&nbsp;<em>Aloft</em>'s world of floating archipelagos in a manner not dissimilar to Bossa Studios' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-worlds-adrift-is-shutting-down-this-summer" rel="nofollow">ill-fated&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift</em></a>. Let's hope this one fares a bit better!</p>




<p>Over the course of its Early Access run, which the developers estimate will last "at least a year",&nbsp;<em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>will be regularly updated with new mechanics, biomes, and challenges, plus lots more.</p>

<p>You can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Aloft&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660080/Aloft/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> ahead of its Early Access release on January 15th.</p>

Sony’s flagship wireless headset is discounted to $129.99 ($20 off) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-PULSE-Elite-Wireless-Headset%2F5113175920">Walmart</a> right now as part of its early Black Friday sale. Although the discount doesn’t appear massive, that still represents the lowest price we’ve seen so far.</p><p>The Pulse Elite launched in late 2023 alongside a slate of other mid-cycle PlayStation 5 accessories, including the $199.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23957860/sony-pulse-explore-playstation-earbuds-impressions">Pulse Explore earbuds</a> and the once-elusive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24012547/sony-playstation-portal-handheld-remote-player-ps5-chiaki-review">PlayStation Portal</a> handheld companion.</p><div><p>Sony’s PlayStation Pulse Elite is an over-ear headset with a retractable boom mic. It’s designed to filter out background noise, deliver low latency and lossless audio, and work with the PlayStation Portal or the PlayStation 5, PC, and Mac via the PlayStation Link USB adapter. </p></div><p>While many third-party wireless headsets support 3D Audio (PlayStation’s take on simulated spatial audio), Pulse Elite supports what Sony considers the ideal acoustics and tuning to get the most from your games. Sony also uses planar magnetic drivers, which are usually reserved for studio-grade monitors. They’re said to offer a more accurate soundstage with less distortion compared to the dynamic neodymium drivers used in most consumer-oriented headphones and headsets.</p><p>Besides its decidedly PlayStation, almost alien design, the headset notably supports Sony’s low latency lossless wireless audio codec. That feature requires the included PlayStation Link dongle, which works with the PS5, PlayStation Portal, Windows PCs, and Macs. It also has Bluetooth, so you can use it with your mobile devices and simultaneously hear from both sources. The retractable voice-isolating boom microphone enables game chat and voice calling in either scenario. </p><p>Whether you’re already a PS5 owner or looking to take your first jump into the deep end of the PlayStation pool with the newly released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/24289319/ps5-pro-review">PS5 Pro</a>, it may be worth a shot if you don’t already have a viable headset.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A dungeon with a different structure each time you enter, a variety of magic bullets—and a formidable barrage of bullets—await you.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In this world, Pentagaia, there were five countries that had been transferred from five different worlds.</p><p>Magi Province, the land of wizards, where magical technology flourished. A land of priestesses and samurai, a land of warriors and the four seasons. A land of elves, with the blessings of the World Tree. A land of mechanical ingenuity, where super-science rules the world. A land of wilderness and dust, ruled by demons.</p><p>The rulers of each nation sent explorers to the Castle of Heaven, where the secrets of Pentagaia were said to lie. They did so with the longing to return to the original world. These explorers were called “Heaven Seekers.”</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Explore a Dungeon That Changes Each Time You Enter</strong> – In this title, you move with the left stick and aim with the right stick. This is a bullet hell shooting game where you freely control your character and explore random dungeons. When your HP reaches 0, you will lose all the items you have gained during this exploration. The player gains experience by exploring many times and learning the patterns of the rooms and the nature of the enemies.</li><li><strong>Create Your Own “Magic Shot!”</strong> – The shot fired by the player character can be modified by freely combining over 20 customizable items to change its properties. Since items are randomly acquired during each quest, players will fight with a different “personalized shot” each time they dive into a dungeon.</li><li><strong>Dot Art Style Game Visuals</strong> – All in-game elements in this title, including player characters, enemies, and dungeons, are rendered in high-quality dot art.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Having his own bespoke, offline engine was a priority for whatever kind of game he would eventually make on his own, to avoid the "sour taste" of inefficient tools and workflows.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Basso's work on a "general purpose, 3D game engine" dragged on during nights and weekends for three years before he came to a tough conclusion: the engine-focused project had been too focused on "preemptively solving problems," instead of "having enough direction to actually turn into a game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was 2017, and some of the design ideas from his 2012 Metroidvania lark had continued pulling on him, so Basso "wrote off" his 3D engine as "a learning experience" and started anew with 2D search action as a priority. Like before, off-the-shelf solutions weren't going to cut it, but at least this time, he had a genre and some design directives in mind.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For his new game, he wanted pixels to scale perfectly to a variety of common screen resolutions, along with visual effects that meshed well with his integer-scaled pixel art. He disliked "built-in lighting effects" that developers had to "fight against quite a bit" in engines like Unity: "they have point lights and stuff, they have a smooth gradient, and that clashes with pixel art."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Build your own technology, then let it set the tone">Build your own technology, then let it set the tone</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With that baseline in mind, Basso's early project took shape, but roughly one year in, he found it "looked like an NES game, where the art wasn't that striking." Thanks to his full control of the engine and rendering efficiency at the fore, Basso had more wiggle room at this point in development to add what he describes as a crucial technical upgrade: a rim light shader.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;"Everything was now kind of in shadow, but the edges were highlighted, and your character sprite in the bushes got blended in with the foreground tiles in a way that tied it all together," Basso says. "Immediately, when I got that shader working, I'm like, 'This is a unique look."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The inspiration dominos began falling. Basso noticed that his effects' shadow-and-light interplay "informed the stylistic direction" of the game's environments and animals. Newly inspired, he built a "full screen Navier-Stokes fluid simulation" to power the game's smoke and water effects for more haziness and dreaminess, along with more lighting and particle-effect systems, painting more highlights and posterization effects over backgrounds and sprites.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Billy Basso/BigMode.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This is interesting," Basso recalls thinking, "where I have this high-fidelity physics simulation working, but it's being paired with this, in some ways, primitive pixel art." As Basso's work bounced between design, art, and engine development, "the richness of the game got layered on, and I found the game's tone and identity gradually over that process." Despite his earlier hiccups with a 3D engine, he still recommends an engine-first mentality for new game development: "That opens up a lot of unique creative avenues. Once I get a cool system working, then I can play around with it and see what it allows for."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Digging the well with Adelman's aid">Digging the well with Adelman's aid</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With his 2D game in full swing, Basso inadvertently learned about Adelman, a business- and marketing-focused industry veteran, through a pair of interviews in late 2017 and early 2018. Basso appreciated hearing how Adelman had transitioned from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/making-world-of-goo-an-all-time-indie-darling">revolutionizing Nintendo's digital distribution channels</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to dedicated support for indie devs, particularly for the breakout Metroidvania hit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Axiom Verge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "I'm naturally a pretty introverted person, so having someone like him to work with sounded very appealing to me," Basso says. He sent a cold-call email.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In hindsight, Adelman admits that his near-instant email reply turned out to be a bit disingenuous. "What was special enough about [Animal Well] that made me think, 'oh I want to work on this,' versus what it eventually became, were actually very different games," he says on the PAX West 2024 show floor. "I really like both games." The game he originally envisioned landed somewhere between </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>VVVVVV </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You Have To Win The Game</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">–since both eschewed combat in favor of exploration, puzzles, and hardcore platforming. For Adelman, the cherry on top was the early game's emphasis on nooks and crannies, which might otherwise be hidden in shadow or other Basso-developed effects: "I really loved finding secret passageways that I walked past, like, four or five times before I noticed them," Adelman says. "Like, oh, this opens up into a whole new area!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With Adelman on board, Basso's more richly developed prototypes started getting in front of industry players, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s first major reveal came in a small booth at the inaugural Summer Game Fest in June 2022, an in-person event in the wake of the defunct Electronics Entertainment Expo (E3). That event's biggest </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> payoff came one week later, as a six-second blip in</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBD3ExFI9_E"> a wrap-up video</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> made by popular YouTube creator Jason "Dunkey" Gastrow.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A big leap with BigMode">A big leap with BigMode</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Jason, in his normal style, basically shit on the whole event, but he did give us a positive shout-out," Adelman says. "Just from that one mention, our wishlist numbers had a big spike." Shortly after this, Gastrow and his wife Leah traded follows with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team on Twitter, which led to a series of DMs between Adelman and Leah during that September's Tokyo Game Show. Leah requested a playable build of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">; Adelman asked that it not be used as YouTube or Twitch content. Leah replied that she had something else in mind: "We're starting a publishing label, called BigMode," Adelman recalls her saying. "Would you have any interest in talking about that?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Adelman had not planned to add a formal publisher to the Animal Well development period; after all, he didn't need one for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Axiom Verge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. And the Dunkey YouTube channel's reputation–full of curse words and overt trolling in online games–gave Adelman some pause: "is [Gastrow's] real-life persona the same as his online persona?" (The past few years have seen other YouTube and Twitch creators take </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/dr-disrespect-s-ousting-should-be-a-wake-up-call-for-devs">huge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> missteps in their own game-publishing efforts.)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Billy Basso/BigMode.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Adelman and Gastrow's initial conversations were polite and promising. Game promotion and marketing were changing in the years since </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Axiom Verge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Jason's online reach and the couple's genuine enthusiasm filled an information gap for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at this point in development. Jason had made a career out of tapping into a modern gaming audience's attention span–how people engage with new games and pick favorites out of a deluge of indies. If Gastrow saw something special in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, he could convince a lot of people to do the same. In short, what a good publisher does.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This could be a disaster, or it could be a really good fit," Adelman recalls thinking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(When asked for comment on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s development and success at PAX West 2024, Jason Gastrow replies by repeating the same sentence twice: "I feel like one hundred penguins." It is unclear whether this statement was in line with Gastrow's humorous YouTube persona, or whether he was offering a hint about an undiscovered </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> secret, since the game prominently features penguins.)</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Layers&quot; work–but they need to be distinct and appealing">"Layers" work–but they need to be distinct and appealing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">wastes no time hinting at its range of secrets. With no plot or narration, players begin running-and-jumping around a dark, eerie cave. In one direction, players can pick up an "egg" from a treasure chest with no indication of what it means or does. In the other direction, a squirrel runs away, and a rabbit is seen hiding in a seemingly unreachable corner of the screen. Neither of these hints is borne out with prompt clarification, and the mysteries and layers keep coming.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that opening beat is nothing compared to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s "layers" of deeper puzzles. Some required dozens of players' collaboration to figure out, and others required connecting specific hardware to a PC while playing the game. Layers found their way into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a few ways:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a publishing deal in place and budget settled, Bigmode, Adelman, and Basso agreed not to rush the game's launch–and to let Basso ultimately lead on the development, implementation, and difficulty of the game's crisscrossing puzzles. Basso would often hand a new build to Adelman and the BigMode team without spoiling its four "layers" of puzzles, though the deepest layer was so obtuse that its puzzles simply couldn't be tested by Bigmode's tiny team without cheat codes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This part of the game's development never exceeded Adelman's "scope creep" bandwidth, as he found the deeper puzzle additions never added "bloat" to the development process. Basso would review feedback after each build was turned in and accept "maybe half" of the suggestions. "It wasn't so much like I was asking permission ever to do something," Basso says. "I kind of just did it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Basso, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s deeper layers would have no value unless players connected with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s surface-level content. He drew inspiration from an unlikely 3D-adventure game: 2005's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadow of the Colossus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, whose online community eventually began hunting for a "hidden" 17th "colossus" boss (which never existed).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was almost like a religious conviction that they wanted to find this missing part of the game," Basso says. "But then you realize that that's only true because </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadow of the Colossus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is one of the most finely crafted games ever made, and people care that much because the base game is so compelling."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, Basso committed to one principle in particular: none of its items could be considered "staples" in other Metroidvania games. Midway through development, Basso inadvertently realized he'd leaned on children's toys as the game's foundation, including a Slinky, a yo-yo, a bubble wand, and a frisbee—which gave him immediate reference points for their designs, plus the freedom to add clever surprises to each (particularly the bubble wand's unique "climbing" system). Basso likes the "safe bet" nature of the popular toys he picked out: "That's already a proven interaction."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Inspiration from The House on the Rock">Inspiration from The House on the Rock</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The last step was to coalesce Basso's artistic and design leanings in a way that would make his mysterious world inviting and exciting to explore, not confusing. Basso had his vision catalyzed after visiting</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thehouseontherock.com/"> The House on the Rock in Wisconsin</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "It's this ramshackle collection of weird objects that the original owner of the house collected, and he built all these expansions to store them all," Basso says. "You can go in any direction and find cool stuff to look at. It's always surprising, and you can't really predict what the through line is between all of them, but it still feels consistent."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Basso says he wanted to make "the video game version" of the tourist attraction, though his version would include an unspoken mythology defined by "all the weird, Midwestern lawn ornaments I was seeing in my neighborhood." This explains some of the game's atypical animals standing amongst overgrown, lawn-like weeds (hello, pink flamingos), but Basso also describes an effort to keep his game's animals as unique as its items.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Basso admits leaning towards a cast of animals in the game because he finds them "more enjoyable" to draw than humans, and that he can have more creative license since people on average are "more forgiving about the [visual] details, about what they look like." His initial impulse was to draw "more zoo animals," Basso says. "There's a zebra in the [early versions]. And there's just some, like, bears."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Billy Basso/BigMode.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the game's more mysterious tone took shape, Basso began watching nature documentaries on YouTube, then found himself compelled by the weirder, less popular animals he saw. "I remember learning that the beluga whale can imitate the sound of children underwater," Basso says. "They trick a lot of divers into thinking there's a child drowning." He might have otherwise picked a better-known creature to fit whatever biome he needed (water, forest, cavern, etc.), but documentaries shaped his excitement: "Oh, I like this detail. That's scary and creepy and interesting." He thus filled out the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Community matters—with a pre-release twist">Community matters—with a pre-release twist</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Adelman admits that before working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, he'd never focused pre-release efforts on the concept of community, and he was particularly ambivalent about one popular service, which he'd seen other game developers adopt for their own games with mixed success. "I guess we've got to start up a Discord server and hope people show up," Adelman recalls initially thinking. But in the game's run-up, Basso hid a number of puzzles across the game's promotional channels, including videos and website posts–all hinting to the caliber of puzzles that would eventually debut in the game's deeper layers. The resulting Discord engagement was immediately massive.&nbsp; "These ARGs brought a lot of people together, and friendships started to form," Adelman says. "So I was like, 'Oh, I get what [people] mean now, when they talk about building community.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before that full community could coalesce, Adelman elected to test one unique version of "community": a pre-release, critics-only Discord channel. In addition to giving critics a few weeks to play the final game, Adelman wanted to provide a meeting place for critics to "share information and collaborate on certain puzzles," admitting that Basso's design vision always included an expectation of community-driven puzzle solving. (In other words: it's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cheating to ask for Animal Well help!)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This had two outcomes for the very small </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> development team: First, the developers could see in real time a miniature version of how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be digested by a community at large–something that couldn't necessarily be replicated by a dedicated QA team. Second, it arguably bumped the game's review scores. "I think if everyone had been playing in isolation, they might have missed out on some things," Adelman says. "Sometimes a reviewer would say, 'I just found this,' and everyone would be, like, 'What?! I gotta look for that." We might have gotten a lot of 7 out of 10s, 8 out of 10s, if people didn't seek out some of the more interesting content or didn't know where to find it."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Not &quot;niche,&quot; but &quot;intense&quot;">Not "niche," but "intense"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The community's response to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s pre-release ARG puzzles gave Basso confidence to build complex puzzles for the final game, and that community responded even more fiercely to the final retail game. "People really appreciated the secrets in the game," he says. "I'd assumed there'd be a hardcore group of people that that appealed to. And most people would just enjoy the game. Maybe that is the case, but I think everybody that did experience those deeper, later parts of the game, they all seemed to really resonate with it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, when the game's deepest riddles were uncovered by the community–particularly a cypher whose only hint is the pixel-long direction a bunny's ears are turned–Adelman and Basso admit they were shocked by how quickly it happened.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Adelman suggests the internal estimate for full puzzle discovery was somewhere around ten years. "There were so many people who were so passionate about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, that there were probably, you know, ten man-years dedicated in that condensed amount of time," Adelman says. "It was just way more people working way harder on [the game's puzzles] than we ever expected." (Basso insists that "there are some things the community hasn't found" in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> but has not elaborated further.)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Basso speaks to trusting his development instincts, he confirms that he's "thinking about another game" and is thus in the "very early stages of setting a new project and engine up." He intends to deliver something similar to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s scope, if not something "bigger."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm looking forward to releasing a game within the context of having already released Animal Well," Basso says. "I think I'll have more flexibility with how it is marketed, and it will be fun to play off, and subvert, existing fans' expectations." And he clarifies that the afterglow of Animal Well's launch, including a "victory lap" where feedback has moved from comment sections to critical accolades and real-life lines, made years of solo-development isolation worth it. He had ultimate control over its tools, engines, art, and mechanics. Now, and forever, he says that's out of his hands.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Animal Well was this sort of pure side project where I could implement things in what I felt was the ideal way," Basso says. "Robust, not dependent on things. [The result was] a timeless quality that older cartridge games have–that still have, like, really intense speed running communities. I wanted to make a game that, you know, could still have a fandom around it 30 years from now."</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro Game Boost feature isn't delivering the 45% improvements promised before launch likely due to memory bandwidth constraints.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their weekly podcast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> commented on the system's features delivering, so far, only a 30%, 35% improvement in titles that did not receive a PS5 Pro Enhanced patch. While it is still not clear if Game Boost, which is essentially a compatibility mode, offers all the features and all the performance of the system, which seems unlikely, considering the Xbox Series X, powered by AMD hardware like Sony's consoles, offers the full GPU power when running Xbox One X using a similar compatibility mode, there's a very good chance that memory bandwidth constraints are limiting the improvements. This is similar to what happened on the PlayStation 4 Pro, as the 45% GPU upgrade over the base model was accompanied by only a 28% improvement in memory bandwidth, although the unbalance was way worse in the previous generation refresh system, which couldn't target 4K resolution in games even if the system had the shading power for it.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro Game Boost feature being limited by memory bandwidth hypothesis is somewhat backed up by how AMD handles its GPU, as the increase in CU is parallel to an increase in memory bandwidth and memory controller improvement that allows larger cache GPUs to better handle high resolutions such as 4K. As such, there may be situations in the future where the PS5 Pro will be able to handle 1080p at 120 FPS with ease but struggle more at higher resolutions, as the higher the resolution, the more memory bandwidth is needed.</p>

<p>Despite unpatched games not seeing the improvements that some were expecting, the PlayStation 5 Pro seems to be delivering in PS5 Pro patched games, as in cases like<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/"> God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, the visual and performance improvements are substantial.

That episode will be the last gasp of an ambitious sci-fi universe the developers at Firewalk Studios helped to jumpstart this year.

<p>Next month, The Game Awards celebrates its tenth anniversary as the leading award show in the gaming space. It’s the premier presentation for gamers worldwide, with awards being dished out, new games being teased, and updates being revealed. This year’s event, which will take place on December 12, is set to be a monumental showcase.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the event, The Game Awards has posted an email revealing to fans that it’s trying to secure registration with the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office, legitimising the brand. It has called on those same fans to bolster the application and help secure the trademark.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-distinctive-association">Distinctive Association</h2>



<p>In an email circulated amongst fans, The Game Awards’ team explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are just 1 month away from The Game Awards and our 10th anniversary. </p>



<p>As a fan who joined us for one of our Zoom sessions during the pandemic, we are reaching out with a quick request. </p>



<p>We are currently in the midst of registering “The Game Awards” as a mark with the US Patent &amp; Trademark office. We are looking for letters of support to establish that consumers (that’s you!) distinctively associate the term “The Game Awards” with our annual awards show.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The email then requested any ‘personal reflections’ that fans might have, all of which will be added to the application when it’s submitted in the coming weeks. If successful, the patent will recognise The Game Awards with a trademark, representing the legitimacy of the event and the high standard to which it’s now held by gamers everywhere.</p>



<p>Upon opening the link in the email, users are presented with a pre-written letter regarding them as a ‘video game enthusiast and an avid viewer of The Game Awards’. By signing the letter, you confirm to the best of your ability that The Game Awards is a ‘well-known trademark’ associated with the showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley – and Ola Balola LLC.</p>



<p>What do you think? Do you associate the term ‘The Game Awards’ with <strong>nothing but </strong>the annual showcase hosted by Geoff?</p>

                <p>It's not a big surprise, but a lot of children want video games for the holidays.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/hundreds-of-zenimax-workers-strike-over-microsoft-outsourcing-remote-work-policies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Hundreds of staff at Bethesda parent company ZeniMax will go on strike today in protest at parent company Microsoft outsourcing work without bargaining with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) union. 
</p>
<p>
The one-day walkout by staff who work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and Doom will be held today, Wednesday 13th November, from 10am to 6pm local time at four ZeniMax Studios offices in Maryland and Texas. 
</p>
<p>
Staff say they are concerned over the "unilateral decision" to outsource quality assurance (QA) work to external teams at a time of uncertainty and layoffs. In short, the worry is ZeniMax will undercut its own union staff by shifting the work elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>ZeniMax workers say they have also been prompted to walk out over continued concerns over remote work policies - the same issue which sparked a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-developers-strike-over-office-working-policy">protest by Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 developers at Activision's QA studio in Minnesota</a> at the end of last month.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted ZeniMax and Microsoft for comment.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-recognises-300-person-zenimax-testers-union">Microsoft recognised the ZeniMax Studios union back in January 2023</a>, when 300 video game testers who worked on ZeniMax and Bethesda titles grouped together under the CWA. 
</p>
<p>
The union was the first Microsoft recognised and the largest video game union in the US. At the time, Microsoft was still battling to buy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>, and was keen to voluntarily recognise worker unions to mitigate concerns over its growing portfolio's impact on workers.
</p><p>
"The Xbox business has never been more healthy," Microsoft's gaming boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">Phil Spencer said in a Bloomberg interview published just earlier today</a>, when asked what the future had in store following a year filled with Microsoft layoffs. "The business is performing right now, and I think that means a more healthy future for hardware and the games we build."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenimax-qa-union-goes-on-strike-over-outsourcing-and-remote-work.1034748/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenimax-qa-union-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ZeniMax Workers United, a gaming union consisting of quality assurance workers from across the studios of Bethesda's parent company, is going on strike today over what it alleges to be excessive outsourcing of QA on parent company Microsoft's part.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/ZeniMaxWorkers/status/1856714377992278336" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the union wants Microsoft to "meet [it] at the bargaining table over key issues like remote work options and outsourcing", <a href="https://x.com/ZeniMaxWorkers/status/1856714480413003983" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">demanding</a> "job security and improved working conditions".</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/bethesda-strike-zenimax-xbox-microsoft" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Inverse report</a>, QA test lead Rhyanna Eichner says ZeniMax Workers United members are "all really looking forward to coming together and spending time together", and that "this is what needs to be done to move on".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-workers-united-strike.jpg?itok=iLZ6m1w6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-workers-united-strike.jpg?itok=Dg4PltUN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZeniMax Workers United comprises QA workers of all stripes from across Bethesda's offices.</figcaption></figure><p>Eichner also says that the union is striking over its parent company's remote work proposals, which she says are not good enough. She says Microsoft has "continually given us their first proposal again and again", and that it's obvious to her the union's "different mobilization tactics have not worked".</p>

<p>Senior QA tester Juniper Dowell adds that many employees would be forced to consider alternative employment if they were required to be at the office five days a week because they were hired under remote working conditions.</p>

<p>Dowell says that while striking "isn't fun or ideal", there's a "satisfaction in having a concrete physical action" to help the union and its members "fight for better work conditions". She's hoping that Microsoft and ZeniMax will "stop dragging their feet and meet us at the table".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bethesda-zenimax-workers-united-strike-starfield.jpg?itok=mv-ewWrh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bethesda-zenimax-workers-united-strike-starfield.jpg?itok=OoFPjxfo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZeniMax Workers United wants to negotiate for better remote working policies and less QA outsourcing.</figcaption></figure><p>ZeniMax's union isn't the only one to go on strike in recent months. Last week, employees at French studio Don't Nod <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">went on strike</a> following the announcement that almost 70 jobs at their studio could be at risk, with remote working policies also on the list of issues employees raised.</p>

<p>Gaming giant Ubisoft also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">faced a strike in October</a>, again in part over remote working policies, as well as what the employees involved perceived to be inadequate salaries.</p>

<p>ZeniMax Workers United's strike will last a single day, running between 10am and 6pm local time. We'll have to wait and see whether Microsoft and ZeniMax pay enough attention for negotiations to truly begin.</p>

It seems it’s more that the company is worried they’ll play with it the wrong way. “By the time you notice, it’s already covered in drool...”</p><p>I have three cats, and I can’t say this has ever proved an issue. My ten-year-old is far more likely to cover the screen in that inexplicable sticky residue all children exude, even more so than Archie, the giant, lumbering ginger. Although, in fairness, I don’t own a slavering St. Bernard or Mastiff, leaving those ghastly tendrils of slobber everywhere they go. I wouldn’t want one of those playing <em>Zelda</em> on my device.</p><p>The tweet continues, “Pet saliva and urine can cause the device to malfunction due to water exposure. If you have pets, be careful about where you place your Switch.”</p><p>“Pets” seems to be doing rather a lot of work, trying to cover up for the real culprits here: <em>dogs</em>. Just name them, Nintendo. Stop trying to be all woke and refusing to profile. We’ve also got a pet corn snake, and I’m not in the least concerned about Cornflake running my Switch under the faucet.</p><p>However, according to the image accompanying the warning, it looks like Nintendo might be more concerned about rabid foxes than anything else.</p><p>Look, it’s good advice. You <em>should</em> stop your pets from peeing on your electronic devices. You also shouldn’t put them through the washing machine, run them over with your car, or drop them into a volcano.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">While all eyes are on Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom has unveiled a brand-new game for mobile devices (App Store and Google Play) in the franchise called Monster Hunter Outlanders. The company is teaming up with TiMi Studio Group, known for its work on Call of Duty Mobile and Pokemon Unite.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Outlanders is being described as an open-world survival game, offering solo play as well as co-op for up to four people. The announcement trailer--seen below--interestingly enough doesn't showcase any combat for the title, instead focusing on mobility. The video sees a player paragliding across the map, swimming, sliding, utilizing a grappling gun, climbing a cliff, and even being shot out of a cannon-like device.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Monster Hunter Outlanders | Official Announcement Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">A core aspect of the Monster Hunter franchise is taking on giant creatures and then craving them up for parts to build new armor as well as weapons. Monster Hunter Outlanders will feature "the traditional hunting experience," per a press release, though this aspect isn't really shown in the debut trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">“Monster Hunter Outlanders not only offers players an authentic hunting experience, but it does it in a massive open world featuring the community and social systems players are looking for today," said TiMi producer Dong Haung in the press release.</p><p dir="ltr">The game is coming soon to mobile devices, though no specific launch date is listed. In the meantime, there will be several playtests for Monster Hunter Outlanders.</p><p dir="ltr">The next mainline entry for the series is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-launching-in-february/1100-6526679/" data-ref-id="1100-6526679">Monster Hunter Wilds, which will launch February 28, 2025</a>, on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. A couple of weeks ago, the game had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-begins-with-almost-500000-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6527527/" data-ref-id="1100-6527527">a beta that began with almost 500,000 concurrent players on Steam</a> alone.</p>

            <p>Following the passing of Sylens' original actor Lance Reddick last year, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> has recast the role.</p>
<p>In the latest Horizon outing, the character is voiced by Tim Russ, Eurogamer can confirm.</p>
<p>Russ has been in the industry for many years, and is known for his roles in the likes of Star Trek: Voyager where he portrayed Vulcan Lieutenant Commander Tuvok, and as doorman Frank in Samantha Who?</p>

<p>Sylens features in both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, which Lego Horizon Adventures is based on, and its sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>. Series developer Guerrilla is yet to comment on who will replace Reddick, who portrayed Sylens in both mainline games and their respective DLC, longer term.</p>
<p>Reddick <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/actor-lance-reddick-star-of-destiny-and-the-wire-has-died">passed away in March last year</a>, aged 60. Following his passing, players discovered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lance-reddick-memorial-added-to-horizon-forbidden-west-dlc">memorial situated on an island visited in Horizon Forbidden West's DLC Burning Shores</a>, which served as an homage to the late actor.</p>
<p>"In honour of Lance Reddick, we created a memorial to commemorate the profound impact he had on us all," Guerrilla wrote at the time.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Lance, for everything you brought to the role of Sylens: your gravitas, energy, wisdom and more. An incomparable talent and friend. We miss you terribly."</p>

<p>As for Lego Horizon Adventures, we just awarded the game two out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It's a decidedly joyless kind of game, the sort that's better to look at than actually play with, and one that does little to bridge the gap between its two main subjects," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Eurogamer's Lego Horizon Adventures review</a>. "I still don't know why it exists or who it's for, and there's little evidence to suggest that Guerrilla or Gobo know the answer either."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Amazon’s Prime video service have released a new trailer for<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/secret-level/"> Secret Level.</a> The fifteen episode series features fourteen dedicated to a specific game, and one for “various PlayStation Studios games” which we know will feature Kratos from God of War as he was seen briefly in the first trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Secret Level - Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SvY9Uq7I30Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let’s address the elephant in the room: Concord is still listed, although not shown in the trailer. Well, I don’t <em>think</em> it’s shown in the trailer, given that barely anyone played the game before it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/sony-permanently-shuts-down-concord-and-developer-firewalk-studios/">deleted from history</a> it’s rather hard to judge.</p>
<p>The cast list has also been revealed and there are some big names; Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Terminator Franchise), Kevin Hart (Jumanji), Keanu Reeves (John Wick), Temuera Morrison (The Book of Boba Fett, Chief of War), Ariana Greenblatt (Barbie), Heaven Hart, Emily Swallow (The Mandalorian), Gabriel Luna (The Last of Us, Terminator: Dark Fate), Ricky Whittle (American Gods, Land of Bad), Patrick Schwarzenegger (The White Lotus), Merle Dandridge (The Last of Us), Claudia Doumit (The Boys), Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Lost, The Union), Clive Standen (Vikings, The Morning Show), Laura Bailey (The Legend of Vox Machina), and Michael Beach (The Perfect Couple, Tulsa King).</p>
<p>The games covered include: Armored Core, Concord, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, PAC-MAN, , Sifu, Spelunky, The Outer Worlds, Unreal Tournament and Warhammer 40,000. The first set of episodes will drop on December 10th with additional episodic drops until December 1th, so I would guess that means two episodes a day.</p>

<p>“Secret Level weaves a tapestry of iconic games across multiple mediums, to tell a series of unique and captivating stories,” said Vernon Sanders, head of television, Amazon MGM Studios. “Created and led by Tim Miller, Blur Studio, and Supervising Director Dave Wilson, each episode will take our global Prime Video customers on a brand new journey with breath-taking animation and imaginative storytelling.”</p>

			<p>Last year, I visited Japan for a few weeks, soaking in the culture, the nature and way too many plates of curry. Giant billboards advertised the latest niche gacha game, and multi-floor department stores dedicated huge displays to current and upcoming game releases unlike anything I’d ever see back in America’s dried out and dour shopping culture. The single most mind-blowing display of gaming reverence and promotion, though, was when I walked into a Lawson convenience store in Osaka that had been converted from front-to-back with a Dragon Quest theme. The signage outside was made of slime smiles, when you walked into the store you’d hear the crunchy NES sound-effect of an opened door from the original game play, and half the store was dedicated to selling merch related to the franchise. Dragon Quest has had a lasting impact not just on gaming, but on Japanese culture as a whole. Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, above all else, is a reminder and a celebration of that.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRx4TbtpcRw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For people outside of Japan, it can be hard to notice that influence, and a lot of that is simply due to the Dragon Quest series not being nearly as impactful or consistent overseas. Mainline entries like Dragon Quest IX on the Nintendo DS or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/26/dragon-quest-xi-s-echoes-of-an-elusive-age-definitive-edition-review/">Dragon Quest XI</a> have certainly made an impact on gamers worldwide, but for Dragon Quest III and what is essentially this franchise’s equivalent of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII</a>, there hasn’t been a widely accessible or brushed up release until now with this remake.</p>


<p>Of course, with HD-2D in the title, it’s clear that this isn’t a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/06/final-fantasy-vii-remake-review/">Remake</a> or Rebirth moment for Dragon Quest. The bones of this game are the same as they were in 1988 – you’re a young adventurer boy or girl, tasked with forming a party of companions and setting off into the world to vanquish the demon Baramos and save the world. It’s without a doubt a clichéd story that’s been adapted and twisted and parodied for decades, but what’s important here is that Dragon Quest III is ostensibly the game that invented that kind of story in the first place.</p>


<p>As a remake, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake isn’t doing a whole lot to reinvent that story, flesh it out or turn it into some kind of meta-commentary. There are some additional Episodic story scenes you can access throughout your journey, but they serve to flesh out some of the already existing characters and story threads – like getting a deeper look into the adventures of your famous father Ortega. As a protagonist, you’re a blank-slate, and the same goes for your customisable companions.</p>
<p>Each character class has a unique set of sprites and can be customized with their own names, hair colour, and personality-types, but with no spoken dialogue from your comrades, that final element only affects their stat-growth on paper. Still, that didn’t stop me from telling a story in my mind where my scatterbrain cleric Kikuri kept wasting her MP and missing attacks because she was nursing a perpetual hangover/drunken stupor like her Bocchi The Rock anime namesake.</p>

<p>A new gameplay feature that helps amplify that sense of self-driven storytelling is the ability to Recall conversations. Anytime someone says something you’d like to keep in mind for later, instead of having to jot down a note in your notebook you can just press the start button to save that entire conversation in-game for later access. In a game like Elden Ring, the natural experience of remembering characters wants and objectives can be hard to keep track of the deeper you get into the game. A quality-of-life feature like Recall makes that process a bit easier without hampering the self-guided nature of the journey at all.</p>
<p>Lots of other quality-of-life features have made their way into Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, like the introduction of multiple difficulty options that can be swapped at any time. This isn’t a particularly difficult RPG by traditional standards, but certain tricky bosses or lengthy dungeon back-tracks definitely had me relying on a temporary drop in difficulty to get through them a bit more swiftly.</p>
<p>There’s also a brand new vocation called Monster Wrangler for your companions – it starts out as a pretty standard brawler type with good physical attributes, but eventually turns into a bit of a Blue Mage style character. By capturing and recruiting monsters, you can learn skills from them for the Monster Wrangler. On top of the really fun skill variety, having the added layer of monster-capturing on top of every enemy encounter made battles a lot more enticing and exciting. Your recruited monsters also feed into the newly expanded Monster Arena side-mode, a huge upgrade from the monster-battle gambling of the original game. It feels like a huge love letter to Dragon Quest Joker, the iconic Pokemon-inspired spinoff series, to have these Monster Wrangler and Monster Arena elements worked into the game – and it’s impressive how seamlessly they fit into your grand adventure.</p>

<p>The biggest change and upgrade in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, without a doubt, is the shift in visuals to an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/26/octopath-traveler-review/">Octopath Traveler</a> inspired blend of 3D environments, realistic lighting, and traditional pixel-art sprites. It’s done incredibly well, and the mix of old-school elements like the sprite art and chunky sound effects combined with the flashy new visual touches creates such a fun contrast. Particle effects have been given a wild modern upgrade too, leading to incredibly satisfying moments in battle where your spells and abilities summon huge gusts of wind and searing fireballs.</p>
<p>My only issue with the HD-2D treatment is that, in a lot of locations and times of day, the bloom lighting can be a bit too distracting – I nearly had to wear sunglasses from how bright the sun was reflecting off my parties sprites.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is a lovingly-crafted celebration of gaming’s most iconic franchises. Rather than reinvent that wheel and change the game for modern audiences, Square Enix has highlighted and elevated the elements that made this such an iconic game all those decades ago, while slipping in a treasure trove of quality-of-life features that make it an even smoother experience to either dive into for the first time ever or return to yet again.</p>

			<p>Fallout TV series creator Jonathan Nolan and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer appeared earlier this week at the Paley International Council Summit during a panel titled Source Code: How Hollywood and Videogames Are Leveling Up Together.</p>
<p>At some point during the conversation (transcribed by Inverse), Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/fallout-season-2-jonathan-nolan-interview-phil-spencer-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the outstandingly successful Fallout TV show might have actually benefited from not having another game launch in the same franchise at a similar time. The executive pointed out that the strategy is much more in-depth and long-term than merely using the adaptation to incentivize fans to buy a new game.</p>
<p><em>We didn't have a new game lined up for the launch. I actually think that gave us some creative liberty that we wouldn't have had if we tried to coordinate the production of two very different creative processes to land at the same time.</em></p>
<p><em>The play is much more long term than trying to drive some gift buying.</em></p>
<p>Fortunately, the days of tie-ins, when games were often rushed out of the door simply to be released alongside big-budget movies, are behind us. This has led not only to greater creative freedom but also to much better overall quality, as the creative process cannot be rushed. Plus, Fallout games did <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-popularity-got-bethesda-at-least-80-million-says-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get</a> a massive boost in sales anyway when the TV show dropped on Amazon Prime Video, even if they weren't newly released.</p>
<p>During the panel, Jonathan Nolan briefly discussed the show's <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second season</a>, saying it will rely even more on flashbacks than season one.</p>
<p><em>For the most part, in games, it’s a little harder grammatically to flashback, right? Some games can do it very well. There are a couple of memorable flashbacks in Call of Duty and other franchises. But for the most part, you kind of lock the user into that first-person point of view across both space and time. In a show, you can flashback and you can explore that world beforehand. It’s one of the things I love the most about season one and we will be doing more of that in season two.</em></p>
<p>Fallout TV season 2 will start filming soon in California.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GOG Preservation Program Aims to Make Your Games "Live Forever"]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced the GOG Preservation Program, an initiative that aims to keep certain games playable forever no matter whether their developers are still supporting them or not.</p>

<p>Over on the official Preservation Program <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the company warns that "time is erasing the games that shaped you", but that "we can fight back" through the program, which "ensures classic games remain playable on modern systems".</p>

<p>According to GOG, games that belong to the initiative will be DRM-free and eligible for "dedicated tech support", so even if something does go wrong, you'll be able to get help to fix it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gog-preservation-program-games.jpg?itok=8mrmRJ9h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gog-preservation-program-games.jpg?itok=jt7K9zVg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The GOG Preservation Program currently covers 100 games, and more are coming.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1856698605563793789" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup thread on X</a> (formerly Twitter), GOG says that the initiative features "updated, improved, or quality-tested builds", and that if you see the Preservation Program stamp on a game's GOG page, that means you'll be able to enjoy it on your PC "hassle-free".</p>

<p>Games currently included in the program include the likes of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-3-classic-gog-re-release" rel="nofollow">original three&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games</a>, the original&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>and its&nbsp;<em>Hellfire&nbsp;</em>expansion, and&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic 3</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Defiance</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, and more.</p>

<p>GOG cites the Video Game History Foundation as saying that "87% of games created before 2010 are inaccessible today", a sobering statistic that demonstrates just how necessary an initiative like this really is.</p>




<p>You'll also find an FAQ on the Preservation Program's website that provides more information about the initiative. It includes info like what to do when a stamped game doesn't work, as well as whether classic GOG games are necessarily worse than those included in the Program (the answer being no, of course).</p>

<p>GOG says it wants "hundreds of games" to come with the GOG Preservation Program stamp by the end of 2025, so you can expect lots more games to be added to this initiative as time goes on. Stay tuned for more.</p>
