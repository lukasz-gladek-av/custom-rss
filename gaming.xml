That total includes a base salary of $1.3 million, $25.7 million in stock awards, $2.8 million via a non-equity incentive plan, and $678,000 in other compensation that largely includes personal security benefits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a figure that made Wilson the highest-earner on the company's executive team by some margin. Notably, it also confirms Wilson netted a fairly substantial compensation increase on the $25.6 million he received the year prior.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But how does Wilson's compensation package compare to that of your median EA worker? According to EA's pay ratio breakdown for the 2025 fiscal year, the annual total compensation of its "median employee" was $117,302. Or, to put it another way, Wilson earned 260 times more than the median EA worker over the past 12 months.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a notable shift compared to the 2024 fiscal year, which saw the median EA employee earn $148,704. In short, that means EA has handed more cash to its top executive while paying workers less—at least according to the methodology applied by the publisher.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-11-peak-hits-new-heights-layoffs-all-the-way-down-and-union-workers-make-history" target="_self" data-discover="true">Patch Notes #11: Peak hits new heights, the layoffs keep on coming, and union workers make history</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Executive compensation rises at EA, but the median employee is earning less">Executive compensation rises at EA, but the median employee is earning less</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">EA uses a consistently applied compensation measure (CACM) to identify its median employee, which it explains includes full time, part-time, regular, and temporary staffers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company's CACM considers the base salary of workers as of March 15, 2025; discretionary bonuses paid to employees throughout the fiscal year; the grant date fair market value of equity awards granted to employees in fiscal year 2025; and exchange rates used to convert all non-US currencies into US dollars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Other than annualizing base salary for permanent employees, we did not make any compensation adjustments whether for cost of living or otherwise in the identification process," added the company, which noted it's definition of "median employee" has remained consistent since 2023.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Overall, all of the executives listed by EA received compensation increases of varying degrees in 2025.

<p>As reported by <a href="https://wccftech.com/teamgroup-launches-apex-sd7-1-microsd-express-card-for-nintendo-switch-2/amp/">WCCFTech</a>, the company has detailed its Apex SD7.1 range, which includes storage sizes from 128gb right up to 1TB. From the press release, here's some further info. Oh, and we do like the little controller design on these, we must say:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Next-Gen MicroSD Express Technology – Comprehensive Performance Upgrade</em></li>
<li><em>Fully Compatible with Nintendo Switch 2<sup>[4]</sup> with Broad Device Compatibility</em></li>
<li><em>Ultra-Fast Read/Write Speeds up to 800MB/s &amp; 700MB/s</em></li>
<li><em>Certified by SD Association’s SVP Program</em></li>
<li><em>Evolved High Capacity Storage Space of up to 1TB</em></li>
<li><em>Seamless 4K Recording to Capture Every Moment</em></li>
<li><em>Comprehensive Protection with Lifetime Warranty</em></li>
</ul>

<p>There's also a bunch of details about how these cards are "resistant to water, shock, X-rays, static electricity, and extreme temperatures, enabling stable performance even in harsh environments." So, a standard Saturday night out in Glasgow with your Switch 2 should be fine, then.</p>
<p>Sounds great! Now, how much are they and where can we get all the biggest ones before they sell out? Well, for now, we have no details on pricing, but you can head over to the TeamGroup's website, where they detail <a href="https://www.teamgroupinc.com/en/shop/united-kingdom/">stores that should stock the cards once they release</a>. We've had a quick look and we can see that Overclockers is one supplier for UK-based gamers, whilst in the US you have Amazon and Newegg amongst your choices.</p>
<p>We'll keep you updated as soon as we've got further details on release dates and that all-important pricing!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outer-worlds-2-won%E2%80%99t-let-you-respec-to-make-choices-truly-matter.1229844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Outer Worlds 2 may be a sequel, but it's definitely doing some things differently than its predecessor. One of those things is the ability for players to 'respec', that is to say, to change their allocation of perks, traits, and whatnot. The first game supported that, but the new game director Brandon Adler, who did not work on the original The Outer Worlds (but has credits in Obsidian RPGs like Neverwinter Nights 2, Alpha Protocol, Fallout: New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity and its sequel, and Avowed), has a different view on the matter. Speaking to RPG Site, he <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/17785-outer-worlds-2-director-interview-respec-rpg-choice-consequences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<p><em>We don't allow respec. Lots of people love respec… that is definitely one way you can go about things. I personally want the player to understand their choices are permanent – they matter – and then they think more about their choices. There's a lot of times where you'll see games where they allow infinite respec, and at that point I'm not really role-playing a character, because I'm jumping between -- well my guy is a really great assassin that snipes from long range, and then oh, y'know, now I'm going to be a speech person, then respec again.</em></p>
<p><em>For me, it's not wrong that people like to play like that. But I just like to make sure... Look, if we're going to do The Outer Worlds 2, I want to make sure that the role playing is really strong. I want to make sure that you're building your character and really doubling down - making sure that role-playing comes through the whole experience.</em></p>
<p>It's definitely an interesting view. I can see where he's coming from, although others will be disappointed by the lack of flexibility when building their new character. However, you are still allowed a bit of experimentation in the beginning, as you can still respect while in the tutorial area.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debut</a> on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X and will be available on Game Pass from day one.</p>

Yet despite regularly attracting over 150,000 concurrents, the game doesn't actually make any money, its developer has revealed in a recent interview.</p><p>Marcel Zurawka is the CEO and co-founder of Irox Games, the studio behind Bongo Cat. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steams-fourth-most-played-game-doesnt-really-make-any-money-and-its-developer-says-its-better-off-that-way" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Zurawka pulled back the curtain on the game's viral success, revealing that the high player numbers haven't translated to income for the studio.</p><p>"Some people said, 'Oh you're now rich.' That's bullshit. I didn't make it for the money at all," Zurawka said. "So the first month of March, we made $2000 net, after Steam cuts and everything." He shares all of Bongo Cat's monthly income--$4050 for April, the peak of the game's virality, $3800 in May, and down to $2800 for June so far.</p><p>"It's not even paying a developer for us," he adds. "If you just look at the numbers, it's actually losing us money in the end."</p><p>Bongo Cat is a free <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-idle-games/2900-5676/" data-ref-id="2900-5676">idle game</a> that's really more of a desktop app than an actual game. It puts a little cat on top of your task bar, who taps his paws on a counter for every key press and mouse click. Bongo Cat can discover different hats as the counter goes up, and these items can be traded on Community Marketplaces for real money--which has also resulted in elevated bot activity in the game.</p><p>Zurawka says that the money made from marketplace transactions is generally less than half of Bongo Cat's total income, with the bulk of its sales coming from paid cat skins available in the game as microtransactions.</p><p>Making money was never the goal of Bongo Cat, however. "I want to have it as an easy companion tool for everybody and don't want anyone to pay anything," Zurawka explains. "For me, it should always be as accessible as possible. I don't want to pay-wall anything."</p><p>The game's success has had a different kind of positive impact on the studio, however, acting as a marketing tool that's driven views and wishlists for the studio's next title in development, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/oku/" data-ref-id="5000-681663">Oku</a>.</p>

Sadly, the team explained they fell short of realising their vision and have now cancelled development on the long-gestating title.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/obituary-unity-senior-program-manager-andy-brammall-has-passed-away" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Unity senior program manager Andy Brammall has passed away</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Report: Still Wakes the Deep developer The Chinese Room is making layoffs"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-still-wakes-the-deep-developer-the-chinese-room-is-making-layoffs">Report: Still Wakes the Deep developer The Chinese Room is making layoffs</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">UK studio The Chinese Room has seemingly laid off a number of employees.

Microsoft seems to think the unique selling point here is the ability to stream compatible Xbox titles on a virtual screen that'll float around your living room like an audio-sensory blimp.

            <p>Leon Kennedy of the great hair and lovely jacket fame was once considered to be the protagonist of Resident Evil Requiem, however he is simply too much of a bad ass to be the main focus of a Resi game right now.</p>
<p>That is coming from game director Koshi Nakanishi, who in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hiC3qpghP0">Resident Evil Requiem video</a> said good ol' Leon simply isn't the kind of person who would "jump at something like a bucket falling", and therefore making a "horror game based around him" is tricky.</p>
<p>"No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing," Nakanishi said. "He's actually quite a bad match for horror."</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem will instead be headed up by FBI intelligence analyst Grace Ashcroft, who is described as "introverted and easily scared". The developer wanted to have a character who "experiences horror from the same perspective as the player". Grace - and by extension us as the player - will learn to overcome any fear she has as the game progresses.</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/26/resident-evil-requiem-producer-masato-kumazawa-qa/">PlayStation blog</a>, Resident Evil Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa said the aim of this release was to "focus on horror", and Grace is a "relatable" protagonist unlike series regulars Leon Kennedy and Chris Redfield.</p>
<p>"By making Grace someone who reflects the player's own vulnerability, we believe players will enjoy a gameplay experience filled with tension and immersion. When walking alone down a dark hallway, her breathing becomes erratic; when an enemy suddenly appears, she jumps in fright," Kumazawa explained.</p>
<p>"Grace is a character with a low tolerance for fear, but she grows throughout the story and eventually begins to confront various horrors with courage. By the time players finish the game, we're confident everyone will have come to love her!"</p>
<p>So, does this all mean Leon isn't going to show up at all in Resident Evil Requiem? Nah, I don't think so at all. Thankfully, there isn't too much longer before we find out, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">next entry in the Resi series releasing on 27th February next year</a>, across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam.</p>

Now, developer Sloclap is teaming up with Puma, one of the leading companies in footwear and sports apparel, to bring players some new gear options in this wildly popular soccer game.</p><p>The official teaser video for this collaboration only shows a few of Rematch's new items, including a Puma shirt, shoes, and shin guards.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP4gVa8v1ok" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DP4gVa8v1ok" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Apparently this is the only Puma-exclusive outfit currently in Rematch, but the announcement indicates that more Puma clothing options will be added over time. Sloclap also notes that "the in-game Rematch outfit consists of popular in-real-life collections mixed and matched to create a stylish outfit that lets you look as good as you play."</p><p>Over 1 million players sampled Rematch on its first day alone, including gamers who subscribe to Xbox <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass Ultimate</a>. The game depicts a potential future for soccer that's set four decades down the line. Instead of fielding a full team, there are arcade-style 5v5 matchups, with options for 3v3 and 4v4 battles as well. There have also been several tweaks to the game, including the removal of fouls, offsides, penalty kicks, draws, and shoot-outs. Even the ball is always in play because the entire game takes place inside a cage.</p><p>Although Rematch is available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-wont-have-cross-play-options-ready-in-time-for-launch/1100-6532448/" data-ref-id="1100-6532448">there aren't currently any options for cross-play</a>. Sloclap still intends to add that feature at a later date. Rematch players have recently discovered that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-players-discover-jumping-is-faster-than-running-but-dev-is-fixing-that-soon/1100-6532753/" data-ref-id="1100-6532753">jumping is faster than running</a> in this game, but Sloclap is already planning a fix for that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Remedy Entertainment <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1938250909865410867" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> via social media channels that its first multiplayer game, FBC: Firebreak, had surpassed one million players. At the same time, the Finnish developer acknowledged that it has <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-gets-update-1-2-as-remedy-promises-lots-more-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of work to do</a> to improve the game:</p>
<p><em>As of last night, we have surpassed 1 million players in FBC: Firebreak. This is a significant milestone, so thank you for playing from all of us at Remedy. We know there is still a lot of work ahead of us, and we are super-motivated about it. We have a lot of exciting things cooking for Firebreak players! More about that soon.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, the game may have reached one million players, but that's not saying too much since it has been available on the two primary subscription services, Sony's PlayStation Plus and Microsoft's Game Pass, since day one.</p>
<p>On Steam, the FBC: Firebreak peaked at 1,992 players ten days ago, but it's been getting lower and lower. Yesterday, the daily peak was 169 players. At the time of writing, there are 78 players playing the game via Valve's platform. User reviews are 'Mixed', too, with just 67% leaving a positive review.</p>
<p>Now, it is definitely a little early to sound the requiem for the game. We've seen several online games starting badly and managing to claw back their way to a decent, active user base. The reverse is also true, with some games starting off strong and then dying down like a flame.</p>
<p>Ultimately, any live service game lives or dies depending on the developer's ability to gather feedback, analyze it, and implement it properly. We'll see in the next few months how well Remedy fares in this regard, where so many developers have stumbled.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can read our full review of FBC: Firebreak <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, penned by Francesco De Meo.</p>

            <p>An uncomfortable question I've been asking myself this morning is, now that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>'s free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/824835185591719947">Siege mode update</a> is out, how much money I'd be convinced to part with if they, I dunno, added some Orks. Just a couple Orks. Few grots. Maybe a happy little squig. I ended up really enjoying the game after a rough start, and now this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> horde mode is here, I think it's time to just, you know, pretend the whole Tzeentch thing never happened. It's a horde mode. Add some horde enemies. Happy little squig, you know? Look at him bounce. Wheeeeee.</p>
<p>Anyway the question is uncomfortable because my answer is, depressingly, however much they asked for. What do you mean Kill Team: Typhon is out of stock everywhere? Yes, I haven't even opened the last two boxes, but I'm not sure what that has to do with anything. Here's a trailer anyway. Warning: it's got space marines taking themselves very seriously in it.</p>

<p>Siege is a three player co-op wavey hordey PvE mode with a sort of roguelike resource structure where you'll gain 'requisition points' from defeating waves, to spend on things like consumables and reinforcements between rounds. I find the idea of buying a McNugget box of Cadians to throw at the enemy very funny. I'm not sure how useful they'll be considering how squishy they are in campaign but, hey, <em>it's not like they've got anywhere else to be</em>. Save up enough, and you can even call in a dreadnought.</p>
<p>Every five waves, you'll go up against elites like Hellbrutes, Carnifexes, and everybody's fave, Neurothropes. You then keep going until you're dead, or "fulfill your duty to the Emperor, for only in death does duty end", as the update puts it. Do they ever like, just have a nice biscuit and play Scrabble for a bit?</p>
<p>The update also adds some more paid cosmetics and weapon skins and maybe a pubic wig styled after the Emperor's glorious flowing locks. You can read the <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/230-patch-notes-8-0">full 8.0 patch notes here</a>. Here's a few highlights:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>The Thunder Hammer being available for Bulwark</li>
<li>The possibility to turn off bots in private lobbies</li>
<li>RTAO and DLSS 4 support</li>
<li>You can now change the color of your class's weapons by playing siege Mode.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>"Space Marine 2 is an often-satisfying scrapper that has me convinced of 40K's merit as a crafting ground for excellent-looking environments and creatures," wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Brendy in his review</a>, "even if I'm not particularly moved by the bland character of Titus and his fellow Ultramarines". Personally, I've been really enjoying the PvE missions, especially this one where a random fellow marine and I shared the backstories that led to our undying hatred for the Tyranids.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first DLC expansion for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> will launch on 17th July, bringing Fantasy Finds into the exhibit halls with magical artefacts, class-based Fantasy Experts and a whole new realm for you to send them adventuring across.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum: Fantasy Finds | Coming 17th July" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GRgEvhYj1L0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fantasy Finds will add 40 new exhibits to discover, from the Teanie Kettle and Novel Wardrobe through to a Flying Carpet or a Mimic chest. With such wondrous magical marvels to behold, guests can easily get wrapped up in the action and become cursed, if you don’t maintain them properly.</p>
<p>That’s where Fantasy Experts come in, with Barbarian, Wizard, Rogue and Bard classes, each of which comes with specific stats. When sending them out on expeditions, you’ll have to juggle whether they’ve got enough Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence or Luck to overcome the challenges that await them, adding a little something extra to the expeditions found in the main game.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn’t do to just plop down your magic carpet in the middle of a boring hall. There’s 26 new decorations and utility items, interactive displays, banners, wallpapers, and floors to get the vibes just right for the three new guest archetypes that you’ll want to entertain. You can also buff museum staff with Mythical Gear to provide bonuses for protecting exhibits and giving a little more job security.</p>

<p>In the run up to the DLC release, Two Point Museum is 20% off in the Steam Summer Sale, while the DLC will have a 10% discount across PC, Xbox and PlayStation for its first week on sale.</p>
<p>Launching earlier this year, Two Point Museum is another great spin on the humorous management sim series. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/two-point-museum-review/">I said in our review</a>, “There’s great strides to allow for more customisation and creativity, a revamped structure to make revisiting levels more rewarding, and great variety in the core disciplines, but there’s also a few snags along the way and elements that could improved through updates and DLC.”</p>

			<p>Swedish game developer Fatshark <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-gets-new-arbites-class-via-dlc-and-free-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the first paid DLC for Warhammer 40K Darktide earlier this week, adding the Adeptus Arbites class. Today, the studio has proudly shared that the launch has been successful. Martin Wahlund, CEO and Co-Founder of Fatshark, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We more than doubled our estimated player goals on launch day alone. Thank you for making this launch one to remember!</em></p>
<p>The team also shared some fun stats. The Cyber-Mastiff companion has been petted more than 459,760 times as a reward for being a very good boy. Users have already killed 553,082,097 enemies with an Adeptus Arbites character. Their most used melee weapon so far is the Mk III Branx Pattern Arbites Shock Maul, used 969,008 times, while the most used ranged weapon is the Mk III Executioner Pattern Arbites Shotgun, used 1,157,103 times. The players' favorite ability is Break The Line, which was activated 715,525 times.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Darktide players can purchase the Arbites DLC for $11.99, although there's also a Deluxe Edition available at $18.99. This version includes a unique class outfit, a unique companion outfit, a portrait frame (this one can be equipped by characters of all classes), and four weapon skins.</p>
<p>Alongside the DLC, Fatshark also released a free update that introduced a more structured narrative path to ease new players into the game. The mission board system was revamped, too, increasing the number of mission options for all characters. The patch also increased the maximum number of Operatives to eight, as was the maximum number of weapon loadouts. Fatshark also added around 900 new banter conversations between characters.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, Darktide was not the only Warhammer 40K game to launch new content focused on the Adeptus Arbites. Owlcat's Rogue Trader cRPG also just released the Lex Imperialis expansion, introducing this very class of enforcers of the Emperor's justice, including a new companion, Solomorne Anthar.</p>

It’s not that hot.”</p><p>The “$100 million bonus” headline has rightfully become a meme on social media since Altman said the number on his brother’s podcast. “What Sam neglects to mention is that he’s countering all these offers, creating a small market for a very, very small number of people who are for senior, senior leadership roles” in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/687173/inside-mark-zuckerbergs-ai-hiring-spree">new superintelligence AI team Meta is building</a>, Bosworth told Meta employees today. “That is not the general thing that’s happening in the AI space. And of course, he’s not mentioning what the actual terms of the offer are. It’s not [a] sign-on bonus. It’s all these different things.”</p><p>Bosworth then referenced recent stories about a handful of OpenAI researchers who are joining Meta and said there are “quite a few more in the pipeline that I can’t announce or share right now.”</p><p>“Sam is known to exaggerate, and in this case, I know exactly why he’s doing it, which is because we are succeeding at getting talent from OpenAI,” he said. “He’s not very happy about that.” </p><p>At the Thursday meeting, there were many employees present from the company’s engineering “bootcamp,” a multi-week onboarding program that assigns new hires to various teams. “For all the new bootcampers here, you didn’t screw up,” Bosworth said to laughs and claps from the audience. “You made a great decision. Comp is right where it should be.”</p><p>Bosworth wasn’t the only Meta exec to mention OpenAI during the internal meeting. CPO <strong>Chris Cox </strong>also acknowledged that, while Meta AI has one billion monthly users, engagement “is not nearly as deep as the way that people are using ChatGPT.” The standalone Meta AI app has only 450,000 daily users, he told employees, and “a lot of those folks” are using it to manage their Ray-Ban Meta glasses. </p><p>“We are not going to go right after ChatGPT and try and do a better job with helping you write your emails at work,” Cox said. “We need to differentiate here by not focusing obsessively on productivity, which is what you see Anthropic and OpenAI and Google doing. We’re going to go focus on entertainment, on connection with friends, on how people live their lives, on all of the things that we uniquely do well, which is a big part of the strategy going forward.”</p><p>Meta declined to comment on the internal meeting. </p><div><p id="iyo-versus-io"><h2><strong>Iyo versus io</strong></h2></p></div><p>When I spoke with <strong>Jason Rugolo</strong> on Thursday, I wanted to understand why he is suing the most influential company in tech. </p><p>Rugolo’s AI device startup, Iyo, recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690858/jony-ive-openai-sam-altman-ai-hardware">won a temporary restraining order</a> that bars OpenAI from using the “io” brand for <strong>Sam Altman’s </strong>new hardware division with <strong>Jony Ive</strong>. In response, Altman <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/692840/sam-altman-io-trademark-battle-iyo-emails">took to his X account</a> to suggest that Rugolo filed his trademark lawsuit because OpenAI refused to invest in or buy Iyo, which is gearing up to release its first AI-powered, in-ear headphones later this year. </p><p>Rugolo acknowledges (and documents submitted to the court confirm) that he pitched Altman on investing multiple times. He also discussed an acquisition with io team members this year. Still, he says his lawsuit isn’t part of some revenge crusade, but rather intended to eliminate any confusion between his forthcoming <a href="https://x.company/projects/iyo/">Iyo One headphones</a> and Altman’s io.</p><p>Trademark lawsuits are a dime a dozen, but this one has broken through for good reason. There’s intense interest in what Altman and Ive are building (the first device <a href="https://www.theverge.com/openai/691737/openai-jony-ive-chatgpt-io-ai-device-wearable-headphone-lyo-lawsuit">apparently won’t be an “in-ear” product or a “wearable”</a>), and the case is a Rorschach test for how you feel about Altman, who is undoubtedly polarizing.</p><p>“I had a massive change in opinion on the guy,“ Rugolo tells me of Altman. “While I was meeting with them, I was under the spell of Sam Altman being a great entrepreneur and a really interesting person. That broke pretty instantly after their public announcement [of io].” </p><p>“<em>Am I getting screwed here?</em>” Rugolo recalls thinking. “When I talked to him on the phone and he made a Sopranos threat to sue me, I was just like, ‘Alright, this guy is a bad dude.’” Now, he says that Altman is trying to “manipulate the arguments in the public sphere” and “make me look like a money grubber or a sore loser, and I just don’t think it’s gonna work.”</p><p>“This is a baseless trademark dispute and not a case about stolen ideas or technology,” OpenAI spokesperson <strong>Kayla Wood</strong> says in a statement shared with me. “Iyo demoed a product in May 2025 that didn’t function properly or meet our standards in hopes that we’d acquire Iyo. We passed. Jason Rugolo was also well aware of the io name and never raised concerns before our announcement.”</p><p>Thanks to the millions of dollars he recently raised from his manufacturer, Pegatron, and a billionaire whom he refuses to name, Rugolo says Iyo has enough runway to last it through the end of 2026. When I ask if the device he teased in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L61Kbo3y218">viral TED talk</a> last year is indeed shipping later this year, he says he’s about to fly to China to “basically be living at the factory.”</p><p>While he’s ready to go through the legal discovery process and take his case to trial, he hopes that OpenAI will “put their guns away” and “complete like grown-ups on product.” </p><p>“I will meet them in the market,” he tells me. “We will both try to launch stuff that’s really cool and see if we can serve our customers. They’ll just compete fairly and stop using the name. They have some of the best designers in the world, apparently. Think of a new name. You just can’t use the one that I told you about already, and that I’ve been using since 2019.”</p><div><p id="ai-is-coming-for-games"><h2><strong>AI is coming for games</strong></h2></p></div><div><p>So far, Runway is known for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/679312/runway-ceo-cris-valenzuela-ai-video-copyright-hollywood-film-youtube">bringing generative AI to Hollywood</a>. Now, the $3 billion startup is setting its sights on the gaming industry.</p></div><p>This week, I was granted access to a new interactive gaming experience that Runway plans to make available to everyone as soon as next week, according to CEO <strong>Cristóbal Valenzuela</strong>. The consumer-facing product is currently quite barebones, with a chat interface that supports only text and image generation, but Valenzuela says that generated video games are coming later this year. He says that Runway is also in talks with gaming companies about both using its technology and accessing their datasets for training.</p><p>Based on his recent conversations, Valenzuela believes the gaming industry is in a similar position to Hollywood when it was first introduced to generative AI. There was considerable resistance, but over time, AI has been gradually adopted in more areas of the production process. Valenzuela says Amazon’s recent show, <em>House of David</em>, was made in part with Runway’s technology, and that his company is working with “pretty much every major studio” and “most of the Fortune 100 companies.” </p><p>“If we can help a studio make a movie 40 percent faster, then we’re probably gonna be able to help developers of games make games faster,” he says. “They’re waking up, and they’re moving faster than I would say the studios were moving two years ago.”</p><p>Naturally, I couldn’t let Valenzuela get off our Zoom call without asking him about his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-23/meta-held-deal-talks-with-startup-runway-in-ai-recruiting-push">recent acquisition talks</a> with Zuckerberg: “I think we have more interesting intellectual challenges being independent, and remaining independent for now.” </p><div><p id="elsewhere-in-openai"><h2><strong>Elsewhere in OpenAI</strong></h2></p></div><p><strong>No one knows what AGI actually means.</strong> That much is clear from this excellent <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-microsoft-duel-agi-high-stakes-negotiation?rc=v4bmzs">deep dive from <em>The Information</em></a> into Microsoft’s deal with OpenAI. There has been a lot of good reporting on the negotiations between the two companies, but this piece is the most comprehensive and detailed I’ve seen yet. It states that Microsoft will no longer receive exclusive access to OpenAI’s IP if it achieves “sufficient AGI,” which is contractually defined as when OpenAI’s board determines that the AI “has the capability to generate” the maximum profits its investors are entitled to. Amazingly, OpenAI doesn’t have to actually generate these profits. </p><p><strong>Two under-the-radar deals:</strong> Although they haven’t garnered many headlines, OpenAI announced an interesting partnership and a small acquisition this week. The first is a <a href="https://www.appliedintuition.com/news/applied-intuition-openai">deal with Applied Intuition</a> to “advance next-generation, AI-powered experiences in vehicles.” The second is the acquisition of the small team at <a href="https://www.crossingminds.com/">Crossing Minds</a>, an AI startup that helped e-commerce companies offer more personalized product recommendations. “Personally, joining OpenAI’s research team to focus on agents and information retrieval is a unique honor,” Crossing Minds founder <strong>Alexandre Eobicque</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7343807373683113985/">writes</a>. “These are precisely the problems I’ve always been passionate about: how systems learn, reason, and retrieve knowledge at scale, in real-time.”</p><div><p id="personnel-log"><h2><strong>Personnel log</strong></h2></p></div><p><em>Some interesting career moves in tech:</em></p><div><ul><li><span>The three founders of OpenAI’s research office in Zurich, <strong>Lucas Beyer</strong>, <strong>Alexander Kolesnikov</strong>, and <strong>Xiaohua Zhai</strong>, <a href="https://x.com/giffmana/status/1938299990922674352">confirmed</a> they are joining Meta.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After half a dozen hours in the earliest moments of the upcoming pirate RPG Sea of Remnants, I was left with tons of questions about how this one will ultimately turn out, whether it was the currently barebones turn-based combat system, the convoluted labyrinth of vendors and upgrade paths that reminded me a bit of an MMO, or the story and dialogue that were sometimes difficult to follow given this early build’s lack of English voice acting or reliable subtitles. But one thing that was never in doubt throughout all of that is just how much this colorful, over-the-top adventure is already absolutely dripping with style that’s so unbelievably hard to look away from, it made me eager to see more in spite of those rough edges. Seriously, the cartoonish characters, exaggerated (and often hilarious) animations, and gorgeous menus are some of the coolest I’ve seen since Persona 5, and even when I didn’t understand everything that was happening, I often couldn’t help but smile ear-to-ear. The version I played is so early and unfinished, it’s still pretty hard to tell if this will deliver in plenty of other areas, from gameplay to technical stability, but there’s plenty of time before the unspecific 2026 launch window to iron all that out, and it already has so much unique charm that I’m officially adding this one to my list of games to follow closely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before I get into what I liked and didn’t like in my time with Sea of Remnants, it’s worth mentioning again that what I played appeared to be an extremely early build that was quite unfinished and prone to all sorts of bugs and rocky technical performance. I’m used to playing unfinished products months and sometimes years before they see the light of day, but even by that measure, this one felt especially under construction. Menus and dialogue were riddled with placeholder text, crashes and bugs were quite frequent, and the entire thing hadn’t been optimized for non-Mandarin speakers like myself, which often left things lost in translation. For all of these reasons and more, it was more than a little hard to tell how things will pan out, both from a technical perspective and where gameplay is concerned, since many ideas were clearly extremely unbaked. Keep that in mind as you watch this video.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What I do know about Sea of Remnants is that it’s playing in a lot of the same space as Sea of Thieves, with open-world high seas to explore as a pirate crew and islands to visit, filled with loot waiting to be plundered. But it also distinguishes itself with unexpected elements, like the turn-based combat that happens when you’re ashore, or the RPG/MMO mechanics that accompany it – to the point where I’m not even sure what odd blend of genres the final product is shooting for, and every 30 minutes came with another surprise that added to that confusion, like how, late in the demo, I learned there were hundreds of recruitable companions I could take with me on voyages and build bonds with. And this is all without having been able to see any of the planned multiplayer components in action, as this will all apparently be taking place in an online world where you can interact with other pirate captains.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m not even sure what odd blend of genres the final product is shooting for.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, a lot of the ideas Sea of Remnants threw at me were pretty hard to get a sense for in this build, like the turn-based combat, where my buccaneer crew and I crossed swords and blunderbusses with rival skallywags and local fauna. While beautifully animated, the bits I played were also extremely oversimplified, either due to the section I played being pretty early on in the adventure, or just because it was quite clearly still a work in progress. As a big fan of turn-based battles, I’m hopeful they can flesh out some of the mechanics here to reach the heights of some of my recent favorites like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 or Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, but for now it mostly reminded me of a very stripped-down version of Persona 5.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that, no matter how unfinished any aspect of Sea of Remnants was, it was consistently and without exception one of the most interesting games I’ve played in a long time. The humanoid characters (all of which are puppets for some reason) have a ton of personality despite their wooden faces, and their exaggerated animations really cracked me up. And despite having Sea of Thieves pirate vibes, I rarely felt like I knew what was going to happen next, like how after beating a giant ape boss on an island and getting back on my boat to go home, I suddenly found myself under attack by that same monkey out for revenge, who now captained his own vessel and blasted me with cannon fire. Then, even though I sent him to Davy Jones’ locker, my ship was sunk moments later anyway in the most silly cutscene imaginable. I still feel like I don’t really understand what it will feel like to play the final product, as it swings so wildly between juggling an inventory of loot, blasting cannons on a boat, and choosing between very confusing dialogue options with various party members, but even though playing through that confusion was often a little unintuitive, I certainly can’t say it wasn’t interesting – quite the opposite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also really nice to see such a unique setting, because although there’s a lot of typical piracy shenanigans you might expect, there are also really strange concepts peppered throughout that kept me on my toes, like how my journey started out with me finding the moon buried beneath the sea (!?), or how the marionette characters apparently lose their memory whenever they’re destroyed on an adventure, but always find themselves back inside the main island of Orbtopia to begin again. There’s also a really distinct punk vibe throughout the entire world, as everything is covered with graffiti and many of the characters act like reckless teenagers who cut class to cosplay as mischievous pirates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big question with Sea of Remnants is if its unmistakably cool presentation and interesting hodgepodge of ideas can actually come together into something coherent, and I truly feel no closer to answering that after more than six hours with it. For now, it’s definitely interesting and distinctive enough for me to anxiously wait to see more, but we’ll likely need to wait a fair bit longer before we can get a better feel for how it’s shaping up – especially when it comes to technical performance and the online aspects that were completely absent from this build.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The big question with Sea of Remnants is if its unmistakably cool presentation and interesting hodgepodge of ideas can actually come together into something coherent.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I can definitely see the beginnings of a vision here though, where the punk aesthetic and killer art style play well with over-the-top ship combat and slower, more tactical turn-based battles on foot to create something really special. Plus, we can always use more pirate fantasy in our lives, and I can already tell that this goofy take on the genre will bring a very fresh perspective. Granted, I have no idea how they’ll make online multiplayer, where friends would presumably come along for the ride, work with the turn-based combat and NPC party members. But hey – if they manage to pull it off it sounds like it’d be awesome, and if they don’t at least it’ll be something unique nonetheless.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/sea-of-remnants-preview-sea-of-thieves-piracy-meets-persona-5-stylishness-but-is-it-more-than-skin-deep]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's called '<strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dear-me-i-was">Dear me, I was...</a></strong>' and will launch on the eShop "this Summer". It's an interactive "textless" adventure and is being led by the director Maho Taguchi and art director Taisuke Kanasaki (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/another_code_recollection">Another Code</a> / <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/hotel_dusk_room_215">Hotel Dusk</a>).</p>
<p>Taguchi mentions how this is a game "designed for adult women" aiming to help "you feel a bit more positive after playing".</p>
<p>The title also uses an animation technique known as rotoscoping. Here's a bit more about this from the official description, along with the story:</p>

The journey to release the curse begins!<br>More information to come!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“The game market is tough now,” said Arc System Works chief creative officer Daisuke Ishiwatari during today’s Arc System Works Showcase announcing the project. “To overcome that Arc System Works has launched a new project. It’s an action game project… Let me explain. Arc System Works is a fighting game company. I’m sure most of you recognize us as so. However, to achieve a new brand, where we are known for quality mid-range <a title="Genres > Action [2,837 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a>, we decided to establish a new pillar outside of fighting games.</p><p>“You might be wondering why I specifically use the term mid-range. There are many reasons, but one is that even creators themselves can enjoy striving for their dreams. In recent years, with AAA blockbusters and excellent indie titles gaining popularity, it has become extremely risky for companies to create new series. This has led to dwindling opportunities for young creators to have their own projects. We feel the need to focus our efforts towards the future a decade from now, such as to build stable development schemes and to accumulate technology and know-how.</p><p>“Our flagship title <em>Guilty Gear</em> has now become a million selling copy work—but its very first installment was a small-scale project. From there, over many long years, we built a foundation that could guarantee a certain level of quality in the fighting games genre. Similarly we hope to take a step with this project that will eventually lead to bigger dreams. And precisely because they are mid-range titles, this will create many opportunities to produce many titles and cultivate many creators, and we hope that will become one of the future values of Arc System Works.”</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="DAMON and BABY | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBEFzd4zr-M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/arc-system-works-announces-action-game-damon-and-baby]]></content:encoded>

Select your captain from Mushroom Kingdom mainstays like Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Wario and Waluigi, and jump into a bevy of modes like Grudge Match, Cup Battles and Custom Battles. In this arena, matches unfold with white-hot speed and intensity, and with no referees to dish out penalties, the only thing containing the mayhem is the electrified fence that surrounds the field!</p><p>Plus, obtain familiar items, like shells and mushrooms, to add to the chaos and give yourself a boost during matches. But the real key to winning is the Super Strike: a powerful shot that can net you two points at once! Hone your techniques, deal out big hits and even unleash Chain Chomp onto the field as you aim to score a goal—and crush the opposition. With simple controls, anyone can hit the pitch while playing solo, and in local1 and online multiplayer matches for up to four players.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a trailer below.</p><h2><span><em>Super Mario Strikers</em> Trailer</span></h2><!-- AD: content -->

			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omnl-EMxfYE">Capcom's Spotlight Showcase 2025</a> event featured several of the games in the studio's portfolio, but it spent more time showing off <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> latest free title update than it did anything else.</p>
<p>The second free title update for Monster Hunter Wilds will be available on <strong>Monday, June 30, 2025</strong>, adding two monsters to the hunt. The long-awaited Lagiacrus, and Seregios, from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate.</p>
<p>Capcom also revealed a roadmap for more updates coming later this year, with a seasonal event coming in July that'll last from July 23 to August 6, and a Arch-tempered monster, Uth Duna, that gets introduced on July 30 with its own equipment rewards and challenge questline. That'll run until August 20.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>On August 27, a Fender collaboration will arrive, letting players shred in between hunts, which will land just ahead of the third free title update, which is due to arrive sometime in&nbsp;<strong>late September 2025.</strong></p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched at the end of February 2025 and was instantly one of the best-selling games of 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-10-million-units-establishing-first-month-sales-record-for-capcom/">setting records for Capcom</a>. It's also arguably one of the best games in the Monster Hunter series, if not the best one so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">When Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed it</a>, he said that Monster Hunter Wilds is "<em>the natural evolution of the formula introduced in Monster Hunter World, and one of the best entries in the series.</em>"</p>
<p>If you've been wanting to jump into Monster Hunter Wilds, but haven't had the chance yet, it's on sale for the first time this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-summer-sale-2025-is-officially-here-with-deals-on-indiana-jones-monster-hunter-wilds-oblivion-remastered-and-more/">as part of the Steam Summer Sale 2025</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is not having a particularly good time of it over on Steam; thanks to ongoing performance issues and a perceived lack of meaningful content updates, players numbers are routinely dipping below those of the now seven-year-old Monster Hunter World, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">recent reviews have tipped the game into Overwhelmingly Negative territory</a>. Amid all this, Capcom has now outlined Monster Hunter Wilds' next free Title Update, but whether it'll do enough to shift player sentiment remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds' free Title Update 2 officially launches next Monday, 30th June, bringing with it two much-loved monsters from previous games. You've got the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-content-update-detailed-ahead-of-next-weeks-release">heavily teased return</a> of Monster Hunter 3's serpentine leviathan Lagiacrus, for starters, alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-4-ultimate">Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</a>'s spiny aerial nuisance Seregios, last seen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>'s Sunbreak expansion. For some reason, Seregios immediately brings back memories of chef outfits, but it's entirely possible that's just delirium setting in.
</p>
<p>
Both beasts show off their Wilds' reimaginings in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAf4Z4rCpK4">Capcom's newly revealed Title Update 2 trailer</a>, and Lagiacrus fans may be pleased to know it returns with its underwater combat segments intact, kind of. Capcom describes the underwater portions of Lagiacrus' fight as "accents" (the majority of the battle plays out on land), and while players can't freely swing their weapons while submerged, there <em>are</em> some special actions they can do to add a bit of pizzazz to the encounter. To which I say, Capcom, bring back swimming properly, you cowards.

Lagiacrus and Seregios feature their own armour and weapons to craft, and they'll appear as 8-star tempered monsters once unlocked. Title Update 2 also promises one additional monster - an arch-tempered version of the delightfully billowy Uth Duna - who'll appear as a limited-time event quest for players at HR50 or above, between 30th July and 20th august.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the update promises several new features. There's new layered weapons, new functionality for photo mode - including brightness settings, new filter effects, and the ability to hide specific characters - plus the option to swap handlers, replacing Alma with Erik. Players can also select which support hunters they want to take out on quests, including new support hunter Mina, a Vespae Unit veteran who's armed with a sword and shield.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, there's talk of new events quests enabling players to forge special armour, a new challenge quest featuring Mizutsune, plus that arch-tempered Uth Duna challenge quest. And from 23rd July to 6th August, players can participate in the latest Festival of Accord seasonal event, Flamefete, which brings a range of summer-inspired rewards.
</p>
<p>
And that all leads up to perhaps the weirdest bit of Capcom's latest showcase: a collaboration event with guitar maker Fender (thre's apparently a real-life Monster Hunter guitar in Japan) running from 27th August to 24th September. This gives hunters a chance to unlock the brilliant/ludicrous Fender gesture, enabling them to rock out and play one of the classic Monster Hunter themes while their Palico pal air guitars merrily alongside them.
</p>
<p>
Will that be enough to placate players increasingly frustrated with Capcom's approach to Monster Hunter Wilds? It remains to be seen, but the publisher has at least confirmed a third Title Update - featuring an additional monster and a new seasonal event - arrives this autumn. "I think Capcom has what it takes to turn the fortunes of Monster Hunter Wilds around," Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">Dom Peppiatt wrote recently</a>. "It took seven patches for the publisher to figure out the issues with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-guides-tips-tricks-9422">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> back in 2024, and I'm just hoping Capcom can work that same engineering magic with Monster Hunter Wilds before it's too late."

<p>Capcom has also provided an update about the paid 'Outfit 4' content – confirming seven characters will be getting these outfits first, with the rest of the roster to follow. All of this content is in the "final stages of tweaking" and the team will release Sagat gameplay at a later date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Capcom's Spotlight Showcase 2025 event started off with a deep dive into <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/pragmata/en-us/">Pragmata</a>, showing off more of its hacking-shooting-puzzle gameplay and talking a little more in-depth about the story between the android girl Diana and Hugh Williams, an astronaut who ends up on the Moon as part of an investigative team trying to discover why this lunar base has gone silent.</p>
<p>Williams is described as a sometimes sarcastic, though kind man, while Diana is "<em>an android with a heart</em>" and a "<em>curious and enigmatic android</em>."</p>
<p>The combat system works in two parts. First, you'll always need Diana to 'hack' your enemy's armor, otherwise you won't do any damage. Once you've completed the short puzzle of connecting two green nodes on a five-by-five square while passing through as many blue nodes as you can, Hugh is then able to engage in the ranged third-person combat.</p>
<p><iframe title="Capcom Spotlight | 6.26.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omnl-EMxfYE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Every encounter in Pragmata is essentially a race at the beginning, with you trying to complete the puzzle before the enemy is able to slowly walk to you and do damage, while you try to finish the puzzle to stun them briefly and gain the upper hand. Once you're dealing with multiple enemies at a time, it's about managing who to take down first and how to keep them from overwhelming you quickly.</p>
<p>Graciously, you do also seem to have a solid maneuverability move set, with thrusters that are helpful in combat and when platforming around the lunar station.</p>
<p>We still don't have a proper release date for Pragmata, as the game is still set to release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC,<a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/"> sometime in 2026</a>. Capcom did however confirm that players will be able to try the game themselves if they're in attendance at Gamescom 2025.</p>
<p>Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto got to try out Pragmata at this year's<a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-hands-on-sgf-2025-demo/"> Summer Game Fest 2025 event</a>, and though it was just a short demo, Kai was already able to see the potential of the game's combat.</p>
<p>"<em>In practice, it all flows very intuitively. The actual hacking minigame is about moving through a grid, bypassing traps, collecting nodes, and targeting the enemy core.</em>"</p>
