            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/study-shows-that-gamers-love-strong-and-sexy-female-characters.1027617/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/study-gaming-strong-and-sexy-characters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Teresa Lynch, a professor at Ohio State University, has completed and published a study that examines how elements of sexualisation and <strong>strength </strong>impact our view of female video game characters. In a two-pronged study that put 677 participants to the test, Lynch and her team assembled a series of female characters and had users study and play as them for a set time.</p>



<p>These female characters were created with four categories in mind, all of which were centred around various levels of sexualisation and strength – for instance, a highly sexualised but weak character versus a low sexualised but very strong character.</p>



<p>The results of the study were intriguing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-mommy-theory">The Mommy Theory</h2>



<p>Think of all the users who fell in love with Resident Evil Village’s Alcina Dimitrescu despite her towering size and imposing, terrifying presence, and you’ll effectively arrive at the outcome of this study help by the Ohio State University.</p>



<p>Teresa Lynch’s team created four characters on Soulcalibur VI, focusing on their breast size, hip-to-waist ratio, clothing, weapons, and musculation. They were created to specifically fulfil four roles. Speaking on the reasons behind the study in the first place, Lynch said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s important to understand how gender socialisation and prejudice like sexism inform video game development and player experiences. </p>



<p>Sexism pervades gaming. For example, game content overwhelmingly features male characters to the exclusion of central female or gender minoritised characters. Games that do feature female or gender minoritised characters often unfavorably stereotype and objectify these groups.</p>



<p>I want to know more about why, when, and how these kinds of outcomes happen.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To that end, a two-pronged experiment was produced. First, the team had 239 students view and rate these four characters, indicating which they preferred based on appearance alone. Per expectations, users accurately rated the characters based on their level of sexualisation, while noting that the ‘tougher-looking’ characters appeared more formidable.</p>



<p>Simple.</p>



<p>That’s where things took a turn, though. The participants in the study, most of whom were female, determined that a character with high sexualisation and high strength was <strong>more sexualised </strong>than characters just designed as ‘eye candy’. It was concluded that strength in a sexualised female character only serves to accentuate their attractiveness, rather than degrading it.</p>



<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00936502241279625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The study</a> also showed that female participants were less favourable to the strictly sexualised characters and preferred those with a combination of good looks and a strong build.</p>



<p>Mommy? Sorry.</p>



<h2 id="h-part-two">Part Two</h2>



<p>In the second part of the study (which was picked up first <a href="https://www.psypost.org/new-research-on-female-video-game-characters-uncovers-a-surprising-twist/#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by PsyPost</a>), 438 students were put to the test, playing as one of the four characters for ten minutes on Soulcalibur VI.</p>



<p>The participants fed back that playing as a strong female lead aligned them less with ‘stereotypical femininity’, and it also made them feel as though the character was more competent. In the gender split, female participants gravitated more towards the sexualised characters, while male participants leant more into the ‘strong but less sexualised’ creations.</p>



<p>One of the most damning findings from the study was that while females bagged on sexy female characters, they were more likely to prefer playing as them when it came down to the live test session. </p>



<p>In a parting statement, Lynch said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re also very interested in understanding the positive impact of female characters on players, not just the drawbacks or negative side. People play video games because they like them and find the experiences entertaining, but also because they have meaningful experiences. We’re exploring that side of things because it’s all part of the same question.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What do you think? Do you lean more towards sexualised female characters like Stellar Blade’s Project Eve, or are you more inclined to pick a physically imposing female character like The Last of Us Part II’s Abby?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix Invests In Using AI To Build Games After Closing Down a Studio]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-invest-ai-gaming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix-invests-in-using-ai-to-build-games-after-closing-down-a-studio.1027614/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-invest-ai-gaming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In October, Netflix shut down ‘Blue’, an internal studio dedicated to developing games for the streaming platform. This studio was led by former Blizzard talent and was tasked with creating AAA games, but before producing anything and mere months after a recruitment spree, the studio was shuttered by Netflix.</p>



<p>In recent months, Netflix’s success in the gaming space has come from porting third-party games onto the platform – like the GTA Trilogy. Netflix said at the time that it’s not turning its back on gaming, but it has now been confirmed it’s going in a different direction entirely.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-transformational-technology">‘Transformational Technology’</h2>



<p>In a post on LinkedIn, Netflix’s new VP of GenAI for Games, Mike Verdu, revealed his fresh placement and explained why this is ‘the future of gaming’.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At long last, I am ready to talk about what I’m doing next: I am working on driving a “once in a generation” inflection point for game development and player experiences using generative AI. This transformational technology will accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Verdu explained that GenAI ‘is the next challenge’ on the road to unlocking the ‘unlimited potential and rapid pace of innovation’. He views generative AI as a wave that’s going to hit the gaming industry with an impressive force, despite many viewing ‘this technology with fear’.</p>



<p>He also offered a harsh line against those doubting Netflix’s presence in the gaming space:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media about the changes in Netflix Games. What you’ve seen over the last several months was actually a planned transition.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Unfortunately for Verdu, the comments <a href="http://linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on his post on LinkedIn</a> were rampant with those lashing out against this business decision. The justification for scrapping a studio and laying off workers to invest heavily in GenAI just isn’t there for some. It’s not the first time we’ve seen this in the last year or two, though – but it never gets any easier a pill to swallow.</p>



<p>One user wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>I appreciate your effort to quell speculation regarding Netflix’s changes in its gaming division, but recent events deserve a critical look.</p><p>The closure of Team Blue after only two years, without releasing a single game and with the departure of key figures like Chacko Sonny and Joseph Staten, suggests a lack of strategic consistency.</p><p>Additionally, while generative AI holds potential, many perceive its current use as more of a marketing tactic than genuine innovation.</p><p>In the context of layoffs and restructuring, the community expects tangible outcomes rather than just bold headlines. I trust that these challenges will lead to a more solid and demonstrable plan in the future.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>Other titanic developers, such as Electronic Arts, have spoken boldly about the future of AI in game development. There are some predictions among executives that AI will soon be responsible for an extremely high percentage of development activities, which paints a scary picture for those on the outside looking in.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/slitterhead-how-to-get-rarity-edo-to-unlock-hidden-cave-re-2nd-loop-mission/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/slitterhead-%E2%80%93-how-to-get-rarity-edo-to-unlock-hidden-cave-re-2nd-loop-mission.1027611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/slitterhead-how-to-get-rarity-edo-to-unlock-hidden-cave-re-2nd-loop-mission/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Much of the Slitterhead gameplay revolves around Rarities, gifted humans who can achieve higher attunement with the mysterious Night Owl and maintain their consciousness while being possessed, which allows them to use some unique fighting styles and skills that can make your life easier against all sorts of opponents.</p>
<p>Unlock new Rarities is also a necessity to proceed in the main campaign, as you will need the help of specific characters to continue Night Owl's war against Slitterheads. The first time this happens is right after starting to investigate a religious cult that seems to be bringing together monsters and humans, and you will need Edo's help to proceed in this investigation.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241031011038_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Once you are notified of needing a new Rarity to proceed through the story, play the Parasite Mission 2nd round mission again. At the start of the mission, proceed normally until you reach the main street. Walk around until you hear two NPCs talking about a stray dog and a homeless man. Continue past these two characters, and you will find the stray dog, who is the same one you have met at the very start of the game. Possess it, follow the scent like you did at the beginning of the game, and you will eventually reach the homeless man named Edo. Possess the character, defeat the Slitterhead, and he will join Night Owl in his quest. Quit the mission, and the Hidden Cave RE 2nd Loop mission will be unlocked.</p>
<p>Besides being required to proceed through the story, Edo is an extremely strong Rarity to use if you enjoy fighting Slitterheads head-on, as he is a close-range fighter that can dish quite a bit of damage, deflect attacks automatically, perform a quick dodging maneuver, and increase attack power with his skills. He may not be a looker, but he sure knows how to deal with enemies!</p>

			<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/slitterhead-qa-with-keiichiro-toyama-discussing-gameplay-mechanics-old-gen-release-and-silent-hill-series-revival/">Slitterhead</a>, Hyoki and his Rarities will have to fight a variety of enemies of the supernatural kind, but there will be times when regular old humans will get in their way, leaving them no choice but to use their special powers to take them out and continue their hunt for the vicious Slitterheads. These humans, however, are very different from the Civilians that Hyoki can possess and will fight back with everything they got.</p>
<p>During the Oppressive Force mission, you will encounter members of the S.P.E.U., a military unit out to destroy not only Slitterheads but also Hyoki. Dealing with them is considerably different than dealing with the monstrosities you have fought before, and you will have to adapt to the situation and use completely different strategies.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241031121432_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For starters, always make sure to take advantage of any cover you can find.&nbsp; If you're unsure where they are, just press the LB button to slow time and survey your immediate vicinities, possibly possessing any Civilian or Rarity placed near covers. The members of the S.P.E.U. tend to attack relentlessly, so if you're caught outside of cover, you will receive a lot of damage.</p>
<p>As for taking these enemies out, you can employ a variety of different strategies, which depend on the Rarities you have brought to the mission and the Passive Skills you have learned. A very effective strategy involves two of Alex's unique skills: Blood Well and Time Bomb. The first is used to draw together every character in a certain radius in a single point. At this point, possess one of the attracted Civilians, use the Time Bomb skill, and possess another character far from the one that activated the skill to watch them explode and damage everyone in their vicinity. If you bring Anita, you will have no lack of Civilians to blow up, thanks to her Devil's Scent skill. The War Cry skill also works quite well with this strategy, as this Civilian Skill attracts the attention of any nearby enemy.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241031122458_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you want to make dealing with humans armed to the teeth in Slitterhead even easier, you should have one of your Rarities learn the Possession Rush passive skill. This skill, which is always active as long as a Rarity who has learned it is present, allows any possessed character, whether it's a Rarity or a Civilian, to unleash a powerful attack after being possessed by Hyoki as long as the enemy is in front of the camera. By hopping from one character to the next, you can easily deal with multiple enemies easily as long as you handle the camera properly. This is an excellent strategy to deal with S.P.E.U. members armed with shields. Possess an NPC located behind their backs, unleash the Possession Rush skill, and watch them fall dead.</p>

<p>COD Mobile does not follow the traditional ranked system, such as the Bronze, Silver and Gold ranked system. However, it does split some of the ranks listed above into different levels.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-rookie">Rookie</h3>



<p>Rookie is the lowest rank in COD Mobile, where many gamers start out. Here is every Rookie rank:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rookie I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rookie V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-veteran">Veteran</h3>



<p>Following the Rookie rank is Veteran (which seems like it should be the name for the top rank). Here is every Veteran rank in COD Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Veteran I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veteran V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-elite">Elite</h3>



<p>Elite is the next rank in COD Mobile, which also is split into multiple segments. Here is every Elite rank:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Elite I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elite V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-pro">Pro</h3>



<p>Considered the middle rank in COD Mobile, the Pro rank is filled with players who probably play the shooter game regularly, so if you make it this far, then consider yourself a COD gamer.</p>



<p>Here is every Pro rank in COD Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pro I</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro II</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro III</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro IV</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pro V</strong></li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-master">Master</h3>



<p>Master is the next rank in COD Mobile and the first one without any split segments. Once you hit Master, you will not have to worry about progressing through the rank. </p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-grandmaster">Grandmaster</h3>



<p>Grandmaster is the second to last rank in COD Mobile, meaning you will need to be quite the gamer to make it this far. However, it is not the last and will be extremely difficult to rank up from here.</p>



<hr>



<h3 id="h-legendary">Legendary</h3>



<p>Legendary is the rank all COD Mobile gamers strive for, but very few ever hit. It takes quite a few COD points to make it this far, so if you are ever good enough to hit Legendary, take yourself out for a nice steak dinner to celebrate.</p>



<p>Jump into COD Mobile now and start ranking up so you can hit Legendary.</p>

            <p>
New York Times tech staff have begun strike action in protest of alleged unfair labour practices, and are asking people not to play the Times' games - which include the likes of Wordle and Connections - in order to "honour the digital picket line".
</p>
<p>
The strike, which started today after "multiple rounds of intense bargaining" with management failed to reach an agreement, has been organised by The Times Tech Guild, a union covering 600 workers responsible for the creation and maintainance of the technology powering the New York Times' website and games.
</p>
<p>
According to a <a href="https://x.com/nyguild/status/1853418971585729013">statement</a> shared by the NewsGuild of New York - the labour union representing over 6,000 workers at news organisation in the area - the Times Tech Guild had raised a number of key concerns with management prior to today's strike. These include remote/hybrid work protections, "just cause" job protections (which the Times' newsroom is said to have had for "decades"), subcontracting limits, and pay equity/fair pay.

<p>
Times management are accused of engaging in "numerous labour law violations" during the bargaining process, including the implementation of a return-to-office mandate without bargaining, and the intimidation of staff through "interrogations about their strike intentions".
</p>
<p>
As a result, the NewsGuild of New York has filed unfair labour practice charges against the Times covering "numerous" violations of labour law, and work stoppage began at 12.01am ET on Monday with Tech Guild members picketing outside its Eighth Avenue entrance. Additionally, its newsroom union has pledged not to do struck work, as per their contract.
</p><p>
The Times Tech Guild's strike action is set to continue daily from 9am to 6pm if no progress is made during negotiations - threatening to impact the Times' US election coverage this week - and the union is asking readers to "honour the digital picket line and not play popular NYT Games such as Wordle and Connections as well as not use the NYT Cooking app."
</p>
<p>
"Our union members and bargaining committee have done everything to avoid this ULP strike," Tech Guild unit chair Kathy Zhang said in the statement. "But management is more willing to risk our election coverage than they are to agree to a fair deal with its workers. They have left us no choice but to demonstrate the power of our labour on the picket line. Nevertheless, we stand ready to bargain and get this contract across the line."
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/474209/new-york-times-strike-wordle-connections">response provided to Polygon</a>, New York Times spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha said, "We look forward to continuing to work with the Tech Guild to reach a fair contract that takes into account that they are already among the highest paid individual contributors in the Company and journalism is our top priority.
</p>
<p>
"We're in one of the most consequential periods of coverage for our readers and have robust plans in place to ensure that we are able to fulfil our mission and serve our readers. While we respect the union's right to engage in protected actions, we're disappointed that colleagues would strike at this time, which is both unnecessary and at odds with our mission."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/czech-release-of-mass-effect-board-game-will-remove-squadmate-pronouns<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Czech Republic version of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mass-effect-board-game-review-back-to-reaper-war" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect</em> board game</a> will be changed. A representative of Asmodee has stated that the licensed board game will be released in the region with squadmates' pronouns removed, possibly as a capitulation to bad-faith culture war advocates.</p>



<p>The changes to the Czech Republic Mass Effect board game were revealed on the website <a href="https://www.zatrolene-hry.cz/spolecenska-hra/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz-16040/diskuse/kritika-40147/?pg=2">Zatrolene-hry</a>. In the comments section, Asmodee Czech Republic's Brand Manager, Michal, stated the following:</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asmodee-cz-michal-mass-effect-board-game-announcement-post.jpg?itok=6xRggQAD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asmodee-cz-michal-mass-effect-board-game-announcement-post.jpg?itok=EcJ_OZTp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The subject in question regards the <em>Mass Effect</em> board game including personal pronouns for each playable squad member in the top corner of their character sheets.</p>

<p>At first this decision appears to be purely linguistic. The Czech language isn't the same as English as it uses grammatical gender with its nouns; and that's before local colloquialisms and cultural affectations are taken into account.</p>

<p>But the section in parentheses, saying they will argue with the publisher that they don't want pronouns put into the game, frames the act as confrontational.</p>

<p>It is a position strongly associated with a rise of entitled fandom-grifting culture war advocates. Ones that have been pushing back against the inclusion of gender expression terms in any creative work, claiming it is pushing back against a "woke agenda."</p>

<p>In fact, these advocates have <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mass-effect-board-game-designer-harrassed-over-culture-war-review-bombing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">review-bombed</a> the game and harrassed the lead designer, Eric Lang, into deleting several social media posts.</p>

<p>Another user on the site asked Michal why Asmodee CZ is making this change. Was it being done to mollify a certain audience? A declaration of censorship or alteration to the original designers' vision?</p>

<p>Michal's answer wasn't exactly mindful. He stated that just as thousands of works have released in most recent years without pronouns,<em> Mass Effect</em> will be no different. Furthermore, their removal would have zero issues since "Liara is a female looking character, why would there be anything written under her?"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asmodee-cz-michal-mass-effect-board-game-response_0.jpg?itok=78Vo3kUx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asmodee-cz-michal-mass-effect-board-game-response_0.jpg?itok=JTQZOr84 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This example is dubious at best since in the world of <em>Mass Effect</em>, Liara comes from a monogendered alien race which, while feminine presenting, have diverse gender expression supported by the lore; hence her (She/They) pronouns in the board game.</p>

<p>Additional commenters spoke out on Michal's reasoning, citing the culture war harassment mentioned above alongside ongoing progressive trends. In response, Michal stated the decision to remove pronouns from the game happened before these issues came to light, saying the decision was practical and not political.</p>

<p>However, Michal's statements are undercut by additional posts and responses seen as aggressive. Responses that were deleted by the site's moderators.</p>

<p>While crude and full of discourse, it seems Asmodee CZ has made a notable decision on altering their release of the <em>Mass Effect</em> board game. A change that has, regardless of reason, has been altered from the creator's original vision.</p>

According to Kojima’s post, he liked the film’s animated opening segment and seemed to enjoy the sequel’s “meta-perspective.” </p><p>“In the [film’s] trial that follows, the question of his multiple [personalities] is argued from beginning to end. Is the Joker Arthur? Is the Joker another personality (his shadow)? Who exactly is Arthur? This revelation eventually transforms into a meta-perspective,” he said on Twitter.  </p><p>“In the previous film, <em>Joker</em>, was it really Joker who captivated audiences around the world? Or was it Arthur? This question is constantly raised to Lee and even to the people of Gotham City within the film. We live in an age of mass production of ‘poetic justice’ heroes, a battle between good and evil. Lately, many spin-off films with a focus on the villains have been made. Can villains be superheroes too? Is this question posed on the big screen as a DC movie, too avant-garde? Was it the Joker that audiences around the world loved? Was it Arthur? This is where the reviews have diverged.”</p><p>Kojima suggests that over the next “10 or 20 years” the <em>Joker 2</em>'s “reputation” will change as well as future superhero flicks. </p><p>“It may take some time for it to become a true ‘folie à deux.’ But there is no doubt that everyone in the audience loved Joaquin and Gaga in this film,” concluded Kojima. Will someone check back in on this post in 10 years and ping me to see if people love <em>Joker 2</em> by then? Cool, thanks! </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’re eager to get your hands on the latest horror game from one of the minds behind the original Silent Hill, then you’re in luck because Slitterhead is nearly out in the world. The horror game officially launches on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on <strong>November 8</strong>.</p>

whenever new tech goes on sale. While the newer hardware is undoubtedly more powerful, that doesn't mean that the older stuff should be ignored. For example, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0CX23V2ZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">M3 MacBook Air</a> still offers an impressive amount of power and performance inside of a sleek design that you can easily carry around, while several iPad models increase the portability factor even further and can be paired with an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Keyboard-Experience-Trackpad-Function/dp/B0D3J65R9N?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple keyboard</a> as well.</p><p>Even several of the recently released iPad Pro tablets are on sale, and these workhorse devices also come equipped with an M4 chip that allows them to handle high-intensity apps and use minimal power, so they function really well as creative workstations.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> players will receive several in-game items as "compensation" for September's troubled launched, which developer KT Racing has acknowledged was marred by "technical and server difficulties" resulting in customer "dissatisfaction".
</p>
<p>
Anyone that played Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown prior to its first major patch on 30th September will automatically receive two unique items in their inventories, both coinciding with Season 2's launch sometime after 18th December.
</p>
<p>
The first of these is a custom-built Adventurer edition of the 1986 Porsche 911 Carrera Coupe, "fully equipped for the island's off-road roads". Eligible players will also receive a pack of five stickers that can be used to customise their cars.

<p>
Before their arrival, however, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is set to receive a second major patch, currently scheduled to launch on 5th November. This primarily features graphical enhancements for PS5, but there's also talk of optimisations for Xbox Series X/S and PC, alongside network upgrades, improved peripheral compatibility, and numerous bug fixes - as <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1249970/announcements/detail/4505380324428942358">detailed on Steam</a>, where the game is still rated Mostly Negative.

<p>
Eurogamer contributor Mike Channell detailed Solar Crown's technical woes when he reviewed it in September, finding them severe enough that the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review-tech-issues-mar-the-return-of-the-original-name-in-open-world-racers">received two stars out of five</a>. "Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown's only hope is that it can keep its technical niggles at bay," Mike wrote, "and that its novel, lovingly crafted recreation of Hong Kong Island is enough to claw its way to cult favourite status among genre fans and digital tourists."

<p>In our Harold Halibut review, Dom said, <em>“Harold Halibut looks great, like one of Aardman’s finest, only as a video game. Unfortunately, it’s the game part that underwhelms, offering a distinctly tedious narrative adventure that is a chore to play.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sets-dev-stream-for-tomorrow-first-game-reaches-8-million-sales/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Warhorse Studios announced that the first Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 developer stream will air tomorrow at 17:00 GMT / 18:00 CET <a href="http://twitch.tv/warhorsestudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitch</a> from Kuttenberg, one of the two main cities featured in the game. During the stream, the developers will hold a special live Q&amp;A session, during which they will reveal more information about the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Moreover, the studio has announced a four-part live-action video series starring Tom McKay and Luke Dale, who play Henry of Skalitz (the main character) and his noble friend Hans Capon. The debut episode set in Kutná Hora will go live on Thursday, November 7, at 17:00 GMT / 18:00 CET on the developer's <a href="http://youtube.com/warhorsestudios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is now set to launch on February 11, 2025. When the game was first unveiled earlier this year, the goal was to release it before the end of 2024. However, a short delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024. That's where we had the chance to <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> Warhorse Executive Producer Martin Klima, who was all too happy to dive into the game's features for our readers.</p>
<p>By the way, Warhorse also announced today a major milestone for the first installment. It was only this February that Kingdom Come Deliverance <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-passes-6-million-sales-on-its-6th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> six million units sold on its sixth anniversary; nine months later, it has surpassed 8 million units. It's likely due to major discounts ahead of the sequel, but it's still an impressive accomplishment.</p>
<p>Speaking of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, the developers published a blog post <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1771300/view/4514388158400430393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> where Senior Game Designer Ondřej Bittner talked about the inner workings of survival in the game.</p>
<p><em>The game has survival elements to it because you have to eat and you have to sleep. But that’s for the immersion. It's not hard to be rested and well fed and so on. The food spoils over time, so if you’re going somewhere far away it’s good to have dried fruit or dried meat jerky because it lasts longer. You can be vulnerable when you’re asleep. You can be robbed, or you can be attacked, depending on the circumstances. We even have it in the executioner’s historical records that someone might rob a house, get drunk, and then pass out on the bed - the perfect crime…</em></p>
<p><em>But generally, if you’re found somewhere you’re not supposed to be, you’ll be woken up. Or if someone’s looking for you because you did something wrong and they find you asleep, they’ll wake you up. You’ll need to pay your fine, or you’ll be arrested, whipped, or whatever.</em></p>
<p>Overall, the design philosophy is said to differ from the average game. Rather than asking players to focus on tasks, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will encourage players to pay attention to their surroundings.</p>

While I’m sure there are plenty of games that folks already have their eyes on, there’s always a bunch of smaller games that inevitably fly under the radar. I’m here to correct that for you. </p><p>To that end, Xbox is currently hosting a sale on titles published through the ID@Xbox brand, which benefits independent developers and publishers trying to get their own games out there. One such publisher is Annapurna Interactive, which accidentally wound up taking up most of this list. Whoops! Anyways, here’s just a few of the best games available on that sale, <strong>which concludes on November 14. </strong><br></p></div></div><div><p>The last few years have brought with them a veritable bounty of wonderful puzzle games, and few of them are as good as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cocoon-review-puzzle-steam-switch-limbo-inside-1850883069&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cocoon-review-puzzle-steam-switch-limbo-inside-1850883069"><em>Cocoon</em></a></span>. An entirely wordless game, <em>Cocoon</em>—developed by a team that previously worked on games such as <em>Inside</em>—follows a bug-like protagonist’s odyssey through several different worlds within worlds, divining how to interact with distinctly alien structures and technologies to commune with while perhaps overthrowing some hostile force. <em><strong>Cocoon </strong></em><strong>is currently $12.49 and is well worth that price of admission. </strong><br></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ashen-is-a-dreamier-dark-souls-1830985170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ashen-is-a-dreamier-dark-souls-1830985170"><em>Ashen</em></a></span><em> </em>is one of the best indie attempts at a <em>Souls </em>game. It is restrained and quiet. It is elegant and magical. It is all these things and simultaneously thoughtful and somber. But more than any of that, it is about home. It accomplishes so much while remaining a visual feast with striking minimalist graphics art direction. <strong>You can play the game solo or cooperatively, and I really do encourage you to grab a partner and dive into </strong><em><strong>Ashen</strong></em><strong>, which will run you about $10 right now.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>The best people in your life believe that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/outer-wilds-is-one-of-the-best-games-ive-ever-played-1835801654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/outer-wilds-is-one-of-the-best-games-ive-ever-played-1835801654"><em>Outer Wilds</em></a></span><em> </em>is the best game of 2019. How can they be wrong? This space-faring adventure posits a simple but intriguing mystery: What waits for us at the center of the universe? The game fully delivers on that promise (and then some), but the best part of the game is the journey it’ll take you on. The solar system of <em>Outer Wilds </em>is teeming with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-haunting-discoveries-of-outer-wilds-1837299985&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-haunting-discoveries-of-outer-wilds-1837299985">mysteries</a></span> and as you bounce from planet to planet in search of answers, you’ll learn of what a rich tapestry you belong to—even as the whole system implodes in a supernova every 22 minutes. It is simply one of the most heartfelt stories I’ve ever experienced, wrapped up in one of the most astounding puzzle games I’ve ever played too. <strong>I’d hate to give too much away about <em>Outer Wilds</em>, so instead you should just pick it up while it’s discounted to $15 and thank me later.</strong></p></div><div><p>A lot of the reason for my love of <em>Thirsty Suitors </em>is that, as the title suggests, I too was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/thirsty-suitors/ive-got-a-huge-crush-on-jala-from-thirsty-suitors&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/thirsty-suitors/ive-got-a-huge-crush-on-jala-from-thirsty-suitors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">down bad for the main character</a></span>, Jala, the brown (specifically South Asian) alternative skater girl of my dreams. She is hilarious, hot, and most importantly, a colossal failure just like me. She too struggles with her place in two different worlds, that of her family and their cultural upbringing and the drastically different world that she was raised in outside of her home. She’s one of the most relatable protagonists I’ve encountered. And the way that she does psychic turn-based battles against her exes and overbearing family is aspirational. <strong>If you’re looking for a short RPG with a lot of fun banter, generational trauma, and some of the best style around, it’s hard to go wrong with <em>Thirsty Suitor</em>, which is available for $18 right now. </strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-remains-of-edith-finch-the-kotaku-review-1794562388&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-remains-of-edith-finch-the-kotaku-review-1794562388"><em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em></a></span><em> </em>is, effectively, a short story anthology in video game form. As the titular character, you return to the immense home of the Finch family, who has supposedly been cursed, and explore what remains of them around the house. Along the way, Edith literally trips and falls headfirst into the distinctly styled tragedies of her family members, which are all rendered as unique vignettes with their own mechanics. It’s a game so good you’ll tear through it in a single evening, but the night that you spend with <em>What Remains of Edith Finch </em>will stick with you for years after you’re done with it. <strong>You can have your own fateful night with </strong><em><strong>What Remains of Edith Finch </strong></em><strong>by picking it up for $5 while it’s on sale. </strong></p></div><div><p>Demagog Studio is a small team making narrative games about the collapse of the world as we know it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/golf-club-wasteland-is-a-post-apocalyptic-golf-platform-1847058499&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/golf-club-wasteland-is-a-post-apocalyptic-golf-platform-1847058499"><em>Golf Club Nostalgia</em></a></span>, despite the name, is exactly one of those titles and is in fact the team’s first effort. In it, you play golf among the remains of the world following an ecological collapse. In the time since, Earth has been abandoned by the rich, who’ve fled to Mars, and you only come back to Earth to play one final game of golf and discover what the hell happened.The premise sounds pretty far-fetched, but the more that our way of life is eroded by greed, the more realistic a vision of our future it appears to be. <strong>You can bear witness to the existential horror of <em>Golf Club Nostalgia</em> for yourself for just $2. </strong></p></div><div><p>Here’s the greatest endorsement I can give <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sayonara-wild-hearts-the-kotaku-review-1838219679&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sayonara-wild-hearts-the-kotaku-review-1838219679"><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em></a></span>, a rhythm action game from 2019: I do not skip any of the tracks that emerge on my shuffle all these years later. At times, I even live with a song or two as if I’m listening to them for the first time, enthralled by the propulsive set pieces of the game they’re wrapped in. “Parallel Universes” is just one of my favorite songs in any game ever, but it’s surrounded by bangers like “Begin Again” and “Night Drift.” I can’t even begin to write about what “A Place I Don’t Know” means to me without welling up.<br></p><p><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts </em>is like an interactive pop album. If that doesn’t sell you on the game in which you ride motorcycles, cars, flying swords, and even a dragon through neon-soaked fantasy environments, well then hopefully <em>this </em>sentence did. <strong>You can pick up </strong><em><strong>Sayonara Wild Hearts </strong></em><strong>for just $7.79 and you won’t regret it.</strong><br></p><hr><p>There’s a lot of different experiences to choose from here. If I had to narrow it down to make it easier for you all, <em>Outer Wilds </em>is one of my all-time favorite games. It features a stirring narrative, a wonderful central mystery, a score that’ll bring you to tears, and best of all, a horror-themed expansion that came out a few years later, in case you’re still in the mood for some scares. <em>Outer Wilds </em>has got it all.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I'm going to post most of it here because it's important you read each unhinged line:</p><blockquote><div><p>At long last, I am ready to talk about what I'm doing next: I am working on driving a "once in a generation" inflection point for game development and player experiences using generative AI. This transformational technology will accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players.</p><p>I am focused on a creator-first vision for AI, one that puts creative talent at the center, with AI being a catalyst and an accelerant. AI will enable big game teams to move much faster, and will also put an almost unimaginable collection of new capabilities in the hands of developers in smaller game teams.&nbsp;</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Verdu then moved onto some staffing and internal policy stuff before closing with:</p><blockquote><div><p>GenAI is that next challenge. I don't think I've been this excited about an opportunity in this industry since the 90s, when we saw a new game launch every few months that redefined what was possible. It was an incredible time to be making games as talented creators showed all of us what the future looked like. Guess what? We're back to those days of seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innovation, which resulted in mind-blowing surprises for players every few months.</p><p>I can't believe how lucky I am to be alive when a wave this big is about to hit the game industry. Many view this technology with fear, but I am a game-maker at heart and I see its potential to unlock all of us, to create mind-blowing new experiences for players, to lift us to new heights. Yes, we'll have to adapt and change, but when have we failed to meet that challenge as an industry?</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>I dunno man, the games industry seems utterly incapable of<a href="https://aftermath.site/layoffs-are-the-vibe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> meeting any of the challenges it's currently facing</a>? Let alone a "wave this big" that he <em>thinks</em> is made of money and great games but will actually just be more layoffs and machine-generated slop?</p><p>Also great work trumpeting this just days after closing down a whole studio, including three of its very experienced leaders. It didn't "enable" shit for them!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In front of thousands of fans in Times Square, with most of the sprawling screens displaying his face, Snoop Dogg provided a twist on one of hip-hop’s iconic lines. “It ain’t nothin’ but a gangsta party,” he chanted. “It ain’t nothin’ but a <em>Fortnite </em>gangsta party.”&nbsp;The moment was part of a concert that also featured Ice Spice, all performed live in New York while being broadcast as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285464/fortnite-remix-the-prelude-event-how-to-watch">an in-game event for anyone logged in to the game</a>. The battle royale has had plenty of concerts and events in recent years, but the Snoop collaboration is part of a plan to more deeply integrate music into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24065901/fortnite-metaverse-disney-epic-partnership">the budding metaverse</a>.</p><p>“This is a partnership,” Snoop said during an interview after the show. “Most games just want one song and you don’t even see the artist. So for them to let us be a part of the game, and that community, it’s deep.”</p><p>In the past, <em>Fortnite</em>’s big musical moments have largely been singular virtual concerts from the likes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling">Ariana Grande</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/29/24187226/fortnite-metallica-concert-interview">Metallica</a>. But over the years, music has steadily permeated the game to the point that Snoop’s Times Square performance was just a kickoff point for a monthlong event.</p><p><em>Fortnite</em>’s current season, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24283508/fortnite-remix-chapter-2-concert-snoop-dogg-ice-spice">dubbed Chapter 2 Remix</a>, debuted this weekend, rewinding the clock with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole">a version of the battle royale map from several years ago</a>. But there’s a twist — hence the “remix” in the title. Each week, the game will change slightly, themed around a different artist. Snoop is up first. You can enlist him as a companion, visit a heavily guarded Dogg Pound compound, or rock out as his tracks play on the radio as you drive around the island.</p><p>If you boot up <em>Fortnite Festival</em>, the rhythm game developed by <em>Rock Band</em> studio Harmonix, he’s the new headlining act, which means you can buy his songs to play along to, unlock Snoop-themed guitars and drum sets, and buy a crip walk emote that plays “Drop It Like It’s Hot.” Snoop will be followed by Eminem, Ice Spice, and the late Juice WRLD, with future updates introducing elements like <a href="https://x.com/andredotuasset/status/1853219859741475322?t=EH9BlSHw3u3Xp4yw0XECiA">a gun that spits Eminem lyrics</a>.</p><p>According to Nate Nanzer, head of global partnerships at <em>Fortnite</em> developer Epic, there have been two key points in the evolution of music in the game that led to this point. The first was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">Travis Scott’s “Astronomical” concert</a>, which showed the scale possible with these kinds of virtual events, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count">an audience topping 12 million</a>. “After we did Travis Scott we had everybody coming to us saying ‘Hey, I want to do that,’” says Nanzer.</p><p>The second was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band">the launch of <em>Fortnite Festival</em> last year</a>. Like the battle royale mode, <em>Festival</em> has seasons, each “headlined” by a different artist, which, to date, has included stars like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137317/billie-eilish-fortnite-festival-date">Billie Eilish</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079009/lady-gaga-comes-to-fortnite-tomorrow">Lady Gaga</a>. “If you look at all of the things we did prior, they tended to be more one-off,” says Nanzer. “We’d do an event, and then months or even years would go by before we did something else. What <em>Festival</em> did was give us this venue to be able to celebrate music more regularly.</p><p>For Snoop’s son Cordell Broadus, there was one particular moment that convinced him Snoop should be in <em>Fortnite</em>. In 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/21/23034095/fortnite-wu-tang-clan-gear">a collaboration with the Wu-Tang Clan</a> featured an in-game glider that would play the chorus to “C.R.E.A.M” as players flew down to the battle royale island. “I kept saying: ‘I gotta put his music in there,’” he explains. “Because every time I play<em> Fortnite</em> that’s what I hear. So a lot of the inspiration came from seeing them doing it, and seeing that <em>Fortnite</em>’s not afraid to really deal with hardcore hip-hop.”</p><p>That feeling grew stronger as the more ambitious virtual concerts continued to make waves. “We’re real competitive,” says Broadus. “So we’re competing with Travis Scott. What he did with <em>Fortnite </em>was huge, and I feel like we topped that tonight. But we’ll let the people decide.” (Snoop was quick to clarify that “I didn’t say that, he said that.”)</p><p>The <em>Fortnite</em> collaborations that get headlines — and a prime Friday night spot in Times Square — feature huge artists. But part of turning the game into a viable venue for music, according to Nanzer, is integrating it in multiple ways so that all kinds of artists can be featured. In addition to virtual concerts and headlining <em>Festival</em>, there are the emotes, in-game radio stations, and individual tracks you can buy to play in <em>Festival</em>.</p><div><p>Not all of these ideas have worked out. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike">Epic tried to create a virtual tour stop for artists in 2020</a>, going so far as to build out a studio space in Los Angeles, and the effort has largely fizzled out. But as the company continues to try to push <em>Fortnite</em> beyond its battle royale roots, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">games like <em>Lego Fortnite</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258447/fortnite-creators-first-person-shooters-fps-unreal-editor">a concentrated focus on community-made games and experiences</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest">a still-mysterious virtual world built with Disney</a>, music is another important tool to make the game more than just another live-service shooter, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">an increasingly difficult space to compete in</a>. That’s true at various scales, from Snoop in New York to an indie band getting its first airtime on a <em>Fortnite</em> radio station.</p></div><p>“We want to work with the biggest artists in the world,” says Nanzer, “but we also want to figure out if we can break artists in <em>Fortnite</em>.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Then there are the more nitty gritty details like how magic is getting brought in or what exactly happened in the final scene of season one.

We have no idea! Season one didn’t really wrap up any of the larger conflicts at play in the world of <em>Arcane</em>. Instead, it left things on the precipice of all out war. To that end, Jinx launched a rocket directly into the chambers of Piltover’s ruling council. That leaves a lot of major players from season one with a big question mark over their heads. Jayce, Mel, and Caitlyn’s mother Cassandra are all within the council at the time. Trailers for season two have kept the fallout of this attack underwraps but Caitlyn appears on the warpath, so it is likely her mom was a casualty of the attack. Whatever the death toll is revealed to be, you can be sure this battle will be the match that lights the powder keg of season two.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-recommend-id="image://e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A police officer holds up a baton while a masked officer stands to the right." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A police officer holds up a baton while a masked officer stands to the right." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-recommend-id="image://e0cbdbb65aae89941f0ed456b4ad6a08" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A police officer holds up a baton while a masked officer stands to the right." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The central conflict around which all of <em>Arcane </em>revolves is the growing tension between the cities of Piltover and Zaun. The former is a thriving city full of wealth and technology and home to people like Caitlyn and Jayce. The latter is an undercity beneath it that is a relative slum in comparison to the grandeur of Piltover. Due to the constant pollution of Zaun it has become the home of the poor and disenfranchised, which also means crime runs rampant. As a result, Piltover heavily polices the area and has created a major class divide. This is where Vi and Jinx grew up.</p><p>Season one saw these class tensions come to a head in a huge skirmish on the streets of Zaun that ended with the death of de facto leader and crime lord Silco. Season two teasers tell us that the production of the drug Shimmer is still occuring in Zaun, even without Silco, so Caitlyn and a group of Enforcers are coming in to put an end to it all. I’m sure nothing bad will happen.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-recommend-id="image://567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vi and Jinx stand close to each other with fog surrounding them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vi and Jinx stand close to each other with fog surrounding them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-recommend-id="image://567bba4f5d10f4fbbcc7e89c3e4deb0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vi and Jinx stand close to each other with fog surrounding them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While <em>Arcane </em>is a tale of two cities, it is even more a tale of two sisters. Vi and Powder (who grows up to be Jinx during the events of season one) are the heart of the show. Act one of season one focused on the pair’s upbringing in Zaun, which ended in their separation with Vi thinking Powder was dead and Powder being taken under the wing of Silco. The rest of the season revolved around Vi’s attempt to save her sister (now going by the name Jinx) from the influence of Silco.</p><p>That didn’t end up working out and by season one’s end Vi had come to terms with the idea that Jinx is no longer her sister. Season two positions their final confrontation as the main event, with Vi even admitting her sister is gone and that only Jinx remains. Along with Caitlyn, she’s ready to take down Jinx no matter what. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-recommend-id="image://6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-format="jpg" data-width="1219" data-height="686" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Caitlyn in uniform looking angry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A close up of Caitlyn in uniform looking angry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-recommend-id="image://6729833699de310bb042b2cce798d462" data-format="jpg" data-width="1219" data-height="686" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Caitlyn in uniform looking angry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>At the start of season one Caitlyn is shown to be a Piltover citizen whose heart is in the right place, even if she doesn’t understand the realities of the world. As a rookie enforcer she wants to uphold justice and the law, but quickly finds after teaming up with Vi and falling into the city’s larger conflict that no side is without blood on its hands. Vi opens her up to the humanity of Zaun’s inhabitants, while betrayals from crooked enforcers above her show her that maybe this isn’t all black and white. Even after the final skirmish of season one, Caitlyn seems like a person who truly wants to change the relationship between Zaun and Piltover to change for the betterment of both sides.</p><p>Of course if her mom is dead that changes things. Season two already looks to put Caitlyn on the warpath, but grief may be blinding her temporarily. With the council attacked, Caitlyn seems to be something of a leader for the city now, and Jinx has fallen into a similar role in Zaun. Maybe the two will still find a way to overcome the cycles of violence their cities have been stuck in for years.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-recommend-id="image://356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Ambessa wearing a red and black top with a fur-lined shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A close up of Ambessa wearing a red and black top with a fur-lined shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-recommend-id="image://356ffe15c13f7bdae77826efd2c3e961" data-format="jpg" data-width="962" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A close up of Ambessa wearing a red and black top with a fur-lined shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Mel’s mother played a relatively small part in <em>Arcane </em>season one, but that will likely change in the final season.

Specifically she wants in on weaponized Hextech, the technology Jayce invented. With the council potentially out of the way, Ambessa is in a great position to grab control of Piltover, which would only mean bad things for the relationship between it and Zaun.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-recommend-id="image://47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mysterious mage summons blue swirling magic with a staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A mysterious mage summons blue swirling magic with a staff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-recommend-id="image://47ad84ed10ecb9cb3a752afddac1588a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mysterious mage summons blue swirling magic with a staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>League of Legends</em> is full of magic wielders, but <em>Arcane </em>has almost none in its first season.

<p>There was a lot about Star Wars Outlaws that I thoroughly enjoyed, but its combat wasn’t one of them. I cheesed the system whenever possible, using stealth or outright taking a long route around enemies to avoid combat. It felt awkward, clunky, and barebones. Apparently, that will all change with Star Wars Outlaws title update 1.4, which aims to improve the game’s feel and approach, specifically combat, and embrace player-choice-driven gameplay, allowing you to tackle encounters and missions more freely. It’s a welcome change that we hope will entice returning players.</p>



<p>This reveal stems from a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent official blog post</a> by the Star Wars Outlaws team, which also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-full-release-star-wars-outlaws-get-new-creative-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed a new Creative Director, Drew Rechner</a>, who is taking over for Julian Gerighty. For now, let’s focus on the gameplay enhancements coming in title update 1.4, namely:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we’ve focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions particularly around stealth, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we’re looking to improve the game even further.</em></p>



<p><em>The first key area of improvement to the game is combat where we see a real opportunity to add more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision. Our second key area is stealth which is not only about improving the readability and consistency of enemy detection, but also providing choice in how you want to approach each encounter. Finally, our third key area of focus is centered around the character controls, which means improving the reliability of cover, increasing the responsiveness of climbing and crouching, and generally improving the consistency of the controls overall.</em></p>



<p><em>You can expect to see more details about how we will be celebrating and embracing player choice more than ever before, whether it’s sneaking through encounters, going in blasters-blazing, or everything in-between. We will provide more specific details about the changes to these areas and more in the upcoming weeks as we provide further updates to you. All of this will culminate in the release of Title Update 1.4 which will release on November 21st alongside the Steam launch and first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thankfully, we don’t have to wait long—Star Wars Outlaws title update 1.4 launches alongside the game on Steam on <strong>November 21</strong>.</p>

<p>The popular video game, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, which was released back in 2019, just had images leaked online of it being tested on PSN (PlayStation Network). Since its release, the game has been a staple within the PC and Xbox community but has not seen the light of day on a PlayStation console in over a decade.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-being-tested-on-psn">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition Being Tested on PSN</h2>



<p>The original Age of Empires II was first released back in 1999. For its 20th anniversary, the game got the Definitive Edition just back in 2019. Xbox and PC gamers were lucky enough to indulge in this classic, but it has barely ever been seen on PlayStation consoles. In fact, no Age of Empires game has ever been released on a PlayStation console since the PS2.</p>



<p>However, leaked images online show that PSN subscribers could soon be getting the title brought over to their respective consoles.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leak first surfaced when Reddit user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/draconis90/">u/draconis90</a>, posted the image above on Reddit, which shows two players playing the game on PlayStation. </p>



<p>However, the user also states that this could just be a graphics bug.</p>



<p>Still, not too long ago, Tom Warren, a Senior Editor at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a>, leaked that the game could be getting a PlayStation release in the early months of 2025. Still, no known information has been released since except for the leaked image above.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-does-this-all-mean">What Does This All Mean?</h2>



<p>So, what does all of this mean? Will Age of Empires fans finally be getting a title on PlayStation? Or is it simply just a bug that appeared? </p>



<p>While many are speculating on whether or not this image is real, there have been zero other gamers to emerge and claim they have seen the same glitch happen in their game.</p>



<p>Tell us your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<p>I wasn’t among the countless who positively despised Star Wars Outlaws upon its release. Sure, it wasn’t the best open-world game, but it certainly wasn’t the worst. It was missing something, and apparently, Ubisoft feels the same, as its latest blog post for the game announces not only Title Update 1.4 but also the fact that Star Wars Outlaws has a new Creative Director, Drew Rechner, who is taking over for Julian Gerighty.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official blog post</a> on the Star Wars Outlaws site, Ubisoft said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Outlaws,</em></p>



<p><em>I’m very excited to be stepping into the role of Creative Director on Star Wars Outlaws and to be working with the incredibly passionate team here at Massive Entertainment along with our talented co-development studios around the world and Lucasfilm Games. I would like to personally thank you, our community, for your positive response to the game. We see and love all the fan arts, comments, and videos you’ve created around the game, and it continues to provide joy and inspiration to the team. We truly hope you’re enjoying your journey across the Outer Rim with Kay and Nix thus far.</em></p>



<p><em>I also want to take the time to say that we hear not only your positive feedback, but your constructive feedback as well. Thank you for sharing with us and helping us make the game even better. Today, I want to share with you the next priority areas we are looking to address to ensure that Star Wars Outlaws is the best experience possible for you.</em></p>



<p><em>From before launch and continuing into post-launch, we have been gathering data from and listening to you. This takes place not only formally through our analytics, user tests, reviews and media feedback, our Star Wars Outlaws Bug Reporter, crash reports, and other mechanisms, but also informally when we see your YouTube videos and Reddit, Discord or other social media posts. We deeply care about your experience with the game, and use all the data and feedback possible to see the friction points you are encountering, what you’re enjoying, and where we can further improve certain elements that matter the most to you.</em></p>



<p><em>Your feedback has already resulted in three Title Updates in which we’ve focused on fixing some of your biggest concerns such as bugs, reducing major friction points in some key missions particularly around stealth, adjusting the speeder camera and collision, and much more. That being said, there are three key areas in which we’re looking to improve the game even further.</em></p>



<p><em>The first key area of improvement to the game is combat where we see a real opportunity to add more depth and excitement to the experience, further rewarding your tactics and precision. Our second key area is stealth which is not only about improving the readability and consistency of enemy detection, but also providing choice in how you want to approach each encounter. Finally, our third key area of focus is centered around the character controls, which means improving the reliability of cover, increasing the responsiveness of climbing and crouching, and generally improving the consistency of the controls overall.</em></p>



<p><em>You can expect to see more details about how we will be celebrating and embracing player choice more than ever before, whether it’s sneaking through encounters, going in blasters-blazing, or everything in-between. We will provide more specific details about the changes to these areas and more in the upcoming weeks as we provide further updates to you. All of this will culminate in the release of Title Update 1.4 which will release on November 21st alongside the Steam launch and first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card.</em></p>



<p><em>To our players, thank you again for your support and feedback, and we hope you will enjoy continuing exploring the galaxy with us. And if you’re new to the game, there’s never been a better time to experience the Outer Rim with Kay and Nix!</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>We’re unsure what’s coming in the next Star Wars Outlaws update. According to the post, the community has highly requested fixes and features, and there are likely plenty of quality-of-life tweaks, but there’s no telling just yet. The team promises to share more about Star Wars Outlaws Title Update 1.4 on social media later, but it’s scheduled to hit on November 21st, so we expect to hear more soon!</p>

<p>By now, you’ve undoubtedly heard about the Assassin’s Creed Shadows delay, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-says-star-wars-outlaws-performance-contributed-to-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did you know Star Wars Outlaws’ performance directly contributed to Ubisoft’s decision</a>? It’s true, and Insider Gaming reported on the matter recently!</p>
