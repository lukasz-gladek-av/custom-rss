<p>It has now issued another notice about this via its <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1961267553424253377">customer support social account for Japan</a> – reminding Switch users that these vouchers will no longer be sold after <strong>3</strong><strong>0th January 2026</strong>. It has also shared a notice about how <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers/">the software currently listed for the voucher program</a> does not include Switch 2 titles.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2jnlqiw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf32irwF2Do" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The games that you can redeem with these vouchers include Switch titles and the original Switch versions of certain other games. For example, the latest title to join the game voucher list is the Switch version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, which is due out alongside the Switch 2 version on 16th October 2025. Notably, there'll <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-legends-z-as-switch-2-and-switch-1-prices-have-been-revealed">also be a paid Switch 2 upgrade</a> for the Switch version of Z-A.</p>
<p>Some other titles currently featured in this voucher program include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> and titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> (which also offers a paid Switch 2 upgrade). Multiple other Switch titles featured in the voucher program have recently received free Switch 2 upgrades from Nintendo as well.</p>
<p>Although Switch Online Game Vouchers will no longer be available to purchase after the first month of next year, any vouchers you have will remain valid for 12 months after purchase. Nintendo has said it also plans to continue to add Switch titles to the Game Voucher catalogue throughout 2026.</p>

In this world, Nexus is the unseen bonds woven between paired concepts, such as Love and Hate, Light and Dark, Life and Death, among many others. However, this balance is unexpectedly shattered when a sudden rupture severs those connections, scattering their remnant powers across the land in the form of Anima. From this fractured order, players embark on a journey: through missions and combat, they forge bonds with these Anima, unlocking abilities that reflect the unique concepts each embodies. Moreover, these abilities can be combined to create diverse battle tactics and influence how players explore and engage with the expansive overworld.</p><p>In the game, players take on the role of a plane-hopping traveler who has escaped captivity, embarking on an all-new adventure. The journey begins in a tranquil town that opens into uncharted realms. As players advance, they encounter Anima companions with distinct personalities and forge bonds that carry through both exploration and combat. In Nexus Battles, these companions stand beside players as the story uncovers the mysteries of the protagonist’s past. As the latest major entry in the <em>Honkai</em> series, <em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> continues to deliver the franchise’s signature high-quality storytelling and artistic style, and it also marks a bold new chapter in both gameplay and worldbuilding.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the first trailers below.

<p>"The guild authorizes a special collaboration"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Recently, it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> content appearing in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, and now Capcom is flipping this crossover around.</p>
<p>The developer will be bringing the hunt to its latest Street Fighter entry, dressing the fighters up with new EX colours, "new gears" and more. This limited-time event will be taking place between <strong>1st September 2025</strong> and <strong>30th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's some PR about what exactly you can expect, and you can see it all in motion in the video above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The guild authorizes a special collaboration between Street Fighter 6 and Monster Hunter Wilds, the latest installments in both of these iconic franchises!</p>
<p>All players who log in during the event period will get special collab items! The Shop will also be stocked with special EX colors for Blanka, Akuma, Manon, Cammy, and Ken inspired by some wild creatures.</p>
<p>During this event, the Battle Hub will also get a new makeover while we run a special Street Voter event. Finally, the Monster Hunter 20th Anniversary Fighting Pass will return for the collab!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, the game's online Battle Hub is also getting a themed makeover, and the 20th Anniversary <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monster_hunter_rise_sunbreak">Monster Hunter</a> Fighter Pass will be making a return, so join in on the festivities while you can.</p>
<p>This follows on from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/street-fighter-6s-first-season-3-dlc-character-is-out-now-heres-a-look">recent release of the DLC fighter Sagat</a>, with multiple other characters also on the way as part of the Season 3 update. When we see and hear more about these additional fighters joining the roster, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Although there's no word about Monster Hunter Wilds making its way to the Switch 2, Capcom did recently announce <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a> for the platform. It will be arriving on Nintendo's new hardware at some point in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>

<p>Nintendo has been celebrating Kirby in all sorts of ways recently, and apart from the return of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> on the Switch 2 this week, it's also been restocking its online shops with some goodies.</p>
<p>The item above, which first appeared in 2022, might not be the most exciting, but hey – we're sure some fans out there will appreciate "shopping bag" Kirby. You can get this "exclusive" My Nintendo Store product in the US and Canada for <strong>600 Platinum Points</strong> (<a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1961104654101627083">thanks for the heads up, Wario64</a>).</p>

<p>This follows some news about an update to the My Nintendo Store in Australia and New Zealand, which added all sorts of Kirby merchandise.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/kirby/related-articles:187151 @ 1756449287 -->
<p>And if this wasn't already enough Kirby news for one week, Nintendo has also recently revealed it will be releasing a Kirby update for its sound clock, Nintendo Alarmo. Additionally, there's a Kirby event taking place in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_99">Tetris 99</a> this week, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> recently got updated with some more Forgotten Land tracks.</p>

<p>The third-party title got a full cartridge release</p>

<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b1cb4e9b9f45/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CD Projekt Red</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Switch 2 generation has got off to a solid start, but not everything has been rosy – with Game-Key Cards becoming a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-will-you-be-buying-any-game-key-card-switch-2-games">huge talking point within the community</a>. Many third-party developers are currently shipping their games on these cards, but have also come under fire for not offering <em>proper</em> physical releases.</p>
<p>Of course, outside of first-party Nintendo games, there are a handful of teams offering their titles on full game cards, so what's the pay-off? While we haven't really had any information about this up until now, CD Projekt Group's latest financial report has shared data about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s digital and physical sales in the Switch 2's launch month.</p>
<p>According to a graphic on the fourth page of this report, approximately <strong>75.4%</strong> of Switch 2 users who purchased this title in June bought the physical version, which contained the entire game on the cartridge. As you can see, <strong>24.6%</strong> opted to purchase the game digitally last month, with the game also hovering at the top of eShop purchases in its opening month.</p>
<figure><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd341d2a7cee8/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: CD Projekt Red</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing this report didn't reveal was the exact sales figures, but according to some other sales updates in select regions recently, Cyberpunk 2077 has been featured in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-2-launch-helps-boost-us-video-game-spending-to-record-june-high">best-selling charts in its opening month</a> on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This follows comments by CDPR's Vice President of Business Development Jan Rosner, who <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/cyberpunk-2077-dev-tells-studios-do-not-underestimate-the-physical-edition">spoke earlier this year about offering a "complete" physical edition</a> of Cyberpunk 2077 for Switch 2 – stating at the time how "Nintendo at physical retail is still strong, and retail is, in general, not going anywhere".</p>
<p>He further noted how physical releases are "especially important for the Nintendo audience", acknowledging how "the right thing to do" was to have Cyberpunk 2077 "on the cartridge".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Electronic Arts revealed earlier this year that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-basketball-march-madness-return-2028-ps5-1851785339">it’s planning to add a college basketball game</a> to its ever-expanding roster of sports franchises. Then 2K Games came out hours later and indicated <a href="https://kotaku.com/2k-college-hoops-ea-college-football-26-1851784967">it was doing the same</a>. Now new reporting suggests both publishers have been at war behind the scenes trying to lock up the deals needed to make an NCAA basketball game a reality.</p> <p><a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/08/28/sources-ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game-talks-hit-snag/"><em>Sports Business Journal </em>reports</a> that while EA won a bidding round earlier this year with the Collegiate Licensing Company for the rights to the NCAA brand, 2K Games has moved forward with its own college basketball game by trying to negotiate brand partnerships with individual colleges like UCLA.</p> <p><span data-testid="content-text">“UCLA Athletics and UCLA Trademarks &amp; Licensing, an enterprise of the </span><span data-testid="content-text">Associated Students UCLA</span><span data-testid="content-text">, have announced a long-term collaboration with&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text">2K</span><span data-testid="content-text"> which will see the UCLA Men’s and Women’s Basketball programs bring the rich legacy of Bruins basketball to a future project,” the school <a href="https://www.licenseglobal.com/basketball/ucla-men-s-and-women-s-basketball-confirmed-for-2k-college-basketball-project">announced on Thursday</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bring the Madness. Let’s run it back. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CBB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CBB</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ItsInTheGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ItsInTheGame</a> <a href="https://t.co/iBNhGxn2yj">pic.twitter.com/iBNhGxn2yj</a></p> <p>— EA SPORTS (@EASPORTS) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTS/status/1939703160479637660?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The campus has been quiet for too long 😏 <a href="https://t.co/AuqoX5u5Qr">https://t.co/AuqoX5u5Qr</a></p> <p>— NBA 2K (@NBA2K) <a href="https://twitter.com/NBA2K/status/1939805441468342727?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>EA is apparently very unhappy about this. According to <em>Sports Business Journal</em>, it wanted the rights to everything in NCAA divisional basketball on both men’s and women’s leagues, which would give it the sort of exclusivity stranglehold it long had with the NFL in its <em>Madden</em> series. And if EA doesn’t get its way, sources told <em>Sports Business Journal</em> the publisher might abandon the upcoming game altogether.</p> <p>“The opportunity that’s excited us in college basketball is to deliver a full, standalone experience that captures everything that makes the sport so special,” EA Sports VP Sean O’Brien told <em>SBJ</em> in a statement. “The approach we’ve proposed is to create a game that includes all 350-plus NCAA Division I schools—both men’s and women’s teams included—with name, image and likeness compensation for all athletes, 32 conferences, the NCAA and all things that make ‘March Madness’ the most exciting month of sports and all the traditions and pageantry fans love.”</p>

 <p>Basically, 2K Games, which was reportedly part of the NCAA bidding war but lost to EA, has decided to move ahead with a college basketball game regardless. While it abandoned its<em> Hoops</em> franchise over a decade ago, it’s been releasing<em> NBA2K</em> every year and could quickly spin off a new version of it for college teams or, as <em>SBJ</em> reports, possibly position it as an add-on or expansion for the existing franchise.</p> <p>EA, which also abandoned its basketball franchise over a decade ago, will have to start from scratch. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2025/08/26/ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game/85645694007/">Recent reporting</a> suggests a new game would be years away at best and possibly <a href="https://x.com/ChrisVannini/status/1939704916269818312">not arrive until 2028 or later</a>. Unless it can get the NCAA and its member schools to pull the plug on 2K’s game, it’ll be coming in late. A big part of what helped <em>EA Sports College Football</em> explode in popularity last year was years of pent-up demand. Now both publishers are in a race to see who can cash in on the latest untapped market for annual sports games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/voidbreaker-was-made-by-one-person-and-might-be-2025%E2%80%99s-best-fps.1283550/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I love it when a game comes out of nowhere and surprises me. Earlier this month, that is exactly what happened when I saw the trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460"><em>VoidBreaker</em> during Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. I downloaded the fast-paced sci-fi roguelike FPS shortly after seeing it, and not only is it good, but it might be one of the best shooters I’ve played all year. And it was made almost entirely by one guy, Daniel Stubbington.</p> <p><em>VoidBreaker</em> is an incredibly fast and sleek first-person shooter available now in early access on Steam and Game Pass PC. The game is set inside a large, highly advanced AI program that is using human test subjects to gather data on combat and warfare. This involves you endlessly fighting and dying over and over again through “runs” of the program’s randomly generated gauntlets filled with various robotic enemies and other odd cyber-opponents. Luckily, very early on, a previous human who was trying to escape the program contacts you to help take the AI down and get out alive. Sadly, your ally is just the digital remains of a very dead person who has a skeleton hiding in your cyberjail’s basement. But while he’s dead, his mind is still in the program and helps you hack the system, slowly unlocking permanent bonuses and new weapons to help you get further during each action-filled run.</p> <p>If some of that sounds silly, it is! And that’s the point. <a href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-pacman-silent-hill-hollow-void-2000619570"><em>VoidBreaker</em></a> leans into the absurd and strange situation you find yourself in, with plentiful jokes delivered by a dry robot announcer during runs. Messages include the program explaining how living forever in pain is better than dying, and how you aren’t alone because the AI is always watching you. It strikes that perfect balance between silly and dark that <em>Portal</em> nailed so many years ago.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="VOID/BREAKER | Launch Trailer | PC Game Pass" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/44fxNXBOvIQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>Another run, another run, another run….</h2> <p>The gameplay loop of <em>VoidBreaker</em> will feel pretty familiar if you’ve played <a href="https://kotaku.com/deadzone-rogue-roguelike-steam-pc-shooter-destiny-2000617173">any roguelike game</a> in the last few years. Each run feels different, as enemy encounters and other sections of the digital gauntlets are randomly generated. As you progress through these runs, you find mods of various rarity levels that give you new abilities, make you stronger or faster, or even change how your gun works. And of course, as in most roguelikes, there’s a currency you earn that can only be used at shops that randomly appear on your path during that run. There’s also a currency that lets you unlock permanent upgrades in the aforementioned secret dead guy basement.</p> <p>So yeah, nothing groundbreaking in <em>Voidbreaker</em>. Instead, the reason to play this new FPS is for the gameplay and combat. Movement in <em>VoidBreaker</em> is incredibly smooth, snappy, and satisfying. This is the kind of game where it’s just fun to run around and jump, even outside of a fight. And gunplay is equally fantastic, with the assault rifle you unlock fairly early into the game being a loud and hectic death machine that sprays enemies with bullets in a way that always makes me happy. Buildings and other structures you spot in the levels can also be <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">destroyed à la <em>Battlefield</em> and crumble upon enemies</a>, stunning or even killing them. Oh, and you can pick up most items using a <em>Half-Life</em>-like Gravity Gun mechanic and fling them back at baddies, too.</p>

 <p>As you upgrade your character during runs, adding ice bullets, improving your Gravity-Gun-thingy, unlocking fire attacks, and collecting super-powerful grenade mods, the action in <em>VoidBreaker</em> can become extremely chaotic. At times, it became nearly too much for my eyes to keep track of as my rifle spat out electrically charged bullets covered in energy fields, buildings collapsed around me, and enemies filled the arena with various red projectiles that can do a lot of damage if you aren’t careful. It can be a lot, and I think for some it might be too much. But I enjoyed every moment of it, even if there were definitely times when I was just spamming my abilities and grenades toward a massive cloud of destruction and death and hoping for the best.</p> <p>But the chaos is part of the fun, and death isn’t that big of a deal in <em>VoidBreaker</em>. After all, it just gave me another excuse to load back up in my weird, sparse cyber apartment/prison and quickly say hi to the skeleton in the basement before hopping back out for one more run. I’m excited to see how the game expands in early access. Now, I need to go and play more <em>VoidBreaker</em>. Just one more run. I’ll go to bed eventually. It’s only 2 a.m….</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Sports College Basketball Game Might Be In Trouble]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-college-basketball-game-might-be-in-trouble.1283547/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans may have to pump the brakes on the EA Sports College Basketball game. Just days after EA Sports’ Vice President of Business Development Sean O’Brien said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-is-up-for-the-challenge-of-bringing-back-college-basketball" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA was “up for the challenge”</a> on building a game, a new report suggests that the game has hit a snag.</p>



<p>Sports Business Journal (SBJ) reports that schools are <strong>“weighing with rival video game developer 2K Sports for a separate product.”</strong> </p>



<p><a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/08/28/sources-ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game-talks-hit-snag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to the report</a>, one of the big issues involves EA Sports’ proposal, including an exclusivity license. EA’s College Basketball game was planned to be the only “action simulation” college basketball game, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-ceo-college-basketball-include-all-350-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">involved all Division 1</a> men’s and women’s programs.</p>



<p>Though talks remain <strong>“active and fluid”</strong>, there is the potential that EA Sports walks away from the game altogether if it can’t retain the exclusive license. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming had been working on a similar story ahead of SBJ’s report dropping, and <strong>can corroborate that 2K has continued</strong> to become a serious contender for the rights to college basketball. As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/report-2k-sports-plans-college-basketball-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported in the past,</a> 2K Sports believes it can turn around a standalone game more quickly than EA, due to its already built-in engine used for the NBA 2K franchise.</p>



<p>Those who spoke under the condition of anonymity believe that, if 2K wanted to and a deal was reached with schools, a game could come by 2027, at the earliest. </p>



<p>Said one source on Thursday, <strong>“Once EA put out the announcement, it lit a fire to increase the push and try and get something done.”</strong></p>



<p>Originally, 2K’s proposal to the College Licensing Company called for a non-exclusive license that would see College Basketball be added to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-sports-wants-to-add-college-basketball-to-nba-2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NBA 2K in the form of DLC</a>. This DLC, as per the proposal, would initially start with limited teams before expanding each year, potentially culminating in a full college basketball game should it reach certain milestones.</p>



<p>This standalone game would likely not include every Division 1 program, and instead focus on larger schools, with “more than 100 men’s and women’s teams that would all receive ‘fair market value’ as well for their NIL”.</p>



<p>One program already aboard with 2K is UCLA, which <a href="https://www.licenseglobal.com/basketball/ucla-men-s-and-women-s-basketball-confirmed-for-2k-college-basketball-project" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced on Thursday</a> that it had signed a deal with the publisher. </p>



<p><strong>“We’re excited to confirm we’ve entered into non-exclusive long-term partnerships with multiple elite colleges, including UCLA with more to be announced soon, as we embark on a new college basketball project,”</strong> a representative from 2K told SBJ. <strong>“We’ve been building NBA 2K into more than a game for decades, representing all that is basketball on and off the court along with basketball culture at-large. It’s a platform driving the sport and culture forward, and we intend to do the same for the college experience too. We look forward to sharing more about our plans for our college basketball project in the future.”</strong></p>



<p>In a statement, the NCAA said that it was “negotiating a comprehensive licensing agreement” that would benefit both men’s and women’s student athletes. </p>



<p><strong>“[While] the NCAA remains open to working with a gaming partner to do that, it appears the market has chosen to go in a different direction for the time being,” </strong>the organization said.</p>



<p>2K’s interest in a college basketball game, along with EA’s, <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1869824116339159465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was first reported</a> in December 2024.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA and 2K for comment on the latest report surrounding the future of College Basketball games. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plus, massive discounts on the PlayStation Store. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re coming up on Labor Day weekend, which closes out the summer and tends to be a popular occasion to drop prices. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/labor-day-sales-2025">Labor Day sales</a> have already gone live at most major retailers, with deals worth checking out on everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/target-lego-deals-labor-day-sale-2025">LEGO sets</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-gaming-pc-labor-day-sale-2025">gaming PCs</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the first thing I’m looking for in any of these sales is discounts on physical games. Surprisingly enough, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-labor-day-sale-2025">Amazon's Labor Day sale</a> has listed first-time discounts on some of the latest and greatest PS5 games, while the PlayStation Store has launched its own sale on digital editions. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Amazon Drops Prices on the Latest PS5 Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The physical games I’ve listed above are all at or close to their lowest-ever prices. The discounts aren’t mind-blowing, I know, but they are the first price drops we’ve seen on recent releases like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 and College Football 26, both of which just came out in July. The Tony Hawk remake has been especially popular here at IGN, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review">Luke Reilly’s review</a> saying it "proves yet again the series’ over-the-top skateboarding formula is totally timeless." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another personal recommendation is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">Split Fiction</a>, the latest two-person adventure from It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios. This discount is made all the better by the fact that the co-op game only requires one person to buy it, while the other can download the game through Friend’s Pass. You could go 50/50 with a friend and grab the GOTY contender for $20 each. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Split Fiction - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">SEGA is generally going hard on the discounts right now, with an ongoing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/SEGAPublisherSale2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publisher sale on Steam</a> and price cuts on those games at pretty much every retailer. Last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> is the highlight I've included here, but you can also find discounts on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona games</a> as well as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-games-in-order">Yakuza series</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Playstation’s Ready, Set, Play! Sale: Up to 75% Off Digital Games</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While not branded as having anything to do with Labor Day, the Playstation Store has launched its Ready, Set, Play! sale at the same time as the holiday weekend. The promotion mainly applies to digital games and features separate discounts from what you’ll find on physical games at retailers like Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You won’t find as many discounts on new releases (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-2025">PlayStation Plus</a> is the way to go for those), but the deals you will find are pretty massive. I’d take it as a good opportunity to do some homework before the big sequels we have coming up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A bundle of the two most recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-games-in-order">Resident Evil games</a> (outside of remakes) has dropped to just $19.99, giving you a solid gateway to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, while The Witcher 3 drops below $8 as we get ready for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">The Witcher 4</a>. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">What About PS5 Console Deals? </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, I haven’t seen any discounts on PS5 consoles, which isn’t too surprising in light of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-5-price-rises-for-us">recent price hikes</a>. If you're desperate for the console, I highly recommend checking out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/certified-refurbished-ps5-deals-at-playstation">PlayStation's Certified Refurbished options</a>. Otherwise, here's to hoping we miraculously see some deals around Black Friday. <br>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dying Light: The Beast is due out in a little less than a month from the time of this writing, as it'll arrive on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on September 19, 2025. As part of the road to launch, developer Techland has debuted a new trailer, and more interestingly, shown off some behind-the-scenes concept art, and gone into detail about the team's design intentions with multiple elements of the game in a <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dev-blog-they-tried-to-break-him">new developer blog</a>.</p>



<p>Techland delves into Kyle Crane's return, and the artistic direction behind what he looks like now after a decade of imprisonment, and how to tell the story of his time in captivity without the player being able to constantly look at his face in what Techland refers to as an FPP game (first-person parkour). Kyle's arms, then, were given great focus.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Part 1: Torture &amp; Suffering" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mB56AIZV3Hw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>In an FPP game, it’s difficult to convey the appearance of a character, since one of the few elements visible are the hero’s hands. That’s why we put a lot of effort into the details here. A special shoutout to Charidimos Bitsakakis, who, accompanied by other artists, spent countless hours perfecting them. We recreated Kyle’s hands from the first game, but added scars and other marks reflecting the torture he endured in the Baron’s lab. The experiments also gave rise to the Beast Mode, which we wanted to be visible in FPP as well - we looked for a visual language to represent his transformation and decided on black veins, dark and menacing, perfectly reflecting Kyle’s nature and what he sees when he becomes the Beast.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption>Dying Light: The Beast. Image credit: Techland</figcaption></figure>



<p>The blog also digs into the ways Techland looked to evolve gameplay in Dying Light: The Beast through tweaking and adjusting Kyle's animations, that they should both "<em>be inspired by DL1 Kyle - reflecting his muscle memory, personality, and fighting style</em>," and have "<em>a clear contrast between Kyle in the beast mode - brutal, uncontrolled, overconfident - and Kyle outside of it - pragmatic, precise, and confident</em>."</p>



<p>It's alltogether great dive into Kyle Crane and Dying Light: The Beast for fans who are eagerly anticipating the game's release next month.</p>



<p>When Wccftech checked out Dying Light: The Beast in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-final-hands-on-pc-preview/">a preview earlier this year</a>, Kai Tatsumoto found that Crane had indeed been turned into a beast, saying it was the one "<em>certain</em>" thing about the game, even after only checking out an early portion.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/grim-hollow-2024-bundle-brings-dark-fantasy-to-dd-beyond</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grim-hollow-2024-bundle-brings-dark-fantasy-to-d-d-beyond.1283487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new pair of third-party books is available for pre-order on D&amp;D Beyond. The <em>Grim Hollow: 2024 Bundle</em> brings a revised version of Ghostfire Games' dark fantasy world of Etharis to the platform. Notably, it is the first third-party book to use the new 2024 ruleset.</p>

<h2>The <em>Grim Hollow: 2024</em> Bundle Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://marketplace.dndbeyond.com/category/CBGCH9A2W" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, the <em>Grim Hollow: 2024 Bundle</em> will contain two books: the <em>Grim Hollow: Player's Guide</em> and the <em>Grim Hollow: Campaign Guide</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grim-hollow-2024-bundle-monster-hunter-artwork.jpg?itok=MJkkjUC9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grim-hollow-2024-bundle-monster-hunter-artwork.jpg?itok=juzsUltN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Importantly, these books contain updated rules and mechanics from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2024. This is not to be confused with the <em>Grim Hollow: Player Pack</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/two-ghostfire-gaming-adventures-are-now-available-to-purchase-on-dd-beyond-continues" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Lairs of Etharis</em></a> material, which were designed with the 2014 rules in mind. If you already own this material, it is still compatible with this new edition.</p>

<p>The <em>Grim Hollow: 2024 Bundle</em> is packed with material for players who want to add darker themes and horror to their <em>D&amp;D</em> game. This includes 21 new player species, 40 new subclasses, 25 backgrounds, 41 feats, 102 new spells, 113 dark fantasy-themed magic items, and 82 advanced weapons. The <em>Player Guide</em> even includes a new character class: the Monster Hunter.:</p>

<p>For GMs, there is plenty to enjoy as well. There are 24 monsters, 10 detailed battlemaps, in-depth lore of the seven different regions of the land of Etharis, and grittier rules for resting, wounds, and corruption. Will your adventurers resist, or fall into murky moral greys?</p>

<p>The corruption isn't metaphorical either. The unique selling point of <em>Grim Hollow</em> are rules where players can slowly become monsters, including vampires, werewolves, demons, liches, avenging angels, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In 2014, before allegations of sexual misconduct against him became public, actor Kevin Spacey was one of the biggest names out there thanks to Netflix’s <em>House of Cards</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/kevin-spacey-the-kotaku-review-1654032299">And his role in that year’s<em> Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</em></a> was a highlight. But now, it feels like a problematic relic. However, the game’s director, Glen Schofield, doesn’t think the shooter is “tainted,” even if Spacey was “weird” to work with.</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/kevin-spacey-got-a-little-weird-on-the-set-of-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-we-all-had-to-fake-laugh/">In an interview with<em> PC Gamer</em>,</a> Glen Schofield was asked about Spacey’s involvement in<a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-call-of-duty-games-from-worst-to-best-1844765026/20"><em> Advanced Warfare</em> as the shooter’s main villain</a>. In 2014, Spacey delivered a fantastic performance that was praised by many critics and fans. In 2017, his role in the game became less celebrated after accusations of sexual harassment and assault were levied against the actor. While years later, he was ultimately not found liable for harassment and was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/26/uk/kevin-spacey-trial-jury-verdict-intl/index.html">acquitted of assault</a>, Spacey’s reputation was still heavily damaged, and he appeared in fewer film and TV roles. Despite that, Schofield told the outlet that Spacey’s inclusion “doesn’t taint the game.”</p> <p>“At the time, that’s the actor I wanted,” said Schofield.&nbsp;“When he was on set, and we said action, he was unbelievable. He just is a great actor, right? Then when we said cut, you could tell the video games weren’t his thing. We had to get him a trailer. So he had a trailer outside that he would go in and he was a little bit more difficult, I would say.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="et" dir="ltr">On set filming <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CallofDuty</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AdvancedWarfare?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AdvancedWarfare</a>! <a href="http://t.co/2Q0jZPkiwT">pic.twitter.com/2Q0jZPkiwT</a></p> <p>— Kevin Spacey (@KevinSpacey) <a href="https://twitter.com/KevinSpacey/status/464570512510042112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2014</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Advanced Warfare’</em>s director did claim that Spacey “got a little weird once in a while on the set.” Schofield added, “He would say things that just weren’t proper. We all had to fake laugh. There was some stuff.”</p> <p>Schofield explained that the initial pitch for <em>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare 2</em> involved Spacey’s character returning in some form despite dying in the previous game. However, Activision passed on that pitch, which he’s grateful for now.</p> <p>“We were going to go there,” Schofield admitted, “and I’m glad we didn’t, because it was like two months before we would have shipped when the scandal broke.”</p>

While previously, Nightreign's ongoing challenging endgame content has been limited to more difficult bosses, Deep of Night will impact an entire run, from start to finish.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, enemies will just be stronger than normal across the board. You also won't get a heads up about which Nightlord you'll be fighting, nor will you know if you're getting a Shifting Earth event in advance, so you won't be able to prep a build for any specific type of run.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, to counterbalance this, players will be able to collect new types of weapons and relics with even more powerful effects...though they may also have some new drawbacks attached as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you play and win Deep of Night you will descend to deeper depth levels, going at least as far as Depth 5. Each new Depth gets even more challenging, though losses will push you back up to easier Depths.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-say-theyve-uncovered-an-entirely-new-ultra-hard-game-mode">This mode was previously datamined</a>, with dataminers getting all the announced details correct. Not announced but suggested by the datamine is that Deep of Night will feature skill-based matchmaking, and that some enemies will get special additional effects, such as being "magmafied," or covered in magma. The datamine also suggests that players can unlock access to three additional relic slots for Deep of Night only, giving them up to a total of six.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign a 7/10</a>, saying "when Elden Ring Nightreign is played exactly as it was designed to be played, it’s one of the finest examples of a three-player co-op game around – but that's harder to do than it should be, and playing solo is poorly balanced." The game recently got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-finally-gets-duos-mode-with-patch-102-game-balance-adjusts-to-the-current-number-of-players">a much-requested duos mode</a>, and currently has two Everdark Sovereign bosses available for players wanting a challenge before Deep of Night: Libra, and Caligo.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Sucker Punch Productions announced <a href="https://x.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1961111668345241612" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a> that their upcoming game Ghost of Yōtei has officially gone gold. This means the game is fully completed and has been sent to be mastered for physical copies, although of course, these days a studio's work is never done. Sucker Punch will still likely continue up to the last minute for the day-one patch, and even beyond that. We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">know</a> that Ghost of Yōtei, like its predecessor, will receive a 'Legends' multiplayer mode in 2026, free for all owners of the game.</p>



<p>A spiritual successor to 2020's Ghost of Tsushima, the new game is however set in a different place, at a different time, and with a different protagonist. In this one, players will step into the role of Atsu, who at the beginning of the game is nearly killed alongside her family by the so-called Yōtei Six, led by the renegade samurai Lord Saitō and consisting of the Snake, the Oni, the Kitsune, the Spider, and the Dragon. Sixteen years later, Atsu roams the surroundings of the titular Mount Yōtei to exact bloody vengeance on the aforementioned group.</p>



<p>New features compared to Ghost of Tsushima include dynamic weather effects, such as snow, rain, and auroras, inspired by the real-life environment surrounding Mount Yōtei. Additionally, Sucker Punch has <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-ghost-of-yotei-details-from-sucker-punch-dig-into-yoteis-non-linear-campaign-story-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the game's flexible, nonlinear quest structure allows players to choose the order in which they confront the Yōtei Six, fostering emergent narrative paths and player-driven momentum. Similar to the first game, players can take on side missions, such as hunting outlaws for bounty rewards. Several side activities also return, including bathing in an onsen and cutting bamboo, as well as new activities such as sumi-e painting and setting up a campsite where Atsu can cook and play her shamisen.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-similar-length-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game length</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-has-a-similar-sized-map-to-tsushima-but-it-has-been-designed-to-feel-larger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">map size</a> are said to be similar to the previous entry, though the developers also said that the game world will feel larger, owing to the real environments. Ghost of Yōtei will be released on October 2 for PlayStation 5, with a PC version practically assured to follow in about a year or so, given Sony's recent policy.</p>

Some are <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-man-s-sky-planet-porn-ghgs-hello-games-1849655173">breathtaking paradises</a> that look straight from the cover of a sci-fi paperback. Others are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1kedf8j/rip_my_permadeath_file_beautifully/">deadly traps</a> ready to claim unsuspecting travelers as their next victims.</p><p>It’s less often that you hear about the weird creatures living on these procedurally generated space rocks.

Lounging on tall grass under blue skies was what looked like—how else can I describe it—a dick and balls. Buoyant and springy, it greeted UnderstandingDull174 with the best of intentions.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 14's community is once again in a tizzy about the use of mods in game, to the point where the game's producer and director, Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P), <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9e5517bca992ff35133f519db15eb456d2183251" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has weighed in</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some background. While modding is an extremely common practice across many games, including other MMORPGs like World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy 14 has always had a slightly more hostile relationship with them. That's not to say players don't use mods in FF14 - they absolutely do. But officially, they're not allowed. Even so, Square Enix has largely operated for a long time on a policy of letting mods slide...as long as players aren't too loud or obvious about it. So players might use mods to customize their UIs, or change the way their character looks just on their own screen. As long as they aren't interfering with other people's games or, say, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14s-latest-raid-sparks-controversy-as-world-first-winners-accused-of-cheating">being very public about their mod use</a>, the publisher has mostly turned a blind eye.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But that strategy hasn't always worked out for Square Enix, especially due to the lack of real clarity for players as to what Square Enix will be permissive about, versus what it will immediately ban. And recently, mods have been in the crosshairs of the developer once again. Earlier this year, Yoshi-P himself <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-director-yoshi-p-threatens-legal-action-against-stalking-mod">threatened legal action</a> after a mod went around that could track other people's player data - a mod that's pretty obviously not permitted by any standards. But more recently, a different, less obviously problematic mod has entered the discourse: Mare Synchronos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mare Synchronos is a mod that's become popular with Final Fantasy 14 players over the years, especially for role-playing communities. Essentially, it lets those who use it "synchronize" their character appearances with those of other players. Here's an example. If I'm playing FF14 and don't have a lot of cool gear to dress my character up in, and don't want to run the content needed to acquire it for whatever reason, I can use a mod that will let my character appear exactly how I want them to - but only on my screen. However, with Mare Synchronos, everyone else using Mare Synchronos can <em>also</em> see that modded appearance. Players who do not use the mod will see my character in whatever bland gear I'm actually wearing. And critically, Mare doesn't actually let you change your character's appearance - other mods are needed for that. Mare just lets you see other mods, and be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, a week ago, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1mwhuzu/final_fantasy_xiv_mod_mare_synchronos_is_shutting/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mare Synchronos announced it was shutting down</a>. The cited reason was that it had received a "legal inquiry" surrounding the project, and after reviewing options, the creator decided to wind it down. It officially went dark last Friday. While some fans were unphased by the shutdown, or even claimed they'd expected it eventually, many others were deeply upset. Though Mare's developer hadn't specified who the legal inquiry was from, many speculating it was likely Square Enix, and even took to the FF14 official forums to complain about the third-party mod shutting down. It's even getting review bombed on Steam right now, currently sitting at "Mixed" recent reviews versus "Very Positive" total reviews.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which is what has prompted Yoshi-P to speak up. In a <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9e5517bca992ff35133f519db15eb456d2183251" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lengthy post on the official Final Fantasy 14 website</a>, the producer reiterated his past-stated stance on mods: he tolerates them. That stance, he says, hasn't changed. Mods made entirely for one's own personal use that only impact the individual using them, Yoshi-P explains, are fine with him. "I'd like to stress the importance that players follow two rules: that their style of gameplay does not infringe upon others, and that they do not negatively impact the core game, its services, or intended game design, as mentioned above."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshi-P goes on to detail exactly what he means by "negative impacting the intended game design" and "infringing upon others." He offers an example of a player, Player A, who loves to raid and acquires a new title and weapon by successfully finishing an Ultimate raid. Player B does not have time to raid, and uses a mod that allows them to see their character with the same title and weapon as Player A. As long as that only displays on Player B's screen, that's not a problem for Yoshi-P.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, where Yoshi-P takes issue is when this begins to impact others. If Player B's changes are visible to Player A somehow, "it considerably negates the cooperation, time, and effort invested, not to mention the pride they might have felt in their achievement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He goes on to illustrate another example that is unacceptable: a mod that allows players to freely equip optional items purchased from the FF14 Online Store and display them to others:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Some may say that Square Enix is to blame for trying to make money by demanding that players spend extra on optional items," he writes. "We operate our servers and data centers twenty-four hours a day, three-hundred-sixty-five days a year with the hope that our players can enjoy a reliable gaming experience. Currently, global inflation is taking its toll at a rapid pace, driving up server electricity costs, the cost of land, and even the price of servers themselves. We do not want to increase subscription fees for players, if at all possible─but keeping our game running requires sufficient income. If we start creating a deficit, FFXIV may no longer be able to operate. This is an example of damage dealt to the services we provide."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a third example, Yoshi-P mentions the possibility of a mod that displays a character completely naked. Even if this is only displayed on the player's screen, he explains how it could potentially still be harmful. For instance, if a player posts a screenshot of their naked character on social media, FF14 may face legal consequences.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I ask that all players in turn respect our game by enjoying their fun within the confines of some basic rules.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"Laws that regulate the content of video games grow stricter by the year," he says. "These laws are there to protect minors and for a variety of other reasons, but the fact remains that they are tangibly becoming stricter. We have a duty to provide our services in adherence to the laws of all countries where FFXIV is available, and if we are unable to do so, the distribution of our game can be prohibited. This is another example of damage dealt to our services."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshi-P ends his post by saying he intends to listen to player feedback and try to increase the freedom of players to equip different types of gear. "While paying respect to the long-standing tradition of modding PC games, I ask that all players in turn respect our game by enjoying their fun within the confines of some basic rules," he concludes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this post contains some much-needed clarification, it ultimately does leave Final Fantasy 14 in the same odd limbo state it's always been in: no mods allowed, except it's fine if no one ever knows you're using them. While that will likely be sufficient clarification for many players, it's still a potentially frustrating place for players who have built their gameplay styles around the modding community and what it has to offer. At least over on console, no one has anything to worry about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> dropped a bunch of new collabs in quick succession this week with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-gorillaz-season-in-fortnite-festival/1100-6534219/" data-ref-id="1100-6534219">Gorillaz</a>, the Front Man from Squid Game, and the One Punch Man cosmetics on Tuesday and Wednesday. But apparently Epic isn't done with this week just yet, because the Fortnite Instagram account just teased a new skin based on a space dwarf from the co-op shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic/" data-ref-id="5000-460551">Deep Rock Galactic</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4558483-deeprockfortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558483" data-ratio="0.56245662734212" data-width="2882" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4558483-deeprockfortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558483"></a><figcaption>The Fortnite Instagram posted a story teasing the Deep Rock Galactic collaboration.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4558483-deeprockfortnite.jpg"></figure><p>The countdown timer indicates this six-foot-tall dwarf skin will hit the Fortnite item shop on Friday at the usual shop reset time at 5 PM PT. It'll likely have some accessories that come with it, like a pickaxe, back bling, and wrap--though that's not always the case with individual gaming skins like this. The Goat from Goat Simulator, for example, never received any accessories, and Goat Simulator and Deep Rock Galactic share the same publisher. The image above is the entire tease, and so there's no way to tell what else, if anything, might come with it.</p><p>This is a rare example of Fortnite collaborating with another video game that isn't available on the Epic Games Store. It's not something that happens a lot, but it's not particularly shocking either, since Halo just got a slot on the current battle pass despite also not being on EGS.</p><p>Deep Rock Galactic, released in early access on PC and Xbox in 2018 before getting a full release in 2020, is a co-op shooter in which players control their own custom fantasy-style dwarf as they try to mine valuable resources in procedurally generated cave systems on a hostile alien planet. This collaboration is likely pegged to the new spinoff game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-survivor/" data-ref-id="5000-583534">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a>, a chaotic top-down shooter which exits early access in September.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">We're a few weeks removed from the Battlefield 6 open beta, and by all accounts, the test was a massive success. While it was live, the beta <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-open-beta-outpaced-grand-theft-auto-5-on-ps5-and-xbox/2900-6921/#1">topped the Steam charts</a> while also placing highly on both Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5's active-user leaderboards. Once it was over, its absence (and some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/how-to-get-all-free-battlefield-6-skins-and-rewards-in-battlefield-2042/2900-6887/">freebies</a>) prompted a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-prompted-a-huge-spike-in-battlefield-2042-players-for-an-obvious-reason/1100-6534270/">huge spike in sales</a> of its predecessor, Battlefield 2042. The vibes around Battlefield haven't been this good in a while, thanks to that beta.</p><p dir="ltr">Feedback has been coming in quickly since the beta ended, with many fans taking to social media and forums to talk about what they most liked and disliked about this new Battlefield experience. However, there's one particular reaction that I find fascinating, and that's players being happy about the lack of collaborations with outside IP.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4544116-battlefield-6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4544116" data-ratio="0.56140350877193" data-width="1197" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4544116-battlefield-6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4544116"></a><figcaption>Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4544116-battlefield-6.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Forniteification," as some call it, has turned other franchises into interactive IP catalogues, tapping into current trends and nostalgic trips to yesteryear in order to sell skins and other cosmetics. Battlefield's biggest competitor, Call of Duty, has embraced the concept, enlisting a range of established faces from WWE wrestlers to Cheech and Chong to Nicki Minaj into its platoon.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision has since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/">acknowledged fans' criticism</a> that the series has "drifted" from its identity, but I don't know if the company can fully close Pandora's box at this point. Activision may not think so, either: The news that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/">Black Ops 6 skins will not carry over to Black Ops 7</a> notably does not include the battle royale Warzone, where wacky skins will continue to exist--Activision may be trying to find a way to get the best of both worlds.</p><p dir="ltr">Then again, we can't use the term "Fortniteification" without mentioning its namesake, as Fortnite is currently enjoying a season headlined by the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. Name a popular IP across movies, TV, video games, or even music thanks to Fortnite Festival, and there's a chance it's been a part of Fortnite at some point. Fortnite's cartoony style may have immunized it from similar criticism, though; for "military simulations" like CoD and Battlefield, there are expectations of realism that fans aren't always willing to compromise on.</p><p dir="ltr">The devs behind Battlefield 6, to their credit, are talking the talk so far; Vince Zampella recently spoke to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield" rel="nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, where he said that BF6 will "stay true to Battlefield" with cosmetics that stick to what the article calls the "core visual identity of Battlefield." Online forums like Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1mf53ev/battlefield_6_leads_will_avoid_goofy_crossover/" rel="nofollow">seem to be happy</a> with this, with one commenter saying they hope this declaration is "not an empty promise."</p><p dir="ltr">Look, I appreciate those who want Battlefield to be as "authentic" an experience as possible for its fans--whatever that even means. However, it would be completely naive to think that Battlefield won't try its hand at the collaboration game, simply because Electronic Arts likes money and wants to earn as much of it as possible. The main reason those wacky Call of Duty skins appear in the game in the first place is because Activision knows people will buy them, and EA would be silly to leave those potential dollars on the table.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4558499-beavis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558499" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4558499-beavis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558499"></a><figcaption>Call of Duty's recent Beavis and Butthead collaboration.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4558499-beavis.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Please don't misunderstand me: I am not saying that a Battlefield where Ronald McDonald and the Burger King finally settle their score is inevitable (though if Fortnite wanted to take on this hypothetical…). What I am saying, though, is that expecting Battlefield 6 to maintain this lack of collaboration throughout its life cycle is setting yourself up for disappointment, because there's simply too much money to be made in those partnerships.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, there are ways to make the inevitable collaborations with outside IP blend in seamlessly with Battlefield's look and feel; namely, choose partners that are a natural fit for a military simulation sort of game. They're out there, and I'm willing to bet the IP owners would be thrilled to join Battlefield 6 if the game mirrors the success it saw in open beta when it fully launches in October.</p><p dir="ltr">Take <strong>Helldivers 2</strong>, for example. This one doesn't have to go too far--armor skins, perhaps a weapon or two--but the defenders of democracy in Helldivers 2 would make a nice fit into Battlefield 6, even with their futuristic look. Another one that sticks out to me is <strong>Metal Gear Solid</strong>, as I'm sure many Battlefield players who are also MGS fans would love being able to have the official Foxhound logo, or Snake's bandana, or any of Big Boss's many camouflage patterns from MGS 3 on their character. Let's not forget that Battlefield 2042 included <strong>Mass Effect</strong> and <strong>Dead Space</strong> collabs, so EA could always dip into that well again too.</p><p dir="ltr">There's fertile ground for partnerships outside of video game IP as well. <strong>Reacher</strong> on Amazon Prime comes to mind; if Alan Ritchson wanted to record some lines and lend his likeness to a Battlefield version of Jack Reacher, that would fit nicely. EA could even go for a nostalgia hit with another fictional Jack in <strong>24</strong>'s Bauer, especially if Kiefer Sutherland would lend his voice and likeness as well.</p><p dir="ltr">These are off-the-cuff ideas, but the overall theme remains consistent; with some restraint, Battlefield 6 could jump into the Scrooge McDuck money bin that is outside IP collaboration, but do it in a way that "stays true to Battlefield" as Zampella suggests is the plan. Partnering with other IP owners doesn't mean you immediately have to throw Pennywise the Clown into your game; by being selective, EA has an opportunity to walk the fine line and get outside IPs into Battlefield 6 without driving it into becoming a parody of itself.</p><p dir="ltr">I just hope the BF6 teams at DICE and the other studios can figure it out, because if I had to guess, the challenge is going to come to them eventually. There's simply too much money to be made for EA to ignore.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Another massive batch of developers under Microsoft and more specifically under Blizzard have voted in favor of unionization under the Communications Workers of America (CWA), as 450 developers working on Diablo voted for unionization.</p>



<p>Per a press release from the CWA, those who voted for unionizing will join members of the CWA Local 9510 in Irvine, the CWA Local 1118 in Albany, and the CWA Local 6215 in Austin. Microsoft, in keeping with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-signs-labor-neutrality-agreement-with-cwa-will-apply-to-activision-blizzard-60-days-after-deals-closure/">promise made to help push its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King through</a>, has recognized the union. </p>



<p>That's not to say that Microsoft has been entirely welcoming to the hundreds of game developers under it that have unionized in recent years. It took the ZeniMax QA union, the first major union to form under Microsoft thanks to the deal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">two years to reach a deal</a>, and they eventually had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/unionized-microsoft-developers-authorize-strike-after-failing-to-reach-a-deal-after-two-years-of-negotiations/">strike</a> to help get its deal through. </p>



<p>There are still <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/">other unions</a> under Microsoft working for a deal, but still, it's all a step towards creating a better situation for the developers.</p>



<p>"<em>With every subsequent round of mass layoffs, I've witnessed the dread in my coworkers grow stronger because it feels like no amount of hard work is enough to protect us</em>," said Kelly Yeo, producer on Diablo. "<em>I am overjoyed that we have formed a union—this is just the first step for us joining a movement spreading across an industry that is tired of living in fear. We are ready to begin fighting for real change alongside our Diablo colleagues.</em>"</p>



<p>Nav Bhatti, senior software engineer on Diablo added, "<em>My entire career as a developer has seen my peers and I paying the ‘passion tax’ for working in an industry that we love</em>. <em>At some point you have to choose between fight or flight, and forming a union is us doing just that — standing our ground in the industry.</em>"</p>



<p>This is the latest wall-to-wall unionization effort at Blizzard since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/">Overwatch 2 team </a>formed its union, and if the reports we've heard, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-king-layoffs-chaos-microsoft-mandatory-daily-ai-use/">continue to hear</a>, about working conditions under Microsoft are even half true, it likely won't be the last as workers continue to fight for a better quality of life. </p>
