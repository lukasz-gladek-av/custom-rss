            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><em>Gladlands </em>is the latest <em>Dimension 20</em> adventure to hit Dropout. Functioning as a spin on a post-apocalyptic adventure where everyone is nice and trying to help out one another instead of fighting over resources, think of it as the most wholesome <em>Mad Max</em> spinoff you've ever seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Going on this adventure are <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/ify-nwadiwe-and-jacob-wysocki-chat-never-stop-blowing-up-being-new-at-table-and" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b02fe4e6-1370-402b-a680-949a73bfa736" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Jacob Wysocki</a>, Oscar Montoya, Vic Michaelis, and Kimia Behpoornia, among others. Midway through the season, TechRaptor was able to sit down and hear from these performers about what piqued their interest in the project, how they created their unique characters, and what role they think they'd have in the post-apocalypse.</p><p dir="ltr">Starting at the beginning, I asked each how they were approached for the project and what made them say yes. Montoya started "The pitch was essentially, this is a post-apocalyptic world, but instead of devolving into chaos, it's what happens if a caravan of people decide to spread positivity and joy."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Joining The <em>Gladlands </em>Caravan</h2><p dir="ltr">At first, Montoya was in, but when it was revealed who else would be joining the cast, it became a much more enticing offer.</p><p dir="ltr">"Oh, you mean all of my favorite people in the whole wide world? Well, of course I'm in."</p><p dir="ltr">For Wysocki, he explained that <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Brennan Lee Mulligan </a>"hit him with the math," and while he understood the idea, it wasn't fully clicking. "These are two entities that I recognize," those entities being: <em>Mad Max</em> and 'being nice,' "and I know there's a place where they meet, but it didn't immediately click. It required me probably asking fifteen minutes of questions, but Brennan had it all locked and loaded because he's fucking Brennan, and I see the needle we're trying to thread."</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">This idea of excitement to play in a game with all of your friends was a sentiment shared by Michaelis and Behpoornia. They shared their story in tandem, first with Michaelis rejecting the idea before learning who would be on it.</p><p dir="ltr">"David Kerns hopped on a call and said 'literally all of your best friends are going to be here, and it's <em>Gladlands</em>, it's going to be post-apocalyptic like Mad Max but things are better.'" From there, Michaelis texted Behpoornia to confirm.</p><p dir="ltr">"I got an email and I was like 'hmm, I want to do it but maybe I should wait it out' and then I got a text from Vic being like 'hey, are you doing this D20, I got all the information, here's everyone who's gonna be there, here's what's going to happen…' and I was like Oh great, somebody got all the info, somebody I really trust and then it was just all my friends there at the table."</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"There was all my friends there, that's kind of all I needed… they should have led with that" - Behpoornia on accepting a role in <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Talking further about having so many friends at the table, Michaelis added, "So much of improv is about the chemistry that you have with people. It's something that we deal with all the time in Very Important People, when you already have that base shared language it's way easier to jump into something, and you get to places that you never would have known before."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Choosing A Post-Apocalyptic Character</h2><p dir="ltr">In this future setting, each performer has created a truly one-of-a-kind character. Wysocki roleplays as KoKoMo, a nine-foot-tall hairy 'snorlaxian, totoroian' character. Montoya is a drag queen, Poppy Persona, Michaelis is a pale corvid-cosplaying mortician, Hugi, and Behpoornia is a normal human man with a 20-pack abs and a cockroach head.</p><p dir="ltr">For inspiration on KoKoMo Wysocki, "his head first went to the 'glad' side of things. I thought about childcare and how these communities, other than western society, raise children and pod them together and there's more of a community effort to look after people than a nuclear family. Then I went to the <em>Mad Max</em> side of things and thought 'what would mutate into that?' and I started to think of a big round couch boy."&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">"Then I think I rewatched <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> just for vibes, and I was like yeah, this is that" - Wysocki on creating Kokomo</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Poppy Persona takes inspiration from Aunt Entity, Tina Turner's character in <em>Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome,</em> mixed with Montoya's real-life experience as the Drag Queen Ozma. "When Brennan gave the premise, my immediate reaction was 'Oh! Tina Turner in Beyond Thunderdome' and to me I've always seen Aunt Entity as a Drag Queen because she has to be this larger than life personality to run the Thunderdome."</p><p dir="ltr">"I was like, 'What would my character's Thunderdome be?' and it would be like Drag Queen Story Hour. So that's where the character of Poppy Persona was created."</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-poppy.jpg?itok=AgchLUFb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1079">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-poppy.jpg?itok=2DChsHcy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I did ask if there were any other Drag Queen influences that he was drawing on, but Montoya explained, "No, I tried to stay away from any existing Drag Artist. They're all incredible artists."</p><p dir="ltr">Behpoornia's approach was to start with one idea and then iterate upon it. "When I heard it was post-apocalyptic, I thought cockroaches survive that long, it usually helps me in brainstorming when I trust my first idea and then go deeper into that."</p><p dir="ltr">"So then I went, 'how do I make this matter?', if it has survived this long, it's probably a lonely guy, and if it's part of a caravan going around to communities being used for the ability that it can't die, then how does that feel? Does he feel used in that way? It's also such a big idea, I wanted to make any lesson he learned kinda bite sized, so I made him a dumb guy, so everything he experiences, he can sum up the way a kid might."</p><p dir="ltr">For Hugi, Michaelis's inspiration was in the pages of the book <em>From Here To Eternity</em>, "which is about cultural death practices and things that are unique to different cultures, and it really took it from an anthropological standpoint. It made grief a lot more accessible. It was interesting exploring the way a community deals with death, especiallyone &nbsp;that has been ravaged and was one generation away from this mass extinction event."</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-hugi.jpg?itok=9v2P88ct 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1076">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-hugi.jpg?itok=nbVDDOyu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="673">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">"People are still going to die in the <em>Gladlands </em>and the way that we as a society handle death is really important because it's very indicative of the type of society that we live in and so having someone around that's going to treat that with care and respect and to make the people going through that feel seen and honored I think is important to a healthy society. But it's also a job that people don't want to do, so what does the guy who does that look like?"</p><p dir="ltr">As each character could have their own mutations for different body parts, and other irregularities, I was interested to know if that made the character creation process easier or more difficult to nail down a character design. Wysocki explained it was quite the opposite, "It's sort of an easy out in the sense that you can just say 'well, I just mutated that way,' you can't argue with that. It does give you a lot of freedom, so much freedom that somebody's dad could be a motorcycle."</p><p dir="ltr">"Or that you can be the hottest bodied person ever and have the body of a bug" Montoya added, referencing Behpoornia's Tess Tube5.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">First And Second Times In The Dome</h2><p dir="ltr">Interestingly while <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> is the 27th season of Dimension 20 for Wysocki and Montoya this was their second time in the Dome, and for Michaelis and Behpoornia it was their first. I was interested to know how it was coming back for the second time, as well as what they came away with from the experience if it was their first time on Dimension 20.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm more comfortable now, I'm not as intimidated by what the Dome is and how important it is to a lot of people," explained Wysocki "to be supported by very great people there was no way to lose."</p><p dir="ltr">Montoya echoed similar sentiments, "I felt super comfortable because I'd done it before, the first time I was learning how to play the game while I was playing it, but even when it had wildly different mechanics it was a lot easier for me to RP, and that was the easy part of it, AND I get to RP with my friends? Say less, I'm good."</p><p dir="ltr">For those new to the Dome they had experience in playing some home games "which were really fun, but I don't think necessarily prepared me for the amount that you have to be doing in the Dome when you're being filmed and recorded" Michaelis joked.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension-20-gladlands-table-reaction.jpg?itok=rzAtC7bF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1079">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">"I also hadn't played very much," Behpoornia added "this is what I think all of them are and I'm hearing that it's kind of an outlier here because we're not doing much combat, big bads, magic spells, all of that. So if I had to go back and do something like that I'd be so confused."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Improv Bits In A Strange New World</h2><p dir="ltr">Watching <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> the bits that the party make up and stick with are just as outlandish as the setting they're taking place in. Knowing that it was such a strange world it seemed like there was no limit to a punchline. Talking about the 'Yes, and' at the table Montoya jokes "I feared we did go too far."</p><p dir="ltr">"I was wondering 'is any of this usable? We're just having too good of a time riffing and doing bits. That's just a testament to the kind of storytelling ability the Brennan Lee Mulligan has, he was able to steer the ship when things were getting a little bit too chaotic. We also know when to lock in and when to be silly and goofy and stuff"</p><p dir="ltr">On the flip side Behpoornia mused that she didn't think there was any way to take it too far. "Just knowing the people that were there at the table, knowing that anything you did, even if it was crazy, nothing is a mess up. We could have done anything at the table because one, Brennan is such a big brain that's taking us through exactly what we need to do, and two, everyone else there we've known for years and have performed with so it's the safest space to do anything."</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">"I really believe that the only time you can mess up is when nobody is there to back you up," Michaelis added, "With a group like this it's never going to happen, there's going to be somebody who steps in. Even if it doesn't work, there's going to be four of you together"</p><h2 dir="ltr">What Would Your Job Be In The <em>Gladlands</em>?</h2><p dir="ltr">As our time wrapped up and we had finished discussing each characters role I was interested to pose to each of the cast members what role they think they would have in the Gladlands.</p><p dir="ltr">Montoya began "In the Gladlands I would like to think I'd be a Poppy Persona, that's why I created the character, yeah I think that's my answer."</p><p dir="ltr">Michaelis shared that they'd been "constantly threatening to go back to school to be an EMT or a nurse. I think that's probably what I would want to do. Weirdly, I think I'm quite good in hospitals or emergency situations. I'd need the training but I think in a situation like that where there's not TV I'd have a lot more time to focus on studying."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'd maybe want to do some job with the kids in the Gladlands because that just sounds really sweet," mused Behpoornia "It sounds like my level of how I would process living in the Gladlands. So to be someone who can help them process their play in the post-apocalypse sounds like a nice job to have."</p><p dir="ltr">To close us out Wysocki gave the short but sweet answer "I'm just not making it, nah nah nah I like accidentally shoot a president or something"</p><p dir="ltr">You can watch <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> now on Dropout.tv, the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W63ILhEsvGY" rel="nofollow"> first episode is also available via the Dimension 20 Youtube channel.</a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/dimension-20-gladlands-is-mad-max-if-everyone-wasnt-being-so-rude-interview]]></content:encoded>

              <p><span>When you need a tool, you rarely reach for a Swiss Army Knife. It’s an option that only makes sense when you have no other options. Have you ever tried to </span><i><span>actually </span></i><span>cut wood with the shitty and very flimsy saw blade included in a Swiss Army Knife or any other similar kind of multitool? I have. It was a horrible experience, and I ended up buying a saw to finish the job. It turns out shoving many things into one package isn’t an effective way to make something good.</span></p> <p><span>Anyway, have y’all played </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Released on January 26, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136"><i><span>Highguard </span></i></a><span>is a (</span><i><span>deep breath)</span></i><span> free-to-play fantasy-sci-fi MOBA-like 3v3 PVP hero shooter with base defense and raid mechanics. It was first unveiled as the finale of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">2025 Game Awards</a> and received a less-than-stellar reaction from people online. And since then, the conversation about </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>has been very strange and oddly aggressive. People taking sides. Takes being shot out like mortars across social media. It’s one of the weirdest reactions to a video game I’ve seen in many years.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>But I’m not here to talk about that </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>, the one that exists online as a battlefield for takes, opinions, videos, and discourse about the discourse. I’m here to offer a critical look at the </span><i><span>actual </span></i><span>game. The thing people can play right now. And that </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is far less interesting than the conversation and the mess around it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That’s perhaps the biggest problem facing </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>as it enters into its second week leaking players like a toddler spilling juice from their first big kid cup. It turns out </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>just isn’t very interesting.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Bland and boring</b></h2> <p><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is such a boring game to look at. Developers Wildlight Entertainment seem to have been unable to decide what kind of game </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is, and the first sign of that is in how it mixes together fantasy, sci-fi, magic, and modern guns. This blending of genres and tropes can be done well, but not in </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>; every asset and model has had any potential character and grit sanded down to ensure the various pieces blend together.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And they do blend. Perfectly. Too perfectly.&nbsp; Nothing sticks out. There’s no charm. No quirks. Nothing to talk about with people or post online. It’s the kind of game that leaves your brain the moment you stop playing it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I’ve played over 14 hours of the game now across many matches, and I struggle to name a character beyond Slade, an obnoxious blonde dude who is the closest </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>gets to creating something that has personality. Everybody else is a generic tough man or sneaky woman with clothing and armor that looks like what you start an RPG with, and then quickly replace.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s a shame that </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is such a forgettable-looking game because I do think the idea of a raid shooter is a cool concept.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Let’s get ready to raid</b></h2> <p><span>When a match kicks off, you start at your base, pick a hero, and set up defensive walls. Next, you and your two teammates ride out and search for loot on the map. This mostly involves speeding around on your mount and opening chests. The other team is doing the same, and you might run into them.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Eventually, a large sword starts to form in the world, and each team needs to get to it, grab it, and take it to the enemy base to blast open their shield dome and raid the place. Do a good job raiding and the match is over. Fail and this all repeats, but the loot in the world gets better. Once a team pulls off a successful raid, they win.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This might sound complicated compared to a lot of other shooters on the market, and it does take some time to learn how this all works.

That makes sense considering the studio behind </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is made up of devs who worked on that game. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mining-crystals-in-highguard-is-so-damn-satisfying-ps5-pc-steam-2000663527"><span>Breaking large gems out in the world between raids is also extremely satisfying</span></a><span>. I equally enjoyed setting up defenses at my base before heading out to find upgrades. And chasing someone down on the back of a mount is thrilling and not an experience found in most other online shooters. Then you have each character’s unique powers and abilities, which can dramatically change a fight as you drop down a fireblast or whip up a big wall of ice. Oh, and there’s a whole loot economy, in which you need to balance buying better guns with making sure you have enough shields to weather future firefights. And then…</span></p>

 <h2><b>Too many moving parts</b></h2> <p><span>Well, see, we’ve reached the other major problem with </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>: It is trying to be everything.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Similar to its bland art style that makes it feel like the devs couldn’t commit to one idea and instead tossed it all in, </span><i><span>Highguard’s </span></i><span>gameplay is a grab bag of ideas and mechanics from other popular games. And while it would be cool if we could just put ice cream, pizza, wine, and meatloaf into a blender and mix it all up to get something even better, that ain’t how the world works.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The fast, </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span>-like gunplay means you die quickly. This makes going out and getting into fights before raids a chore. The upgrade and crystal economy means you have to spend time hunting down and breaking blue rocks, which, while satisfying to smash, compelling gameplay it doesn’t make. And sure, you get some currency from defeating other players, but late-game gear costs so much and you get so little from kills that during long matches, I felt obligated to stop fighting and instead go mining. The raids, easily the best part of </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>, also make mounts mostly worthless, robbing the game of one of its coolest features. And only having three players on each side makes raids feel less epic, and the bases you defend too big. (Though the devs are already playing around with <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-big-update-free-shooter-future-patch-notes-wildlight-2000664584">a 5v5 mode</a>, which might help.)</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663165" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663165"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663165">© Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In other words, each piece of </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>often gets in the way of the other pieces and can derail the whole experience.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Perhaps </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>will receive weeks and months of updates to improve some of these problems. Perhaps it will add a 4v4 mode to make the map feel less empty. Maybe the time to kill, especially in the early part of matches, will be increased so fights last longer.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But none of that will be able to truly fix </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>. It would take a lot more work to do that. </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is a forgettable shooter that stuffs too much into one game and ends up being a sometimes fun but uneven mess. At least it’s a mess that most players won’t remember for long after they log off. </span></p>

            <guid>1421437</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Bethesda is celebrating the release of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-s2-ep6-super-mutant-character-name-2000662226"><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>season 2’s penultimate episode</span></a><span> by thoroughly upsetting the franchise’s online multiplayer fanbase. It just released the </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4250650/Fallout_76_Mojave_Bundle/"><span>Mojave Bundle</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Fallout 76</span></i><span>: a $30 DLC pack that features some nametags, a couple of items for your in-game camp, and the NCR Ranger Power Armor worn by Maximus in the previous episode. That’s half what the entire game cost back when it launched in 2018.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Those who stuck with </span><i><span>Fallout 76 </span></i><span>throughout its many highs and lows </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-zenimax-fallout-76-crunch-development-1849033233"><span>in the aftermath of its very rough launch in 2018</span></a><span> aren’t impressed. The decision to lock the cool new Power Armor design behind such a pricey one-off payment has been made worse by the fact that you can’t even purchase it through the in-game microtransaction store, the Atomic Shop.</span></p>

 <p><span>That means that if you’ve been saving up your Atoms, the premium currency used to purchase items, either by completing daily and weekly challenges or by slowly accruing them through your monthly $13 Fallout 1st subscription, you’ll still have to shell out an extra $30 just to get this fancy-looking skin. All of <em>Fallout 76</em>‘s seasonal updates are free, but that’s not making it any easier to swallow for some fans.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is CRAZY. They love making you pay a stupid amount of money for NCR stuff. <a href="https://t.co/gfqLCuUSaR">https://t.co/gfqLCuUSaR</a> <a href="https://t.co/aXgFIYhmct">pic.twitter.com/aXgFIYhmct</a></p> <p>— RyGuy (@rydirium) <a href="https://twitter.com/rydirium/status/2016932831084114052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 29, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“I can’t stay silent about how aggressively cash-grabby Bethesda has become since Microsoft acquired them,” reads </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1qqhysl/yeah_the_price_of_the_mojave_bundle_is_ridiculous/"><span>one post</span></a><span> over on the </span><i><span>Fallout 76 </span></i><span>subreddit. “But what makes it even worse is that the game is still full of bugs and issues that haven’t been properly addressed. Clearly, Bethesda’s focus isn’t on fixing the game or delivering a solid experience anymore – they’re just trying to squeeze every cent out of players.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-76-is-free-to-play-until-feb-5-but-if-you-want-that-sick-ncr-power-armor-from-the-fallout-show-its-gonna-cost-you/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span> pointed out, you can currently buy every single mainline </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> game, from the OG </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span>&nbsp;all the way up to </span><i><span>Fallout 4</span></i><span> (and even </span><i><span>Fallout 76</span></i><span> itself), for less than the price of the Mojave Bundle. The fact that players who have been grinding for Atoms don’t even get a discount makes it even worse.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Meanwhile, </span><i><span>Fallout 76</span></i><span> itself has been on a week-long free trial and is currently on sale for just $8. It’s almost like the $30 power armor is Bethesda trying to make it up on the back end. Genuinely impressive that they’ve managed to make Amazon look borderline charitable by comparison, considering they just dropped the first season of </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>on YouTube </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-1-free-to-watch-youtube-prime-2000664098"><span>for free</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Devs Make A Big Change As Player Count Nosedives]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-big-update-free-shooter-future-patch-notes-wildlight-2000664584</link>
            <guid>1421422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After launching on January 26, <em>Highguard</em> has struggled to keep players, according to data on SteamDB. But <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-patch-note-fov-ps5-crash-pc-optimization-2000664201">Wildlight isn’t giving up on the free-to-play raid shooter</a>, and has announced a big<strong>&nbsp;</strong>change for the game: a 5v5 mode.</p> <p>On Friday, Wildlight’s studio head and game director Chan Grenier <a href="https://x.com/ChadGrenier/status/2017271635712352533">teased on Twitter that a “big update”</a> about <em>Highguard</em> was coming, adding “You’ll want to see this one.” About four hours later, after some delay, that update arrived, and it was indeed a biggie. For a limited time, Highguard will offer players a 5v5 mode, a big shift from the game’s 3v3 mode, which many had criticized for being too small and sweaty.</p> <p>“We heard the feedback,” <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2017334052865658987">posted the official <em>Highguard</em> account</a>. “For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode. This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. 3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it! The lobby has been updated to allow for parties of 5 while the mode is live.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You asked, we listened</p> <p>All-new 5v5 limited time mode, playable now! ⚔️ <a href="https://t.co/wBaFZUOCeZ">pic.twitter.com/wBaFZUOCeZ</a></p> <p>— Highguard | LIVE NOW! (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2017333024598221040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The new mode was added as part of a patch that is live now on consoles and PC. 5v5 will only be around for the weekend, for now, and Wildlight warns that adding more players could lead to some performance issues. Still, I’m excited to give <em>Highguard</em> another shot to see if a few more players in the game’s big empty maps could help add some excitement and take some pressure off players having to perform perfectly during team fights.</p> <p>The conversation around <em>Highguard</em> has been a mess ever since it was announced via the final teaser at the <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">2025 Game Awards in December</a>. That trailer failed to excite people online, and a period of radio silence afterward left a big void that was filled by angry commentators, confused gamers, lots of blogs, and random takes from users on sites like Reddit and BlueSky. When it finally arrived earlier this week, it saw a huge influx of curious onlookers, nearly reaching 100k concurrent players according to SteamDB data. But just a few days later, <em>Highguard’s</em> playercount has dwindled as <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220">negative reviews continue to flood the game’s Steam page</a>.</p>

 <p>Will this big change be enough to turn things around, or is <em>Highguard</em> doomed to become another flop in a long line of live-service games that have failed to survive? I’m not sure, but at the very least, it seems Wildlight Entertainment is willing to make big changes to the game to try and keep it around.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-has-reportedly-sold-over-20m-copies-most-of-them-on-steam/</link>
            <guid>1421398</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If <strong>PlayStation</strong> needed another sign that its current push to put its first-party made and published games on both PC and <strong>PS5</strong> was a good idea, it certainly has it with the latest report from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/helldivers-2-sells-20m-copies">Alinea Analytics</a>, which claims that the popular third-person shooter <strong>Helldivers 2</strong> has sold <strong>over 20 million copies</strong>, most of them coming from PC players on Steam.</p>



<p>When Helldivers 2 launched, despite its connectivity issues <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/helldivers-2-not-enough-patriotism/">that hindered the experience</a> and the controversy regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-cancels-mandatory-helldivers-2-psn-account-linking-update/">PC players initially being mandated to connect their PlayStation Network accounts to their Steam accounts to play the game</a>, it was immediately the standout hit multiplayer game of 2024. </p>



<p>It skyrocketed to the top of Steam's charts, and even though it hasn't sustained the same level of popularity it had two years ago, it has successfully carved its own dedicated community out of the swath of multiplayer games people can choose to play. Alinea Analytics even adds that in December 2025, Helldivers 2 had <strong>3.6 million monthly active users</strong> across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>After Helldivers 2 arrived on PC and PS5 at launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-coming-to-xbox-summer/">it came to Xbox Series X/S consoles in summer 2025</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-coming-to-playstation-helldivers-2-warbond/">even ushered in the first instance of Halo coming to PlayStation</a> through a Halo and Helldivers 2 crossover, before <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">Halo was actually announced as coming to PlayStation</a>.</p>



<p>So far, Helldivers 2 has sold <strong>1.6 million copies on Xbox</strong>, <strong>5.6 million copies on PS5,</strong> and the remaining <strong>13.1 million on PC</strong>. According to Alinea Analytics, it has generated over <strong>$700 million in revenue</strong> for developer <strong>Arrowhead Studios</strong> and publisher <strong>PlayStation Studios</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Helldivers-2-Sales-Alinea-Analytics.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Alinea Analytics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The game is nothing but a roaring success, and as Arrowhead continues to update it with new content, it's likely that we're due for a spike in Helldivers 2 popularity from a new expansion, similar to what the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-update/"><strong>Into the Unjust</strong> update</a> did for it last year. Though the most recent update to get excited about was exclusively for PC players, as <strong>Sony's </strong>internal PC porting house, <strong>Nixxes</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-install-size-on-pc-shrinks-by-85-percent-thanks-to-nixxes/">figured out how to shrink the game's install size by <strong>85%</strong>, freeing up a lot of storage space on players' SSDs</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly, as far as previously console-exclusive third-person shooters go, when comparing how <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-surpasses-1-million-players-three-days-after-launch/">Gears of War Reloaded</a></strong> did on PS5 versus Helldivers 2 on Xbox, <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-xbox-sells-more-gears-of-war-reloaded-ps5/">Helldivers 2 is the clear winner, selling more on Xbox than Gears of War has done on PS5</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devir Games has announced an <em>Ace of Spades</em> reboot. After pulling the game from sale after some controversial content, a revised version of the card game is coming this summer along with a new expansion.</p><h2>The <em>Ace of Spades</em> Reboot Announcement</h2><p>According to a report <a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/61522/inappropriate-cards-removed-upcoming-reboot-ace-spades" rel="nofollow">by ICV2</a>, the <em>Ace of Spades</em> reboot will be hitting retail stores on May 2026. The game will be identical to its original release from Gen Con 2025, with some material removed.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>That removed material are several cards depicting the enslavement of African-Americans. Said cards depicted artwork of an enslaved African American and a slaver. According to the designers, the intention was to invoke the Quentin Tarentino western film <em>Django Unchained</em> with the cards. Instead, audiences saw the cards as trivializing the institution of slavery in the American Wild West.</p><p>Devir Games did issue an apology for these cards, stopped all sales of the game, had retail copies recalled, designed new cards to replace the controversial ones, and issued them free of charge.</p><p>Now with the <em>Ace of Spades</em> reboot, this revised version of the game is coming back. As our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/ace-of-space-review-shuffle-deal-draw" rel="nofollow">original review</a> mentioned, the game is a fun, Wild West spin on poker where winning, much like a gun duel, depends on the draw. The new version of the game will be sold at an MSRP of $24.99.</p><p>But this reboot isn't just a formal relaunch. Devir Games has also announced a new expansion for the game, <em>Ace of Spades: Call of the Zombie</em>. This expansion adds 15 new cards to the game, including zombie enemies and four versions of a boss zombie, called Hellbilly. Considering Rockstar Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/look-back-at-red-dead-redemptions-timeless-tale-of-john-marston" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></a> and the TTRPG <em>Deadlands</em> have done this mash-up, it fits here.</p><p><em>Ace of Spades: Call of the Zombie </em>is available for pre-order on Devir Games' website. It is set to release on May 31, 2026, and will be sold at an MSRP of $9.99.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

When news broke, fans immediately started flooding the internet with tributes, condolences, and jokes about how the wrong </span><i><span>Home Alone 2 </span></i><span>star died.</span></p>

<p>The features for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> have officially been revealed, and with that comes the first batch of screenshots for the game. </p>



<p>The screenshots give players a look at new and updated character models, arenas, match types, and more. </p>







<p>WWE 2K26 launches on March 13 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. The series is officially leaving the last-gen Xbox One and PlayStation 4 behind after over a decade.</p>



<p>This year’s game features CM Punk as the game’s main cover athlete and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" id="169985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feature wrestler in the game’s Showcase Mode</a>. Other improvements include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four new and returning match types</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-nintendo-switch-2-features/" id="173149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2-specific features</a>, and a number of updates to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-features-major-updates-to-fan-favorite-game-modes/" id="173163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan-favorite game modes</a>. </p>



<p><strong>“Run the show your way in WWE 2K26, featuring 400+ WWE Superstars and Legends,” </strong>the game’s description reads. <strong>“Light up the ring with all-new match types, relive CM Punk’s greatest moments, and explore the secrets of The Island.”</strong></p>



<p>Speaking of the Island, the mode is officially coming to PC for the first time after skipping the platform in WWE 2K25.</p>



<p>As mentioned, WWE 2K26 launches on March 13. Those who preorder the higher-tiered editions of the game, however, get access to the game a week early on March 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>March is coming up fast, which means it’s nearly time for another <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dose of wrasslin’ game goodness</a>, with 2K officially unveiling WWE 2K26 today. CM Punk is once again gracing the cover this year (a Punk with less gray in his beard appeared on the cover of WWE 2K13) and will be starring in this year’s 2K Showcase mode. Punk is far from the only wrestler in the game, as developer Visual Concepts has apparently packed a whopping 400+ Superstars into WWE 2K26 at launch – a number that will only expand with DLC, etc. You can check out a handful of early screenshots of WWE 2K26, below.</p>

<p>Visual Concepts is also promising four new match types -- I Quit, Inferno, Three Stages of Hell, and Dumpster – as well as some new plunder to use against opponents, such as shopping carts and thumb tacks. Ultimately though, perhaps most exciting for folks like myself who have been playing WWE 2K forever, Visual Concepts have promised a full revamp of the reversal and stamina system, which has long been a glaring weak point for the series. We still don’t know much about <em>how</em> these systems are changing, but apparently the updates will “add a new layer of strategy,” which is exactly the kind of thing I was begging for in last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k25/">WWE 2K25 review</a>. </p>



<p>Here’s a quick rundown of some other new features coming in WWE 2K26…</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>Creation Suite</strong> - 2X the CAS and Image Slots, Plus Body Morphing: The best-in-class customization mode now offers 200 Create-A-Superstar save slots, doubling the existing count in response to community demand. Community Creations now features a doubled image capacity of 2,000, deeper body and face morphing tools, and two-tone hair color blending, giving players unprecedented freedom to craft the Superstars, arenas, and other creations of their dreams.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>MyGM</strong> - More Shows, More Superstars Per Match: New Intergender Matches, 5, 6, and 8-manmatches, plus support for more match types than ever before, vastly increase the number of&nbsp; possible matches and outcomes. More shows per season pose new management challenges in2K’s strategic brand management simulation mode.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>MyRise</strong> - New Theme, Increased Replay Value: Players define their MySuperstar’s journey through two new division-based storylines where villainous or heroic decisions impact MyPlayers like never before. Players can now keep playing even after the main stories are complete, with more unlockable content and achievements to earn for increased replayability.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>The Island</strong> - New Storyline and Environment, Available on All Platforms: 2K’s WWE-themed world is now bigger and more social than ever, and available for the first time on PC. Players will choose one of three factions and battle for control with a revamped progression system. The new Scrapyard Brawl environment, fresh Towers, new shops and branded gear, an expanded MySuperstar builder with face-photo importing, plus upgraded quests, complete with Superstar voiceovers, cutscenes and dialogue screens, enhance the immersive experience.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, WWE 2K26 is coming in the usual dizzying array of special editions, and, in fact, 2K is pushing the bar further than ever this year, with the $150 Monday Night War Edition. Here are the different ways you can buy WWE 2K26:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>The <strong>Standard Edition</strong> is $70.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>King of Kings Edition</strong> will be available for $1oo. King of Kings Edition includes the Standard Edition, Joe Hendry Pack, Ringside Pass Premium Season 1, and 32,500 VC, plus the King of Kings Pack which includes playable Superstars Triple H ‘98 and Stephanie McMahon ‘00, and a “Triple H Signature Taunt” Emote for The Island.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Attitude Era Edition</strong> will be available for $130. In addition to all content included in the King of Kings Edition, Attitude Era Edition includes access to Ringside Pass Premium Seasons 1-4,plus the Attitude Era Edition Pack, which features playable Superstars The Rock ‘99, Kane ‘98, and Chyna ‘97, “Stone Cold” Steve Austin “Rattlesnake” and The Rock “People’s Champ” MyFaction EVO cards, the Raw is War ‘98 Arena, and Undertaker “Thumb Across the Neck” and Shawn Michaels “DX Crotch Chop” Emotes for The Island. The Superstar Mega-Boost is also included, which grants 200 MySuperstar attribute points for MyRise plus 100,000 VC.</em></li>



<li><em><strong>Monday Night War Edition</strong> will be available for $150. In addition to all content included in the Attitude Era Edition, Monday Night War Edition includes access to Ringside Pass Premium Seasons 1-6, plus the Monday Night War Edition Pack, which features playable Superstars Shawn Michaels DX, Macho Man Randy Savage ‘98, Rowdy Roddy Piper ‘98, the WCW Thunder ‘98 Arena, and a Diamond Dallas Page “Bang!” Emote for The Island. Monday Night War Edition also grants entitlement for the WrestleMania 42 Pack, which includes the WrestleMania42 Arena and three WrestleMania 42 Superstar Persona Cards to be automatically entitled post-launch.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Oh, and yes, there will now be a premium battle pass, er, sorry, “Ringside Pass” offered as well. Here are the details on that.</p>



<ul>
<li><em><strong>Ringside Passes</strong> - DLC Gets an Upgrade with More Post-Launch Content Than Ever Before: The all-new Ringside Pass offers players additional incentive to play, earning XP across all game modes, excluding online lobbies. 60 free tiers and 40 premium tiers will be available to reward gameplay, with players who can reach tier 40 of the Ringside Pass Premium Season able to unlock Superstars, cosmetic and customization items, VC, MyFaction and The Island content, and more. The Ringside Pass Premium replaces the previous DLC model, rewarding players with all-new playable characters unavailable on the base game roster, including current Superstars, Legends, Personas, and some unexpected names. Six Ringside Pass Seasons are planned to roll out throughout the year, with Ringside Pass Season 1 available at launch and featuring unlockable Superstars and Legends, previously available in the WWE 2K Supercharger, on the free tier.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>WWE 2K26 hits PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Switch 2 (yes, “last gen” versions seem to finally be behind us) on March 13, unless you buy the King of Kings Edition or above, in which case, you’ll be able to play a week early on March 6.</p>

            <guid>1421326</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> is updating some of the most popular game modes in major ways.</p>



<p>It’s WWE Royal Rumble weekend, and that means that there is a major push regarding marketing for the upcoming WWE 2K26 video game. <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/wrestling/wwe/cm-punk-liv-morgan-bron-breakker-talk-wwe-2k26-as-new-game-info-released">New information from The Takedown on SI </a>confirms several updates coming to the game modes. </p>



<p>In addition to confirming several updates previously reported by Insider Gaming, new details give plenty for longtime fans of WWE video games to be excited about, as it pertains to customization, replay value, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-universe-mode-gets-a-draft-and-more">WWE Universe Mode Gets a Draft and More</h2>



<p>Universe Mode has been a focal point of WWE video games since 2010. Sandbox mode in WWE games lets players be the promoter they’ve always wanted to be, setting up cards, creating rivalries, managing injuries, and more.</p>



<p>This year, WWE 2K26 not only adds a Draft to Universe Mode to increase realism, but also introduces a new Universe Creation Wizard, additional promo types to add more drama to your rivalries, a “Watch Show” mode for those that like pure sim experiences, and more.</p>



<p>MyGM Mode, which acts as a more short-term brand management sim, is also getting some improvements. There will be support for more match types than ever, including intergender and eight-man matches, more shows per season, and new management challenges.</p>



<p>MyRISE, the game’s version of MyPLAYER from NBA 2K, also features major improvements, including the ability to continue their career mode beyond completing the campaign. This year’s campaign will also feature new decision-based storylines in which your choice to keep your customized WWE Superstar as a babyface or a heel will affect the story.</p>



<p>The Island mode will also come to PC for the first time ever.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-creation-suite-options-spark-new-life-in-wwe-2k26">New Creation Suite Options Spark New Life in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>In addition to all of those updates, there are major improvements to the Creation Suite. For the first time, there will be 200 Create-A-Superstar save slots. This is double the existing amount and provides plenty of options not only to create your own stars but also to download popular stars from other promotions. Additionally, Community Creations now supports 2,000 images, advanced body/face morphing, and two-tone hair blending for maximized Superstar and arena customization.</p>



<p>The game is scheduled to release to the general public on March 13, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/">if you pre-order a premium edition</a>, you can get Early Access. For more WWE 2K26, learn about the forthcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-is-going-to-have-a-ringside-pass/" id="173150">Ringside Pass.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Greg Bovino, who was voted “most likely to run a lawless band of white nationalist secret police” in high school based on looks alone, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/27/gregory-bovino-minneapolis-minnesota-alex-pretti-shooting?ref=aftermath.site"><u>might be out</u></a>, but Minnesota is still under siege. 3,000 ICE agents continue to run rampant, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brainnotonyet.bsky.social/post/3mdlzwx6lek2g?ref=aftermath.site"><u>neither side</u></a> of our government seems particularly interested in reining them in. It’s one thing to watch the carnage play out on a phone screen; it’s another entirely to be there. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by Ben Hanson of worker-owned media outlet <a href="https://www.patreon.com/minnmax?ref=aftermath.site"><u>MinnMax</u></a> to talk about what it’s been like covering games – and just generally existing – amid ICE’s violent occupation of Minnesota. Ben tells us about the strange juxtaposition of tragedy (abandoned cars, large portions of the population terrified to leave their homes) and triumph (ordinary people working together to protect their neighbors on a previously unprecedented scale, the generally good vibes of any given protest) that characterizes Minnesotans’ daily existence.&nbsp;</p><p>He also explains his decision to publish <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dyNcRGRXY&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>a video demonstrating what ICE is doing</u></a> to people in Minnesota on the YouTube channel of MinnMax, which, again, typically focuses on video games. Keep politics out of games? Kinda hard to do when politics are literally banging down your door. (MinnMax is also collaborating with Giant Bomb to host <a href="https://www.givemn.org/story/qexfdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>an ICE OUT charity stream</u></a> today, which you should absolutely tune into.)</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that as many people as possible can hear us tell ICE to fuck off. Speaking of, in the unlikely event that an ICE agent is reading this: Fuck off.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Ben: </strong>Some of [our show ideas] are going out in Minneapolis and filming stuff on location, so to speak. And it’s like, well, we just can’t do that. It doesn’t feel safe to be recording and having fun in the streets of Minneapolis these days.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s smaller things. The plan was, Jacob Geller and I were going to do a reaction stream to the <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> Direct that was happening on Sunday. Obviously the most important thing in the world. And then with the second murder happening on Saturday, it was an unbelievably devastating day – a tough day to try to wrap your mind around what’s happening here. Still, throughout that day I was like “I can do the <em>Mario </em>stream, I can do the <em>Mario </em>stream. I can spend ten minutes with Jacob Geller looking at <em>Mario</em>. That seems fine. That seems fine.” It was midnight the night before that I had to reach out to Jacob and be like “I can’t do it. It just feels disingenuous for me to be like ‘Look how cute Yoshi is!’” with “federal murder, federal murder” blinking in my mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Then I ended up watching the <em>Mario </em>movie trailer later in the day, and there’s a freaking scene in it with Luigi being scared, and some <em>Mario </em>enemy comes out of a cave, and Luigi panics and fires a thousand fireballs in it. Even just that connotation of somebody panicking and unloading everything they have with their weapon – not to be a complete wimp about it, but that would have hurt to stream Sunday morning and see that live with everything so prominent in my mind. So it impacts content like that in a strange way, I suppose. It’s odd when it sort of sneaks up on you like that.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Are you introducing your listeners and viewers to what’s happening and to politics, or are most of them pretty clued in?</p><p><strong>Ben:</strong> Most of them are pretty clued in. That was definitely the goal of that standalone video: If you’re not paying attention, maybe this will get you to look at it. Maybe MinnMax has enough clout for you to give it a chance if you’re like “Well, I’m sick of the news. I just want to get away from politics. But I don’t know; if that Ben guy put this together, maybe I’ll watch it. I like his travelogues to GDC.” I don’t know what the comparison is.</p><p>I haven’t seen too many comments of “Wow, I had no idea.” But I have seen a lot of comments of “I’m gonna share this with family members and friends.” That’s impactful. It’s not that common that we’ve seen people be like “F this, stop talking about politics.” We see it every once in a while, but because I think we choose our lanes and try to have an impact, it’s coming from a place that feels like it’s necessary. The part I always like to emphasize too is just that idea of, you can say, “Stop talking about politics,” but at a certain point, this is beyond the realm of politics. When our neighbors are being dragged out of their houses, is it politics to speak up and say, “Uh, guys? We should talk about this! This is happening!”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/i-do-not-feel-safe-in-the-country-international-developers-are-skipping-gdc-because-of-trumps-border-chaos/"><div><p>“I Do Not Feel Safe In The Country”: International Developers Are Skipping GDC Because Of Trump’s Border Chaos [Update]</p><p>‘The reality is the US has become increasingly hostile to foreign nationals regardless of origin’</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202601/64541">Famitsu</a> has shared the latest look at physical sales in the region, and it's Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> that has come out on top with 23,428 units sold in its debut week. That's not a particularly high number, it's true, but considering that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> came in second with almost 14 thousand, it's not bad going.</p>
<p>A couple of other new releases also broke into the top 10 this time, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> and Broccoli's <strong>UN:LOGICAL</strong> making the cut at fifth and sixth, respectively.</p>

<p>Expectedly, the Switch 2 has remained on top of the hardware side of things, with an additional ~72,000 units under its belt. The standard Switch model sold marginally more than the OLED this week, interestingly, but neither was enough to overtake the PS5 Digital Edition or the Switch Lite.</p>
<p>Combining the three SKUs for Switch this time gives us a total of 17,515, while the trio of PS5 models combine for 9,766.</p>

			<p><strong>Amazon's</strong> upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong> is certainly ramping up, as we've just had another <strong>three casting announcements</strong> after two new cast members were announced just yesterday. A report from <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-series-alastair-duncan-mimir-brok-sindri-1236645903/">Variety</a> confirms previous rumours that <strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> <strong>will</strong> <strong>reprise his role as Mimir</strong>, while <strong>Danny Woodburn</strong> (Seinfeld, 90210) and <strong>Jeff Gulka</strong> (The X Files, Once Upon a Time) will play the dwarf brothers <strong>Brok</strong> and <strong>Sindri</strong>, respectively.</p>



<p>Duncan, Woodburn, and Gulka are the sixth, seventh, and eighth additions to the cast that we've heard about, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/"><strong>Ryan Hurst</strong> was cast as <strong>Kratos</strong></a>, followed by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Teresa Palmer </strong></a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">getting tapped to play <strong>Sif</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/"><strong>Max Parker</strong> getting cast as <strong>Heimdall</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong> accepting the role of <strong>Thor</strong></a>, and last night's latest addition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Mandy Patinkin</strong> stepping in to play <strong>Odin</strong>,</a> replacing The West Wing's <strong>Richard Schiff</strong>, who voiced him in <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>.</p>



<p>All of these casting announcements have happened within the month of <strong>January 2026</strong>, with Ryan Hurst being named as Kratos kicking things off just two weeks ago. We may not get the rest of the cast revealed today, but it certainly feels like we have more announcements coming, and that Amazon is trying to get all of these reveals out before the show starts filming, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">which is reportedly due sometime in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>.</p>



<p>With Brok, Sindri, and Mimir now settled, other remaining casting choices include <strong>Freya, Baldur</strong>, and, of course, <strong>Atreus</strong>. There are more characters we could see cast for the series, though we can't exactly speculate that we're waiting on casting choices for characters like <strong>Tyr</strong>, <strong>Magni,</strong> <strong>Modi</strong>, <strong>Freyr</strong>, <strong>Thrúd</strong>, and <strong>Angrboda</strong> until we know a bit more about the show's plot direction.</p>



<p>Right now, we know that <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">showrunner <strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></a> will be pulling from the Norse mythology-based games from 2018 and 2022, but that's about it. The character descriptions included in Variety's report don't include any new information that those who've played the games don't already know, so for now we're left waiting until Amazon, <strong>PlayStation Productions</strong>, and Moore can start talking about the show they're planning.</p>



<p>Even though it is focusing on the Norse-based games, it would be exciting to see callbacks to Kratos' days running around Olympus. It seems unavoidable for the show not to address Kratos' past, which opens up an even bigger can of worms regarding which characters are left to be cast. Hopefully, we'll have more concrete information soon.</p>
