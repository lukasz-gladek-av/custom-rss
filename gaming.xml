			<p>It's <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-thursday-adds-22-games-to-october-lineup-including-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/">GFN Thursday</a>, which means there are new games being added to the ever-growing catalog on GeForce NOW. This time, the update comes with something a bit more important than just games, as Game Sync has finally been added for Battle.net accounts. Steam, the Epic Games Store, Xbox, and Ubisoft Connect stores already have game library sync, and Battle.net is one of the last to join the roster on that front. This GeForce NOW Thursday sees the addition of Diablo IV's Vessel of Hatred DLC to the cloud, meaning members of GeForce NOW will be able to stream it without having to wait to download the game. Those who are Ultimate members will be able to play the game at up to 4k and 120 FPS.</p>
<p>Having your client accounts linked to GeForce NOW means that the gaming experience will be more seamless than ever. It allows for "plug and play" activity, meaning that you'll be able to stream some of the most current and popular games out there right now on a top-notch rig without worrying that it's going to cause your low-tier rig to combust into flames by running in 4k. By now, adding Battle.net to the mix means that all of your games will be more accessible than ever, and you will have the potential to play the games on a variety of devices, including your phone and TV.</p>
<p>Those who own the game through Battle.net will no longer have to worry about their games not syncing up to GeForce NOW, as the update for Blizzard games will officially be rolling out to members this week. Along with the addition of Diablo IV's long-awaited expansion, there are six new games for members to stream, with plenty more games to come over the next couple of weeks to see out October. Here are all of the games that you can expect to see on the Geforce NOW client, available to stream from a powerful rig, with the player getting to choose how long their gaming sessions are via the tier of their subscription.</p>
<p>Below is the list of all of the games that are being released this week and will be available for members to stream as soon as they are released on the platform mentioned.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-update-6</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/timberborn-update-6-adds-full-3d-water-physics-mod-support-and-more.1006257/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-update-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Mechanistry has released&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>Update 6, which introduces a number of major new features to the beaver city-builder, including new water physics, official mod support, and more.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a string of major updates for&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>since its Early Access release <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-sales-surpass-100k-copies-in-first-week">back in September 2021</a>, with other big major updates adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-major-timberborn-update-adds-infinite-metal-and-more">infinite metal</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-update-adds-robot-beaver-workers-and-more">robot beaver workers</a> (yes, really), and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-update-4-brings-new-map-faction-changes-and-more">new maps</a>.</p>
<p>The first big new feature in Update 6 is a new 3D water physics system, which replaces Mechanistry's "cleverly designed 2.5-dimensional system". You can now run layers of fluids on top of one another, over buildings, and more. That's right: you can finally build&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>aqueducts if you wish.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/timberborn-update-6-water-physics.jpg?itok=kzm3HyTQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/timberborn-update-6-water-physics.jpg?itok=oLm_J2Lg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Timberborn</em>'s new water physics open up a range of possibilities.</figcaption></figure><p>This new water physics system introduces a range of other possibilities to&nbsp;<em>Timberborn</em>, including new automated sluice gates, new metal platforms with overhangs, and more. You can also look forward to new vertical power shaft buildings to add efficiency to your colony.</p>
<p>Since many&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>players have been requesting more concrete endgame objectives for the game, Mechanistry has introduced Wonders, which are advanced structures you can work towards in order to "complete" your run if you want to.</p>
<p>Once a wonder has been constructed, you can change where you start for future runs on a map as well, giving you a little more flexibility in terms of how your next&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>game goes.</p>
<p>Another major feature that's been added in&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>Update 6 is official mod support; you can now download and run&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>mods via the Steam Workshop, which should make changing up your game that much easier.</p>

<p>If you want to see everything that's new, you can check out the full&nbsp;<em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>Update 6 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1062090/view/4617965876718311948" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes right here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Timberborn&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062090/Timberborn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. It previously cost $24.99, but starting from October 24th, it'll be getting a $10 price increase to $34.99. Bear that in mind if you've been looking to pick it up.</p>

A “That’s my sister!” will escape my lips when I reunite with my younger sibling after not seeing her for months, or I’ll utter an “I like candy, everybody likes candy” while walking through the confectionary aisle in Walgreens. Those ear worms that have remained steadfastly bored into my brain for close to thirty years are from <em>Backyard Baseball</em>, a point-and-click sports arcade game first released in 1997 that just dropped on Steam by way of publisher Playground Productions. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195386" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC Probably Won’t Change V’s Fate" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195386,196251,195805" data-current="195386"><div><p>Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC Probably Won’t Change V’s Fate</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195386/195386_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195386/195386_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195386/195386_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195386/195386_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20852.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Backyard Baseball ‘97</em> as it’s now known is the original <em>Backyard Baseball</em>, exactly how you remember it, from the cartoonish sounds of some of its absurd pitches (a sopping wet spitball or a twisting corkscrew) to the silly, sloppy field gameplay that often results in dropped balls or in-field collisions, and all the (somewhat irritating) chirps from the kids in-between. The moment I boot up <em>Backyard Baseball</em> and am greeted with the goofy opening credits, it’s like a warm hug from my YiaYia or a rainbow cookie hand-delivered from my Gramps on a brisk September morning. Picking my team from a gaggle of fidgety kids on the bleachers, kids like Pablo Sanchez, the Weber twins, and Keisha Philips, is like taking a time machine back to elementary school recess days. And when I get into an actual game and remember how arcadey and silly it is, I can’t wipe the smile off my face.<br></p><p>I first played <em>Backyard Baseball ‘97</em> during a Twitch stream, and my chat was delighted to see the game we clearly all played when we were younger. “Pablo Sanchez the GOAT,” typed one person, while many derided my CPU opponent for its lineup choices. As the game began, someone typed in chat that the announcer, Sunny Day, is voiced by none other than Jen Taylor, who plays Cortana in the <em>Halo</em> games and TV series. The vibes are impeccable as I head into the first inning.</p><p>Unfortunately, nostalgia can only carry a game so far. I am no longer in elementary school, and <em>Backyard Baseball</em>’s inherent jankiness means I rarely get on-base, so the game drags on as errors abound in my infield, the opposing team loads the bases, and my tired pitcher walks batters. The chirps from the children (some of which have not aged well) get annoying after the fourth, fifth, and sixth time they echo across the field. Thankfully, gratefully, after nine long innings, I get a Power Up while at bat with Pablo Sanchez: an aluminum bat that rockets a homerun 515 yards, bringing the game, mercifully, to an end.</p><p><em>Backyard Baseball ‘97</em> is fun in snippets, and a great way to reminisce about the games of yesteryear. It’s not expensive (just $8.99 on Steam), so it could be worth playing just to remember what it was like to live a life unburdened by taxes, toxic Twitter users, and the far-reaching global implications of 9/11 (plus you can play it on your Steam Deck). </p><p>And if you enjoy playing <em>Backyard Baseball ‘97</em>, there’s lots more nostalgia headed your way, as Playground Productions will eventually release <em>Backyard Soccer ‘98</em>, <em>Backyard Football ‘99</em>, <em>Backyard Basketball ‘01</em>,<em> Backyard Baseball ‘01</em>, and <em>Backyard Hockey ‘02</em> on Steam. You can wishlist them all now. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Each player will pick one of the six classes (Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, and Rogue), and together, you’ll venture out into the Sunderlands and engage in turn-based tactical combat. During combat, there is no set player turn order, so your strategy can adapt in a moment’s notice to react to the conditions of the battlefield. With new enemies appearing at every turn, it’s up to your party to find the best approach to each mission.</p><p>Between missions, players will return to Arden and help improve the village. You’ll unlock and upgrade different local vendors, build relationships with other Sunderfolk to earn rewards, and outfit your characters with new Skills, Weapons, Trinkets, and more.</p><p>Your goal, as the heroes of Arden, is to protect the town and its Brightshard from the corruption of shadowstone and defeat the threats from the surrounding Sunderlands.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_920699"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A Couch Cooperative First <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong> – The best adventures are meant to be shared.

                          <p><span>Dreamhaven Studios provided a round-trip train from Washington, D.C. to New York and accommodation for one night so that Ars could play <em>Sunderfolk</em> and interview its creators.

<p><span>Tabletop board games and video games typically offer ways to reduce their difficulty. But getting and keeping a group together for a semi-regular game night or impromptu session across different schedules and experience levels? That can be fiendishly hard.</span></p>
<p><span>That, more than anything, is what <a href="https://www.sunderfolk.com/"><span><i>Sunderfolk</i></span></a> wants to make easier. At its core, it’s a turn-based tactical RPG with well-worn hero classes and mechanics familiar to fans of crunchy tabletop games and CRPGs. But this upcoming game from Secret Door, led by Blizzard veteran and tabletop aficionado Chris Sigaty, wants to bring more people into the game-night fold. By fusing <em>Jackbox</em>-like accessibility with tabletop mechanics and letting the game do all the hard work, <em>Sunderfolk</em> aims to reduce learning curves, eliminate setup, and encourage game nights with friends.</span></p>

<p><span>Also, you use your phone as a controller, connected to one "big screen," local or remote. But it makes sense, and it worked, at least in the two hours I got to play <i>Sunderfolk.</i> The phone is both a controller and a replacement for all the cards, tokens, and other ephemera a tabletop player would have in front of them. And it allows for quick setup of couch co-op or screencasted play. <i>Sunderfolk</i> is a game that can make use of the QR-code-scanning, Discord-arranging skills many of us learned during the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span><i>Sunderfolk</i>—due out in 2025 for PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch—is aimed at both video game and tabletop audiences. It's a bold swing, and it might not have come from anywhere else but Secret Door and the developers’ refuge that team works under.</span></p>

<h2><span><b><em>Sunderfolk</em> as a gateway to game night</b></span></h2>
<p><span><a href="https://www.dreamhaven.com/">Dreamhaven</a>, the publisher of <em>Sunderfolk</em>, is what Mike Morhaime and his wife Amy are doing now after Morhaime left Blizzard, the company he co-founded, in 2019. Morhaime has teamed up with other Blizzard ex-pats to provide <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mike-morhaime-blizzard-dreamhaven-secret-door-moonshot-feature-interview"><span>a unique kind of publishing house</span></a>, one that offers equity to every employee and a great deal of autonomy to the two studios under the Dreamhaven umbrella so far.</span></p>
<p><span>Secret Door is one of those studios. It's headed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-sigaty-2811294/"><span>Sigaty</span></a>, the executive producer of <i>Hearthstone</i>, <i>StarCraft II</i>, and <i>Heroes of the Storm</i> and lead producer of <i>Warcraft III</i>. Fellow Blizzard veterans Jason Chayes and Dustin Browder head up Moonshot, the other Dreamhaven studio working on a game that, according to Sigaty, is quite different. Secret Door has its fair share of former Blizzard creators, too.</span></p>
<p><span>But Sigaty isn’t much for talking about the old days, at least with this new game to pitch. Throughout a formal presentation, an hour-long lunch, an hour-long panel interview, and every side conversation I had with him, he always came back to tabletop. Specifically, how great it is, how more people need to do game nights, and how <i>Sunderfolk</i> is Secret Door's attempt to use the best parts of video games to deliver the best parts of tabletop while letting devices trim off the tough parts. </span></p>
<p><span>Kara Centell-Dunk, senior game designer on <i>Sunderfolk</i>, has <a href="https://www.karacentelldunk.com/projects"><span>a deep background in tabletop design</span></a>. Part of her job is making sure people picking up the game don’t see how deep it is—at least right away.</span></p>


<p><span>“The further you get into tabletop games, the more you speak your own language,” Centell-Dunk said. “The deeper you get into the hobby, the harder it can be for you to pitch that hobby to other people… You start tossing around words like ‘worker placement’ and ‘drafting’ and ‘resource management,’ ‘Eurogame,’ ‘engine building.’”&nbsp;<em>Sunderfolk</em> has its own kinds of mechanics to master, but tries to get players familiar with them on a curve.</span></p>
<p><span>Along with the intimidating shorthand for newcomers, experienced tabletop heads face their own challenge: teaching new players the rules and helping them enjoy something new. “</span><span>[</span><span>People</span><span>]</span><span> don’t want to look bad in front of their friends, which I think is a really human instinct… The game will run most of itself, and I love that it was a way to invite players to try experiences I think they would love.”</span></p>
<p>If it works,&nbsp;<em>Sunderfolk</em> wants to get people on the couch, or, failing that, on Discord, working through turns, choosing hero builds, and, presumably, having a chance to talk about their non-mystical lives. I can't say what it's like over the long haul, but in a preview session with a fellow journalist and <span>Centell-Dunk, I found myself getting the gist quickly, seeing meatier possibilities ahead, and, yes, getting to know two people who were utter strangers minutes before boot-up.</span></p>

<h2><span><b>Two hours in the Sunderlands</b></span></h2>
<p><span>Up to four people start out <i>Sunderfolk</i> by picking one of six heroes: arcanist, bard, berserker, pyromancer, ranger, or rogue. They’re anthropomorphized animals, so the berserker is a sledghammer-wielding bear, the rogue is a weasel, and the pyromancer is (I think) a fire-bellied toad (edit: a red-bellied newt, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/sunderfolk-is-a-couch-co-op-tactical-rpg-you-play-with-a-phone-no-really/?comments=1&amp;post=43218825">actually</a>). The fantasy town you inhabit, Arden, and its central life-giving tree are under threat. Your band sets out into the Sunderlands to figure out what’s wrong and stop it.</span></p>
<p><span>Each mission takes place on a hex-based grid; you'll be defeating baddies, rescuing innocents, and reaching other grid goals. As a group, you decide who goes next, and you can coach, argue, and even use a pointing device (Overview Mode) on your phone to map out ideas on the big screen (or just get up and point). When you’re ready, you tap to activate your turn, then use your phone to swipe between cards and trace out a path on the "big screen" to move. It’s weird at first, but after a few rounds, I could largely take my turns with barely a glance at my phone.</span></p>
<p><span>Playing with the berserker bear, pyro frog, and bird arcanist, my group both talked out strategies and engaged in some good-hearted <a href="https://youtu.be/mLyOj_QD4a4?feature=shared&amp;t=51"><span>Leroy Jenkins moments</span></a>. The bird’s spells could really mess with enemies, but, like all RPG wizards, the bird was squishy. The bear’s movement was limited, but it could draw aggression and toss enemies around. My pyro frog was a glass cannon that demanded timing and zone control; I tried to spread fire around to trap enemies and boost future attacks while staying out of the melee.</span></p>

<p><span>There’s a catch to each move, though, and it’s Fate. Each action has you draw from your Fate deck, which has a required number of positive, negative, and “other” cards. A card can add or subtract from your attacks, or change it up somehow, like modifying a dice roll. As you advance, you can alter this deck so that your worst negative outcome still gives you a bit of defense, for example, or a neutral Fate card heals you.</span></p>

      Fine, I'll get you back your beetle, but only in exchange for experience points, randomly generated loot, and the chance to name him.

<p><span>On some missions, the game sends a chosen player a Madlibs-like prompt to name something in the mission. My own prompt led my team to valiantly rescue a kidnapped beetle named Michael Keaton. There were groans and grudging acknowledgments; it was the closest parallel to my tabletop experiences.</span></p>
<p><span>After each mission, you return to town where you get a little solo “maintenance” time, mostly on your phone. You level up if needed, visit people in town for some optional <i>Stardew Valley</i>/<i>Dragon Age</i>-style friendship maintenance, equip and sell Trinkets and other gear, decide where your party is heading next, and get some narrative.</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t know much of <i>Sunderfolk</i>’s narrative after just two hours and four missions. It’s linear, it’s appropriate for kids, and if you’re on a replay, it’s mostly skippable. Then again, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anjali_Bhimani"><span>Anjali Bhimani</span></a> (i.e., Symmetra from <i>Overwatch</i>, Rampart from <i>Apex Legends</i>) does the majority of the voices here, so it’s not a hard listen.</span></p>
<p><span>The developers’ best guess is that the 38 missions currently in the game will take 25–35 hours on a first playthrough. The big variable, as with any game night, is how much “analysis paralysis” members of your group experience. </span></p>
<p><span>You can add new players and move on if a friend drops out, and people can play as other characters in a pinch (solo play would be running a minimum of two characters at once). <em>Sunderfolk</em> will do some auto-leveling for players who missed a session or two, and players can also gift gold or items to each other. The difficulties, adjustable at any time, span from “you pass out instead of die, infinite times” to “every creature is elite, death is real, and there’s a timer.”</span></p>
<p><span>Replayability should come from the side missions you didn’t choose last time, the range of characters and builds available, and weapons that can drastically change your play style (I didn’t get to those in my preview). The developers’ greatest hope is that players will want to introduce a wider range of friends to the game, ranging from casual gamers to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/04/gloomhaven-review-2017s-biggest-board-game-is-astoundingly-good/#page-2"><i>Gloomhaven</i></a> engineers.</span></p>

<h2><span><b>Can <em>Sunderfolk</em> hit with two markets?</b></span></h2>
<p><span>I asked Sigaty if, as a new 28-person studio, developing an original property for four platforms (plus mobile), Secret Door was “playing on hard mode.” He agreed and took it further, comparing Secret Door’s work to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_triangle"><span>fire triangle</span></a> of heat, fuel, and oxygen. “New team, new IP, and new game. We did all three—and question our sanity a little bit.” But it was a conscious decision, Sigaty says, and a specific challenge.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re trying to walk this really interesting line… If you come from this deeper board game side, you’ll find gameplay depth that’s there. And if you’ve never played these sorts of games before, you can get in and start playing and realizing this is something really fun,” Sigaty said. The world, too, is crafted to walk a middle line, having stakes but not being overly violent or sexualized. “We want families to be able to play together, too,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span>Then there’s the phone thing. There is no controller or keyboard option; you need an iOS or Android device with a touchscreen to play. Sigaty and his team say they’ve optimized the game for phone battery life. The game can also work fully on local network connections, leaving Secret Door’s servers only for remote play.</span></p>
<p><span>So only one person has to have the actual <i>Sunderfolk</i> game—displaying it on a TV, a Discord screencast, or wherever—while three others can scan a QR code and join by phone. </span><span>As for the diminished sales potential that might present, Sigaty doesn’t seem concerned. Playing the game is its own marketing to own the game and bring in others, he suggested, similar to playing a board game and wanting to own it yourself. </span></p>
<p><span>I asked Sigaty how Secret Door plans to pitch a brand-new game to both tabletop and video game markets, perhaps simultaneously. “If there’s a story to <i>Sunderfolk,</i> it’s to walk the middle line,” Sigaty said. “My hope is… we can appeal to both audiences and say, ‘Both of you have a place here’ and act as this bridge to those people or their friends who never really played a tabletop experience before, or maybe never played a tactical strategy game on PC or console.”</span></p>
<p><em>This post was updated at 11:35 a.m. to note that the pyromancer character is likely a red-bellied newt, not a fire-bellied toad. Ars regrets its attempt at armchair herpetology.</em></p>

The word economy, however, can be used to describe inter-related systems and activities, across a vast range of smaller subdivisions including, for example companies or even a single family.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is generally understood that game economy design concerns itself more with game design than traditional economics. While real-world economic theories and terminology are referenced and used to some extent, the game economy designer’s role, along with other designers, is to create player engagement and, specifically, things for the players to do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A game economy is a highly tailored, fabrication of a real-world economy, functioning around in-game resources, currencies and virtual goods, along with a system of engagements and activities for players. It is, in essence, a much simpler, controlled version of a real world economy.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/book-excerpt-designing-games-meant-for-sharing" target="_self">Book Excerpt: Designing Games Meant for Sharing</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The aspects of a game which fall under the umbrella of game economy can be tricky to define, and different genres of games utilize game economy design in different ways. However, there are a number of components, practices and theoretical tools for the game economy designer to use, which will be discussed in the following sub-sections of this chapter.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What Does a Game Economy Designer Do?">What Does a Game Economy Designer Do?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Naturally the game economy designer’s overarching task is to create the interweaving systems and flow of resources, goods and currencies within the game: a game economy. The job itself is a subspecialty within the divisions of game design and can generally be thought of as concerning the design of the systems which relate to the long-term engagement of the player. This contrasts with the other design disciplines which are working on the minute-to-minute action-phase gameplay. Game economy design concerns itself with the areas of the game which include the control for distribution of content and rewards (broadly, a progression system), and the resources, goods and currencies which are used in tandem with these systems. By extension, the game economy designer is concerned with the monetization and microtransaction elements which have become more commonplace throughout games.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/book-excerpt-game-engine-architecture" target="_self">Book Excerpt: Game Engine Architecture</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Essential to any role within the game design team is a high level of collaboration with colleagues. Game economy design is no different.&nbsp; There are certain aspects which absolutely lend themselves to two or more people sitting down in front of a computer screen and discussing the inner workings of a system. This will and should form a key part of the working day. The areas covered by you as a game economy designer will overlap one way or another with the work of a designer covering the many other systems in the game, including user interface and narrative. Beyond this, naturally you will collaborate with developers on the entire team. This is the spirit of game development, and it involves an intricate blend of technology, art, creativity and psychology, all mixed to produce fascinating end products to be enjoyed by millions.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Goals of a Game Economy">Goals of a Game Economy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A fundamental question: why do we have the need for a game economy in the first place?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The concept of a game economy is utilized to varying degrees across the different genres of games, and it is true that not all genres require a standard game economy. From the early days of the games industry, many titles had little concept of such a game economy. However, as games developed over the years, new trends surfaced, and new types of gameplay experiences and engagement developed, and therefore so did the need for a game economy.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/book-excerpt-ai-for-game-developers" target="_self">Book Excerpt: AI For Game Developers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game design as a discipline, and by extension the game designer as a role, is there to solve conceptual problems within the development cycle</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">of a game, leading to an improved player experience. Ergo, game economy typically exists to solve a number of problems often concerned with the overall player journey and long-term engagement within a game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A game economy facilitates direct player engagement. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">A game economy in this sense bleeds into the main action phase of a game (e.g. playing a mission in a shooter game, involving combat). As a game economy encompasses the systems related to player resources, goods and in-game currencies, these are used to give a degree of value and context to the goods that a player utilizes while playing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A game economy provides long-term player experience</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. One of the key aspects to a game economy is to provide a motivation for long-term engagement within a game. The controlled distribution and usage of resources should keep players coming back over an extended period of time and allow the player to establish a routine of play on a regular basis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A game economy acts as the access to and the control of distribution of content. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Closely related to the motivation for long-term engagement is the need for control and by extension safety measures over the distribution of content. A game development team can only create a finite amount of content with the time and budget allowed for any project. If the pacing of the content is incorrect, players can potentially burn through this content far too quickly, ultimately causing the player to leave the game; i.e. if the player acquires the game’s most valuable content with relative ease, what reason would they have to continue playing? The game economy and, in particular, the progression systems (see below) can act as metaphorical brakes on content distribution, ultimately preventing a potentially damaging content burn rate. Aside from preventing content burn, a game economy concerns itself with session control.&nbsp; In other words, the game must provide the player with just enough content: not too little, not too much during any given play session. The details of how long a play session should be will vary depending on the game itself, the genre, platform and target audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The concept of giving utility to players is achieved by this access to content. Think of an open world game, which opens up more as the player plays, giving access to more quests, side quests, collectables, skills and surprises along the way. Alternatively, a collectable card game gives the player an expanding pool of mechanics to use, thus creating strategic depth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A game economy itself provides engagement and should generate fun. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Often, the game economy is something which is generally “felt” by the player, as opposed to being noticed in the same moment to moment fashion as core gameplay mechanics. Naturally, creating a game economy interaction which features the same emotion, sensation and buzz of action gameplay would be an impossible task.&nbsp; However, the concept of an economy generating intrinsic fun for the player is an important design consideration. The narrative design and the nature of the project can also have an impact on this. For example, if a game features fly-by-night black market trading, this could provide some inherent intrigue to otherwise relatively mundane elements.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A game economy provides adaptability and growth. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Many video games must be sustainable long after their initial launch, and postlaunch operations continuously update the game after its initial launch.&nbsp; The game economy must be built in such a way as to allow it to be expanded and modified. These updates can take many forms, such as new currencies and features which “plug into” the main game economy systems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A game economy provides access to monetization, and depth of player spending. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Monetization in the context of game economy design typically refers to the in-app/in-game purchases (microtransactions) that occur after the main game purchase or free download. These give the player access to premium (premium will be synonymous with “costing real money” throughout this book) features and content. With a strong game economy design, there will be a synergy between the regular economy and the premium (costing real money) content. One caveat is that the individual business model and game genre is a major determinant of how the game economy relates to monetization. Monetization will be covered in more detail within Chapter 4.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Key Components of the Game Economy">Key Components of the Game Economy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the goals of a game economy in mind, what are the actual building blocks and theoretical components/elements which the economy designer has at his/her disposal?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Currencies are a natural part of any economy, both virtual and real world. However, currencies do not necessarily need to exist in video games. There are many games which do not require currency and, by extension, do not have a typical game economy. This does not prevent these games from containing a progression system, and other resources for players to collect. For games which have a currency – that is, a medium of exchange – integrated into their design, the common convention is to design a soft currency, which is a currency that the player obtains from playing the game. The soft currency is used for purchases within the game that have a direct link to the gameplay and the player’s engagement. For example, soft currencies are used as a charge for upgrading weapons and equipment used by the player. Many games take the design approach of having a single soft currency with a variety of uses spread across the game’s features. This soft currency works in synergy with other more specific resources within the game, and free-to-play games typically often introduce other new soft currencies into their design, especially as these games adapt and evolve with updates post release.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many games typically also introduce a hard currency. This is a currency that is acquired through real money microtransactions and can have a variety of applications. The most noteworthy use of a hard currency is for the purchase of purely cosmetic vanity items. These are often used for character customization such as items of clothing and accessories, but can also be special commands known as emotes, which players use to convey emotions or perform greetings to other players during a multiplayer game. Economy design does not preclude a hard currency from being dropped in small quantities through the gameplay. This is often used during the early stages of a game to teach the player the usage of hard currency and to help to drive potential further monetization.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Goods</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Goods are items in the game that are tangible to the player. A good in this sense can be difficult to define. Broadly speaking, these are the major items that the players owns. Not all of these may relate directly to the game economy, although from a theoretical standpoint they do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The items which are easily recognizable as goods tied to the game economy are weapons, armor pieces, cosmetic apparel and similar content tied to the in-game currencies. For example, a loot focused roleplaying game will involve repeated cycles of buying and selling these items. Other items that can be viewed as goods are, for example, tools and gadgets which many action or stealth games often incorporate into their design. These items may simply be available to use, without significant links to the game economy, and are therefore of more concern to system designers. However, the game economy designer must be a stakeholder within their design, as the use of these items will have an impact on player performance and can have a knock-on effect on other aspects of the game economy, for example, the rate at which players progress and acquire currencies and resources.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resources</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Resources can also be difficult to define, as there is often an overlap between goods and currencies, but there are typically differences to note. Resources are often collected for a specific purpose and combined or utilized within one or more of the game’s systems. They are typically precursor items used in the production of other items and are collected in abundance throughout a game environment or via core gameplay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A common type of resource which many will encounter includes crafting materials found in modern action role-playing games. For example, the player must collect the resource called “metal fragments”, which can be taken to a blacksmith non-player character, who will use these metal fragments to craft a new sword for the player. These types of resources are usually distributed in abundance and can help to provide a method for designers of large scale – particularly open world – titles to extensively populate the game environment with numerous amounts of minor rewards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although not generally thought of as a resource, experience points which are awarded through gameplay would be broadly classified as a resource for the player. These may not be used in the direct sense, but they contribute to other systems, unlocks and rewards. They would differ from a currency, as they cannot be spent by the player. There is a similarity here with professional sports leagues, where teams accumulate points from winning matches.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A word of caution regarding terminology. The term “resource” will commonly be used as an over-arching term for all elements of a game economy, from currencies to content. Keep context in mind while researching.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sources</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A source can also be called a faucet, or a tap in British English. A source is defined as a means within the game by which players receive in-game currency, resources or goods. In the context of a virtual game economy, the currency, resource or good is created from nothing and injected into the economy. With a source created, the game economy designer has the task of adjusting how much currency (or resources/ goods) this source provides to the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Typically, the most prominent source within a game economy is that which generates in-game soft currency. Sources for soft currency are used as a method for providing the main reward for the player’s engagement with the core gameplay. As the currency is generated from everyday engagement by the player, this can often generate a large amount of currency simply by existing, in turn creating the main balancing task for the designer. An example would be an amount of soft currency which the player receives for completing a level in a mobile puzzle game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The source for resources is another type which you will encounter within a game economy. Designers often use more bespoke means to generate resources for players, entirely dependent on the type of game and the business model, to solve problems in the design or guide the player to playing the game in a specific method or pattern.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Consider a system where the player must upgrade weapons, and after reaching the maximum level, the player can begin levelling up the weapon again from zero, but this time with new powered-up features on the weapon permanently available. In order to reset the weapon, the player must use a rare resource only acquired from completing specific weekly missions within the game. The use of these therefore guides the player into a weekly engagement with the game, controlling the means by which the player can upgrade weapons.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources for goods can be more difficult to define and are not to be confused with traders (see section below). Sources for goods, like resources, are often used to solve specific design problems, but can be a main part of the game’s core engagement. For example, many roleplaying games function around the collection of loot; items dropped by enemies. An example would be a sword dropped by a monster after the player kills it, within a fantasy role-playing game. Sources for goods can also provide the player with certain rewards for regular engagement with the game, to aid retention. An example would be a consumable health potion which is given to the player for returning to the game a specific number of times within a set period (though in practice, currency is used more predominantly in this instance).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sinks</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A sink (sometimes called a drain) is a way or object/element within the game which removes currency, resources or goods from the economy. A sink destroys the currency, resource or good, removing it permanently. Sinks are used to combat currency inflation and work in conjunction with sources. It is also the task of the designer to balance the sinks to remove sufficient currency, resources or goods relative to the rate at which the sources are generating.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A sink for currency can initially seem obvious to design but can quickly become tricky to add to a game while keeping a sense of credibility within the experience and the established narrative of the game.&nbsp; Definitions become more obscure with currency sinks relative to the type of game. Take the example of purchasing a store item. Within the context of a single player game without player-to-player trading, this can act as a currency sink, with the currency being taken out of the economy. We should note that this currency is being replaced by a good. In essence, this behaves more like a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>converter </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(see below).&nbsp; Naturally, the player must get something in return for spending their hard-earned currency, so finding intricate ways of removing the currency while giving something in return which is continually needed and desired, something moreover that can be given repeatedly over the player’s lifetime with the game, is a key design challenge. Within a game which involves player trading, buying items from other players would not act as a sink at all, as the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>trader </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(see below) would exchange the currency and the good between the two parties. Given the fact that soft currency is readily printed by playing a game, it naturally</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">tends to be in abundance, with designers left straining to find ways to remove it. A few examples of currency sinks would be: an amount of soft currency charged for upgrading a piece of equipment, or an amount of currency charged to begin a new match, which may be used for certain game modes in multiplayer titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The concept of sinks for resources may be used for specific cases within the game. Resources tend to have controlled distribution relative to the game and are given very specific uses, so their need for blatant sinks is not the same as for currencies. Resources function effectively with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>converters </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(see below), for example where they can be transformed into goods. This would effectively be a sink for the resource and a source for the good.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sinks for goods can take different forms, and game designers often come up with quite innovative ways to remove items from a player, again specific to the genre and business model of the game. Roleplaying games often allow players to sell unwanted items to non-player character vendors, in return for small amounts of currency or resources.&nbsp; While this is theoretically a trade, the good is being destroyed by the vendor, and the amount of currency given back is typically a fraction of the amount that the good was purchased with. In certain cases, games may feature items or weapons which are permanently lost, for example if the player character is killed during a mission.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Converters</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Converters are mechanics which transform one type of good, currency or resource into another within the game. A useful way of thinking about the converter is that it is acting as a source and sink simultaneously, producing one element in return for instantly destroying another. While this can be applied in many ways within games, the most obvious use of the converter lies within the design of crafting systems, or the harvesting of resources or similar mechanics within strategy, or construction and citybuilding simulation games. For example, players will collect certain raw resources deposited from the game environment and will use these in conjunction with a nonplayer character (e.g. a blacksmith) to create a new tool or weapon. The use of converters can be applied across many genres of games and can be used as part of puzzle solving within games, or indeed any system whereby players collect multiple components and then combine these into a single whole item. The behavior of the converter should not be described as a variation of a sink. Although the number of elements can be reduced, the converter does not totally destroy anything without replacing it with something else. It is a theoretical tool at the disposal of the game economy designer, to be utilized in various situations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Traders</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Traders are mechanics which exchange goods, resources or currencies between different entities within the game. As a definition this can seem overly technical, but in practice the trader is a theoretical way of describing the behavior of, for example, a player purchasing a weapon from another player, for an amount of in-game money. The trader mechanic transfers in-game money from the account of Player A to the account of Player B and transfers the weapon from the account of Player B to the account of Player A. This is where we can observe the nuances of traders and the overlap between traders and sinks. If the player buys a new item from a non-player vendor character, this is not trader functionality. From the player’s perspective it appears to be the same, i.e. they give away one element and receive a different one in return. But in this instance, the player is interacting with the game which destroys the in-game currency and creates an item out of nothing to give to the player. A trader as a theoretical object must not destroy or create anything, it simply exchanges different existing elements between entities in the game. Even within a game which involves player to player trading, from the perspective of one player, the trader appears to act like a converter on the surface, but in terms of the overall economic balance, and crucially for the designer, the two are different.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game Genre and Business Models">Game Genre and Business Models</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For those of us who have had a strong passion for video games from a young age, the concept of genre is something from which we derive our main emotional connection to the games we enjoy. As the years go by and we purchase new devices, and their associated titles, we connect to specific types of games and find new favorites, and obsessions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the ever-changing landscape of the games industry, the factors constituting the different game genres have also changed. There is still a lot of ambiguity, with many games breaking trends, and fusing defining elements from different genres.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What defines a game’s genre? Genre is the French word for type, and the term is often heard in the context of films. However, what characterizes the video game medium is that genre mainly refers to the type of gameplay involved, as opposed to the type of story being told. Some of the main video game genres with which I have always associated personally are the following:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• First-person shooter</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Action adventure</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Sports</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Racing</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Puzzle</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">• Strategy</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are a plethora of sub-genres within each of these, and the list could extend for many pages.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How are these different genres relevant to the game economy?&nbsp; Naturally, some genres lend themselves to a typical game economy far more than others, but there is a large gray area in between the extremes which includes varying aspects and elements of a game economy. A strategy game such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clash of Clans </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">features a prominent game economy and metagame, while a story-driven adventure or interactive drama title may feature no game economy in the immediate sense. However, there may be progression systems built into a story-driven game, even if they are not prominent and player facing, so the generic principles and theory within this book should be able to be readily applied whenever the needs arise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this point, it becomes necessary to address the two major business models that dominate the games industry: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Free-to-Play </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Premium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Free-to-Play</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A game which follows the free-to-play business model is available for players to play without any upfront real money cost and is the dominant business model for mobile games. Monetization is built into the game via the use of non-compulsory microtransactions, which the player can carry out from within the game. The microtransactions provide the user with some benefit(s), closely related to the game’s design, such as content, or some other more optimal experience for the player to enjoy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Monetization should be built into the game from the ground up and be considered during development as part of the process of building the game’s economy. Tagging on a monetization strategy at the end of a project will inevitably lead to a more mediocre result.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A pattern of effective design for free-to-play games tends to involve a single core method of play, which takes place in consistently measurable play sessions, and from here the player builds an expression around this core experience, with engagement, retention and ultimately monetization features wrapped around this. A good example of this would be the game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rocket League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which shifted business models to free-to-play, from originally being a premium title. The game centers around multiplayer matches, with other features such as tournaments, customization and live events all complementing this single user experience (Figure 1.1).</span></p><p>Figure 1.1 Typical gameplay loop for a free-to-play game.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Premium games are games in which the player must pay an upfront cost. Many of the most popular franchises on PC and console are premium products.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a premium experience demands that a player part with real money before beginning to play, there is more leeway for the game to be a self-contained journey, which combines different challenges, rhythms of engagement, types of gameplay and experiences (Figure 1.2).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A single player, open world, story-driven game could be considered an archetype for this, with a narrative that changes, progresses and adapts to context, combined with a mixture of combat and problem solving gameplay, and many other surprises along the way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are exceptions to this, with some sports and racing games being genres which could conveniently lend themselves to the free-to play type of engagement. It is worth bearing in mind that these games are often high budget, yearly iterating franchises, with licenses from sports associations, and often in themselves contain expansive career and season modes, requiring a large time investment from the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Paymium </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is a term that can be used to refer to the practice of a premium game also including the opportunity for further in-game microtransactions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I feel the need to make a small qualification in relation to the detailed chapters which form the remainder of this book. It is certainly true that a great deal of game economy and monetization design has its heart in the free-to-play model, and this should be taken into consideration. However, bearing in mind the readership for this book,&nbsp;</span></p><p>Figure 1.2 Player engagement diagram for a typical premium product.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">and the changing nature of the games industry, I have attempted to generalize the concept of game economy to systems which can be applied to solve meta design-related problems within different games. These potential solutions will be largely independent of the business model the project is using, but will also allow for the perception that some genres lend themselves to game economy more than others.&nbsp; Often, there is overlap between free-to-play and premium design, and the methodologies can be readily applied across different projects. By extension, game design can be boiled down to a series of problems to solve whatever interconnected systems are present. Therefore, it is very relevant as an economy designer to think of and apply the theory to whichever project-specific problems present themselves, and to be able to, for example, use and reapply free-to-play best practices in a premium game where relevant and whenever the needs arise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now we will begin the deep dive, by first looking at the high-level driving force behind the game economy, in “player motivation”.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Player Motivation">Player Motivation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a prelude to going into the specifics of building the game economy, it is important to start asking the most high-level questions about the overall design of the game, which is, in essence, part of the game’s overall direction. This is something which must happen before preproduction fully starts, and is usually handled within a small team, including the game director who sets the creative vision for the project. To get to the bottom of player motivation, and with the business model being already decided, there are a series of questions which will help set the scene for the metagame.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first question is who is the target audience for the game? Every game needs a target audience. Different titles appeal to different people, with varying life habits and character traits. Keeping the game’s meta features in line with the overall creative vision is part of the economy designer’s role, and identifying the target audience helps with this. The target audience guides everything about the game, from the type of content and features to the pacing of progression, and the multitude of decisions that will be made along the way. For example, if you are building a game for a more casual audience, it would not be sensible to spend a lot of development resources building an incredibly deep series of meta systems which are not going to be discovered by the majority of players. Likewise, an economy which is too simplistic would not appeal to the audience of a more hardcore game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second question is what are the main emotions that the game’s design wants to generate in players? You need to identify how you would like your players to feel while playing the game, and how these feelings connect with each other. These involve everything from the waves of emotion that occur during a single round of gameplay, and during a single play session, all the way through to the overarching emotions over the player’s lifetime with the game. Is there anything in particular you are looking to ignite in players? There are many different emotions that are intrinsic to video games, and the design of the metagame and economy can play on these. Satisfaction, happiness and surprise can be powerful positive emotions to generate in players. However, you must also look to conjure up more negative emotions such as frustration and disappointment along the way. A game requires this to complement the positive times. Pride and envy, which are themselves extremely powerful feelings, can also be exploited. With insights gained from the first two questions, the third question is: what are players going to be doing within the game? This will typically adhere closely to the genre of the game. Take a step back into the persona of the player and ask the question, what am I doing in a game? Naturally, the first answer that comes to mind is trivial. In a racing game you are racing vehicles, probably cars in some form. But really, there are sub-genres within this, with their own experiences that cater to different players. There is often one over-arching goal, but there are many different segments of player experience to take into consideration. For example, a game could involve engaging in quick races, to build up a collection of vehicles, with upgrades helping with this collection process. The game could have a story mode, various multiplayer modes and ranked leagues. What are the predominant elements to consider, and how do they come together into a coherent whole?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Developing an Economy">Developing an Economy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The natural follow-on from the previous questions is to take the answers and put them into more of a context within a system of components which help to build up a working game economy. With the</span></p><p>Figure 1.3 Diagram showing the highest level of theoretical game economy components.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">knowledge of the components of the economy, we can now think about the overall experience of the game, and what the player is doing in terms of the gameplay. This can be seen as a hypothetical directional thought process to ignite the game economy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We can address the highest-level theory of the economy by thinking through and answering questions related to the following topics:&nbsp; Activities, Intensity, Rewards and User Journey (Figure 1.3).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Activities</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What are the core activities that happen within the game, through the different types of gameplay in relation to the game economy?&nbsp; Ultimately you are addressing the question of what the things are that players are doing. This could be the main story battles that onboard new players and keep them engaged for multiple subsequent play sessions. Other examples could involve quick battles, daily challenges or end-game boss raids.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Intensity</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The intensity takes the activities and contextualizes them in terms of how much time and effort they require from the player. This will then be used to define what type of rewards they tie into. For example, an end-game boss raid would require far more valuable, rare rewards compared to a simple daily logon reward, which would require a small amount of the game’s main (and easy-to-acquire) soft currency. This is an important step. It may seem like common sense, but it is important during the course of development to identify and keep a measure of the type or quantity of rewards that are given through different game play modes or features, and how these may potentially change. During the cold reality of game development, it is quite common to be pushed into re-using certain rewards. Economy designers can find themselves not differentiating sufficiently between easy-to-acquire and extremely grind-focused rewards, which in turn has a detrimental effect on the player’s overall engagement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rewards</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This step requires the designer to define the currencies which will drive the economy. In addition to this, the resources can be considered. In reality, the line between currencies and resources can become blurry. The goods which serve as rewards must also be defined, and in general how these all tie together. This stage involves asking the question “why does the player care about investing in this economy?”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>User Journey</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this stage you will be considering the overall user journey of the player. This ties heavily into the overall progression system (regardless of how prominent and/or complex the progression system is). It is this section that will serve as the initial spark for the more complex design of the user journey. At this point you must reflect on how things will change over time from a high-level standpoint.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is an early onboarding phase, which can be more contrived and designer controlled. The player investment is small at this point and should therefore require minimal effort. There will be a mid-level phase where players are in the system, with less predictability around the player’s experience. Last, although not relevant to all players, an end-game phase for the most experienced and skilled individuals must be considered.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We must ask ourselves, what do we do to keep players going forward? What activities are unlocking, and what types of rewards and currencies are focused on during certain points within the user journey. For example, how are these rewards distributed at the end game compared to the mid-game phases?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this stage, it will be prudent to roughly map out the stages of the user journey on paper, which will serve as the basis for planning the deeper, detailed design to follow.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Reference">Reference</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Virtual Economies: Design and Analysis, Vili Lehdonvirta and Edward Castronova, 2014</span></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto V was released almost ten years ago on PC, but with some choice mods, the popular open-world title by Rockstar Games can look as mind-blowing as some of the best games released in the current console generation.</p>
<p>A new video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams</a> shows the fifth entry in the series running with mods like <a href="https://www.razedmods.com/gta-v">NaturalVision Evolved</a> and <a href="https://gtareal.club/">GTA 5Real</a>, among others, at 8K resolution. At times, it's almost difficult to say this is Grand Theft Auto V and not a more recent, current-generation game.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K]  Mind-Blowing GTA 5 Photorealism Mods! (Next-Gen Graphics &amp; Maxed out settings)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qWXuV9cWjsU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fans of the series by Rockstar Games will have to make do with Grand Theft Auto V for a little while longer, as its highly-anticipated sequel will be released sometime next year. Given the game's ambition and scale, however, the release date could slip to 2026, although, as of last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/">it hasn't been delayed internally yet</a>. Its ambitious nature could also make it impossible for current generation consoles, including the soon-to-be-released PlayStation 5 Pro, to run it at<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/"> 60 frames per second</a>, forcing players who want to experience the new rendition of Vice City at high refresh rates to wait for the PC version, which has yet to be officially announced.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series X, Xbox One and Xbox 360.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/270880/view/4657376178538345385" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>, the next major project for SCS Software is Louisiana. It follows on from the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/american-truck-simulator-nebraska-dlc-release-date">Nebraska</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/american-truck-simulator-montana-release-date-announced">Montana</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/scs-software-shows-off-american-truck-simulator-oklahoma-dlc-cities-and-more">Oklahoma</a> in the annals of cities that have been added to&nbsp;<em>American Truck Simulator&nbsp;</em>via downloadable content.</p>
<p>This being an&nbsp;<em>American Truck Simulator&nbsp;</em>DLC pack, we don't have a release date for it yet, but we do have a bunch of mighty pretty screenshots to look at while we wait.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/american-truck-simulator-dlc-state-louisiana-road.jpg?itok=7nymcyUw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/american-truck-simulator-dlc-state-louisiana-road.jpg?itok=jOOMViDc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>American Truck Simulator</em>'s next DLC state has been revealed, and it looks just as beautiful as you'd expect.</figcaption></figure><p>SCS Software is promising the inclusion of iconic Louisiana cities like New Orleans and Baton Rouge, as well as miles and miles of lowlands, valleys, and rolling hills.</p>
<p>Of course, you'll also find plenty of signature Louisiana geographical features; the Mississippi floodplain will be yours to explore, as will the river delta, which has "shaped how the area looks today", as the developer points out.</p>
<p>As you truck through Louisiana, you'll encounter lots of different industrial facilities, including agriculture, fishing, forestry, and petroleum. Don't worry; since New Orleans is one of the US' busiest ports, you'll have plenty of cargo to transport.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for the&nbsp;<em>American Truck Simulator&nbsp;</em>Louisiana DLC right here.</p>

<p>If you're an&nbsp;<em>American Truck Simulator&nbsp;</em>fan, you'll know that SCS Software typically takes its time with DLC for the game, so it could be a while before we hear about this one again.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the studio has promised to share more about the Louisiana DLC and what you can expect from it in future blog posts.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>American Truck Simulator&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/270880/American_Truck_Simulator/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, which is also where you'll find up-to-the-minute information about the Louisiana DLC as and when SCS Software releases it.</p>

<p>Playground Productions has announced that five more Backyard Sports classic games are coming to Steam. The news comes on the day that the original <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/backyard-baseball-97-being-re-released-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Backyard Baseball 97</a> also launched on Steam.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/backyardsports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Coming to the storefront</a> are Backyard Soccer ‘98,&nbsp;Backyard Football ‘99, Backyard Basketball ‘01, Backyard Baseball ‘01&nbsp;and&nbsp;Backyard Hockey ‘02.</p>



<p>Release dates haven’t been announced for the games, but that information is expected to come soon. All of the games will be single-player only with Steam achievements.</p>



<p>In addition to the five other games coming to Steam, it was confirmed that Backyard Baseball 97 is verified for Steam Deck. </p>



<p>Playground Productions <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/backyard-sports-returns-with-franchise-revival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced the return</a> of the Backyard Sports series in August. The return is starting with re-releases and remasters of old titles. However, there is a belief that new games are on the horizon.</p>



<p>“We’re incredibly excited to reintroduce&nbsp;Backyard Sports&nbsp;to a new generation of players,” Playground Productions CPO Chris Waters said at the time. </p>



<p>“I can’t wait for fans to see what we’re building on the Playground.”</p>

                <p>The first internally developed video game from Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime's publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-blizzard-boss-mike-morhaime-founds-new-studio-dreamhaven/1100-6482533/" data-ref-id="1100-6482533">Dreamhaven</a> is Sunderfolk, a tactical, fantasy co-op RPG meant to be played in person, with players using their phone as their controller.</p><p dir="ltr">Sunderfolk comes from Dreamhaven's Secret Door studio, which is composed of numerous ex-Blizzard employees and includes studio head Chris Sigaty, who worked at Blizzard for over 20 years and served as a lead producer on games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/" data-ref-id="5000-2650">Warcraft 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/" data-ref-id="5000-30719">Starcraft 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBOhgqT3Q78" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fBOhgqT3Q78" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"The board game table is something very special, and we wanted to create a video game that had those same elements," Sigaty said in Sunderfolk's announcement trailer. "We focused on this idea of collaborating together. We're using the phone in everyone's pocket as their control interface. Your phone being the controller allows you to have your own information as well as roll out only the information needed at any given time."</p><p dir="ltr">In Sunderfolk, players will step into a fantasy world of anthropomorphic animals and embark in an ongoing campaign meant to be played over multiple sessions, similar to a tabletop roleplaying game. Players will pick a class that they will use over the course of multiple sessions, along the way leveling up and gaining new abilities. In Sunderfolk's announcement trailer, we get a glimpse of a polar bear Berserker and an otter Rogue in action, as well as other classes like Bard, Arcanist, Ranger, and Pyromancer. The television displays the game's "board" and information relevant to each player, while a player's phone will display details about their character and abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of gameplay, Sunderfolk is divided into two parts. Players will embark on missions where they gather loot, battle enemies, solve puzzles, and complete objectives. After the mission, the group returns to town, where each player can go to different locations independently to improve their character, sell items, and talk to townsfolk.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u-2_fngUPg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8u-2_fngUPg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Actress Anjali Bhimani, the voice of Symmetra in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch</a> and Rampart in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a>, (and who has also made guest appearances on tabletop RPG shows like Dimension 20) can be heard as the narrator of Sunderfolk's debut gameplay trailer. Secret Door confirmed Bhimani will actually voice all of Sunderfolk's characters, with the intent, according to game director Erin Marek, being for her to be reminiscent of an in-person game master who does the voices for every character players encounter on their tabletop adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">Marek said the goal of Sunderfolk is to create something that would mimic an in-person game night, bringing people together like they would in a roleplaying game like Dungeons and Dragons or a board game.</p><p dir="ltr">"It is really trying to parallel that experience of I've got a hand of cards and a board on the ground in front of us," Marek said.</p><p dir="ltr">Sunderfolk is also meant to serve as a gateway to bring friends and family members into the tabletop RPG space.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're trying to give an entry point for folks already in the community to pull along their friends, their family, their loved ones, who want to be part of that community as well," Marek said.</p><p dir="ltr">Sunderfolk is slated to release in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam, with more information about the game to be shared in the months ahead.</p>

		<p>Just over a week ago, Sports Interactive announced that Football Manager 25 would be released on November 26th. However, things have changed in the short time since that announcement, and Sports Interactive has now delayed the release of Football Manager 25 to March 2025, following discussions with Sega and other partners.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 25 | The New Era | #FM25 Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob06By9TFOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement released today, Sports Interactive said, <em>“After careful consideration, Sports Interactive have made the tough decision to further delay the release of Football Manager 25. Following discussions with SEGA, our licensors and partners, we have agreed the best course of action is to delay the launch until March 2025. Specific platform release dates will follow once confirmed.</em></p>
<p><em>In our last&nbsp;<a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-0">Development Update in September</a>, we explained that we needed to push FM25’s original release back to give ourselves more time to deliver the best possible experience for this first instalment in a new era of Football Manager. This additional time has not been sufficient to ensure the game quality and experience meets your expectations and our very high standards.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>In the previous blog we explained that it has been a difficult development cycle for the studio. Many things have been moving slower than we had predicted – despite everyone in the team working at an incredible pace to try and get everything done. Timelines were already tight and, as rightly pointed out by many of your recent comments, we were simply rushing too much and in danger of compromising our usual standards. This has put an enormous amount of pressure on everyone working across the studio, who are all passionately committed to delivering the best game possible.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>FM25 is the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation. We simply cannot compromise the delivery of this crucial juncture in Football Manager’s history by rushing to release it in November. Of course, this is not where any of us expected to be seven weeks out from our release but, in the spirit of our studio values, we always consider the bigger picture – and the bigger picture here is that we need this additional time to deliver a game that we can all be proud of.</em></p>
<p><em>For the large numbers of you who have already pre-ordered the game, we thank you very much for your trust and support. Given the delay, however, should you wish to claim a refund, please contact your retailer. Something you noted as missing from our announcement on 30 September was mention of Advanced Access on PC/Mac. We can confirm Advanced Access will be available ahead of the new release date and, when we are confident on how long that period will be, we will update you at the first opportunity. The new gameplay reveal will also now move to the end of January 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>We are intensely aware that this will be massively disappointing for you. We share that disappointment and are extremely sorry.&nbsp;Thank you for reading and your patience. It means the world to us as we continue to work on creating a new era for Football Manager.”</em></p>
<p>We do not know what impact this will have on the release schedule of future Football Manager games, as it is unlikely that Football Manager 26 will be ready by the end of 2025. The switch to a new engine and fundamental changes to the gameplay has already seen features stripped from Football Manager 25 including, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/football-manager-25-releasing-late-november-international-management-removed/">international management</a>, which should return in future games, touchline shouts, create a club, challenge mode, and versus mode. Football Manager 25 will have the official Premier League license and women’s football for the first time in its history.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amber Isle Review - A Colossal Close Hit]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/amber-isle-review-colossal-close-hit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amber-isle-review-a-colossal-close-hit.1006155/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/amber-isle-review-colossal-close-hit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Who knew that the answer to ultimate relaxation was building a shop and rebuilding an island entirely made up of cute dinosaurs? <em>Amber Isle</em> lets you do just that, combining adorable aesthetics with island restoration that takes the edge off after a long day.</p>
<p><em>Amber Isle</em> is, at its core, a management game. Players fall in control of an island shop, where they soon learn that they can revive the island by being successful and breathing life into the abandoned areas. More dinosaurs can be invited to stay as areas are fixed up, and a touching story brings the island together by the end.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to love about <em>Amber Isle</em> – the shop simulation, dinosaur designs, and overall decorating were wonderful. However, there are bugs at every corner that slows things down, and not in a good way.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amber-isle-story.jpg?itok=hgqkvyhl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amber-isle-story.jpg?itok=1mp5E_it 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Taking control of the shop is the first part of the story in&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>Shop Simulation Done As Cozy As Possible</h2>
<p><em>Amber Isle</em> does a few things incredibly well, and the shop simulation aspect is one of them. Players mostly craft all the items they sell with materials gathered by cleaning up and exploring the island areas.</p>
<p>This crafting system was a lot simpler than in many other games. Gathering materials for each item was straightforward and easy to do. For those who aren’t a fan of complex crafting systems, like myself, this is a good thing. It’s much more relaxing and calm compared to other, similar games, such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/cozy-grove-review"><em>Cozy Grove</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the shop itself was much more relaxing to run than other shop simulation games. Most of the time, dinos will buy the item outright or bring it up to the counter to haggle.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amber-isle-haggling.jpg?itok=TDvrQtzf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amber-isle-haggling.jpg?itok=RqB4KcKc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle</em>, haggling is a way to either make friends or boost your shop's ranking -- choose wisely.</figcaption></figure><p>Haggling is what you make of it. By giving dinos the price they want, or at least a lower price than you’re asking, friendship with them is raised significantly. By trying to get a better deal for yourself, the shop’s level will rise more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When players aren’t haggling, they can clean the shop or turn on various appliances to raise the aesthetics of the shop (though this isn’t available until later on). Occasionally, a dino will break something that has to be addressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only problem with the shop is that it can be buggy. There were several times when I was trying to accept a haggle price set by a dino and they would act like I was charging them much higher than they were asking. This led to several mad dinosaurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, trying to interact with the front counter can be difficult. The interact icon is hard to land perfectly on at times, especially if there’s any sort of furniture near the front counter, even in areas that you wouldn’t expect to impact you. I ended up just not using the entire wall that the counter is closest to as a way to avoid the worst of the problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found ways around these problems, but it was a bit annoying to do so consistently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amber-isla-kai.jpg?itok=j2qbvB5A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amber-isla-kai.jpg?itok=rZPkvn2R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The dinos in&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle&nbsp;</em>are unique and lovable with distinct personalities.</figcaption></figure><h2>Dino Designs Take the Stage in Amber Isle</h2>
<p>The dinosaurs in <em>Amber Isle</em> had distinct personalities and stories. I was impressed by this level of detail, with some dinos being related to each other and others having development as the story progresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting to know these dinos is a key part of <em>Amber Isle</em>. It’s also really well incorporated into the story. While they are all side quests, players will inevitably complete them as they progress. This kept <em>Amber Isle</em> fresh and cohesive on top of the great characters.</p>
<p>Plus, the dinosaur designs were incredibly fun. While creating your own character is its own adventure, meeting the other dinosaurs was part of the fun. Their designs matched their personalities well, even down to the tiniest details.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amber-isle-character-creator.jpg?itok=uUffY8HO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amber-isle-character-creator.jpg?itok=IcCzm_wC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even the character creator in&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle&nbsp;</em>is incredibly detailed.</figcaption></figure><h2>Decorating and Reviving Amber Isle is Free and Fun</h2>
<p>Recruiting these adorable dinos means making the areas around <em>Amber Isle</em> as attractive as possible. Decorating and redesigning these areas is vital, and it feels less like a chore and more like an honor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Designing is simple and intuitive, and it just costs money to do (which is a much less complex system than having to craft every individual item). The decorations themselves are cute, and it’s satisfying to walk around and see what you’ve created. There are so many ways to really tailor each area and make it exactly what you want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ironically, this became the highlight of my playthrough. I had a lot of fun creating little areas. Designing can sometimes feel overwhelming or pointless, even for the most style-savvy players. However, its purpose and the ease of decorating make the feature a highlight instead of something stressful.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baths-in-amber-isle.jpg?itok=81Co7BC6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baths-in-amber-isle.jpg?itok=uFNLGPqY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The areas around&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle&nbsp;</em>were just as distinct and full of possibility as the game itself.</figcaption></figure><h2>Paleo Problems Abound</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, there were several problems in&nbsp;<em>Amber Isle</em> that can make the game feel frustrating. For example, there were consistently spaces in my inventory or in the shop that I couldn’t interact with. So if I needed to choose a specific item to move or to give to a customer, I literally couldn’t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occasionally, I could get around this by automatically sorting my bag. This would force items to move and hopefully land somewhere I could interact. The problematic spots were different every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, I struggled to find dinos sometimes. They’d show on the overworld map but be hidden by an object. In particular, one small dinosaur was almost always stuck under a pile of dirt and impossible to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smaller problems, such as a lack of explanation about how to use several systems in the game and UI issues, brought <em>Amber Isle</em>&nbsp;down quite a bit. Some players may be less bothered by these, but it’s enough to make the game confusing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A note on the game's Discord did explain that the build I had been playing was old, and it had been updated and was available to check out. This was after the review was written, and after checking the new build out, there were still several problems. Some bugs had been fixed while others still made it into the game, and new bugs cropped up that I'd never experienced before.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/audi-in-amber-isle.jpg?itok=VxbZyOe- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/audi-in-amber-isle.jpg?itok=mwluO1EE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>OrbCorp, the main antagonist in <em>Amber Isle</em>, is just as big a problem as the bugs.</figcaption></figure><h2>Overall, Amber Isle Falls Just Short</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, these problems make it so that <em>Amber Isle</em> struggles to feel like a good, solid game. It has several amazing components, but the bugs and issues are so abundant that it’s frustrating at best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, for players who don’t mind navigating around bugs for cute, relaxing dinosaur fun, <em>Amber Isle</em> is a solid pick.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-25-delayed-to-next-year-after-difficult-development-cycle.1006152/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-delayed-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and developer Sports Interactive have announced a&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>delay, with the management sim now due to launch for PC and consoles in March next year.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-delayed-until-march-2025" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post explaining the delay</a>, Sports Interactive says that the additional development time it afforded itself back in September "has not been sufficient" to ensure the game "meets your expectations and our very high standards".</p>
<p>The studio puts the delay down to a "difficult development cycle", with many parts of&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25</em>'s creation "moving slower than we had predicted", although the dev says that's not the team's fault.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-25-delayed-player-screen.jpg?itok=uZXvm0-d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-25-delayed-player-screen.jpg?itok=nz4OyoAp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>won't be arriving until March next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Sports Interactive goes on to say that the timeline for&nbsp;<em>FM25</em>'s development was "already tight", and that the developer was "simply rushing too much and in danger of compromising our usual standards".</p>
<p>The studio concludes that it's too risky to rush&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>to release in November, and so the game will now be launching in March instead. Advanced Access will still be available ahead of the new release date.</p>
<p>This delay announcement is pretty noteworthy given that the&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>release date was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-release-date">only announced last week</a>, raising questions about how a game can be delayed less than two weeks after its release date was revealed.</p>
<p>Judging by some of the replies on&nbsp;<em>Football Manager</em>'s official X (formerly Twitter) account, fans aren't happy with the delay, either. Many suggest that the release of&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>is now effectively irrelevant, given that it will launch just two months or so before the end of the season.</p>

<p><em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>series of football (sorry, I'm British, so it's not "soccer" to me) management sims.</p>
<p>The game will feature a number of improvements over&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 24</em>, including a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-premier-league-licensing">license for the English Premier League</a> for the first time in series history, although it will also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-dev-update">lack Create-a-Club and other core series features</a>.</p>
<p>We don't know when the new&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>release date is, but the game will be arriving some time in March next year. Until then, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217490/Football_Manager_25/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam</a>&nbsp;or check it out on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010715" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/football-manager-25-console/9NQ4K2ZW5HJV/0010" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Store</a> if you wish.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24265928/intel-core-ultra-200s-series-specs-release-date-pricing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Intel is finally addressing how hot and power-hungry its desktop CPUs have become. Intel’s new flagship Core Ultra 200S series of processors, arriving on October 24th, are focused on performance per watt to run cooler and more efficiently than the previous 14th Gen chips. Codenamed Arrow Lake S, these are also Intel’s first enthusiast desktop CPUs with a built-in NPU, or a neural processing unit, for accelerating AI tasks.</p><p>“Arrow Lake will deliver Intel’s best performance for enthusiasts in desktop and mobile,” says Josh Newman, general manager and VP of product marketing client computing.&nbsp;“It will deliver that performance at significantly lower power levels than previous generations of Intel enthusiast products, and Arrow Lake is also delivering the first Intel AI PC for enthusiasts in both the desktop and mobile performance space.”</p><div><figcaption><em>The full Core Ultra 200S lineup.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>At the heart of the Arrow Lake architecture is a big effort from Intel to reduce the power draw from its chips. Both the 13th and 14th Gen Intel Core CPU generations were power-hungry, often drawing far much more power than their AMD equivalents. These new Core Ultra 200S series chips will halve the power consumption when you’re doing basic desktop tasks, and Intel claims they’ll shave off lots of watts during gaming, too.</p><p>“You’ll see about half the power consumption at the desktop,” says Robert Hallock, vice president of client computing group at Intel. “You’ll also see about half the power when you’re just using a single core. Gaming it’s going to be up or down, 50 to 150 watts just depends on the title and its behavior.”</p><p>During a recent press briefing, Intel demonstrated <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> running on its flagship Core Ultra 9 285K compared to its current Core i9-14900K. The Ultra 9 285K delivered similar or better performance at 80 watts less in <em>Mirage</em>, and Intel claims it will reduce power by up to 58 watts in games like <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</em>, <em>F1 24</em>, and <em>Total War: Pharaoh</em>. There are some extreme cases like <em>Warhammer: Space Marines 2</em> where the Ultra 9 285K even runs at 165 watts less than the 14900K. </p><div><figcaption><em>Intel’s power claims for the Core Ultra 9 285K.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>Intel also claims the package temperatures of the Core Ultra 9 285K will drop by around 13C compared to the 14900K during gaming at 1080p with a 360mm all-in-one cooler. While Intel is moving to its new LGA-1851 socket with these new chips, existing all-in-one coolers should work just fine. You may need to speak to your cooler manufacturer to confirm whether you need additional standoffs, but Corsair confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that all of its coolers that supported LGA-1700 also support LGA-1851.</p><p>Intel is using its latest 3D packaging technology to build the Core Ultra 200S series chips, and the package size has been reduced by 33 percent over the 14th Gen chips. There are some interesting changes as a result of this new package. The flagship Ultra 9 285K will ship with 24 cores, 24 threads, and a boost clock of 5.7GHz. That’s a slower boost clock and eight fewer threads than the previous 14900K, as Intel has removed hyperthreading in favor of power efficiency here. “We knew we could save the wattage for hyperthreading by not including it,” says Hallock.</p><p>The Ultra 9 285K will have eight performance cores (P-cores) and 16 efficiency ones (E-cores). The E-cores have been upgraded with more efficiency to process instructions, and there’s even a reduction in latency. There will be 36MB L3 shared smart cache, 3MB of L2 per P-core (up from 2MB on 14th Gen), and 4MB of L2 per E-core.&nbsp;Intel is claiming that the Ultra 9 285K will be around 8 percent faster in single-thread tasks compared to the 14900K and around 15 percent faster on multi-threaded workloads.</p><div><figcaption><em>Intel’s Core Ultra 9 285K will trade blows with AMD’s Ryzen 9 9950X in gaming.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>Intel has also provided some limited benchmarks for gaming with the Ultra 9 285K up against AMD’s Ryzen 9 9950X and Ryzen 9 7950X3D processors. It looks like Intel’s latest flagship will be trading blows with AMD’s flagship Zen 5 desktop CPU, but on the X3D side, it’s clear from Intel’s own data that it will be behind. Intel is also being surprisingly transparent about being behind the best gaming CPU right now, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/5/23668320/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">AMD’s Ryzen 7 7800X3D</a>.</p><p>“I think we’ll be about five percent back versus X3D parts, which we feel really good about considering we have just the cache that’s built into the CPU and the great IPC of the product,” says Hallock. “You’ll see about a five percent deficit and I want to be clear about that.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Intel is being clear the Core Ultra 9 285K will lose out to AMD’s X3D chips in gaming performance.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>That’s disappointing for the gaming side of things, but Intel claims it will still hold the performance crown for most creator and AI tasks. It has even added an NPU to the Ultra 9 285K, which will be able to accelerate certain AI tasks. It’s only capable of 13 TOPS, meaning these processors won’t qualify for Microsoft’s Copilot Plus features that require a 40 TOPS or better NPU. Intel is hoping that as NPU adoption grows, developers will be able to leverage this to offload tasks and even for some gaming-related features.</p><p>“It was fully possible to put a 40 TOPS NPU on this product, but to do so would require shrinking core count or changing GPU core count,” admits Hallock. “You start making sacrifices in fundamental performance dimensions that enthusiasts really do care about. That didn’t feel like the right mix. We also talked at length about the enthusiast market’s disposition on AI as a whole, and I think it’s fair to say it’s somewhat reluctant.”</p><p>A new LGA-1851 socket also means new motherboards. You’ll need a new Z890 board to use the Core Ultra 200S desktop CPUs. Intel’s 800 series chipset supports up to 24 PCIe 4.0 lanes, up to 8x SATA 3.0, and up to 32 USB 3.2 ports. The platform supports a total of 48 PCIe lanes, with up to 20 of those being Gen 5 from the CPU. There’s also integrated Wi-Fi 6E and 1GbE, Bluetooth 5.3, and 2x Thunderbolt 4 on the CPU, with motherboard makers able to add discrete options for Wi-Fi 7, up to 4x Thunderbolt 5 ports, 2.5GbE, and Bluetooth 5.4.</p><div><figcaption><em>The new 800 series chipset provides plenty of PCIe and USB connectivity.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Intel</cite></p></div><p>Intel is also improving memory support with the Core Ultra 200S series and Z890 motherboards, supporting up to DDR5-6400, up to 48GB per DIMM, and up to 192GB max capacity. DDR4 support has been dropped for the 800 series chipset. These chips are also Secure Core compliant and include three built-in hardware engines for security.</p><p>It’s not clear how long the LGA-1851 socket will last, though. AMD has committed to supporting AM5 to 2027 or beyond, but Intel is refusing to comment on future product plans. With rumors of an Arrow Lake S refresh being canceled in favor of a leap to Nova Lake, it’s possible the LGA-1851 socket won’t be around for long. Intel launched its LGA-1200 socket in 2020, before replacing it with the LGA-1700 a year later, so hopefully history won’t repeat itself again.</p><p>The Arrow Lake reveal comes just days after Intel said its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262287/intel-13th-14th-gen-crash-raptor-lake-root-cause-fix">Raptor Lake crashing nightmare</a> is finally over. Instability issues with 13th and 14th Gen chips have now been addressed, with a too-high voltage issue as the root cause. Intel’s new Arrow Lake chips won’t be impacted by the Raptor Lake voltage problems.</p><p>Intel’s new Core Ultra 200S chips will start shipping on October 24th, with the flagship $589 Core Ultra 9 285K, a $394 Core Ultra 7 265K, and the $309 Core Ultra 5 245K. Intel is also launching KF variants of the Ultra 7 265KF ($379) and Ultra 5 245KF ($294) without the built-in GPU.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-bets-on-efficiency-with-the-power-sipping-core-ultra-200s-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Intel have announced their latest batch of desktop CPUs, the Core Ultra 200S series, and it's got the component giants singing quite a different tune. Instead of trying to stuff in ever more threads, and ever more PC-incinerating clock speeds, the Core Ultra 200S family – spearheaded by the Core Ultra 9 285K when it launches later this year – will dial back certain specs compared the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-core-i5-14600k-and-core-i9-14900k-review">14th Gen</a> range. Instead, the focus will be on power efficiency and lowering temperatures.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That’s not to say this generation will actively trundle backwards on performance. Intel claim that the Core Ultra 200S’ new P-core and E-core designs have improved IPC (instructions per clock, or basically how much work the core can perform in each clock cycle) by 9% and 32% respectively. And the Core Ultra 9 285K, which replaces the Core i9-14900K, is said to be a in "dead heat" with AMD’s top-spec Ryzen 9 9950X when averaging out all their gaming benchmark differences.</p>
<p>However, this new chip also cuts its thread count to 24 (matching its physical core count but down on the i9-14900K’s 24 core/32 thread setup), while also stepping away from the i9-14900K’s maximum 6GHz clock speed to top out at 5.7GHz instead. It’s a similar story down the rest of the range, too: the Core 5 245K, successor to the more mainstream Core i5-14600K, drops from 20 threads to 14, and from a 5.3GHz max clock speed to 5.2GHz.</p>

</figure>
<p>A concession that infinite growth is futile, and that gaming CPUs, like their owners, will ultimately decay into insignificant cosmic dust? Not quite. It’s all in aid of better efficiency, y’see, and the Core Ultra 200S range is very much designed to be Intel’s least power-hungry chip generation in years, with total package power down by 40% in some cases. And while it might not get far better framerates out of your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics card</a> than the 14th Gen crew, if it can at least avoid running slower, that could work out to a tremendous improvement in performance-per-watt.</p><p>During a pre-reveal presentation, Intel showed off two PCs running <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> – both identical, save for one using a Core Ultra 9 285K and the other a Core i9-14900K. The former was pulling about 80W less than the latter, which is an awful lot of juice to save from a single component switch. And while we weren’t shown these tests in action, other games could benefit as much or more: supposedly, the power draw difference between these two CPUs is around 34W in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, 79W in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin’s Creed Mirage</a>, and 169W (!) in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, all in the newer model's favour. Gulping down fewer watts should also help these chips beat the heat; Intel say that they run 13°c cooler, on average, than the equivalent 14th Gen chips.</p>
<p>I’m keen not get <em>too</em> credulous toward the official numbers, following a torrid year for Intel that started with the underwhelming 14th Gen launch and was marred further by a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-algorithm-among-the-many-other-things-they-ruin-is-causing-stability-problems-on-intel-core-cpus">serious stability defect</a> on both those chips and the 13th Gen range; the Core Ultra 200S series apparently is and always has been unaffected. At the very least, the blue team opting not to go all-cores-blazing on performance, when AMD’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-worlds-fastest-gaming-cpu-amds-ryzen-7-5800x3d-gets-a-price-and-release-date">3D V-Cache</a> processors have claimed the 'best for games' crown, could be seen as just a different kind of risky.</p>

</figure>
<p>And yet, I do kinda see the point. For one thing, simply iterating on speeds hasn’t worked out for Intel; after all the innovation of the 12th Gen Alder Lake series, the two following generations didn’t try anything near as ambitious, resulting in three years’ worth of CPUs that all broadly performed the same. Clearly a change in design thinking was necessary. As was a rethink of Core power draws, especially for the Core i9 variants, which have recently been far too nonplussed about hitting 100°c under load. A 13°c reduction here could literally save your processor's life.</p><p>Even if Core Ultra 200S doesn’t outmuscle the 3D V-Cache crew, then, it’s still a major course correction. And could still find an appreciative audience, whether they simply want to keep their electricity costs down, or have become more sensitive and aware of the environmental impact of their playing habits. Or, if nothing else, a few dozen watts saved on the CPU would allow for a beefier graphics card upgrade without needing to change PSUs.</p>
<p>A new motherboard will be in order, though, as well as a new cooler mounting kit, as the Core Ultra 200S is only compatible with the also-new LGA1851 socket. Now <em>there's</em> the Intel I know.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They’re enough to justify this brotherly reunion entirely.”</p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-luigi-brothership-charms-its-way-through-familial-familiarity&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-luigi-brothership-charms-its-way-through-familial-familiarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Phillips at <em>Eurogamer</em></a></span> thought the game was similarly pleasing despite the familiar formula and repetitive battles thanks in large part to all the little touches and quirky characters that fill out its world. “Seeing the brothers turn into a spaceship, getting caught out by a tricksy enemy’s attack pattern in combat, going on a quest to recover hair wax for a faded Concordian pop star—I found plenty in <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> that raised a smile,” he writes. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/impressions/463951/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/463951/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael McWhertor at<em> Polygon</em></a></span><em> </em>lauded some of the new ideas in the game even though if he found the hands-on demo a bit more uneven. “The most enticing aspects of it are the depth of combat, a branching narrative, and a cast of colorful electrical outlet-themed characters,” he writes. “I have some reservations about how it plays—the game’s performance was a little chunky and battles didn’t feel as snappy as past handheld <em>Mario &amp; Luigis</em> did—but I’m still excited about a new entry in the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> franchise nonetheless.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-aims-to-emerge-from-paper-marios-shadow/1100-6527047/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-aims-to-emerge-from-paper-marios-shadow/1100-6527047/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Watts at <em>GameSpot</em></a></span> had a more specific criticism that I could see being unnecessarily frustrating without an option to swap controls in the settings. “I was, however, slightly disoriented by the way the menu confirmation works,” he writes. “Mario’s button prompts are always mapped to A and Luigi’s are always mapped to B, as usual for the series. But when selecting an attack from the menu, A is confirm and B is cancel regardless of which brother you’re selecting. That means remembering that when choosing a Mario attack, you use A to confirm and then A to perform the timing prompts, but when choosing a Luigi attack, you use A to confirm and then immediately switch to B for the timing prompts. I’m sure it would come to me with practice, but during the short preview session, I got my wires crossed and flubbed the timing on more than one occasion.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-the-final-preview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-the-final-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leanne Butkovic at <em>IGN</em></a></span> was cautious about making any grand pronouncements based on the limited demo time, but came away hopeful the newest <em>Mario &amp; Luigi </em>has enough gas in the tank for its entire adventure. “There’s a chance that <em>Brothership</em> fizzles out as the story chugs along, or that using Battle Plugs becomes rote,” she writes. “But, given that so many other facets of the gameplay immediately struck me as so well thought-out, I’m holding out hope that the franchise has learned plenty of lessons over the course of five games and two remakes to create something that feels fresh and whole.”</p><p>  <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> is one of the last chances for the Switch to go out with a bang, although people have been predicting that for years even as Nintendo keeps stretching out the life of its handheld hybrid to be the longest in its console-making history. At the very least it seems destined to be a joy-sparking crowd-pleaser heading into the end of the year. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Intel has officially announced its new Intel Core Ultra 200S Series processors. Launching October 24, the new Intel Arrow Lake CPU lineup includes five new processors at launch, giving customers a range of options for the next generation.</p>



<p>The prices of the Intel Core Ultra 200S Series processors range from $294 for the low-end Core Ultra 5 245KF up to $589 for the high-end Ultra 9 285K.</p>

<h2 id="h-intel-core-ultra-200s-series-cpu-features">Intel Core Ultra 200S Series CPU Features</h2>



<p>According to Intel, the Core Ultra 200S series has more than two times the graphical performance and over 10% more multithread performance while using less power.</p>



<p>“The overarching goal of this program was to make dramatic improvements in energy efficiency,” Robert Hallock, VP of client computing group and GM of AI technical marketing, said.</p>



<p>The Arrow Lake CPUs, according to Intel, cuts power consumption in general productivity by up to 58% in some instances compared to the last-generation Raptor Lake. That power consumption drop still comes with a slight increase in overall performance.</p>



<p>For gaming, Arrow Lake sees drops of up to 165W in total system power compared to last gen. Games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and F1 24 both saw drops over 50W. Assassin’s Creed Mirage had a near 80W power drop. Along with the power drop comes cooler performance. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Using the Core Ultra 9 285K as the benchmark, Intel said that temperatures fell while gaming by as much as 17°C.  </p>



<p>For general gaming performance, the new CPUs run mostly on par with the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X. A few games like Total War: Warhammer 3 and Age of Mythology Retold perform better on the  Core Ultra 200S. However, games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Red Dead Redemption 2, per Intel itself, seem to perform slightly worse.</p>



<p>It’s not just for gaming, either. When comparing against the 9950X, the Core Ultra 285K showed improvement in various rendering processes almost across the board. According to Intel’s data, it lagged behind slighting in CPU-only rendering in Blender, photo edition, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Lightroom Classic.</p>



<p>With this new CPU generation, Intel is introducing its new 800 Series chipset. This new chipset comes with 48x PCIe lanes and 20x PCIe 5.0 lates. It has integrated support for Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and Thunderbolt 4. Discretely, it supports Wi-Fi 7, Thunderbolt 5, and Bluetooth 5.4. There is also support for Thunderbolt Share that allows quick file sharing along with PC to PC screen sharing and even storage sharing.</p>



<p>Three of the launch SKUs will also have integrated graphics. The Core Ultra 9 285K, Ultra 7 265K, and Ultra 5 245K all feature 4 GPU cores. The 285K and 265K will have a 2 GHz max frequency while the 245K has a 1.9 GHz max frequency. </p>



<p>Regarding memory, the Intel Core Ultra 200S Series supports up to DDR5-6400 MT/s with a max capacity of up to 192GB at a max of 48GB per DIMM.</p>

<p>AI is the buzzword with PCs right now, and the Intel Core Ultra 200S series seems to be no different. The new family of processors is being touted as Intel’s “first ever AI PC for enthusiasts” thanks to its first-ever integrated NPU for AI.</p>



<p>The new Arrow Lake family of CPUs, Intel says, features up to 36 platform TOPS (Tera Operations per Second) thanks to its NPU delivering up to 13 TOPS on its own.  The NPU will allow larger-scale tasks to be performed parallel with one another, including generating video effects, audio, and even gaming. An example Intel used in its briefing on the AI abilities of the new processors was NPU-enabled auto framing and background segmentation. Intel says offloading tasks to the NPU will “free up the GPU to focus on delivering higher game frame rates.” They add that offloading various tasks can “win back up to 15%” of frame rates in games.</p>



<p>To add more ways to utilize the NPU, Intel says its working with over 100 ISVs (independent software vendors) to bring over 300 AI-based features to users. They also say that there are more than 500 different AI models supported, including object detection, language processing, instance segmentation, and more. </p>



<p>In terms of overall performance, Intel says that the Core Ultra 200S processors have up to 50% faster AI performance than AMD. Specifically, the 50% increase was using Scene Edit Detection in After Effects. Most improvements were between 15%-20%, however.</p>



<p>In addition to the Core Ultra 200S series, Intel did confirm that details on its next-gen Core Ultra H and HX Series processors for mobile will be coming in the first quarter of 2025. More details on those will come at a later date.</p>

<p>Football Manager 25 has been delayed yet again. Developer <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-delayed-until-march-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sports Interactive has announced</a> that Football Manager 25 has been delayed until March 2025.</p>



<p>The decision comes after talks with SEGA, the studio’s licensors and partners.</p>



<p>Back in September, it was revealed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be pushed to November</a> with a few additional features being removed. The short push, however, wasn’t enough for Sports Interactive to get the game in a state they are happy with.</p>



<p>“This additional time has not been sufficient to ensure the game quality and experience meets your expectations and our very high standards,” the studio said. </p>



<p>They continued: “Timelines were already tight and, as rightly pointed out by many of your recent comments, we were simply rushing too much and in danger of compromising our usual standards. This has put an enormous amount of pressure on everyone working across the studio, who are all passionately committed to delivering the best game possible.”</p>



<p>Football Manager 25 marks a shift for the series as it moves the game off the internal Sports Interactive Operating System (SIOS) and onto the Unity Engine. This has provided challenges for the team with it being “biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation.”</p>



<p>“We simply cannot compromise the delivery of this crucial juncture in Football Manager’s history by rushing to release it in November,” they said.</p>



<p>“Of course, this is not where any of us expected to be seven weeks out from our release but, in the spirit of our studio values, we always consider the bigger picture – and the bigger picture here is that we need this additional time to deliver a game that we can all be proud of.”</p>



<p>Though the game is now scheduled for March 2025, a specific release date wasn’t revealed. That will come at a later time along with details on advanced access for players.</p>



<p>What do you think of Football Manager 25 being delayed until March 2025. Let us know in the comments and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/893/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official community forums</a>.</p>

The statement continued, "In our last Development Update in September, we explained that we needed to push FM25's original release back to give ourselves more time to deliver the best possible experience for this first installment in a new era of Football Manager. This additional time has not been sufficient to ensure the game quality and experience meets your expectations and our very high standards."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Football Manager (@FootballManager) <a href="https://twitter.com/FootballManager/status/1844377892303798752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 10, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The statement goes on to explain that it has been a "difficult development cycle" for Sports Interactive, and that things have been "moving slower than we had predicted." This led to concerns that the development team was "simply rushing too much and in danger of compromising our usual standards." </p><p>The studio claims that this is the "biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation" and a "crucial juncture in Football Manager's history," making the delay unavoidable. Sega and Sports Interactive thanked fans who pre-ordered for their trust but also invited them to contact their retailer if they want a refund. The studio also said that early access will be available ahead of the new release date. A full gameplay reveal is expected to take place at the end of January.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We are intensely aware that this will be massively disappointing for you. We share that disappointment and are extremely sorry</p></div><p>"We are intensely aware that this will be massively disappointing for you. We share that disappointment and are extremely sorry," the statement said. </p><p>It's a huge move for Football Manager, which is customarily released each November. The highly-regarded sim is a fixture for football fans, who log hundreds or even thousands of hours managing clubs ranging from superpowers like Manchester City to minnows like Notts County. It's known for its intimidating level of depth and the <a href="https://deadspin.com/the-unreal-genius-of-football-manager-greatest-video-g-5707443/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fascinating stories that can come out of it</a>. It's so popular that it has resulted in fans from locales like China traveling halfway around the world to see tiny English clubs like the <a href="https://deadspin.com/soccer-fan-travels-halfway-around-the-world-to-visit-ti-1819658631/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Runcorn Linnets</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Football Manager 25 looks to be a massive update for the annual franchise. In addition to featuring fully-licensed Premier League teams, it will add women's football to create "one world, one ecosystem." Sega claims this year's version will have "more playable leagues and nations than ever," and that it will feature major technical and visual improvements as it switches to Unity. All of these features represent a major step forward for the franchise, which is known for being fairly conservative with its updates.</p><p>When Football Manager 25 does come out, it will be available on PS5, PC, and Xbox, where it will once again be available on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mario-luigi-brothership-%E2%80%93-the-final-preview.1006113/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s been almost 10 years since two very iconic plumber brothers were accidentally sucked into a new world for a brand-new adventure together, so it’s about time that Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership threw a fat wrench into their idyllic lives romping around the Mushroom Kingdom. In this RPG, it’s not Princess Peach who needs saving; it’s an entire archipelago that’s been cut off from its source of power, and it’s up to the bros to reconnect the flow of energy and commerce among the vast network of islands in the land of Concordia.</p><p>In a little more than an hour, I got to play through the main missions on two particular early-game islands, Twistee and Merrygo. While it definitely felt like these were building the groundwork for bigger challenges and more intricate gameplay to come, the slice of island-hopping upon the brothers’ mammoth seafaring vessel, the ship-slash-island Shipshape Island, that I did experience hinted at the larger potential of what’s to come.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership – 34 New Screenshots From June 2024's Nintendo Direct</h3></div></output><p>It might go without saying, but for starters, I thought Brothership was totally charming. Ignoring the fact that water and electricity is a dangerous matchup, Brothership’s staunch loyalty to its voltaic motif was clearly extremely carefully considered, from the more obvious socket-faced NPCs and the bros’ cute navigator Snoutlet to the tinier flourishes that I caught when I looked more closely, like the jumper-cable design of an enemy Snaptor bird. The attention to detail extends all the way down to Mario and Luigi’s downright hammy reaction animations, like making huge “no” gestures during conversations, doing hype dances for each other when they level up, and beefing their landings after being shot out of Shipshape’s cannon. Those were honestly some of my favorite small moments that highlight Brothership’s giddy sense of humor that feels cozy yet refreshing, especially when it’s enjoyed from a TV screen instead of a handheld console. (Apologies to the Switch Liters.) </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The attention to detail extends all the way down to Mario and Luigi’s downright hammy reaction animations, like making huge “no” gestures during conversations, doing hype dances for each other when they level up, and beefing their landings after being shot out of Shipshape’s cannon.</p></div><p>Even the premise itself feels like an exercise in kindness and community-building. The goal of reconnecting isolated bubbles to rebuild a society that thrives when more plug-faced people are in it feels relevantly sentimental in 2024. On a more practical level, that simply means more of Brothership becomes available as more islands are linked. Additional socket-people take up residence on Shipshape and other islands, opening up the main storyline, side quests, and the capabilities of the ship. I really only got a glimpse of this on Twistee and Merrygo – I helped reunite a young poetess with her mother, escorted a shopkeeper through a bug-ridden field, made friends with a local groovemaster in need of hair wax, and cut a mutually beneficial deal with an engineer to find Peach lost in a maze – but as a sucker for silly personality-driven adventures, it had me very eager to dig in.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One of the nice things about sailing to destinations aboard Shipshape is the ability to set a course while being able to run little errands as the boat traverses the Concordian sea. (If you choose the option to Fast Travel, Toad will work really, really hard.) Even if it’s functionally not all that different from a cut-to-black location transition, it does at least give the illusion that I’m being productive en route to whatever area of the sea I would want to visit next, which gives a seamless sense of exploration.</p><p>I should clarify that Brothership isn’t running purely on vibes. Like any RPG worth its salt, Mario and Luigi are regularly leveling up their stats and acquiring new weapon and equipment upgrades to take on bigger and badder enemies. Returning players will definitely notice some familiar elements of the turn-based combat system, especially in the shell-based Bros. Attacks. New ones will have an easy enough time picking it up, even if learning battle patterns and nailing the guys’ coordinated attack button presses might take some trial and error.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>A brand-new addition to the battle system is something called Battle Plugs, which is acquired sometime before Merrygo Island. These are basically craftable advantages, augmentations, and buffs that are usually triggered when certain conditions are met, like netting additional damage upon landing ‘Excellent’ hits or auto-healing when health is running low. I had two slots to work with to try and discover the ideal combinations for surefire battle strategies. Picking among the plugs was a little time consuming, but this struck me as a feature that would naturally become a breeze in the course of developing a repertoire against enemies’ strengths and weaknesses during a regular playthrough.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Battle Plugs are basically craftable advantages, augmentations, and buffs that are usually triggered when certain conditions are met.</p></div><p>I would have really loved to have gotten more hands-on time with the evolution of Luigi being struck by ingenuity – in Brothership, it’s called Luigi Logic. I only saw a few meaningful iterations of this, one of which turned the brothers into a UFO-shaped object to get them across a wide gap after some ballroom dance spins. The rest were simpler, mostly sending Luigi off to smash boxes or collect items that I didn’t feel like doing, which was nice. But given the kind of wild stuff Luigi dreamed up in Dream Team, I can only imagine what kinds of epiphanies he’ll have this time around.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Of course, there’s a chance that Brothership fizzles out as the story chugs along, or that using Battle Plugs becomes rote. But, given that so many other facets of the gameplay immediately struck me as so well thought-out, I’m holding out hope that the franchise has learned plenty of lessons over the course of five games and two remakes to create something that feels fresh and whole.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
