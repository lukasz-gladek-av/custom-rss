		<p>Crowbar Collective, the creative team behind the Half Life remake Black Mesa, has announced with Team 17 its new rogue-lite tactical co-op shooter. This new game is called Rogue Point, and it is set in a word where the world conglomerates wage war against each other after the passing of the world’s richest CEO.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rogue Point | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jFQvOaxl6lk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In this corporate war, players are not one of the many groups employed by these conglomerates. Instead, players form up a team of independent vigilantes who go after these mercenary groups, known as MERX, in attempt to bring an end the power struggle between the corporations.</p>
<p>Ann Hurley, General Manager, Team17 Digital, said, “<em>Team17 has had amazing success in the shooter genre and we’re delighted to offer another incredible title in that space by teaming up with FPS veterans,</em><em>&nbsp;Crowbar Collective. We’ve seen the high quality they brought to Black Mesa and together we know Rogue Point will take things to the next level.”</em></p>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;CEO and Project Lead Adam Engels said, “<em>We’re very excited to share that we have partnered with Team 17 for our upcoming co-op shooter,&nbsp;Rogue&nbsp;Point. We cannot wait to go in depth about the game, and everything we learned while creating a new IP (as well as turning Crowbar Collective into a full time development studio). We can’t thank Team 17 enough for their support and expertise. Just like Black Mesa, we want to heavily involve the community in our development and updates. Our community was critical in the Early Access of&nbsp;Black Mesa&nbsp;and having Team 17 as a partner for&nbsp;Rogue Point&nbsp;helps us focus on development and community feedback!</em>”</p>

<p>Rogue Point’s campaign will be dynamic so no playthrough will be the same, due to how the mission structures and designs change. The missions themselves are set in four different locations. Players will be able to equip various types of weapons and equipment, along with campaign modifiers which all add to the dynamism of Rogue Point. Changing weapons and equipment will be necessary as different MERX groups are divided into classes with their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>At the moment, it appears Rogue Point is on PC via Steam only and a release date is to be confirmed.</p>

			<p>The PS5 Pro seems way more capable of handling the demanding Unreal Engine 5 than the base model, as the system runs the demo that first showed what sort of visuals the engine can deliver much better than any other console currently on the market.</p>
<p>As shown in a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cycu1</a>, The Matrix Awakens Unreal Engine 5 demo runs considerably better on the newly released system than on the base system without a dedicated patch that would allow the demo to take full advantage of the PS5 Pro's power and features. Resolution changing to keep performance steady is rather noticeable in some sequences, but it is still impressive how the console handles this demanding demo, which uses the very first version of Unreal Engine 5 that lacks many of the improvements that have been introduced over the years.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Matrix Awakens - Can PS5 Pro handle this Unreal Engine 5 Tech Demo?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CKnW095Kpys?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It would be quite interesting to see how the PS5 Pro would run The Matrix Awakens Unreal Engine 5 demo if it were updated to the latest version of the engine. As showcased in a video <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-the-matrix-awakens-cpu-gpu-performance-improvements/">last month</a>, the improvements introduced to the engine since its very first version make quite a difference in terms of image quality and performance.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the mid-generation refresh system by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crowbar-collective-rogue-point</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-mesa-dev-and-team17-announce-roguelite-shooter-rogue-point.1032657/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crowbar-collective-rogue-point<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Black Mesa&nbsp;</em>developer Crowbar Collective has announced&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point</em>, a co-operative multiplayer roguelite shooter that the studio says will offer "hundreds of ways to play". It'll be published by British veteran studio Team17.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>takes place in a world where the mysteriously-named "CEO", the richest man in the game's world, has died. Using an app called MERX, corporations are attempting to carve up his empire by hiring mercenary teams to fight one another.</p>

<p>Contrary to what you might believe, it doesn't seem like you're playing as one of these armies. Rather, you'll play as members of the titular Rogue Point, an "elite, independent vigilante squad" aiming to put an end to MERX and save the day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rogue-point-crowbar-collective-shootout.jpg?itok=hnXDYDkR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rogue-point-crowbar-collective-shootout.jpg?itok=pRQ6C-RW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>pits you against armies of merciless mercenaries.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with up to three friends, you'll take part in what Crowbar Collective and Team17 call "challenging missions", making your way through a campaign in which "no two playthroughs are alike", which is, of course, the standard roguelite boast.</p>

<p>As you play, you'll unlock gameplay modifiers and gear that will help you create "loadouts specific to the needs of the mission", and you'll also come up against MERX classes which will "challenge you in new and surprising ways".</p>

<p>The two studios are also talking up what they call the "Parametric Design System", which they say contributes to "new strategies and challenges with every play" across four "diverse" locations.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point</em>, which shows off some of the tactical gameplay you can expect from the co-op shooter, right here.</p>




<p><em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>will serve as developer Crowbar Collective's second game, following on from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/black-mesa" rel="nofollow"><em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>remake&nbsp;<em>Black Mesa</em></a>, which was finally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-mesa-release-date-finally-set-for-march-2020" rel="nofollow">released back in 2020</a> after enjoying a rather <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-mesa-finally-adds-xen-levels-roadmap-to-10" rel="nofollow">protracted development cycle</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, unlike&nbsp;<em>Black Mesa</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>isn't a remake, so it'll be interesting to see how Crowbar Collective handles its first original IP. There's no release date yet, but&nbsp;<em>Rogue Point&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive on PC via Steam when it does launch.</p>

Since then, the franchise has remained a bright spot in Nintendo’s RPG lineup, with new titles and remakes of previous ones showing up throughout the years to the delight of fans.

Most reviewers have praised its enjoyable combat and generally likable cast of characters. However, many have bemoaned the overabundance of dialogue, endlessly repetitive jokes, and excessive hand-holding. Perhaps most importantly, some critics say the game feels much more geared toward a younger audience than previous titles in the series. As such, Nintendo may have overcorrected toward that demographic just a bit too much.</p><figure id="" data-id="094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-recommend-id="image://094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1517" data-height="833" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bowser and other villains fly through the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bowser and other villains fly through the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-recommend-id="image://094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1517" data-height="833" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bowser and other villains fly through the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Given <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>’s somewhat polarizing reception, I’d recommend watching or reading a variety of reviews to weigh how these various pros and cons might affect your enjoyment of the game before you spend your hard-earned money on it.

Multiple characters including Henry Czerny as Eugene Kittridge, the IMF director who memorably antagonized Hunt in the original 1996 movie, narrate the new trailer to set up the stakes and quickly summarize decades of Tom Cruise’s hero always narrowly saving the day at ever-increasing levels of international risk. </p><p>The trailer shows Hunt’s hacker accomplices Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) back at his side along with new recruit Grace (Hayley Atwell), who was first introduced in<em> Dead Reckoning</em> as a thief who later turned IMF agent. With both pieces of the key to the submarine housing the rogue AI, the crew attempt to get onboard and disable the all-predicting, ephemeral nemesis while everyone and everything that could possible get in their way seems to do exactly that. </p><p>Unlike its predecessor, <em>Final Reckoning</em> wasn’t filmed during the pandemic and will hopefully showcase more of the franchise’s charismatic ensemble cast actually acting together at the same locations and sets. <em>Mission Impossible 8</em> also clearly carries on Cruise’s recent penchant for spectacular stunts. The new trailer shows him hanging off the side of a small airplane shortly after takeoff as he fights with the pilot inside. </p><p>And while the title and trailer certainly make it seem like this could be Ethan Hunt’s last rodeo, Cruise himself doesn’t seem to have any plans of stepping away from the character in the near-future.

            <p>The team behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-mesa">Black Mesa</a> - the fan-made reimagining of Valve's Half-Life - has announced its next game.</p>
<p>It's called Rogue Point, and developer Crowbar Collective describes it as a "rogue-lite tactical co-op shooter", which will offer up a "strategic approach to high-octane combat".</p>
<p>This will all see players unlocking various weapons and cosmetics to help them on their way, as they shoot through a "dynamic campaign" (the developer promises that no two playthroughs will be the same).</p>

<p>"The CEO, the richest man in the world, is dead," Rogue Point's official blurb begins. "Cutthroat conglomerates seek to carve up his kingdom. Using the MERX app, rival businessmen can order private mercenary armies as easily as ordering takeout! Only Rogue Point, an elite, independent vigilante squad, dares to fight back."</p><p>Players will need to do what they can to eliminate the MERX, and "put an end to the corporate war" that has befallen society. This can be done with up to four others, making up a team of justice-seeking gun-slingers.</p>
<p>"We cannot wait to go in depth about the game, and everything we learned while creating a new IP (as well as turning Crowbar Collective into a full time development studio)," project lead Adam Engels said today, thanking Rogue Point partner Team 17 in the process.</p>
<p>"Just like Black Mesa, we want to heavily involve the community in our development and updates. Our community was critical in the Early Access of Black Mesa and having Team 17 as a partner for Rogue Point helps us focus on development and community feedback!"</p>
<p> You can check out a trailer for Rogue Point in the video above. If you are interested, you can also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/">wishlist Rogue Point on Steam now</a>. There is currently no release date other than a vague "2025". </p>
<p>We called Crowbar's past work a "masterful remake that improves upon a classic" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-mesa-review-a-masterful-remake-that-improves-upon-a-classic">Eurogamer's Half-Life: Black Mesa review</a>. Hopefully, Rogue Point lives up to that same standard. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Shift Up have announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover, as well as when you can expect the former's photo mode to arrive.</p>

<p>Both the crossover and the photo mode will be added to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>in an update on November 20th, and they'll both be completely free as well, so you won't have to pay to let Eve cosplay as everyone's favorite blindfolded android.</p>

<p>According to Shift Up CTO Dong Ki Lee,&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>"significantly inspired&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>", and the collaboration between&nbsp;the latter's director Kim Hyung Tae and the former's Yoko Taro was "marked by mutual respect and creativity".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover-costumes.jpg?itok=QXY2pXv6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover-costumes.jpg?itok=dBMWsizy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Blade</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover will arrive next week.</figcaption></figure><p>The crossover will introduce a host of costumes for&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>based on&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>characters like 2B and A2, as well as&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>stalwart Emil, who will be the proprietor of a shop from which you can buy "eleven different collaboration-special items".</p>

<p>It's not just the&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover, either. This update is also adding a photo mode to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, allowing you to pause the action and take photos of the game's characters, landscapes, and more.</p>

<p>The photo mode will, of course, come complete with lots of different filters and options, so even if you don't quite have that perfect shot lined up, you should be able to get what you need by tweaking a few menu toggles here and there.</p>




<p>This update will also introduce various quality-of-life improvements and gameplay tweaks to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, including new character customization options for Eve, new battle features, and more. You can see a list of what's new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/11/stellar-blades-nier-automata-dlc-photo-mode-launch-nov-20/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via the PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, it's an action game created by&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>developer Shift Up, although unlike that game,&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sony-publishing-deal" rel="nofollow">a console exclusive</a> and not a mobile gacha RPG.</p>

<p>You play as Eve, a survivor of an apocalyptic war against aliens known as the Naytibas, and you must reclaim Earth from its new alien occupiers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game proved popular among players, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">selling a million copies</a>&nbsp;just a few months after its launch, although the much-talked-about PC port remains unannounced at time of writing.</p>

<p>You can pick up&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/stellar-blade/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

Also, we got Cobb literally scorching a mother and son from the rival Maroni crime family, an inside look at the devastation The Riddler caused when he flooded parts of the city at the end of <em>The Batman</em>, and insight into Cobb’s plan to take over Gotham. </p><p>As great as the show was, it left a number of questions we need answered when we return to Gotham in 2026 for <em>The Batman: Part II</em></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="968a39a5759226fe8b9554ef57aaef2a" data-recommend-id="image://968a39a5759226fe8b9554ef57aaef2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="968a39a5759226fe8b9554ef57aaef2a" data-recommend-id="image://968a39a5759226fe8b9554ef57aaef2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In <em>The Batman</em>, Cobb is more of an annoyance than a major player in the action, but he had flashes of being a formidable foe to the billionaire vigilante.

In eight award-worthy episodes of <em>The Penguin, </em>Cobb has dismantled the Maroni crime family, inspired mutinies in all of the rival gangs, and is figuratively and literally on top of Gotham. Although Gotham produces a new villain every day, for now, Oz is the king. And he’s already shown how he can influence the media and politics, making him even more formidable.</p><p>The biggest confirmation of Oz being Batman’s next nemesis is in the last scene of <em>The Penguin </em>when Eve Karlo (Carmen Ejogo), creepily cosplaying as Cobb’s mother, tells him there’s nothing in his way of Gotham being his, just before someone gets the bright idea to send the bat signal into the sky.

While Batman was solving riddles and doing the most brooding version of flirting with Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), Sofia Gigante was being drugged, electrocuted, and assaulted in Arkham Asylum thanks to Cobb. Now that she’s back in Arkham Asylum because of the same person, Batman may have gained an ally he doesn’t know he has yet.</p><p>In the comics, Gigante is secretly the serial killer The Hangman, an identity she denies is hers in the show, and runs into issues with Batman. Even if she isn’t The Hangman in <em>The Penguin</em>, she’s shown she’s a ruthless tactician willing to bomb an already decimated community like Crown Point if it means blowing up Cobb’s operation in the process. It would be safe to assume the only joy Gigante feels is the recurring thought of how she will enact revenge on Penguin. Why not let your half-sister’s love interest help do the job for you?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-recommend-id="image://fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="570" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->DC Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-recommend-id="image://fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="570" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Corruption in Gotham is like sand in the desert. In episode six of <em>The Penguin</em>, Cobb spoke about politicians diverting resources like electricity and infrastructure repair to richer communities instead of to the poorer communities like Crown Point that are living in rubble and FEMA tents. In<em> Batman </em>lore, this type of nefarious prejudice is usually the work of one shadowy cabal, The Court of Owls. </p><p>This is a secret society comprised of the wealthiest and most influential people who control every part of Gotham, yet only exist to most of the citizens as an urban legend. The classist divide in the city was a main motivator for The Riddler, who grew up as a poor orphan, targeting corrupt wealthy individuals who he felt abandoned those with similar upbringings. That insidious elitism, along with Gotham’s criminal hierarchy being in flux thanks to Cobb and Gigante’s turf war, might be enough for the true rulers of Gotham to come out of the shadows in <em>The Batman Part II</em>.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-recommend-id="image://fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-recommend-id="image://fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In two episodes, the Maroni crime family succession tree was dismantled after Cobb set fire to matriarch Nadia Maroni (Shohreh Aghdashloo) and heir to the throne Taj Maroni (Aria Shahghasemi), before fighting head of the family Salvatore Maroni (Clancy Brown) to the point of a heart attack. </p><p>The Maroni family is no joke and played a pivotal role in <em>The Batman</em>, as Salvatore tried blackmailing Batman’s father Thomas Wayne while he was running for mayor by threatening to release information about his wife Martha Wayne’s struggles with mental illness. This led to a domino effect where Thomas inadvertently got the journalist killed by Carmine Falcone after asking the crime boss to only threaten them into silence, and then got himself killed when he tried to turn Falcone in. In a not-so-roundabout way, the Maroni family is responsible for Batman losing his parents. </p><p>Now, that the heads of the family are gone, is there a long lost familial successor looking to take on the mantle and, as a result, the ire of Batman?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-recommend-id="image://807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-recommend-id="image://807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the biggest missteps the movie made that was fixed in the show was the relatively little time fans got to spend in the playground of nightmares that is Arkham Asylum.

Given the fact she’s back in her old, deranged stomping grounds, and the best <em>Batman</em> villains are in Arkham, <em>The Batman Part II </em>would be foolish to treat it like a side quest after <em>The Penguin</em> made us want to live in that world for longer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-recommend-id="image://ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-recommend-id="image://ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Gotham is fun, but it’s just one city. Both the movie and the show keep all of the action inside the murderous metropolis. But, in <em>The Penguin</em>, Cobb mentioned a few times how partnering with the Chinese crime syndicate The Triads could take his operation international. Now that they not only agreed to join his alliance with the other rival gangs of Gotham, but also had internal mutinies that helped Cobb ascend to the top of Gotham’s crime world, it looks like it’s only a matter of time before we see the true scope of Gotham’s influence beyond the city limits. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-recommend-id="image://87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="641" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros/Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-recommend-id="image://87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="641" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Carmine Falcone spread his seed far and wide, and somehow produced two of the most badass women to ever hit Gotham. Kyle may have despondently left the city after deeming it beyond saving at the end of <em>The Batman</em>, but we all know the woman who eventually becomes Catwoman always crawls back to the city that made her. And her letter to her imprisoned half-sister at the end of <em>The Penguin</em>’s season finale is her first step back home.</p><p>Kyle’s letter not only woke Gigante out of her catatonic gaze, but brought a smile to her face. This is arguably the most compelling wrinkle that <em>The Penguin </em>adds to <em>The Batman Part II</em>’s storyline. What could she have possibly written that would make a woman, who could be facing death in prison, feel joy? Did she congratulate her on wiping out multiple crime families, including the one they were both born to and victimized by? Did she let her know that she thinks she’s innocent (she isn’t) and she was framed (she wasn’t)? Or, maybe she told her a plan she has to get her sister out so they can enact her revenge alongside her lover boy Batman?</p><p>Whatever she wrote, <em>The Batman Part II </em>needs to find a way to make that a catalyst for the sisterly meet-up we all want. Plus, I’m sure if you have undeniable talent like Kravitz and Milioti in your cinematic universe, you’re legally obligated to make them share the screen. Or, you should be. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-recommend-id="image://431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1077" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-recommend-id="image://431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1077" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>The Batman</em> director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a62282321/why-batman-is-not-in-the-penguin/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a62282321/why-batman-is-not-in-the-penguin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Reeves told us</a></span> from the start that Batman wouldn’t been swooping in to save the day in <em>The Penguin </em>because the show was meant to focus solely on telling the story of Gotham’s underworld, not how Batman fights their crimes.

While probably best known for his movie appearances in the Candyman and Final Destination franchises, the actor also has voiced some big roles in video games the past few years--such as Venom in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-2-review-web-warriors/1900-6418134/" data-ref-id="1900-6418134">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Insomniac Games paid tribute to Todd over the weekend, posting a statement <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1855085273035530368" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> noting the team was "heartbroken" by his death. "He brought so much joy to our studio during the production of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and to many fans around the world with his inimitable voice and presence. We are Venom... forever," said Insomniac.</p><p dir="ltr">Spider-Man 2 saw the introduction of the symbiote, portrayed by Todd. Last year, the actor showed up with other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-gets-comic-con-panel-this-month-with-a-bunch-of-big-names/1100-6515752/" data-ref-id="1100-6515752">big names from Spider-Man 2 for a Comic-Con panel called "Symbiotic Relationships."</a> Todd also told <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/marvels-spider-man-2-venom-tony-todd-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marvel.com</a> before the game launched that "Venom is one of the coolest Marvel characters ever created." Last month, Insomniac revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-comes-to-pc-in-january/1100-6527271/" data-ref-id="1100-6527271">Spider-Man 2 will arrive on PC on January 30</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Todd will also be featured in next month's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.

            <p><strong>UPDATE 4pm UK:</strong> Well, that didn't take long. Microsoft has now confirmed Spyro Reignited Trilogy hits Xbox Game Pass tomorrow, 12th November.</p>
<p>The trilogy of titles will be available to play whether you subscribe to Game Pass Standard, Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass, across cloud, console and PC.</p>
<divider></divider>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 3pm UK:</strong> Stop everything - Xbox is teasing that Spyro is coming to Game Pass.</p>
<p>We don't have much to go on - Microsoft simply posted a 30-second teaser of a glittery chest and the words, "hey, uhh who left this chest here?" - but it's enough to get fans excited that the Spyro: Reignited Trilogy could be on its way to the Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</p>

<p>The official Sypro the Dragon X/Twitter account responded with three wide-eyes emojis and shared the message. Up until today, the account had been dormant since May.</p> <div>

<p>The good news is these kinds of teases often come ahead of an imminent release, so, hopefully, we won't have to wait long for formal confirmation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Microsoft has announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-november-line-up-announced">Xbox Game Pass line-up for the first half of November</a>, headlined by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-slug-tactics">Metal Slug Tactics</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator">Goat Simulator</a> Remastered and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Xbox recently reaffirmed its commitment to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reaffirms-commitment-to-bringing-great-games-to-more-people-on-more-devices">"bringing great games to more people on more devices"</a> and plans to "extend" its strategy to bring its most notable franchises to other platforms like PS5 and Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-will-make-exploration-feel-truly-rewarding-says-machinegames/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, MachineGames has <a href="https://youtu.be/ik6WEckZKh4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released </a>a new deep dive video for the upcoming action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-qa-game-features-dozens-of-upgrades-is-absolutely-inspired-by-riddick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. In the footage, Audio Director Pete Ward claimed that the game will make exploration feel truly rewarding, especially for those players who like to wander off.</p>
<p><em>The game is designed around the charm and resourcefulness of our hero. You will be thrown into this story-driven&nbsp;journey where Indiana must hunt for clues to uncover the Great Circle's mysteries. This race for answers will take you to ancient crypts, lost civilizations, and much more.</em></p>
<p><em>The focus for this game is adventure. When you venture into the unknown we want exploration to feel truly rewarding. We carefully crafted each environment to encourage players to uncover clues left, discover valuable objects, and reveal hidden secrets that can aid you in your adventure.</em></p>
<p><em>While the vividly recreated locations you visit have a clear goal driving the story forward, you'll always feel enticed to explore the world and discover the many secrets hiding around every corner. Open areas give you the freedom to find your own adventures beautiful. In these areas, let your curiosity take you off the main path and uncover new missions and mysteries.</em></p>
<p>As an adventure game first and foremost said to have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-a-spiritual-successor-to-classic-adventure-game-fate-of-atlantis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired</a> by 1992's classic point-and-click game Fate of Atlantis, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will also place a significant emphasis on puzzles.</p>
<p><em>During your adventure, Indiana's versatile tools are at your disposal. It's up to you to find clever uses for each of them. That includes Indiana's camera. Snap photos to reveal historical insights and important clues. Or if you feel the need, use it to receive puzzle hints.</em></p>
<p><em>The journal is your complete guide. It starts as a blank slate but becomes a detailed archive of your journey with maps, photos, and letters. It's a reminder of where you've been and, for the sharp observer, a hint about where to head next.</em></p>
<p><em>Indiana's greatest tool is his mind. Just like Indie, you'll use yours to navigate buried tombs and activate forgotten puzzles while avoiding deadly traps. Clues from the journal, traversal, and decryption are just a few of the things you'll need to figure out the solutions. Every puzzle is designed to fit seamlessly into the world. They range from smaller challenges hiding forbidden secrets to epic obstacles leading to greater mysteries. Solving these puzzles will make you feel like the world's greatest archaeologist.</em></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will be released on December 9 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, while a PlayStation 5 version is being <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prepared</a> for Spring 2025. Meanwhile, check out our recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview-swinging-in-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a> from a press event.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dark Minimalist RPG Songs of Rats Revealed for Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/songs-of-rats-dark-indie-rpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dark-minimalist-rpg-songs-of-rats-revealed-for-next-year.1032573/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/songs-of-rats-dark-indie-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Salient Games and publisher Tesseract Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats</em>, an "indie dark role-playing game inspired by choose-your-own-adventure books". It's coming to PC sometime early next year.</p>

<p><em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>takes place in a cluster of broken-down spaceships and space stations "crushed and combined into one massive structure" known as the Wreckage. Bizarrely, due to "advanced self-repair technology", the Wreckage has become a haven for its inhabitants.</p>

<p>You must venture into the darkest, deepest corners of this "dangerous yet livable labyrinth" in order to uncover "the dark secrets of fallen civilizations", together with a team of fellow explorers that will help you to navigate the Wreckage's many dangers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/songs-of-rats-announced-mutants-battle.jpg?itok=rtgbYN2L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/songs-of-rats-announced-mutants-battle.jpg?itok=MWG2kHli 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>has a deliberately lo-fi, grainy aesthetic.</figcaption></figure><p>As a roguelike,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>will feature an ever-changing world, along with a range of "strange, human and inhuman enemies" with which to do battle. It wouldn't be much of an eldritch superstructure without them, after all.</p>

<p>Exploring will not just get you combat encounters with horrors; it'll also net you bonuses that you can use to upgrade your character, making you better-equipped to survive the dangers of the Wreckage.</p>

<p>Largely speaking,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>tells its story through text and evocative lo-fi images rather than hoity-toity fully-3D graphics, so if you've got any degree of nostalgia for the old days of RPGs, then this one will likely serve you well.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>right here. It gives a good sense of the strange, chilly sci-fi aesthetic the game is going for.</p>




<p>Aesthetically,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>shares a fair amount in common with 2022's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/norco" rel="nofollow">retro-style adventure game&nbsp;<em>Norco</em></a>, although it's perhaps a little closer to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/classic-gold-box-rpgs-to-hit-steam-later-this-month" rel="nofollow">old-school dungeon-crawlers</a> like&nbsp;<em>Eye of the Beholder&nbsp;</em>on the gameplay front.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via Steam sometime in the first quarter of 2025. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3300470/Songs_of_Rats/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it here if you like</a>.</p>

The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/27/15958176/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-gameplay-preview-nazi-punching"><em>Wolfenstein</em></a> studio released a nearly 15-minute-long video, which seems to give a very good idea of what to expect in the full release. That includes plenty of cryptic puzzle solving inside of ancient ruins, and lots of using a whip in both combat and traversal.</p><p>While the exploration is obviously at the heart of the game, the new video makes it look like there will be quite a bit of variety to the combat as well. The hand-to-hand brawling looks a bit like a boxing game, but you can combine it with the whip to pull enemies towards you like Scorpion in <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. And there are plenty of other fun details, like an excellent adventure journal and an old-school camera that can take photos and provide puzzle hints.

This look at the back end, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently shared</a></span> by <em>Pokémon</em> community account CentroLeaks, outlines a suspected upcoming schedule of the card game from new events to new booster packs, with the card set after Genetic Apex <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://note.com/safe_abelia5761/n/n2e641cc42282&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://note.com/safe_abelia5761/n/n2e641cc42282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seemingly arriving around January 29</a></span>.</p><p>That deduction was based on the apparent naming convention in the code which tags current in-game events as part of A1, while after January they move to A2. But that doesn’t mean players will have to wait several months before the game’s first new cards appear. There’s also an A1a booster pack event starting around December 17 which seems like it could be part of a smaller, mid-season mini-expansion. That’s a good thing if it turns out to be accurate, as anyone playing daily up to that point will have likely filled out much of <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s existing Pokédex outside of the rarest cards. </p><p>Other significant milestones in the datamind findings <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684">point to a new store update</a></span> on December 1, as well as something Bulbasuar-themed appearing in the weeks after that. In the meantime, November appears to have a part 2 to the current Meowth event waiting in the wings, as well as a potential Black Friday event and something called “Mass Outbreak.” </p><p>If you ask me, the updates can’t come soon enough. I’m starting to tire ever so slightly of the existing battle meta, and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506">Lapras event</a></span> is truly a grind. Fortunately, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> still excels at the thing I need it for most: 5 minutes of peace staring at beautiful <em>Pokémon </em>cards while I drink my morning coffee. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-exists-in-part-because-younger-gamers-arent-familiar-with-the-series-anymore-konami-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami has revealed that one of the reasons it greenlit the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake is because younger gamers aren’t familiar with the series anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to Play and shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-exists-because-konami-was-starting-to-get-worried-that-the-younger-generation-of-gamers-arent-familiar-with-the-metal-gear-series-anymore/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, series producer Noriaki Okamura admitted Konami is looking to capture a new audience with the remake, which arrives 20 years after the original Metal Gear Solid 3 and nine years after the last mainline entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the things that really sparked us to do the remake in general is because we realized that a lot of the newer, younger generation of gamers aren’t familiar with the Metal Gear series anymore,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations. After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say — but again, who is Solid Snake?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, this is one of the reasons Konami chose the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater name for the remake, as opposed to simply calling it Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Timeline wise, Snake Eater is the first game in the series, so going with the Greek letter 'delta' helped get this new beginning across.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thr franchise began in 1987 with Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear, and last saw a mainline entry with Kojima’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain">Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain</a>, released in 2015. Spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-survive">Metal Gear Survive</a> launched in 2018, with only collections of older games coming out in the subsequent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it’s easy to understand where Konami is coming from here. Metal Gear is well-known by fans of a certain age and has enormous nostalgia potential, but without a brand new mainline entry in nearly a decade, interest among younger gamers probably isn’t where Konami wants it to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, after Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater comes out, where will Konami take the series next? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-had-a-pretty-rough-launch-so-konami-says-its-being-more-careful-with-vol-2">We know MGS: Master Collection Vol. 2 is in the works</a>, but could Konami be set to remake Kojima’s seminal Metal Gear Solid next? After that, could fans finally get a brand new Metal Gear Solid game? If so, would Konami continue the story as set out by Kojima, or start fresh?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Konami is yet to announce a release date, but it's due out on 	</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC at some point in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-datamine-alludes-to-expansion-set-in-january<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> players may want to get cracking Genetic Apex packs as quickly as possible as a datamine of the mobile game has alluded to expansion sets arriving in December and January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@CentroLeaks</a> revealed an event scheduled in the backend of the digital TCG that references A2 and is therefore seemingly linked to a new card drop. Genetic Apex, the first Pokémon TCG Pocket set and the only one currently available, is labelled as A1 in the game, so A2 is presumably the second full set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event is listed as beginning October 29 (the game's global release date) and running until January 29. It's dubbed "Period A1 to A2 (After Global Release) and therefore appears to indicate the end date of Genetic Apex being the main set in Pokémon TCG Pocket.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Genetic Apex</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, another scheduled event could indicate a supplementary set or expansion to Genetic Apex coming in December. "Period A1 to A1a" is similarly listed as already begun but ends December 16, so players should perhaps expect a smaller card drop then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is far from an official announcement, of course, and no further details will be available until developer Creatures Inc. shares them itself. But a full release every three months lines up with the proper Pokémon TCG schedule and standard card game practice in general.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The December event is more mysterious, as Genetic Apex already includes 226 standard numbered cards and 60 super rare alternate arts. Collecting all of these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take upwards of a year</a>, so it's perhaps unlikely Creatures Inc. will expand the set even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event may point to a special event for Genetic Apex instead, where more packs become available, or perhaps even a new bumper booster pack that contains more cards. Doing something like this is fairly common practice in games, with the larger, more expensive packs usually only available by spending real money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only time will tell what these events actually are, but fans can enjoy the myriad existing events already added by Creatures Inc. in the meantime. One offers players a free Wonder Pick with the chance of pulling either a Meowth or Chansey alongside event tickets and Wonder Hourglasses, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-adds-new-rewards-and-missions-to-wonder-pick-event">its second part currently active</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A solo battle event <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">lets players take on a handful of water themed decks</a> for the chance of winning new promo cards including Lapras ex, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gets-first-pvp-event-today">a PVP event puts badges on the line</a> in true Pokémon fashion. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Mewtwo and Charizard are naturally dominating the meta so far</a>, but one outlier comes via Misty, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokmon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain">whose heads or tails effect is driving many up the wall</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the collecting front, some players are focused on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-think-theyve-discovered-a-secret-way-to-get-super-good-cards">a conspiracy theory about crinkled corners</a> while most are swooning over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-swoon-over-mythical-god-packs-that-have-5-alternate-art-cards">mythical god packs that award five alternate art cards in one go</a>.

            <p>Bethesda and MachineGames have released an extended look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, giving us a deeper dive into the upcoming game.</p>
<p>In the 15-minute presentation, the team offers a look at a broad spectrum of gameplay, including combat, puzzles and traversal. The part I am most looking forward to - Indy's turn as an Agent 47-like man of disguise - is also shown off, with MachineGames letting us see the archaeologist infiltrate areas dressed as a member of the clergy. </p>
<p>And yes, just like Hitman's Agent 47, you can hide bodies by picking them up and moving them out of sight of patrolling guards or whoever else you don't want happening upon your corpse wake.</p>

<p>The trailer also gives us a look at the Great Circle's Adventure Points, which are used to unlock new skills. One such skill is Lucky Hat, which allows our hero an extra chance to come back from a fatal blow. Another, Bear Hands, lets Indy do unarmed takedowns of enemies. Speaking of taking down enemies, Indy can use his gun and whip to get the upper hand, but also items he finds lying around the environment. One moment sees the archaeologist bopping his assailant on the head with a rolling pin.</p><p>On the puzzle side of things, we see Indy pouring out some wine to reveal a number hidden within a basin, and elsewhere bouncing light around a secret room with ancient mirrors. He can use his camera to search for puzzle clues, as well. </p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is set to release across Xbox and PC next month, on 9th December. It will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">arrive on PS5 next year</a>.</p>

<p>Our Ian has been hands on with the upcoming release already. "I think it's going to be something truly special and I can't wait to play more of it," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-played-3-hours-of-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-it-nails-the-films-whip-cracking-sense-of-adventure">Eurogamer's hands on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle preview</a>.</p><p>"It's shaping up to be a wonderful love letter to Indiana Jones, just like Rogue City was to Robocop, and anyone who counts themselves a fan of the movie trilogy (there's definitely only been three movies, don't know what you're talking about) should definitely have this on their radar."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-first-birthday-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Happy birthday to us! It’s the first anniversary of Aftermath, and we’re spending a whole week celebrating.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve all learned a hell of a lot in our first year of existence—mostly, that our vision of sustainable journalism and a better internet is actually possible. A year ago, all we had was the hope that there were readers out there who wanted to read the stories we wanted to write, <em>and </em>would support us with a subscription. Today, we have a thriving reader community, a ton of stories we’re proud of, and we’re part of a cohort of reader-supported journalism that’s charting a new course for media and the internet. It’s truly all thanks to you, and we couldn’t be more grateful.</p><p>We’ll be running some special blogs this week that recap our first year and that capture what we think is the spirit of Aftermath. But we also want to make sure as many people as possible are along for the journey.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">So from today through November 29, we’re offering new subscribers a month of Aftermath’s Reader tier for only $1</a>. The Reader tier is our most popular tier; in addition to letting you read all of our articles, it also gives you access to bonus episodes of our podcast <a href="https://aftermath.site/52-pickup-podcast-dc-comics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">52 Pickup</a>, where Gita Jackson and Alex Jaffe take you through the world of DC comics. We think it’s a great way for new folks to learn more about what we do.</p><p>If you’re reading this blog, you’re probably already a subscriber, but we’d be grateful if you’d spread the word. We know times are tough, and while we hope the sale brings new people to the site, we’re also happy to give newcomers a more affordable way to check us out.</p><p>If you’re a subscriber who’d like other ways to support us, we have several subscription tiers, as well as a <a href="https://aftermath.site/donate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tip jar</a> and a <a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">merch store</a>.</p><p>Thanks for being here, and here’s to another year of Aftermath.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-little-puppy-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton and developer Dreamotion have announced&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy</em>, an adorable-looking adventure in which you play a corgi who's waiting to greet their owner in the afterlife. Sniff.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the thesis of&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>is that "when a person departs from this world, the dog who went ahead will warmly welcome them". Dreamotion head Lee Joon-young says the game was created "to offer warmth and comfort" to those whose dogs have passed away.</p>

<p><em>My Little Puppy</em>'s little doggo protagonist must set out on a journey across the afterlife to meet their owner, exploring "oceans, deserts, and snowy plains" along the way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-little-puppy-krafton-heaven.jpg?itok=OcewKKqj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-little-puppy-krafton-heaven.jpg?itok=slw1QcYk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>is bound to make you bawl if you love dogs.</figcaption></figure><p>As you explore said biomes, you'll also meet a host of other dogs who are awaiting the arrival of their owners in the afterlife, and you'll get to learn their stories. I don't know if I have the emotional strength for this.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you'll be able to engage in what Dreamotion and Krafton call "interactions based on real dog behaviors", including sniffing other dogs, barking, and, well, just hangin' around as a fluffy lil' dog. What's not to love?</p>

<p>Lest you fear that&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>won't have the kind of gameplay variation to keep you engaged, however, think again. It'll feature "a range of gameplay genres, from adventure to action and racing", according to the two studios.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>right here. Just try to make it through the whole thing without welling up.</p>
