		<p>EA has just given us the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> multiplayer reveal, confirming that the game will launch for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 10th October, as well as beta tests that will take place in August.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Event" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_BRbvYxgOY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s right, Battlefield 6 is coming out in October, but you’ll be able to play before then with two beta weekends. The first is coming next week, in fact, with a beta running from 7th August, with codes available from Twitch drops from people streaming today or pre-ordering the game. This will morph into an open beta test on 9th August and run through the 10th.</p>
<p>A second Battlefield 6 open beta weekend will take place from 14th-17th August.</p>
<p>Classes are back alongside signature weapons and abilities that fit into the archetypes of games before and 2042</p>

<p>There will be 9 maps at launch including an Operation Firestorm remake, Gibraltar, Egypt<br>
Tajikistan and Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Conquest, Rush and Breakthrough game mode are joined by the likes of TDM, Squad DM, Domination and KOTH.</p>
<p>More maps and modes will arrive in seasonal content, while BF Portal returns as editing tools and modifiers for gameplay.</p>
<p>Officially unveiled last week, Battlefield 6 is a huge production for EA, with the Battlefield Studios comprised of Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios, all with different roles to play in its creation. Criterion and Motive have focused on the single player campaign, which will see NATO attacked and going on the counter-offensive against the private military group known as Pax Armata. This announcement trailer brought us plenty of cinematic moments with characters calling in military strikes, angrily slapping tables and more, but there’s also paratroopers jumping from planes, there’s beach landing craft coming out of carriers, there’s rocket artillery, there’s dams blowing up and more. It builds up until parts of New York are getting blown up.</p>
<p>A lot of this was echoed in the multiplayer reveal, which takes players to some rather familiar looking streets for The Division players, over the river from the main city, fighting in the shadow of Brooklyn Bridge. The war extends from the US through to the Middle East with modern combined forces as tanks and soldiers battle through the streets.</p>
<p>We’re going hands on with the game shortly, so keep your eyes peeled for our Battlefield 6 preview very, very soon.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/time-flies</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-time-flies-switch-%E2%80%93-an-indie-oddity-that-makes-every-second-count.1258884/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Time Flies Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157652/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>As I sat down to write this review, I typed ‘What is the lifespan of a housefly?’ into my search bar. It’s not a question I ever really pondered prior to my playthrough of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/time_flies">Time Flies</a>. Somehow, this minimalist indie puzzler got me curious enough to wonder. I can’t say there’s ever been a piece of media that’s ever piqued my general interest in a pest in quite the same way.</p>
<p>That’s because Time Flies’ protagonist <em>is</em> a fly, and <em>they made him cool.</em> That’s not how I thought I’d be anchoring this review, but it’s the truth. Much like how the goose in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/untitled_goose_game">Untitled Goose Game</a> wins hearts by being a chaotic menace, the fly is an existentialist rebel worthy of an Albert Camus novella about, say, the absurd search for meaning in a life measured in seconds.</p>
<p>That’s essentially what Time Flies is all about. Developed by Michael Frei and Raphaël Munoz and published by Panic (of Untitled Goose Game fame), the game puts you in control of a tiny housefly with a bucket list of cheeky to-dos to complete. The catch is that, depending on where you live, you’ll only have around a minute and a half or less to tick them all to progress.</p>
<figure><a title="Time Flies Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157649/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Using data from the World Health Organisation’s life expectancy figures, your in-game lifespan (measured in seconds) is tied to the average life expectancy of the country you're in. In my case, Singapore’s 83.9 years afford me 83.9 seconds of playtime, after which your little fly drops dead and you begin anew. You’re free to set any country as your location ahead of each ‘run’.</p>
<p>There are no button inputs; only the control stick is used to manoeuvre around with buttery smooth flight physics. Exploration is the name of the game. You’re given a vaguely phrased list of objectives like ‘Get Rich’, ‘Start a Revolution’, ‘Go With The Flow’, etc., and it’s up to you to experiment with the world around you through trial-and-error.</p>
<p>For example, if your goal is to ‘Learn an Instrument,’ you could try buzzing around the strings of a guitar. Tasks are never too cryptic and often play out in ironic or unexpected ways with a deadpan delivery that lends the game a distinctive comedic tone. Times Flies never tells you what to do, opting to let you poke around and figure things out on your own.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/accessibility-report/4221/embed @ 1753988409 -->
<p>Despite the small size of each of the game’s four areas, there’s plenty to discover. The camera zooms in when you’re near certain objects, which is usually your cue that there’s something to interact with. Time pauses during these moments to let you prod, which more often than not leads to the quiet satisfaction of ticking something off your bucket list.</p>
<p>Unlocking a new level requires you to tick off all area-specific objectives within a single life, which is easier said than done. Fortunately, you’re able to buy yourself some additional time when there’s a clock nearby. You literally turn back the clock to gain precious seconds needed to complete your tasks, which adds a layer of strategy to the gameplay.</p>
<p>There’s also a larger achievement list to chip away at as you play, along with 12 hidden puzzle pieces scattered throughout the game. These collectibles are impressively well-hidden, requiring careful observation to sniff out and precise timing to access. Hunting for the last puzzle piece kept me invested and finding it made me feel mighty clever.</p>
<figure><a title="Time Flies Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157650/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game’s visual aesthetic won’t be for everyone, but it absolutely lends personality. Settings are imperfectly hand-drawn yet slyly expressive, rendered in black and white with no gradients or shading. It’s unpolished in a deliberate way, landing somewhere between doodles on the margins of a student’s philosophy notebook and early Macintosh aesthetics.</p>
<p>Time Flies similarly uses sound design sparingly but effectively. Throughout the game, two sounds persist: the steady ticking down of the clock and the soft buzz of your wings. Ambient details like dripping water, the crackle of old jazz records, flickering TV channels, and even a tunable radio add charm and ambience to the world.</p>
<p>If Time Flies has a weakness, it’s one the game fully owns: it’s short. The game can be completed within two hours or so, and once you’ve finished it and collected all its secrets, there’s little incentive to return. The developers clearly anticipate criticism of the game’s length and, at one point, even break the fourth wall to gently rib themselves.</p>
<figure><a title="Time Flies Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157656/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Its creators know exactly what kind of game they’ve made, and they lean into it fully and stay committed to the bit. Time Flies feels like the lovechild of Untitled Goose Game and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/minit">Minit</a>, blending checklist-based mischief with clever time constraints. But where the goose is gleefully anarchic, the fly revels in the shortness of life and is committed to enjoying the ride.</p>
<p>Just a warning, the game does depict nudity and drug/alcohol use, so it’s not one for the kids. Times Flies runs flawlessly on both the Switch and Switch 2 with no discernible difference in performance apart from slightly speedier load times on Nintendo’s newest console. Oh, and if you were wondering, houseflies live between 15 to 30 days. Now you know.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Time Flies is a clever puzzle-exploration game and a playful meditation on life’s brevity. Its gameplay mechanics don’t evolve dramatically from one level to the next, but that never felt like a hindrance. It’s a tight, focused experience that delivers its core ideas with confidence but doesn’t necessarily push beyond them. That said, Time Flies never feels like a concept stretched too thin, and it bows out before overstaying its welcome.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-is-out-october-10-pre-orders-now-open-two-open-beta-weekends-set-in-august.1258881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Electronic Arts has confirmed the previous Battlefield 6 leaks for both <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-release-date-indirectly-confirmed-official-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october10-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pricing</a>. The game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 10 with no early access options.</p>



<p>On PC, the pricing is:</p>



<ul>
<li>Standard Edition: $69.99 / €69.99 / GBP 59.99
<ul>
<li>Phantom Edition: $99.99 / €99.99 / GBP 89.99</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>On consoles, it is slightly higher for Europeans and British players:</p>



<ul>
<li>$69.99 / €79.99 / GBP 69.99
<ul>
<li>$99.99 / €109.99/ GBP 99.99</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The Open Beta details are slightly different from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-closed-beta-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak</a>, though. There will be two beta weekends:</p>



<ul>
<li>Saturday, August 9 - Sunday, August 10</li>



<li>Thursday, August 14 - Sunday, August 17</li>
</ul>



<p>The press release also reveals plenty of details on Battlefield 6. The premise is that in 2027, a high-profile assassination throws the world into chaos. Around the same time, 'major European countries' leave NATO, while the United States and its remaining NATO allies are left to deal with a massive private military corporation called PAX ARMATA.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BF6-Screen-6-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In the single player campaign <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made by Motive</a>, players step into the boots of Dagger 1-3, a squad of Marine Raiders fighting private military companies around the world to stop a global collapse. The developers promise 'jaw-dropping set pieces' and 'explosive action on an unparalleled scale'.</p>



<p>The game's combat system is described as 'kinesthetic', enhancing gunplay and character movement. It offers new tactical options, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Drag and Revive - Lets you drag a teammate away from danger while reviving them</li>



<li>Peek and Lean - Lets you peek around corners to spy on the enemies while remaining unexposed to their fire</li>



<li>Combat rolls - A new maneuvering ability to limit fall damage and increase the chance to avoid getting hit</li>



<li>Mounting weapons - When behind cover, players can mount weapons to decrease recoil</li>



<li>Hitch ride - This feature expands how many players can be on vehicles beyond just seats</li>
</ul>



<p>The developers also promise that Battlefield 6 will offer 'reliable recoil patterns' and 'well-defined weapon ranges'. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BF6-Screen-8-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The class system returns. That was practically a guarantee - even Battlefield 2042 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-class-system-breakout-rework-info-blowout-gameplay-ahead-of-next-weeks-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought it back eventually</a>, although it was too little and too late. The classes are the same four fans have loved throughout the entire franchise: Assault, Engineer, Recon, and Support.</p>



<ul>
<li>The Assault class, unsurprisingly, uses assault rifles and has a faster transition from sprint to firing and switching to and from the weapons. It also takes less damage and a lower movement speed penalty from a fall. Its signature gadget is an Adrenaline Injector that clears flash and stun effects (and offers resistance against them), boosts sprint speed, reduces damage taken from explosives, and makes the sound of enemy footsteps clearer. Its active ability reveals audible nearby foes, and kills prolong this effect. Assault players can choose from two training options: a Grenadier (quicker reload on grenade launchers, extra grenades, and more resistance against flash effects) or a Frontliner (improved health regeneration, extra adrenaline injector charge, and reduced penalty to shooting on the move).</li>



<li>The Engineer uses submachine guns, has better hip-fire control, and takes reduced damage from explosives. Its gadget is the Repair Tool, which 'fixes friendly assets and armor' but can also damage enemy assets. Its active ability overloads the Repair Tool to improve its efficiency. The Engineer's training options are the Anti-Armor (who focuses on damaging enemy vehicles with faster loads, extra rockets, and its rockets diminish repair efficiency) and the Combat Engineer (who automatically regenerates the health of vehicles they occupy, can use the Repair Tool longer, and automatically spots mines).</li>



<li>The Recon uses sniper rifles, with faster rechambering between shots, decreased scope sway, and improved breath control. It can automatically spot enemies when aiming through an optic sight. Its gadget is the Motion Sensor that tracks any enemy movement in its range. Its active ability calls an UAV to passively spot enemies in a marked position. The Recon's training options are: Sniper (improved auto-spot speed, range, duration, and the sniper shots temporarily prevent healing and headshots make targets unrevivable) and Pathfinder (undetectable by equipment except when sprinting, they also highlight foes for the rest of the squad and can perform quieter takedowns).</li>



<li>Lastly, the Support fights with light machine guns and does not suffer any sprint speed penalty with this weapon. They can drag and revive squadmates faster and also carry a Supply Bag, which heals allies and resupplies both weapon and gadget ammunition. Their active ability is a supply area of effect around them that also temporarily increases their revive speed. The Support's Training Options are: Combat Medic (they function as a health dispensary for squadmates and regenerate health when reviving them) and Fire Support (they have improved weapon control from mounted weapons and can provide ammo to teammates).</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 also brings tactical destruction back. Players can not only use rockets or tanks to blow things off, as even a sledgehammer or some C4 can take down a wall. The developers say that projectiles now leave a realistic impact based on the round and the wall's material, while explosives blow down walls based on their damage potential.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BF6-Screen-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The game will launch with nine maps: Siege of Cairo, Empire State, Iberian Offensive, Liberation Peak, Saints Quarter, Manhattan Bridge, New Sobek City, Kundara Valley, and the remake of Battlefield 3's Operation Firestorm. Multiplayer modes include classics like Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush, not to mention shooter staples like Team Deathmatch, Squad Deathmatch, Domination, and King of the Hill. The developers also added a brand new mode called Escalation where two teams fight to capture strategic control points.</p>



<p>Portal also returns with a robust toolset that has been improved with a spatial editor powered by Godot. A server browser will be a 'highlighted Community option' that is often available in Featured playlists. Furthermore, Portal-made experiences created in Verified Mode will allow for full progression in Battlefield 6. Lastly, the developers reassured fans that the ambitious post-launch support will deliver more maps, modes, weapons, and features on a regular basis. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hangar 13 has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1941540/view/523098355357712525?l=english">announced</a> the PC specs for <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/mafia-the-old-country-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-return-of-the-gangster-franchise/">Mafia: The Old Country,</a> and unfortunately for anyone with a PC on the lower end of the hardware spectrum, you won't be playing this game at launch if you don't upgrade your hardware or buy a console.</p>



<p>Starting with the features PC players can enjoy if they have the hardware for it, Mafia: The Old Country will feature an uncapped framerate during gameplay, though the framerate will be capped to 30 FPS during cutscenes. Unreal Temporal Super Resolution, AMD FidelityFX<em>™</em> Super Resolution 4, NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling 4, and Intel Xe Super Sampling 2 will all be supported at launch, including V-Sync and frame generation for those with the hardware for the features. It'll also have HDR and ultrawide monitor support at launch.</p>



<p>And you'll seemingly need all the upscaling help you can get, as it's an extremely demanding game that seems to require more from your CPU than GPU, given the fact that even the minimum CPU requirements ask that you have an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X or Intel Core i7-9700K in your machine to play the game at 1920x1080p, with graphical settings at 'Medium.' As for the minimum GPU requirement, you'll either need an AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT or NVIDIA RTX 2070 to have a smooth experience.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Mafia: The Old Country PC Specs. Image credit: Hangar 13</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you dared to play the game at the 'High' graphical preset at 2560x1440p, then you'd better have an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X or Intel Core i7-12700K CPU ready to go, paired with an AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT or NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti GPU.</p>



<p>Finally, playing the game with the graphical settings on 'Epic,' aiming for a 4K resolution, you'll need an AMD Ryzen 7 9700X or Intel Core i7-14700K CPU, paired with an AMD Radeon RX 9070 or NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti.</p>



<p>With all that said, even those with lower-spec hardware might be able to squeeze out some semblance of a good experience by tweaking the graphical settings to fit their build. Here are all the settings you can tweak at launch: </p>



<ul>
<li>Display Selection: (varies by setup)</li>



<li>Screen Mode: Windowed, Borderless Fullscreen</li>



<li>Window Resolution: (varies by setup)</li>



<li>V-Sync: Off, On (supports VRR via G-Sync / FreeSync)</li>



<li>Gameplay Frame Rate (FPS): 30, 40, 60, 90, 120, 144, Unlimited</li>



<li>Quality Preset: Low, Medium, High, Epic, Custom</li>



<li>Anti-Aliasing &amp; Upscaling: Unreal TSR, NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, Intel XeSS</li>



<li>Upscaling Mode: Performance - High, Performance, Balanced, Quality, Quality - High, Native</li>



<li>Sharpness:&nbsp; 0.1 - 1.0 (in increments of .1)</li>



<li>Frame Generation: Off, On (on supported hardware)</li>



<li>Global Illumination: High, Epic</li>



<li>Shadows: Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>Reflections: Low, Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>View Distance: Near, Medium, Far, Epic</li>



<li>Textures: Low, Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>Foliage: Low, Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>Effects: Low, Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>Post Processing: Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>Motion Blur: Off, On</li>
</ul>



<p>Hopefully, when Mafia: The Old Country launches next week on August 8, 2025, it won't arrive with a slew of other technical issues that impair it from running well on the builds that it should run on without issue. We'll see how things go when it hits PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S next week.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Multiplayer Preview - Good Company]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battlefield-6-multiplayer-preview-good-company</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-multiplayer-preview-good-company.1258872/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s only been a handful of days since EA raised the curtain on <em>Battlefield 6 </em>and already it’s become abundantly clear: <em>Battlefield</em> is back.</p>

<p>And EA is here to celebrate it with all the exaggerated pomp and circumstance that comes with a homecoming such as this. It’s a return to form in many ways, building upon what worked before, but also trying new things that will help define <em>Battlefield</em>’s identity.</p>

<p>It’s also a chance for a fresh start, and a commitment to fans that branches out from the legacy multiplayer experience using the key pillars of classes, gunplay, vehicles, and destruction.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-soldiers.jpg?itok=sknvJ_hA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-soldiers.jpg?itok=9n46A7n7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With that in mind, EA and the developers at Battlefield Studios set fit to put on a dazzling, hard-edge show, inviting us out to see <em>Battlefield 6</em>’s multiplayer mode in action in a studio setting. From the jump it’s just as loud and bombastic as ever, with many facets that are setting the stage for one of this year’s big first-person shooters when it launches on October 10.</p>

<p><em>Battlefield 6</em> is framed by the role of a soldier who finds themself in the midst of a war between NATO and a paramilitary organization known as PAX ARMATA. These fights take place in real-world locations and set the stage for various modes including Conquest, Breakthrough, Squad Deathmatch, and Domination.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-city.jpg?itok=d1J31W6L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-city.jpg?itok=KPULzFKd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Core gameplay is important, but especially so when it comes to games that lean on multiplayer for their longevity. <em>Battlefield 6</em> aims to take the stage with one key focus: squads. And with squads comes classes, each with a specific role to play and the capacity to adapt to real-time situations.</p>

<p>These classes include Engineer, which can expertly take down enemy vehicles and boost allies', and can take reduced damage from explosives. The Engineer takes control of submachine guns and has improved hip-fire control.</p>

<p>Then there’s the Recon class, whose role focuses on intelligence and counterintelligence whilst being able to infiltrate and scout at a high degree. As the name suggests, they make use of sniper rifles and can stabilize aim for a longer period of time.</p>

They use light machine guns and a supply bag that can heal allies when tossed out onto the field.</p>

<p>At the forefront of the group is the Assault class. They’re the frontline fighter, the leader meant to take the team to the enemy. They wield assault rifles, and can sprint and shift to weapons with a faster transition than is normal.</p>

This system is designed to give the player more control, heightening mobility and tactical options in a fight, while also evolving the <em>Battlefield</em> series with all-new features.</p>

<p>For example, players can drag and revive a member of their team, ensuring both are away from danger. Players can get creative and mount weapons, which allows for steadier aim and a decrease in gun recoil. Cover can be further exploited through peeking around corners without being exposed, and you can even roll during combat to limit fall damage and increase the chance of dodging some bullets.</p>

<p>The combat system is unique in that it works to give players reliable recoil patterns that will allow players to learn and adjust accordingly. This is something the team really focused on, and getting that feedback ahead of time really helped shaped the state of the game.</p>

There’s some pretty creative solutions here too such as firing on a floor to take out enemies from above.</p>

<p>All of this extends to <em>Battlefield 6</em>’s nine maps, including a remake of <em>Battlefield 3</em>’s Operation Firestorm. Newcomers include Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, Empire State, and Liberation Peak. Several maps that we didn’t see firsthand include Saints Quarter, Manhattan Bridge, New Sobek City, and Kundara Valley.</p>

More specifically this means that while the maps remain similar, elements within them can change such as how something becomes destroyed or the location of specific objects.</p>

<p>These modes can be broken down rather simply. There’s Conquest, which involves a lot of vehicles like tanks and helicopters, and it’s up to players to control specific locations on the map. When a team’s resources hit zero, they lose the game.</p>

<p>Breakthrough divides the map into sections that players will have to fight for one at a time. These battles will continue until all sections are captured or respawns are depleted.</p>

There’s also the classic Team Deathmatch, Squad Deathmatch, King of the Hill, Escalation, and Domination modes available.</p>

<p>The Portal feature returns to <em>Battlefield 6</em> with new tools including a spatial editor. Players will now have the ability to craft their own spaces and their work with the community.</p>

<p>While we didn’t get to experience that particular mode, we did spend some quality time with many of the aforementioned gameplay features, as well as each of the four combat classes. It’s a lot to take in, but so far promises made seem to be promises kept.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-soldier-charge.jpg?itok=qgHQNM1D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-soldier-charge.jpg?itok=0XVKObGK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> already feels incredibly polished, and not just in visuals. While yes, the fidelity is there, the explosions are bigger than ever, and the audio tuned along with it, it’s the gunplay that feels familiar yet fresh and tightly tuned.</p>

<p>Things are chaotic, but the assigned roles give you a sense of purpose - you’re not simply running and shooting, there’s the potential for specific tactical actions, and as the developers stressed, a real learning experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Support class in particular feels like a star for the versatility added to a typical healer. Being able to drag and revive people means you’re not going to be stuck out in the open, and playing around with shields, healing items, and zapping enemies with a defibrillator means that there’s a level of creativity involved outside of shooting a gun. When things get tough, hanging out in one of the vehicles isn’t a bad play either.</p>

It truly does feel like you’re doing different things on the same map. This is especially true in the close quarters locations like Cairo, which relies a lot on buildings and small spaces.</p>

<p>These few hours were only a taste of what’s to come in <em>Battlefield 6</em>. With promises of post-launch support and an open beta for fans beginning early next month, it’ll be worth seeing if everything we saw holds up on a larger scale. The setup is certainly there, so it's safe to say, at least tentatively, that <em>Battlefield</em> is back.</p>

The video featured Limp Bizkit singing about a chainsaw. It was loud, bombastic, and frankly a bit embarrassing. But then I sat down and got to play over four hours of EA’s upcoming military FPS, and somehow, by the end, I was so won over by this new game that I almost forgot about Limp Bizkit.

This is a game that has four different studios (previously five) working on it. A game that EA is seemingly betting the farm on. A game that is meant to return the franchise to greatness after it stumbled in past entries, like <em>BF 2042. </em></p><p>And EA and Battlefield Studios’ plan to pull all this off with <em>Battlefield 6,</em> launching this October, is simple, but smart: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-reveal-trailer-teaser-sp-ea-gameplay-1851786894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-reveal-trailer-teaser-sp-ea-gameplay-1851786894">Make <em>Battlefield 4</em> again</a></span>, but with better visuals, improved gunplay, and a few ideas to freshen it up. That’s the fan favorite entry. The one people compare every other installment against. It might seem cynical to frame <em>BF6 </em>as “<em>BF4 Again</em>” but it’s practically what EA said during the on-stage event before I played the game. “A spiritual successor to <em>Battlefield 3 </em>and <em>Battlefield 4</em>" were exact words used by one developer. And as a fan of those games, I’m happy to report they (mostly) nailed it. </p><p>I and a whole army of other journalists, critics, and content creators got to play a handful of maps and modes in L.A. as part of a preview event ahead of the game’s full multiplayer reveal that happened on Thursday. (Travel and accommodation were provided to <em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>by the publisher.) This wasn’t a finished build, but what I played felt good enough to ship. </p><p>Set in 2027, <em>BF6 </em>returns the franchise to a contemporary military setting. There are no crazy laser guns or robots. Instead, it’s M4s, Abrams tanks, shotguns, dusty streets, and frag grenades. This is a more grounded and gritty military shooter compared to recent <em>Call of Duty</em> entries.</p><h2 id="h830845"><a id=""></a>Dangerous guns and different classes</h2><p>Combat is loud and dangerous. The time to kill is fairly short, and headshots are extremely lethal. Every gun I used packed a punch and felt destructive. <em>Battlefield 6</em>, more than anything else, nails its gunplay and combat. Firefights are chaotic, but moving around the very dense but easy-to-navigate maps is a breeze thanks to improved controls.  You can jump out windows, slide, roll when landing, sprint while crouched, and even shoot guns while lying on your back. Even when I was getting my ass kicked by some popular streamer, I still had a good time when playing the franchise’s famous Conquest mode because moving and shooting in <em>BF6 </em>is a joy. But like in <em>BF4 </em>and <em>BF3</em>, you move slowly and deliberately in <em>BF6</em>. Characters feel heavy, as do vehicles, making combat feel less like a twitchy arena shooter and more like a digital simulation of a real war. </p><p>Adding to that feeling of chaotic, gritty combat is the ability for any player to grab a downed player and drag them to safety before reviving them. I did this many times in my time with the game, often pulling fellow squad members out of harm’s way or out of the scope of a pesky sniper. It’s a small, simple, but surprisingly engaging mechanic that everybody I spoke to after the event loved. I expect some other games might steal it from <em>BF6 </em>in the future. </p><figure id="" data-id="5e44a3f016c7f34548f53bde816bd679" data-recommend-id="image://5e44a3f016c7f34548f53bde816bd679" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5e44a3f016c7f34548f53bde816bd679" data-recommend-id="image://5e44a3f016c7f34548f53bde816bd679" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Classes return to <em>Battlefield </em>after being absent from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-the-kotaku-review-1848123654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-the-kotaku-review-1848123654"><em>2042</em></a></span><em> </em>at launch (and then later shoved back in via a post-launch update), and they work like they did in <em>BF3/BF4</em>. You can play as Assault, Support, Engineer, and Recon. Each class has a few key abilities and traits that help make them feel different during combat. </p><p>For example, the Assault trooper takes less fall damage and readies assault rifles quicker than anyone else, helping give them the edge in one one-on-one fights. Meanwhile, the Support trooper—my favorite—can place down chest-high bulletproof walls to provide cover, and can also provide ammo refills to teammates. They can also instantly revive players, which is faster than dragging them out of combat, but not as fun. </p><p>Having the traditional classes return in <em>Battlefield 6 </em>is both a nostalgic return to what I loved before and also a great reminder that, yeah, this is the best way to do a class-based shooter. However, one big change here from <em>BF4 </em>and <em>BF3 </em>is that classes can now spawn with any weapon. While there are some advantages for picking the specific weapon type suited to each class—like snipers getting to reload scoped rifles without leaving aim-down-sight—this new open weapon system does rob the classes of some individuality.</p><p>This is extremely noticeable in the smaller, more combat-focused modes that take place on specific sections of the larger maps. Here, a sniper becomes less useful, but the Recon troopers’ motion sensor is still nifty. So many players I fought during the event just swapped out a scoped rifle for an SMG. It ended up feeling less like <em>Battlefield 3</em> and more like a <em>Call of Duty </em>clone. Thankfully, EA says <em>BF6 </em>will ship with playlists that feature locked class weapons, which is nice, but I worry how that will split the game’s fanbase in the weeks and months after launch. </p><h2 id="h830846"><a id=""></a>Lots of destruction, but smaller maps</h2><p>On the plus side: <em>BF3 </em>tank lovers, rejoice. Your armored mechanical beasts are very powerful in <em>Battlefield 6.</em> When an enemy tank would appear, I’d panic and dive for cover or try to get as many walls between me and it as possible. And thanks to <em>BF6 </em>bringing back <em>Battlefield’s </em>beloved destruction, tanks and other vehicles can quickly turn the tide of battle by ripping holes in walls or even demolishing sections of buildings. One of the funniest moments involving destruction that I experienced involved someone using a tank to knock out the wall and floor of a building I was camping in, sending me falling below into debris and enemy gunfire.</p><figure id="" data-id="7e5ac75492678221c0f05f90c1a22a67" data-recommend-id="image://7e5ac75492678221c0f05f90c1a22a67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e5ac75492678221c0f05f90c1a22a67" data-recommend-id="image://7e5ac75492678221c0f05f90c1a22a67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is what EA is calling “Tactical Destruction,” which is the idea that levels should be extremely breakable and that destruction should not only look cool (which it does) but that it should serve a purpose. A single grenade or rocket can alter a shortcut or change up a hiding spot. I’ll need to see how other maps feel, but so far, what I’ve played has me excited to see how EA and Battlefield Studios design maps to be destructible in tactical ways.</p><p>Speaking of maps, all of the ones in <em>BF6</em>'s preview were smaller than what was found in <em>BF 2042</em>. This is a good thing. It means you spend less time looking for action and more time fighting other players in chaotic shootouts. The maps also look gorgeous, with lots of lovely details, most of which get destroyed by the end. I also felt like they all funneled players into firefights efficiently and didn’t feel too barren or busy.</p><p>The devs at the event said they went back and got inspired by some of the classic maps fans love, and I can feel it. And all but one of the nine maps launching with <em>BF6 </em>are new. (The one exception is the return of Operation Firestorm.) This strikes me as the <em>BF6 </em>devs feeling confident in what they have made, and they should feel that way. These are some damn fine <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-7-last-ea-motive-future-1851397390?_gl=1*au54e4*_ga*MjA2NzM0ODM3MS4xNzQ5ODUxOTU4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM5Mzg3MzEkbzE1JGcxJHQxNzUzOTQwNzgwJGoxMyRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-7-last-ea-motive-future-1851397390?_gl=1*au54e4*_ga*MjA2NzM0ODM3MS4xNzQ5ODUxOTU4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM5Mzg3MzEkbzE1JGcxJHQxNzUzOTQwNzgwJGoxMyRsMCRoMA.."><em>Battlefield</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>maps. </p><p>I was sad when my four hours with <em>Battlefield 6 </em>were over. As someone who played way, way too much <em>Battlefield 3</em> and<em> Battlefield 4</em>, <em>BF6 </em>is exactly what I wanted. It’s a return to the slower, grittier, louder, and smaller digital battles I (and other fans) prefer. It’s not a confusing and overly large mess, like <em>BF 2042</em>. Instead, <em>BF6 </em>feels like a refined, improved, and perfected version of a game people already loved. It might not be the most original or fresh spin on <em>Battlefield</em>, and that might limit how many new players it brings in. But what’s here is <em>really </em>good, and I can’t wait to play more when <em>Battlefield 6</em> arrives on October 10. Hopefully, I won’t have to listen to Limp Bizkit before I play again. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384]]></content:encoded>

But that brings up one question: Is the gacha system through which you recruited its dozens of characters still intact? Turns out, no, and that’s part of the game’s major story overhauls.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196572,196411" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In a statement to <em>Kotaku</em>, a Square Enix representative confirmed <em>Octopath Traveler 0 </em>is reworking <em>Champions of the Continent </em>to let you recruit new party members throughout the story, rather than through a gacha system.</p><p>“<em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> restructures the story of <em>Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent</em> with new interpretations, but it is a new core entry in the series without gacha or other common mobile game mechanics,” the statement reads. “The game mechanics work for players to encounter allies in various ways throughout the story and the journey.”</p><p>So it sounds like while <em>0 </em>will adapt parts of <em>Champions of the Continent</em>’s story, it is being retooled to strip out some of the more frustrating free-to-play trappings. Square has already said the game will have “more than 30” characters to recruit, which is the most in the <em>Octopath Traveler </em>series. It remains to be seen just how much the original story will be tweaked to accommodate all of them, but at least you won’t have to cross your fingers and hope you unlock your favorites in a gacha pull.</p><p><em>Octopath Traveler 0 </em>is coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Switch 2, and Xbox Series X/S on December 4.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-gacha-champions-continent-remake-1851787459]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Grounded 2 Early Access is GREAT... But Also More of the Same So Far</p>
      </div>
<p>To enjoy cross-play in Grounded 2, you'll need a <a href="https://signup.live.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft account</a>. After you've signed up and linked the accounts, you can check to play sure cross-play is enabled by heading to the Options menu. Scroll to the bottom and enable cross-play if needed, then you'll be all set and ready to jump in with your pals!</p><h2>Does Grounded 2 have cross-progression?</h2><p>There's more good news, too. <strong>Grounded 2 supports cross-progression as part of the Xbox Play Anywhere initiative as long as the game is purchased on the Microsoft Store or accessed via Game Pass</strong>. Those who purchase the game on Steam, for instance, won't be able to make use of cross-save functionality.</p><p>For those within Microsoft's ecosystem, however, Xbox Play Anywhere allows you to start the game on your Xbox, then pick up your save on PC--or vice versa. You can swap back and forth between the two at any time without worrying that your progress will be lost.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grounded-2-guides-hub/1100-6533467/" data-ref-id="1100-6533467">Grounded 2 guides hub</a>.</p>

While there is a common, and understandable, stigma with live-service games and how they are managed, the developers of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">were keen on building a more dynamic version of a Battlefield game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We talked about this consistently when it comes to building the experience for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I love live service, and I think it's the most fun to work on as a developer because of how you can build a game with your players," said McArthur. "We want to make sure right from launch that we start that sort of seasonal journey with our players, and the idea is to deliver ongoing, evolving experiences inside of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the key points that the developers made about Battlefield 6 during the breakdown of its new features was that the upcoming game is all about "building a Battlefield universe." In addition to the plans for seasonal content post-launch, the developers are placing a keen focus on the evolving nature of Battlefield Portal and its various experiences to keep players invested in the game in the long term. According to Alma Talbot, the director of production, the toolset is so sophisticated that the community will be able to modify Battlefield into something unexpected.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The reaction we had in the room when we showed what players could do with Battlefield Portal was super galvanizing to hear. We love the idea of having this toolset that provides players the opportunity to create their own community experiences," said Talbot about the upgraded mode. "As a developer, it's cool to playtest the game all the time, and we're always kind of thinking about how great it will be when our players have their hands on these tools. But what's even cooler is when our players use our tools in a way that we don't even expect. So I know that Portal is going to blow us all away with what everybody's able to create out of those community experiences."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Building a better Battlefield">Building a better Battlefield</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is so far presenting an experience that aligns with the series' classic high points, while also allowing the developers sufficient room to grow and meet its more ambitious live-service plans. Another core lesson that the developers took from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 2042 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was to incorporate extensive player feedback, which they achieved through the private Battlefield Labs program, which gathered player feedback across closed tests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think one of the key things for me is the partnership with the community, which has been a critical success for Battlefield when it's working well," said McArthur. "That's why things like BF Labs have been another important aspect, which taught us moving forward, how do we make sure that we stick to those core concepts, but make sure that the journey we go on with our players keeps us honest in the vision and the direction that we have."</span></p><p>Image via Battlefield Studios/EA.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, with the expectations for a more live-service-driven Battlefield game and the need to deliver on the true experience of the series, the developers stated that they indeed felt pressure to live up to what the series was about. However, the devs are feeling confident in this new vision of Battlefield, one that could end up being their planned future of a "Battlefield universe."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think with a project of this scale, and with a franchise that's so iconic and beloved, we want to do right by our player base, so there is a lot of pressure that comes with that," said the director of production. "But I would say we're laser-focused on what we need to do, and I'm excited about what we have with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Even what we have here today, what people will be able to experience in the upcoming open beta. It feels like a really exciting and energizing time, and I think even though the pressure is high, what we're going to be able to deliver is going to be something really solid that I know our fans are gonna love."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

            <p>According to<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025"> Battlefield 6</a> head Vince Zempella, the upcoming military FPS will not be coming to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. Sorry, Nintendo fans.</p>
<p>In an interview with Eurogamer, Zempella confirmed that EA "doesn't currently" have plans to bring the game to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and that Battlefield Studios is currently focused on PC, PlayStation and Xbox.</p>
<p>When asked why, Zampella confirms that those were the platforms where the core Battlefield audience is present, though he adds that he is "a huge Switch fan".</p>

<p>As of today, Battlefield Studios revealed the multiplayer trailer for Battlefield 6, as part of a global event where press and creators get to try out the game out ahead of the its launch on October 10.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">&gt;In Eurogamer's preview</a>, I noted:</p>
<blockquote>"Battlefield 6's multiplayer is a bold spin on a formula enshrined in the hearts of FPS fans around the world. Instantly recognisable with bombastic battles and a polyamorous partnership between boots-on-the-ground, vehicular, and aerial warfare."</blockquote>
<p>The game is also set to have open beta weekends on the 9th August and 14th August, so that'll give eager fans a chance to try it out ahead of launch. Unless all you own is a Switch 2, in which case... bad luck.</p>
<p>The game will have crossplay, as confirmed at the press and creator preview, as well as the Battlefield Portal; an improved map and game mode creator that'll allow players to build their own experiences that'll be shared among other Battlefield 6 players.</p>
<p>Do you think Battlefield 6 is missing out with its absence on the Switch 2? Or do you think the console doesn't really make sense as a home for a modern military FPS? Let us know below!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-is-not-coming-to-the-switch-2-any-time-soon]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-have-78-seconds-to-complete-your-bucket-list-in-time-flies.1258818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The average life expectancy of a person in the United States is 78.4 years. So, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000120/Time_Flies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Time Flies</a></em> developer Playables has given me 78.4 seconds to play a round of its game; any second longer and the fly I’m playing as will suddenly drop from the air and splat right to the ground. If you’re playing <em>Time Flies</em> from Japan, you’re given a little extra time: 84 seconds, because the life expectancy of a person in Japan is 84 years. If you’re playing from Somalia, where the average life expectancy of a person is 54 years, you’re starting from a disadvantage, because your fly only has 54 seconds to buzz around, completing bucket list tasks like <em>start a revolution</em>, <em>build a house</em>, and <em>bring people together</em>.</p><p>“We started working on the project at the end of the pandemic,” <em>Time Flies</em> game designer Michael Frei told Aftermath. “We had already been looking at the World Health Organization data all the time already. There was this idea to take life expectancy data, so you have to do everything in one lifetime.”</p><p>The goal of <em>Time Flies</em> is to complete esoteric items on a bucket list as you control a fly in its brief time on Earth. These are things like learning an instrument, finding beauty in the world, and trusting someone—human tasks that aren't necessarily easy to accomplish, but doable. It's a little bit harder for a fly that has around a minute to live.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><em>Playables</em></figcaption></figure><p>The studio converted the life expectancy of humans in years to seconds—it’s both more thrilling a challenge and more akin to the short lifespan of the pesky fly. <em>Time Flies</em> begins by setting the life expectancy for the player; mine is automatically set to the United States, where I live and am playing from. But you can cheat the game a bit, Frei said, if you’re looking to make things easier or more difficult, by changing your location to another country. If you make a mistake—say, flying through a lit candle—or run out of time, the buzzing stops. The fly’s dead.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“A big part of the game is exploring spaces,” game designer and programmer Raphaël Munoz told Aftermath.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Time Flies</em> is best played with a controller, using a joystick to push around the pixelized fly on the screen. First and foremost, <em>Time Flies</em> is about experimentation.</p><p>The cryptic bucket list items provide some sort of guidance to the player, but the game is best approached with a sense of curiosity. What happens if I land in this glass full of wine? My bucket list has <em>getting drunk</em>, after all. But landing in the wine glass is the wrong move; my fly has tragically drowned. The game restarts, reviving me at the life expectancy settings, where I choose an option and go ahead. I notice a drip besides the wine glass, which is a much more manageable puddle of liquid for a fly. Slurp up the droplet of wine and the fly’s got the wobbles.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><em>Playables</em> via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRzrrXJXmLE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a></figcaption></figure><p>In another instance, set in the museum, the fly buzzes past a crumble of pills etched with happy faces. Nibble on the crumbs and the fly’s <em>taking a trip</em>, represented by a disorienting kaleidoscope effect that Munoz said is one of his favorite little moments in the game—and it also adds a bit of an extra challenge to navigate the museum. (For Frei, his favorite piece is <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/time-flies-lands-on-ps5-on-july-31/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>finding God</em> bucket list item</a>, which requires the fly to bounce around a video game controller’s buttons.)</p><p>Once all the bucket list items are checked off in however many runs, <em>Time Flies</em> shifts into something else. It’s almost a speedrunning simulator, about remembering and flying through the bucket list items within a short lifespan.</p><p>Playables wanted the player to be able to create a visualization of the space in their minds, something that’s complex but not dizzying, because the player has to be able to remember and complete all bucket list tasks in just over a minute. The time allotted for delighting in the ways in which animated toes wiggle when tickled or the satisfying <em>bzzzzt</em> when a fly fries against a light bulb is brief. Time of the essence, because in <em>Time Flies</em>, you know exactly how fleeting life is.</p><p>Despite the visual simplicity of the game—Frei said he drew the black-and-white game largely using a mouse, his laptop trackpad, and only occasionally an iPad—<em>Time Flies</em> has a dynamic environment full of charming little secrets. That’s because the humble fly is not so much the main character of <em>Time Flies</em>.</p><p>&nbsp;“In my work so far, I focused on the character,” Frei said. “There were usually no backgrounds at all, so the world was usually in an empty space. This time, it’s the opposite. The character has not much that he carries, but the world is the character.”</p><figure><figcaption><em>Playables</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Time Flies</em>' bucket list doesn't inspire the same existential crisis within me that the everyday bucket list often does; common bucket list items are often big, lofty goals to complete before death. It's stuff like traveling to far off places, jumping out of planes, writing a book, paying off debts, falling in love, swimming with sharks. Big, overwhelming goals that create anxiety within me instead of inspiration—abstract ideas that stop me in my tracks instead of push me forward.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Time Flies</em> uses the conceptual nature of these big ideas—starting a revolution, bringing people together, getting rich—and makes them fly-sized. Often, these goals, like starting a revolution or bringing people together, are literal: running, hamster-style, on a wheel to make it move or using the force of an electric wheelchair to push two statues together to make them kiss.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-user-experience-ux-research"><h3>‘Dopamine Simply Doesn’t Work Like That’: An Interview With A User Experience Researcher</h3></a><p>'Part of the reason I have worked in games UXR and not, say, microwave UX, is that games can be designed to be hard'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal"><h3>Inside The Mass Call Campaign To Stop Video Game Censorship</h3></a><p>"This is a marathon, not a race," say organizers who plan to keep calling payment processors for months, if need be</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/peak-multiplayer-streamers"><h3>Peak Is A Playground For Slapstick Comedy</h3></a><p>Peak creates space for players to really fuck around, punctuated by a swift emphasis on finding out</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/new-york-times-video-games-ai-nyt"><h3>The New York Times Will Never Learn</h3></a><p>We kept getting fed the same bullshit, and it’s being laundered in the same kind of stories</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/anime-manga-disney-jail-netflix-fragrant-flower"><h3>The World Is Conspiring Against Me Legally Experiencing The Fragrant Flower Blooms With Dignity</h3></a><p>The enshittification of manga and anime have reached absurd new heights, courtesy of Netflix and Kodansha’s collective bullshit.

<p>Plus Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake gets new trailer</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a70ab0909dfec/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Intrepid adventurers, if you've been holding off on playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> and have a Switch 2, today's news might come as a nice little incentive.</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoWsrW02ja4">during the Japanese Nintendo Direct</a>, Square Enix has dropped a free performance update for the excellent turn-based RPG. The update adds a new option in the game's Display settings, as well as gives the game an overall resolution bump. Oh, and it's out right now.</p>
<p>Now, you can choose between Performance Mode, where the game will run at 60fps but with slightly blurrier visuals (but much better than they are on Switch 1), or Graphics Mode, which gives you some gorgeously crisp visuals at the cost of the game running at 30fps. You can find details on the update <a href="https://www.dragonquest.jp/roto-trilogy/dq3/faq/en.html">on the official website</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/541d08c305ded/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>No more choppy waters. Or pixels. — <em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's not the only Dragon Quest news for today, however. We also got a brand new trailer for Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, which is coming to Switch 1 and Switch 2 on 30th October.</p>
<p>One thing previous trailers have teased is the addition of a new character to Dragon Quest II, and we now know who that is — the Princess of Cannock. That means they're more than likely the sister to one of the other party members, the Prince of Cannock.</p>
<p>An English version of the trailer dropped earlier, so have a watch.</p>

<p>Unlike the free performance update for DQIII, I &amp; II is getting a native Switch 2 version alongside the Switch 1 release. So far, Square Enix has said <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/square-enix-rules-out-switch-2-upgrade-path-for-dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">there will be no upgrade path to the Switch 2 version</a>, which is also a Game Key-Card release.</p>
<p>It does look good though, and at least from the Japanese Partner Showcase, it looks smooth as butter on Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Darrington Press has announced a huge wave of material is coming for <em>Daggerheart</em>. During an official panel at GenCon 2025, the publisher announced new products, supplements, and collaborations with various tabletop influencers scheduled for release in the future.</p>



<p>The first wave of announcements at the&nbsp;GenCon 2025 panel was that official Class Packs would be coming. In response to Darrington being unable to keep physical copies of the Core Set in stock, which includes both the rulebook and a case of cards, they will be launching a Kickstarter campaign to produce individual character class packs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-character-class-pack-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=WqgoxAdE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-character-class-pack-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=Nh_1zLJZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the name suggests, a single pack will contain 76 cards, providing everything a character needs to play a certain class from level 1 all the way to level 10. This includes ancestry cards, community cards, subclass cards, and all cards from the class's two domains.</p>

<p>In addition, Darrington has launched an official Homebrew Kit. This completely free resource provides readers with insights into how the systems and mechanics of <em>Daggerheart</em> were designed. In addition, it will provide resources for independent creators or third-party studios to make original creations. This includes player options like ancestries and communities, to entire campaign frames.</p>

<p>As the&nbsp;GenCon 2025 panel continued, Darrington confirmed that new supplements and prewritten adventures were on the way. An official Romantasy campaign frame, bringing players into a world of passion and power. For <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-announces-world-tour-with-city-echoes-of-exandria-tour" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Critical Role</a> fans, the panel confirmed that their actual play, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-roles-daggerheart-age-of-umbra-mini-series-debuts-at-end-of-may" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Age of Umbra</em></a>, will be getting a Season 2.</p>

Crawford will be working on a brand new setting for the game. Perkins will be writing a special adventure supplement, one that weaves multiple campaign frames into an interconnected epic.</p>

<p>But that's not all of the talent that Darrington has at their disposal. Keith Baker and Jenn Ellis, the creators of Eberron and <em>Phoenix Dawn Command</em> are creating a new original setting using the Daggerheart system.</p>

<p>Lastly, the&nbsp;GenCon 2025 panel confirmed partnerships with various TTRPG influencers and creators. This includes a wave of new&nbsp; <em>Daggerheart</em> actual plays, a mini-series form Legends of Avantris, and a one-shot by Dungeons and Daddies,</p>

<p>For those who enjoy minis and dice, Daggerheart's ancestries are now options in Hero Forge and official Daggerheart dice sets are being produced by Dispel Dice, Botch Dice, and Misty Mountain Gaming respectively.</p>

The difference between <em>Resurrection</em>, the video game <em>And Roger,</em> and other stories that centralize those kinds of perspectives, both come from a place of empathy. Mental illness has been a source of scares and tension for ages, and the reason it's trotted out over and over again is because it's cheap and effective. It's also insulting. It turns people who are suffering into props in a haunted house. It might feel good in the moment, but cheap and effective also means it doesn't <em>last</em>. But stories like <em>Resurrection</em> wrestle with the longstanding impacts of trauma and how really fucking <em>scary</em> that ends up being for the person who suffered the trauma and those in their lives. It's a different kind of scary, one that has you gripping the couch while at the same time wondering if you should be crying, it's a story I won't soon forget.</p><p>Rebecca Hall!</p><p>I love when some of our greatest actors are also genre freaks.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-indycar-racing">Rob Recommends: IndyCar Racing</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@srz?ref=remapradio.com"><span>sydney Rae</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Before I was into Formula 1, I loved Indycars. Named for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, this is America’s top open-wheel racing category and unlike Formula 1, it has always featured a mix of oval and road course racing. The series suffered a devastating civil war in the late 90s / early 2000s that basically destroyed its popularity for a decade as two competing series cannibalized one another and I moved my allegiances to F1 entirely.</p><p>The IndyCar racing series has been in an odd place for a few years. The level of racing has frequently been exceptional, and the rules of IndyCar lead to a more evenly-matched competitive playing field than F1. For two or three out of the last five years, I’d probably say that I enjoyed watching IndyCars more than Formula 1. But the series hasn’t enjoyed the prestige or popularity of F1 and a lot of its excellence has flown beneath the radar.</p><p>It’s especially worth watching now though for a couple reasons. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The line between a bad video game showcase and a great one can be exceedingly slim. Often it only takes one or two surprise reveals targeting the right genres and nostalgia centers for most players to come away with generally positive vibes. The July Nintendo Direct failed on that count. It didn’t help that a fresh flood of Switch 2 game key cards is sapping even some of the most diehard fans of any surplus enthusiasm.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196230" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The<em> Mario</em> maker’s revelation that Thursday’s presentation would be a “Partner Showcase” instead of an all-out Nintendo Direct was the first blow to ambient online hype levels. Okay, no new 3D<em> Mario</em> announcements or<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> release date. But hey, at least fans could count on some major third-party reveals, including another raft of big ports. Surely Microsoft, rumored to be bringing the big guns to Switch 2 any day now, would show up. </p><p>Alas, no. Instead, the July Direct offered only a few smaller new game announcements—<em>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, Octopath Traveler 0</em>, and <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em>—and mostly spent its time rehashing stuff we already knew about like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>Madden 26</em>, and <em>FC Sports 26</em>. Even a quick look at the next <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> felt thrown together and supremely underwhelming. And there was no big “oh shit!” moment like, say, <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> also coming to Switch 2. </p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me1wgt/gotta_say_that_rat_game_dont_look_half_bad/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me1wgt/gotta_say_that_rat_game_dont_look_half_bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">litany of Switch 2 fan wish-casting</a></span> prior to the showcase had gotten out of control, but not even one of the numerous highly anticipated third-party updates made it into the showcase. No more footage of<em> Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, no release date for <em>Hades 2</em>, and no mention of the rumored <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> port. Switch 2 versions of other recent blockbusters were also MIA. No surprise port of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, or <em>Lies of P</em>. There weren’t even updates on when players will be able to get their hands on the Switch 2 versions of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> or <em>Elden Ring</em>. </p><p><em>Chillin’ by the Fire</em>, one of the more unusual games announced during the Direct, now serves as the unlikely encapsulation of this disappointment. It’s a multiplayer game where you sit around a campfire with friends. “Your goal: Campfire Level 10,” reads the description. “The sense of accomplishment you feel when the firebed turns into bright red embers and the pillars of flame illuminate the night sky is more powerful than any scoreboard.” The gimmick is that it works with webcams to put players’ faces around the campfire. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me35oe/peak_nintendo_switch2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me35oe/peak_nintendo_switch2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans were not impressed</a></span>. <br></p><p>A Switch 2 port of last year’s <em>Persona 3: Reload</em>, one of the better pieces of news from the event, highlights the other prong of player disappointment. Diehard Nintendo fans like their physical games, RPG players more than most, but the physical version of<em> Persona 3</em> is the latest to rely on a game key card instead of an actual cartridge with the game on it. It was far from the only game key card game announced during the Direct. </p><p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is key card only too, as well as <em>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</em>. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is a game key card on Switch 2, but fortunately it’s also coming to the original Switch where it will have a standard cartridge. Unfortunately, that version of the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvbir7e7lc2l&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvbir7e7lc2l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will not have an upgrade path</a></span> to the Switch 2 version, so anyone who opts for the only physical version of the game on a Nintendo platform won’t be able to take advantage of any upgraded performance from the Switch 2 version. </p><p>There are still notable exceptions when it comes to the third-party publishers opting to cut corners with game key cards. At launch, the big one was<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em>, which fit the entire base game and its massive expansion on a 64GB card. <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> is another, as is <em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion </em>which arrives in September. It can be done, and it’s unfortunate to see many of the publishers of games whose audiences care the most about that sort of the thing being precisely the ones to opt out. No one cares if<em> Madden 26</em> comes on the cartridge, but why is <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>on Switch 2 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.jp.square-enix.com/item/NXS_J_A43UA.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.jp.square-enix.com/item/NXS_J_A43UA.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just a download code in a box</a></span>?</p><p>Does any of this matter to the average Switch 2 owner? Probably not. The console is good and there will be no shortage of games to play this fall. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo’s slow-drip strategy</a></span> is, all things considered, probably the smart thing to do. God knows there are more than enough games to keep everyone busy until long after they become worm food. But the last few years of the Switch 1 weren’t exactly blowing fans’ lids off, and the Switch 2's first summer, with the notable exception of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, has been a bit of a snoozefest. The first Nintendo Direct since the Switch 2 launched could have jolted fans back awake. Instead, the post-launch lull continues. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-key-cards-persona-3-octopath-1851787455]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2004, Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima turned back the clock with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-18284">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>, a previously untold Cold War story starring Big Boss, the clone father of franchise star Solid Snake.

It hasn't gone into full detail on all the game's mechanics just yet, but said "its campaign-based structure allows you to deeply immerse yourself in the story, while numerous legacy-style mechanics emphasize your role in shaping it--your choices will truly matter."</p><p dir="ltr">The Witcher: Legacy doesn't yet have a release date but Go On Board said it will be sharing more information in the coming months. In the meantime, fans can check out The Witcher: Old World and its various expansions. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-gets-two-new-miniatures-board-games-available-now-at-amazon/1100-6529018/" data-ref-id="1100-6529018">Two new Witcher miniature games</a> also launched earlier this year that allow players to pit characters like Geralt and Ciri against those from other universes.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Witcher-World-Board-Game-Monster-Infested/dp/B0BWBCD8XQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">The Witcher: Old World board game</a> -- $98  <ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Witcher-Old-World-ADVENTURE-PACK/dp/B0DK257WLM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Adventure Pack</a> -- $35</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Witcher-World-Wild-Board-Expansion/dp/B0DK276D2M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Wild Hunt Expansion</a> -- $56</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Witcher-World-Monster-Board-Expansion/dp/B0DK24XX7V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Monster Trail Expansion</a> -- $50</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW9X8443?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Legendary Expansion</a> -- $59</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW9Y4FQD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Mages Expansion</a> -- $62 (<del>$75</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW9XQT8B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Skellige Expansion</a> -- $56 (<del>$65</del>)</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Go-Board-Competitive-Adventure-Strategy/dp/B0BWGP3ZKK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Dice Pack</a> -- $35</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BW9VG2YH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Metal Coins Pack</a> -- $41.73 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Board-Competitive-Adventure-Strategy-Go/dp/B0BW9XHCMY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">The Witcher: Old World Deluxe Edition board game</a> -- $185</li></ul><p dir="ltr">As for The Witcher 4, CD Projekt Red recently revealed an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">Unreal Engine 5 tech demo</a> that gives fans an idea of what to expect from the next entry in the RPG franchise.
