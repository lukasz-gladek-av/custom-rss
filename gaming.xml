In an Instagram post, the Superman and Witcher star praised the developers at Saber for the action game set in Games Workshop‚Äôs grimdark universe, although revealed he failed to complete the campaign solo on the Angel of Death difficulty, which is the hardest of the four difficulties available.</p><p>As we can see from the photo above, Cavill was smart enough to paste over his username with the word ‚Äúnope.‚Äù Yes, that means you could be playing with or against Henry Cavill in Space Marine 2 PvP and you‚Äôd never know it.</p><p>Riffing on this in their <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/93-september-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warning</a> to toxic Space Marine 2 players, Saber and Focus said you never know who you might be insulting in-game ‚Äî it could even be Henry Cavill himself.</p><p>‚ÄúBe loyal to the cause, be respectful,‚Äù reads the statement. ‚ÄúIt has been reported that some players were displaying hurtful behaviors or comments in-game. We do not tolerate that and will take action to prevent it. </p><p>‚ÄúFirst and foremost, we kindly ask you to remain respectful, mature and mannerly with your fellow Space Marines. You can never know how old the other players may be, how their day is going, how sensitive they may be... overall, you never know who your brothers and sisters are... It could even be üòè... you don‚Äôt want to insult Henry Cavill, brother, no you don‚Äôt.‚Äù</p><p>Whether this warning acts as a deterrent or perhaps <em>encourages</em> toxic behavior from players who think they might be playing with or against Cavill remains to be seen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Elsewhere, Focus revealed the hotly anticipated new PvE Operations map coming to Space Marine 2 as part of Season 2. It‚Äôs located on one of the existing planets, Kadaku, and sees the Space Marines once again fight against the Tyranids. The new Operation arrives in October. Here‚Äôs the official blurb:</p><blockquote>‚ÄãThe Tyranid invasion of Kadaku is ending. The planet‚Äôs organic material is being transformed into biomass, and Tyranid Capillary Towers stretch high into the skies above, where the Hive Ships wait to taste their victory.</blockquote><blockquote>The Cadian forces have made a valiant attempt to push back against the Tyranids. A team of Space Marines arrives on Kadaku with a simple mission: help the Cadians destroy the towers. The Tyranids may win the planet, but the Imperium will make it as painful as possible for them.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/02/capillary-towers-1727882783773.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Tyranid Capillary Towers in Space Marine 2's upcoming new Operation.</figcaption></figure></output><p>And finally, Focus said a hotfix will arrive "very soon" that is aimed at fixing crashes and improving stability. In the future, players can expect more quality-of-life improvements, additional customization features (such as new colors for the lenses), and, for PC players, a 4K texture pack released for free. There‚Äôs also work being done to address ongoing server issues.</p><p>Saber recently released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/big-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-30-adds-pc-ultrawide-support-private-pve-lobbies-and-more"><u>Space Marine 2‚Äôs game-changing patch 3.0</u></a>, which made <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-patch-30-made-a-seemingly-innocuous-change-to-the-games-ending-and-now-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-are-losing-their-minds"><u>a seemingly innocuous change to the game‚Äôs ending that got Warhammer 40,000 fans excited</u></a>.

He revealed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-will-hopefully-automatically-make-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-performance-mode-look-better-than-quality-mode-does-now-dev-says"><u>the boost he expects the PS5 Pro will give Space Marine 2</u></a>, discussed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had ‚Äúchanged everything‚Äù for the studio</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-is-so-protective-of-warhammer-40000-it-told-the-space-marine-2-dev-they-got-the-ankle-armor-wrong">how protective Games Workshop is over the Warhammer 40,000 brand</a>.</p><p>Season 2 runs from October until the end of 2024 and includes the aforementioned new Operations map, a new enemy, a harder difficulty level, a new weapon, and various other improvements.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>The next game from Larian Studios could be at least four-to-five years away. When speaking during the SEA Game Awards, Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke said that the next game from the company should be expected sometime in 2028 or 2029.</p>



<p>He then said afterwards that people shouldn‚Äôt hold them to that timeline or date.</p>



<p>‚ÄúI knew you‚Äôd pick up on that. It was just a joke,‚Äù he told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-head-suggests-next-game-2029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> after accepting a Special Recognition Award a the event. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, we‚Äôll release it when it‚Äôs ready. They‚Äôre big games and it takes time, so don‚Äôt hold us to a date.‚Äù</p>



<p>As far as what that next game will be, that‚Äôs up in the air. It‚Äôs known that Larian Studios isn‚Äôt working on another Baldur‚Äôs Gate title after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-baldurs-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completing work</a> on Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3. That said, the studio is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-is-working-on-two-new-games/">working on multiple games</a> right now. At least one of those games will be a brand new IP from the company.</p>



<p>‚ÄúAs an independent studio since 1996, we value the freedom to follow our creativity wherever it leads,‚Äù they said at the time. The studio has said that it is leaving Dungeons and Dragons ‚Äúentirely‚Äù. However, it is still currently providing support to Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 via a small team within the company.</p>



<p>When do you think the next game from Larian Studios will come? Join in the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/660/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> ends with a bit of a cliffhanger. Though Lilith is defeated and Sanctuary saved for a time, another threat, Mephisto, still looms. Seeking to put an end to the Lord of Hatred once and for all, Neyrelle traps Mephisto's essence within a Soulstone before disappearing, leaving only a cryptic note as to her intentions. Enter Vessel of Hatred, Blizzard's first expansion for Diablo 4 releasing on October 8, where players will race to find and help Neyrelle in her struggle before it's too late.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of the release of Vessel of Hatred and alongside the debut of a new in-game cinematic highlighting the physical and mental toll Mephisto's presence has taken on Neyrelle, we got the chance to chat with game director Brent Gibson and associate narrative designer Eleni Rivera-Colon about Vessel of Hatred's cast of characters. How is Mephisto's influence affecting Neyrelle? What is Mephisto's goal, and what is he able to do while trapped within the Soulstone? What is Lorath up to? Gibson and Rivera-Colon wouldn't spoil anything but did help set the table as to what players can expect to see as they journey through Vessel of Hatred's story campaign.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred - Official Cinematic Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In Vessel of Hatred, Neyrelle is seeking the Vault of Light, a location said to be hidden within the dense jungle of Nahantu and supposedly the final resting place of Akarat, the founder of the Zakarum faith. It's there she hopes to be able to destroy Mephisto for good, but his presence within the Soulstone corrupts the world around her, catching the attention of the Spiritborn, the guardians of Nahantu's jungles.</p><p dir="ltr">After teaming up with a new character, the wise Spiritborn elder Eru, players finally catch up to Neyrelle in the newly revealed cinematic. Soulstone in hand, she furiously recites ancient chants in an effort to control Mephisto's power. Gibson said the scene is the moment the player character is "coming to terms" with the scale of Neyrelle's situation and realizing that something must be done as she struggles to tame Mephisto.</p><p dir="ltr">"She's doing everything she can with chants to hold him in the Soulstone," Rivera-Colon said. "He's essentially trying to break out. He's going to do everything he can."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376961-diablo4vesselofhatrederu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376961" data-ratio="0.56226209896683" data-width="1839" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376961-diablo4vesselofhatrederu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376961"></a><figcaption>Players will team up with a new character, the Spiritborn elder Eru, in their hunt for Neyrelle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376961-diablo4vesselofhatrederu.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Neyrelle believed that by accepting the burden of the Soulstone alone, she would be keeping her friends safe. Taking on heavy burdens and being forced to deal with situations out of her control is something that Neyrelle as a character is used to, Rivera-Colon said.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the expansion we get to really explore what she thinks about this choice and this decision now that she's been with something like Mephisto and [the] Soulstone for so long," Rivera-Colon said. "It's going to take a heavy, heavy toll on her, and this is something she wasn't sure if she was going to be able to do."</p><p dir="ltr">As much as it's a story about Neyrelle, it's also one about Mephisto, too. Absent in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a>, he played a supporting role in the story of Diablo 4, aiding players anonymously in his Bloodied Wolf form on their quest to stop Lilith before eventually revealing his true identity. Gibson said one of the goals of the expansion was to hone in on the Lord of Hatred and tell the next major chapter of his story, teasing that there is "still more to come" in regards to Mephisto that Blizzard will craft over time.</p><p dir="ltr">Mephisto is one of the Prime Evils, and though he is terrifying in his own way, he's quite different compared to the demon from which the series derives its name, Diablo. Mephisto is more keen to sow hatred and division among the people of Sanctuary, finding vulnerabilities in people and turning friends and family against one another for his own nefarious purposes.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's his MO," Gibson said. "If you think about the way he shows up in the base game, making you second guess your allies, making you second guess Lilith. What kind of influence does he have on Neyrelle right now? What is he making her second guess?"</p><p dir="ltr">Though he is still trapped in the Soulstone, his wolf projection seen in the base game returns, once again serving as Mephisto's voice and a way for him to "spread his message." His corruption seeps from the Soulstone into the world around it, with Gibson describing the Soulstone itself as being almost radioactive in nature.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a pretty big deal that Mephisto is back on Sanctuary," Gibson said. "Any time that happens, they get banished back to the abyss and have to kick and scream all the way back. Even though he's stuck in the Soulstone, the danger here is if he gets out, he's physically back on Sanctuary, and so it's important Neyrelle finds a solution to not let that happen."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376959-diablo2mephisto.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376959" data-ratio="0.56254272043746" data-width="1463" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376959-diablo2mephisto.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376959"></a><figcaption>Mephisto was defeated in Diablo 2 but is finally back on Sanctuary (albeit still inside Neyrelle's Soulstone).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376959-diablo2mephisto.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Mephisto is trying to do everything in his power to break free, though his options are limited and so he must be careful, Rivera-Colon said. Thankfully for Mephisto, the expansion returns him to one of his old seats of power, the jungles of Nahantu where he previously corrupted the Zakarum church and battled players in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-798">Diablo 2</a>. Gibson said that Vessel of Hatred is "revisiting history" in that way, but it's clear that Vessel of Hatred is also expanding on the region and its lore, adding new wrinkles to the story of Akarat, the Zakarum, the Light, and the Spirit Realm.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Zakarum faith didn't get everything right," Rivera-Colon said. "They didn't know Akarat. So it's an opportunity to explore Akarat and Akarat's faith not just through the Zakarum faith but through the land and the impact he had on the land throughout Nehantu."</p><p dir="ltr">There's no doubt the focus of Vessel of Hatred is on Mephisto and Neyrelle. However, one of Diablo 4's main characters, the last Horadrim, Lorath, is notably absent. Gibson said that was by design, as they only had so much room for the stories they could tell in the expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">"Where Lorath is is a mystery," Gibson said. "That will unpack over time, but if you think about the state of the world after the base game, he had some work to do."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard is still leaving plenty of details for players to discover come launch day, though a recent trailer may have already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-trailer-may-have-spoiled-its-final-boss/1100-6526669/">spoiled one of the expansion's boss fights</a>. Thankfully, players won't have to wait long to find out what happens next. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-launch-and-preload-times-revealed/1100-6526800/">Preloading for Vessel of Hatred is available now</a> for PC players using Battle.net, while console players can preload the expansion October 5 ahead of its October 8 release.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-optimization/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-dev-is-working-hard-on-optimization-online-lobbies-will-show-other-players-in-base-camp.998688/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-optimization/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds development team is hard at work on optimizing the game and making sure that the experience will be as good as possible.</p>
<p>In a new interview with Italian outlet <a href="https://multiplayer.it/articoli/monster-hunter-wilds-intervistata-tgs-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiplayer</a>, the game producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, designer Kaname Fujioka, and director Yuya Tokuda talked about optimization, saying that, while they cannot provide more details on the matter as of now, they hard at work on it to make sure the whole experience will be optimized in the best possible way. Seeing as there have been considerable improvements in terms of performance in the Tokyo Game Show 2024 build over the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">Gamescom one</a>, there's no doubt the team is already doing great work on this front.</p>
<p>In the new interview, the Monster Hunter Wilds development team also commented on cross-play and cross-save functionality, confirming that cross-play can be disabled at any time, even when searching for available quests, so hunters will have plenty of freedom in matchmaking to tailor the experience. Cross-save, on the other hand, is very difficult to implement in a game like this, but the team feels the issue is alleviated somewhat by the simultaneous release on PC and consoles, giving players the ability to pick their preferred platform and still be able to play with everyone else.</p>
<p>Speaking about online play, the Monster Hunter Wilds team also confirmed that some of the trademark social elements of the series will be back, and better than ever before, in the new entry in the series. When connected to an online lobby, for example, every player inside the lobby will appear in the base camp, so the new open-world setting isn't going to impact this aspect of the series negatively. Additionally, it will be possible to start a quest in different weather conditions thanks to a sort of weather forecast system that will let players choose a weather condition and let the hunter rest until the chosen time.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will also see a major change regarding balancing that will likely lead to more build variety. Offensive skills have been moved to weapons, thus giving players way more freedom with armor pieces. Additionally, the decorations system was changed to allow for a more flexible customization system.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 29th, 2025.</p>

<p>Deletion has been suspended effective from today at 1:08am Pacific time (that's around 4am Eastern), and the suspension counts for every world in the Aether, Crystal, Dynamis, and Primal data centers.</p>

<p>Square Enix says that it will "monitor the situation in the coming days" and announce when auto-demolition will begin again once a decision has been made. We don't know when that will be just yet, though.</p>
<p>When it does happen, the auto-demolition timer will continue from where it left off when it was paused, so you'll have exactly as much time to deletion as you did before the pause happened.</p>
<p>The studio closes by saying it hopes that "recovery is swift" for those affected by Hurricane Helene, and that those affected "will be able to rejoin us in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>soon".</p>

<p>Back in the mid-to-late 2000s, Blizzard started work on a project known as Titan. The game was set to be another MMORPG from the company behind World of Warcraft (WoW), but take place in a completely new and original setting. </p>



<p>There have been a few stories about the game‚Äôs development, the problems behind the scenes, and it‚Äôs ultimate cancellation. But many of it had been hearsay </p>



<p>Now, thanks to Jason Schreier‚Äôs new book <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jason-schreier/play-nice/9781538725443/?lens=grand-central-publishing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment</a>, we have more of the story as to what happened with the project. Ahead of the book‚Äôs October 8th release, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/excerpt/458330/why-blizzard-mmo-titan-was-cancelled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon posted details from a section</a> of the book that dives head first into Titan and its development problems.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blizzard-survival-game-cancelled-engine/">Blizzard‚Äôs Survival Game Was Cancelled Because of Engine Issues</a></h6>



<p>According to the book, Blizzard didn‚Äôt want to wait for another game to come and be a ‚ÄúWoW killer‚Äù. Instead, the intended to create another MMO to do it themselves but keep players within the same ecosystem. There had been talks of doing something like a World of StarCraft game, but the internal belief was that StarCraft could fit into an MMORPG setting. </p>



<p>The decision was to then try something new.</p>



<h2 id="h-titan-team-started-small-at-blizzard">Titan Team Started Small At Blizzard</h2>



<p>Led by Blizzard vice president Rob Pardo, the team working on Titan started as a ‚Äúsmall team of top developers‚Äù with an eventual goal to bring in the best developers, artists, and others over to the project. After a couple of years in development, it was being viewed as an ‚Äúall-star team‚Äù being built.</p>



<p>The game was set on an alternate version of Earth in 2070 and was said to be ‚Äútwo games in one.‚Äù</p>



<p>‚Äú[P]layers [take] control of superhero-like characters who lived normal lives during the day and secretly battled against evil forces at night,‚Äù the Polygon story reads from the book. ‚ÄúAn early presentation showed the player, as a professional chef, popping a dish into the oven before going off on a secret mission. When they returned, the dish was perfectly cooked and ready to serve.‚Äù</p>



<h2 id="h-playtests-had-concerns">Playtests Had Concerns</h2>



<p>As the game started playtesting, the game was ‚Äúfun in isolation‚Äù but finding the core gameplay loop was something that just never found footing. The game‚Äôs combat had superhero classes with unique abilities but the continued engagement of players was a struggle to for the Titan team. There were also issues with the technology built specifically for Titan causing issues with the game‚Äôs development causing lag when use or problems that caused development to pause altogether.</p>



<p>It also didn‚Äôt help that Riot Games was hiring developers from the project over to work on League of Legends, which was in development at the time and released in 2009.</p>



<h6>READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-starcraft-shooter-in-development-at-blizzard/">New StarCraft Shooter In Development At Blizzard</a></h6>



<p>Regarding the design of the game, it was said that things would regularly change or be moved in entirely different directions. There were also issues with a bloated art repository with artists working on something without realizing or being informed that it had already been completed in the past. </p>



<h2 id="h-finger-pointing-from-titan-developers-to-blizzard-leadership">Finger Pointing From Titan Developers To Blizzard Leadership</h2>



<p>As the struggles during development continued, developers on Titan ultimately pointed the blame at Pardo. They stated that he was viewed as an ‚Äúabsentee game director‚Äù due to him also overseeing StarCraft 2 and Diablo 3 at the time. It left him little time to lead the brand new IP.</p>



<p>Pardo, according to developers, would come in and out during the project‚Äôs development. When he would show up and get involved, it would often lead to months of work being thrown out after he wasn‚Äôt around for long periods of time.. The development team became demoralized as Pardo would shoot down ideas for the game without offering reasons or guidance of where the team should go next.</p>



<p>In 2013, it was then announced internally that the game was going to be rebooted before it was cancelled in 2014. </p>



<h2 id="h-a-costly-endeavour-for-blizzard">A Costly Endeavour For Blizzard</h2>



<p>After the cancellation of Titan by Blizzard, Pardo appeared to blame others for the game‚Äôs failing rather than taking accountability, according to the book. His actions throughout the development and beyond led to a loss of trust from other management at Blizzard. This had a number of executives and directors demanding Pardo‚Äôs removal from a position of leadership. Pardo took a sabbatical from the company after Titan was ended. He never returned as Pardo resigned from Blizzard at the behest of then-CEO Mike Morhaime.</p>



<p>Overall, development of the cancelled Titan project cost Blizzard roughly $80 million. However, rather than lose everything that was done, the company was able to repurpose various elements of the game into what would become Overwatch.</p>

While there's still a lot to be revealed about the game, the creative team behind Ghost Of Yotei wants players to know that this spiritual sequel won't be as repetitive as the original title. </p><p>"One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again," creative director Jason Connell told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sequel-playstation.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>. "We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences."</p><p>Part of those unique experiences will involve the player exercising more control over the choices made by the game's heroine, Atsu. Although the story is set centuries after Ghost of Tsushima, Atsu has assumed the Ghost persona as her own. Players will also get to decide how Atsu fights her battles, with the option of using traditional melee weapons or switching to firearms. </p><p>Nate Fox, the game's other creative director, shared his desire to introduce a greater sense of danger to Ghost of Yotei that was inspired from Sucker Punch's location scouting at Shiretoko National Park.</p><p>"Inside the park, you have to watch a video telling you about the dangers of bears," recalled Fox. "Being in this incredibly beautiful park with jagged cliffs and water, yet all the time being aware there were dangerous bears, was electrifying... We strive to bring that into the video game--that feeling of danger."</p><p>Ghost of Yotei doesn't have a release date, but it will arrive on PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>

            <p>I wasn't very well yesterday, and to make myself feel better I took to the internet to see what joys I could find tucked away in some corner or another. What I ended up finding was rather unexpected, but all the same very welcome.</p>
<p>You see, I came across a trailer for The Rocky Horror Video Game, an upcoming release from Bit Bot Media and Metal X Entertainment. And I think it looks kind of great, thanks to retro graphics and 8-bit chiptune renditions of The Rocky Horror Show's soundtrack to boot.</p>
<p>The game is described as a "bonkers classic platformer", which will allow players to relive the "strange journey of Brad and Janet like never before". You can check out the announcement trailer for The Rocky Horror Video Game below.</p>

<p>While the blurb has The Rocky Horror Video Game release date simply listed as "coming soon", according to the trailer itself it is set to arrive this month. So, something for Halloween.</p>
<p>The Rocky Horror Video Game is set to release across PC via Steam (although it doesn't appear to have a Steam page as yet), Playstation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>So, do you think the first thing players will be asked to do when booting up the game is "Jump to the left"? I certainly hope so!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260296/microsoft-xbox-research-developers-outreach<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft wants to hear from game developers who might be skipping Xbox or those already building games using the company‚Äôs developer tools. The software maker is expanding its Xbox Research team to include the community of game developers, seeking feedback directly from developers about tools, support, and the overall pain points of the Xbox platform.</p><p>A new program, much like Microsoft‚Äôs Xbox Insider one, <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/resources/xbox-research/">is now open</a> to all members of game studios, not just technical employees. ‚ÄúTypically, it takes a lot of people to make and ship a game, including marketing, user research, artists, audio, PMs, community managers, and more,‚Äù <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/09/how-xbox-research-is-shaping-the-future-of-game-development/">says Deborah Hendersen, PhD</a>, principal user researcher for Xbox. ‚ÄúWe want to hear from everyone who works on games or helps support game studios because if we can make your life easier, it makes gaming better.‚Äù</p><p>While the program will gather feedback about tools, performance tuning, debugging utilities, and plenty of other aspects of game development, it‚Äôs also designed for input from game studios that aren‚Äôt shipping games on Xbox. ‚ÄúIf you aren‚Äôt on Xbox, we‚Äôd love to know why,‚Äù says Hendersen. ‚ÄúAnd honestly, if you are using our competitor‚Äôs products, you probably have a great perspective we could learn from!‚Äù</p><p>Microsoft‚Äôs outreach for direct game developer feedback comes amid some noticeable delays for third-party releases on Xbox. <em>Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3</em> launched on Xbox <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23993155/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-release-game-of-the-year">several months after</a> it first debuted on PS5, because of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/24/23844418/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-release-series-x-s-cross-save-split-screen">technical issues</a> developing for the Xbox Series S. Capcom revealed last month that its two new fighting game collections ‚Äî&nbsp;<em>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em>&nbsp;‚Äî <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234863/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-xbox-release-2025">will come to Xbox in 2025</a> after ‚Äútechnical discussions‚Äù with Microsoft.</p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is also coming to Xbox after its PS5 release, as its developers ‚Äúare currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards.‚Äù Microsoft says ‚Äúthe delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us,‚Äù and single-sourced <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/29/black-myth-wukong-isnt-on-xbox-yet-due-to-an-exclusivity-deal/">reports</a> suggest there could be some kind of Sony exclusivity deal involved.</p><p>The developers of&nbsp;<em>Enotria: The Last Song </em>also publicly <a href="https://enotriathelastsong.com/news/enotria-the-last-song-official-announcement">announced an ‚Äúindefinite delay‚Äù</a> to the Xbox version of the game last month, after struggling with Microsoft‚Äôs game review process. The studio‚Äôs statement about the issues <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1831359412897976811">caught the attention</a> of Xbox chief Phil Spencer, who reached out to the team to help resolve the situation.</p><p>Microsoft would obviously prefer to receive this type of feedback from game developers privately, to avoid potential headlines about game developers skipping the platform due to technical issues, tooling, or even processes. Hopefully, this expansion of Xbox Research will help address the pain points that prevent some game developers from releasing Xbox games.</p><div>

In the attic, Riley is surprised to find a stack of VHS tapes next to an old TV set. The tapes seem to be episodes of an early 2000s-era children‚Äôs cartoon they have never seen before. Intrigued, Riley pops the first tape into the VCR.</p><p>Relatively simplistic in appearance, it appears to have been made locally and features a little girl named Amanda and her loyal yet shy best friend, Wooly the Sheep. While the episode appears charming and straightforward on the surface, an uneasiness starts to settle in as Riley realizes that Amanda and Wooly seem to be communicating directly through the television set. A gnawing feeling in the back of their mind presses them to stop, but Riley is compelled to continue watching the tapes. It‚Äôs almost as if Amanda needs something, and Riley becomes fascinated with finding out what that something may be.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-review-15-hours/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake will require over 15 hours to complete, according to one of the game's very first reviews.</p>
<p>Japanese magazine Famitsu reviewed the highly anticipated remake launching next week on PC and PlayStation 5 in this week's issue, awarding it a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1fuez5j/famitsu_review_score_silent_hill_2_ps5_8999_3540/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35/40 score</a> (8/9/9/9), which is a little higher than the score the magazine awarded the original game (32/40). The review praised the sense of realism brought by the beautiful visuals, the game's unique atmosphere, revamped puzzles that feel more mentally taxing, and combat. The review also confirmed that it will take between 16 and 18 hours to complete the game for the first time, which is almost double the length of the original, so it will be very interesting to see how Bloober Team expanded the original.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the Silent Hill 2 remake is about to release on PC and PlayStation 5, but a release on other platforms is not to be ruled out. <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-wont-be-available-on-other-consoles-until-10-08-2025/">Last month</a>, it was confirmed that the game developed by Bloober Team will remain a PS5 exclusive until October 8th, 2025, so there's a good chance it will eventually launch on Xbox consoles and possibly the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 Remake launches on October 8th on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can check out footage from the PC version of the game by going <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-gets-hours-of-pc-gameplay-from-review-build/">here.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-delayed-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-developers-the-alters-delayed-to-2025.998595/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-delayed-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios' upcoming "emotional sci-fi" game&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>has officially been delayed to next year, with the studio citing a need to "optimize all mission-critical systems and ensure that every aspect of your journey is as seamless as possible".</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601570/view/4697907940245503472" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement post on Steam</a>&nbsp;(which is, rather amusingly, written as though it's a message from the in-game company Ally Corp Communications), 11 bit pledges to "polish each phase of the project" with the additional development time.</p>
<p>The studio says that the initial demo phase of "Project Dolly" (referring to&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>) has "already exceeded expectations", but that "good is never enough" for Ally Corp, and so the delay has been put into effect in order to deliver "results that surpass our prior projections".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-delayed-chasm.jpg?itok=YKWTFVfG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-delayed-chasm.jpg?itok=8ZZml9gI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until next year.</figcaption></figure><p>While 11 bit doesn't go into any further detail regarding the delay to&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>, we can, perhaps, find a little more context in a message <a href="https://x.com/gdansk_marcin/status/1841175005083934726" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released to the studio's investors</a> recently.</p>
<p>In the message (for which we're using machine translation), 11 bit says it wants to give&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>a little room to breathe, and that the negative reception from some&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>fans blindsided the studio, so it wants to make sure that doesn't happen again for&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's worth noting that 11 bit's stock <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/shares-video-game-maker-11-bit-studios-slump-after-frostpunk-2-release-2024-09-23/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">plummeted recently</a>, with analysts suggesting that&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s Steam numbers had come in under expectations.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, 11 bit itself appears to disagree with this assessment; the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k">announced recently</a> that&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>has already sold 350,000 copies and has already made back its development and marketing costs.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>, it's a sci-fi adventure game that contains elements of survival, base-building, and "confronting your own multiverse life choices", per 11 bit.</p>
<p>The game casts you as worker Jan Dolski, who becomes trapped on a distant planet and who must confront alternate versions of himself (the "alters" of the title), each of whom "has a different personality and background".</p>
<p><em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>is due to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601570/The_Alters/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/the-alters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-alters/9n0p25wjhm8c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> next year.

Following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/29/24208868/amd-announces-fluid-motion-frames-2-less-lag-less-jitter-when-its-faking-more-frames-for-you">its technical preview</a> in July, <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/boost-gaming-performance-by-2-5x-with-amd-software-adrenalin/ba-p/711458">Fluid Motion Frames 2 (AFMF 2) is now widely available</a> after being released on Tuesday alongside its supporting Adrenalin 24.9.1 GPU driver.</p><p>AFMF is a frame generation technology similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841148/nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction-ray-tracing-quality">Nvidia‚Äôs DLSS Frame Generation</a> but operates on the driver level instead of game-specific integration. The second-gen AFMF update can be enabled in OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX 11, or DirectX 12 games ‚Äî meaning FPS can now be improved in titles that don‚Äôt support FSR and DLSS ‚Äî and currently works on AMD Radeon RX 6000, RX 7000, 700M, and 800M GPUs.</p><div><figcaption><em>According to AMD‚Äôs tests, AFMF 2 (alongside other optimizations) can provide an impressive frame rate boost compared to raw game performance.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: AMD</cite></p></div><p>AFMF 2 can increase FPS by up to 250 percent ‚Äúon average,‚Äù according to AMD, but that was tested in combination with the company‚Äôs FSR 2 tech and Hypr-RX optimization suite. Actual performance will vary by GPU, game, and resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjAhju5VGX4?feature=shared&amp;t=3824"><em>Digital Foundry</em> reports</a> FPS was boosted ‚Äútypically in the 2x range‚Äù when it tested the AFMF 2 beta in <em>Control</em>, <em>CyberPunk 2077</em>, and <em>Senua‚Äôs Saga: Hellblade II</em> at 4K using a Radeon RX 7900 GRE GPU.</p><p>The AFMF update notably includes fast motion optimization, which should address issues from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/24/24048904/amd-fluid-motion-frames-frame-geneation-directx-11-12-feature-support">the first generation of AFMF</a> that disabled frame generation in games displaying fast movements. AMD has also added two AI-optimized adjustable modes for AFMF 2 that allow users to control how the feature impacts game performance. Search Mode adjusts the FPS smoothness and image quality in games during fast-motion scenes, while Performance Mode can boost AFMF efficiency on low-power devices.</p><p>AFMF 2 supports borderless full-screen game modes on RX 7000 GPUs and AMD‚Äôs Radeon Chill low-latency FPS cap to limit the lag that FPS boosters can inflict. Outside of gaming, it also provides a new ‚Äúgeometric downscaling‚Äù feature that can reduce aliasing and other visual artifacts when videos are played in a window smaller than their native resolution. This is supported in DirectX 11 apps running on Radeon RX 7000 and integrated Radeon 800M GPUs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But for all of the new game‚Äôs openness and emphasis on playing how you want, its most brilliant innovation feels like an inspired reworking of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20871958/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch-updates-graphics">2019 <em>Link‚Äôs Awakening </em>remake‚Äôs</a> clunkiest feature.</p><p>Though the recent <em>Link‚Äôs Awakening </em>was a (largely) faithful remake of its Game Boy-era predecessor, the Grezzo-produced title switched things up with a toyetic 3D design, improved controls, and a new dungeon creation mode clearly inspired by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/2/9240795/super-mario-maker-review-nintendo-wii-u"><em>Super Mario Maker</em></a>. After fighting your way through the game‚Äôs traditional dungeons, you could build your own in a creepy little shack using chamber tiles modeled after various rooms you had already explored.&nbsp;</p><p>There was never really an element of surprise to these Chamber Dungeons because you were in charge of choosing what went inside them while following a number of rules about how chamber tiles could be arranged. And while your original dungeons could be used as a reliable way to rack up easy rupees, the game‚Äôs lack of an online component made it impossible to share your creations, which was a significant part of <em>Super Mario Maker</em>‚Äôs appeal.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Also key to the <em>Super Mario Maker</em>‚Äôs success was the simple fact that user-created courses could be a lot of <em>fun </em>to play through, and the title as a whole was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/2/9239911/super-mario-maker-wii-u-game-design">a very clever exercise in teaching basic video game design</a>. Chamber Dungeons were a good idea, but in practice, <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-link-s-awakenings-chamber-dungeons-are-a-big-dis-1838038985#:~:text=This%20feels%20like%20a%20rudimentary,of%20the%20Game%20Boy%20classic.">their repetitiveness and inflexibility</a> didn‚Äôt give <em>Link‚Äôs Awakening </em>all that much replay value.</p></div><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption>Damp√©, who helps you create custom dungeons in the Link‚Äôs Awakening remake, returns in Echoes of Wisdom.</figcaption> <p><cite>Nintendo</cite></p></div></div><p>While a more refined iteration of Chamber Dungeons could still make for a novel gaming experience, the mechanic ‚Äî much like Link himself ‚Äî is largely absent as we knew it in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, the franchise‚Äôs first mainline entry to turn Zelda into the playable protagonist. But rather than completely scrap the core concepts that initially made Chamber Dungeons an intriguing proposition, <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>taps into them from a different and more imaginative angle.</p><p>As <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>‚Äôs hero, Zelda and her companion Tri journey out into Hyrule equipped with the Tri Rod ‚Äî a new magical key item that works a bit like <em>A Link to the Past</em>‚Äôs Cane of Somaria. But unlike the Cane, which gave Link the power to create single square blocks to climb on or push, the Tri Rod grants Zelda the ability to conjure multiple copies (referred to as ‚Äúechoes‚Äù) of various objects and monsters she encounters on her adventure.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the game gives you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24231404/echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-sword">a handful of other useful items</a>, the Tri Rod‚Äôs echoes are Zelda‚Äôs most powerful weapons to use in battle as she searches for a way to close the interdimensional rifts popping up all over Hyrule.&nbsp;</p><p>Some echoes ‚Äî like the Boomerang Boarblin and Bombfish ‚Äî basically give you a quick way of whipping up the classic <em>Zelda </em>weapon their names reference. But far more of them are just glowing replicas of the hostile creatures like ReDeads and Darknuts that you commonly find in <em>Zelda </em>overworlds and dungeons.</p><p>When Nintendo first revealed <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, echoes ‚Äî which disappear after receiving a certain amount of damage ‚Äî seemed like a riff on <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>‚Äôs approaches to providing players with weapons. But in <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-1%2F">a recent interview about <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>‚Äôs development process</a>, director Tomomi Sano and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23721063/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-interview-aonuma-fujibayashi">series producer Eiji Aonuma</a> explained that the idea for a <em>Zelda</em> title built around the concept of copying / pasting objects actually began as part of a plan for a game focused on Link creating custom dungeons.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</p><div><figcaption>An early test build of a Zelda game focused on dungeon building.</figcaption> <p><cite>Nintendo</cite></p></div></div><p>As Aonuma played through an early demo, he started thinking that ‚Äúwhile it‚Äôs fun to create your own dungeon and let other people play it, it‚Äôs also not so bad to place items that can be copied and pasted in the game field, and create gameplay where they can be used to fight enemies.‚Äù And while the team was already about a year into building an ‚Äúedit dungeon‚Äù-style game, Anonuma felt that the copy / paste mechanic ‚Äúhad significant potential to be developed into a new way of playing the <em>Legend of Zelda</em> games if the gameplay was changed to use ‚Äòechoes‚Äô instead.‚Äù</p><p>Coming after <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom, </em>which some fans knocked for their relative lack of traditional <em>Zelda </em>dungeons, <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>feels like a return to the basics in some ways. Individual, themed dungeons filled with small keys and minibosses abound and call on you to solve puzzles to unlock their hidden secrets. Though Zelda can move things around using bind, there‚Äôs only so much she can change about the way the new game‚Äôs literal dungeons are designed. But the brilliant trick baked into <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>is how it turns the whole of Hyrule into a new kind of dungeon, conceptually, and makes you its intrepid master.</p><p>When I first started playing <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, the focus on learning echoes of ordinary inanimate objects to help Zelda made the game feel like a standard top-down dungeon crawler that was trying to make me think more about how to move through space vertically. Table echoes could be used to give the short princess a boost, and stacks of heart-restoring beds could be fashioned into makeshift staircases. Those kinds of echoes all gave me different ways of navigating Zelda out of a jail cell, which felt like a crash course in the game‚Äôs stealth missions. But once I was out in the open world and learned my first monster echoes, it was surprising to see that I had to be familiar with a creature‚Äôs behavioral patterns to wield it effectively in combat.</p><p><em>Zelda </em>dungeons aren‚Äôt just elaborate buildings filled with puzzles and locked doors; they‚Äôre places where monsters live, and those monsters‚Äô actions play a significant role in shaping a dungeon‚Äôs identity. The same goes for environmental hazards like fire, water, and ice, which can all help or harm you depending on how you interact with them. <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>doesn‚Äôt allow you to create your own bespoke dungeons per se, but it does give Zelda many of a dungeon‚Äôs fundamental building blocks to play with. And the deeper you get into the game‚Äôs literal dungeons, the more it pushes you to fight by sending monsters into battle ‚Äî almost as if Zelda herself was thinking the way a dungeon designer would.</p><p>There‚Äôs a narrative poetry to the way Zelda‚Äôs first mainline outing in her own ongoing legend is one in which her power is reshaping the world and using its rules to her advantage. It‚Äôs a framing that presents her as both a princess and a kind of dungeon master ‚Äî and shows how, 40 years in, Nintendo is still finding fantastic ways to make <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>‚Äôs old ideas feel new.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>One blemish on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/throne-and-liberty">Throne and Liberty</a>‚Äôs barnstorming release ‚Äì one day in and it‚Äôs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazons-new-free-to-play-mmorpg-throne-and-liberty-is-coming-for-the-banana-games-crown">so far up the Steam charts</a> it‚Äôs only visible by telescope ‚Äì has been some unexpected Steam Deck trouble. Despite the fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMORPG</a> having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDeckGaming/status/1841107699036979648">trickling in</a> of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-conundrum-partially-solved-with-easy-anti-cheat-support">Easy Anti-Cheat</a>, Throne and Liberty‚Äôs hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again ‚Äì I‚Äôve got Throne and Liberty running on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.</p>

<p>As for what <em>actually</em> happened with Easy Anti-Cheat, it sounds like either developers NCSoft or publishers Amazon Games simply neglected to enable Easy Anti-Cheat support for the Linux-powered SteamOS in the final release build. Judging by <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/proton">Valve‚Äôs documentation</a>, this isn‚Äôt a complicated process ‚Äì perhaps hence why it was overlooked ‚Äì but it does require a dash of manual input. Without this, the game assumes that EAC is missing, and blocks off online play completely rather than potentially let any do-badders in while its guard is down.</p><p>No-one seems to have been outright banned as a result of attempting to play on a Steam Deck, so this could be considered a happy ending. Definitely more so than other recent cases we‚Äôve seen where anti-cheat has proven a stumbling block to portable compatibility: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuthering-waves-was-unleashed-on-the-steam-deck-but-only-for-one-day">Wuthering Waves</a> was only briefly playable on the Deck before an update blocked it off again, and despite how the BattlEye anti-cheat software can easily be made compatible with SteamOS, its addition to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> last month involved Rockstar just... <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-online-is-no-longer-supported-by-steam-deck-thanks-to-a-slightly-baffling-rockstar-anti-cheat-update">choosing not to</a>? I guess? And the less said about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-wont-get-steam-deck-support-epic-ceo-blames-cheaters">Fortnite</a>, the better.</p>
<p>Throne and Liberty, at least, is now having an easier time of it. I‚Äôm prodigiously bad at guessing how games will fare in Valve‚Äôs Steam Deck Verified ranking system, but if I were to simply ignore that and speculate anyway, I‚Äôd go for 'Playable': some of the UI text is absolutely microscopic on the 7in screen, but it controls fine, and typically runs above 30fps on Low settings. I‚Äôd swap FSR upscaling from Balanced to Quality mode, though, just to make character models look less like they‚Äôre disintegrating into sand when they move.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In 2019, head of publishing Andrey Tsvetkov&nbsp;joined the company to build up a self-publishing arm, and after 5 years and the acquisition of publisher Meta Publishing, the company's ready share its success with other developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Launching a new game publisher in 2024 is a bold choice. The last year hasn't just seen thousands of developer layoffs, it's seen a number of games dramatically undersell and put publishers and developers out of business. In an interview with Game Developer, Tsvetkov seemed keenly aware of that fact, telling us that the company is working hard to prepare its signed games for success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The main goal, he said, is to help signed developers "walk the path we have already walked." "We know the challenges that await them in this process, so we want to make sure they are avoiding them. After creating three games in a row, we actually know what kinds of pipelines, what kinds of budgets, and what kinds of efforts one needs to create these kinds of experiences."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A creative vision and backing from an experience publisher aren't enough to succeed on their own‚Äîwhich is why Tsvetkov believes the number one thing developers pitching him should prepare for is to explain how their game can stand out in a given market.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/owlcat-games-opens-third-party-narrative-game-focused-publishing-label" target="_self">Owlcat Games opens third-party, narrative game-focused publishing label</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Owlcat Games' publishing terms favor developers (but it can only help so many teams)">Owlcat Games' publishing terms favor developers (but it can only help so many teams)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers interested in pitching a narrative title to Owlcat Games can expect what Tsvetkov described as favorable terms if they make it all the way to the end. The company isn't interested in taking ownership over intellectual property, and it favors revenue splits that give developers a greater chunk of the change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He couldn't give specifics on signed contracts, but said revenue splits at Owlcat might start at "around 20-25 percent" (for the publisher), then change for "later stages of the product lifecycle."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Owlcat apparently isn't just looking for interesting-looking games, but also a sense that there's a core team behind them who can maintain focus on their pitched product even while scaling up the team. If a game doesn't make the cut, Tsvetkov said he's happy to give feedback so developers can pitch themselves better elsewhere.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The label's first two published games are both striking. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126190/Rue_Valley/">Rue Valley</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a narrative RPG in the vein of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that uses RPG-like systems to explore a character's inner psyche, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1173980/Shadow_of_the_Road/">Shadow of the Road</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is an isometric RPG akin to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> set in an alternate history Japan. But what, it's worth asking, made these games stand out from other pitched titles?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The answer, Tsvetkov said, has to do with how well they can compete with similar games‚Äîeven ones a decade old. "Right now you're competing with games that are seven, eight, ten years old and are in good shape," he said. "They still look great and you can buy them for $5 on sale."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In isolation that can be a depressing fact, but Tsvetkov seemed to see it as an opportunity. "If you approach with a pitch, we evaluate on our side [and ask] 'what is the market share for this game?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here "market share" refers to the genre a game operates in. Some games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vampire Survivors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might birth a whole new "genre" that captures player interest, other polished titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might knock down the competition that previously dominated the field. Both options are on the table, but the size of the market will impact what kinds of budgets Owlcat is comfortable with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rue Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for instance, gets to build on the success and mechanics of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game that has sparked a few imitators, but it's still early enough that not many game studios have launched big-budget follow-ups. (Unfortunately for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer ZA/UM, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-za-um-writers-allege-studio-has-become-a-cold-careless-company-">its struggles</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> may mean it's not putting one out anytime soon either...)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadow of the Road</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> competes in the same market as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (and even Owlcat Games' own turn-based RPGs), but it has a unique setting and gameplay hook for players looking for a fresh take on the genre. Owlcat was willing to bet on both games' success.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Think carefully about what makes your game special">Think carefully about what makes your game special</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For developers inspired by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s success, he advised them to be cautious just jumping into the genre because it's relatively unexplored. "It's not about the mindset of 'oh I've seen the success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I need to know how to recreate that,'" he said. "It's about 'I have a story I want to tell that's really deep inside me,' and then you can do it with [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">]'s gameplay."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A key lesson developers might want to take from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s success isn't the subject matter or specific game mechanics, it's that more players want to engage with RPG systems that center the story more than they enable deep complexity with combat builds and character classes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tsvetkov's advice is familiar in some ways‚Äîdevelopers need strong creative ideas and a good sense of how they'll bring a game to life to land publishing deals or investors. But his invitation to explore the market share a game is breaking into may help developers spot opportunities in new genres‚Äîor see how to thrive in one dominated by beloved classics.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
