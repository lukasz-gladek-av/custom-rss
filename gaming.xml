<p>BitSummit has once again come and gone, and unlike <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/10-switch-games-weve-played-at-bitsummit-2024-heres-what-we-thought">last year</a> where it was a bit difficult to find indie developers committing to a Nintendo Switch release well before the Switch 2 was announced, we found a renewed enthusiasm for Nintendo as we pursued the two floors BitSummit took over in Kyoto’s Miyako Messe convention center.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitsummit.org/en/">BitSummit</a> is a yearly gaming convention dedicated to not only Japanese indie developers but those from around the world. 2025 marked the 13th iteration which grows larger every year; this time around, they even had <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> composer Nobuo Uematsu make an appearance to perform some of his famous, genre-defining music on the second day.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ypgumo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>But you’re here to read about the games of tomorrow, right? While many indie developers commit only to a Steam release well before even thinking about Nintendo's handheld hybrids, we once again did our due diligence to track down 10 games that you will <em>eventually</em> get to play on a Nintendo Switch.</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>

<h2 id="bitsummit-2025-every-switch-1-andamp-2-game-we-played">BitSummit 2025 - Every Switch 1 &amp; 2 Game We Played</h2>
<h3 id="hades-2-2025-switch-1-andamp-2">Hades 2 - 2025 (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</h3>
<figure><a title="Hades 2 Erebus" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bf20c6a46d531/hades-2-erebus.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Supergiant Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay – let’s get the big boy out of the way. At the Nintendo Indie World booth we were intrigued to see three games available to play, the most prominent of them being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii"><strong>Hades 2</strong></a>. We all already know the sequel to one of the best action roguelikes ever made is going to be a great game, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-hades-2-is-a-hell-of-a-time-even-in-early-access">you might have already played it in early access on PC</a>, but you’re likely curious how well it runs on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>While we only got our hands on the handheld mode, we’re happy to report it runs at a crisp 60 frames-per-second at what looked like standard 1080p resolution. More importantly, the ghosting effect of the Switch 2’s LCD screen didn’t seem to have much of an impact on the frenetic action.</p>
<p>Our experience playing through the entire Erebus region right up until just before the boss encounter against Headmistress Hecate was smooth as butter, and we can’t wait to play more of it when Hades 2 comes to the Switch 2 at the same time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/hades-2-full-release-is-getting-close-as-development-enters-final-phase">it leaves early access</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pico-park-2-plus-mouse-stage-out-now-mouse-mode-coming-soon-switch-2">Pico Park 2 + Mouse Stage - Out Now / Mouse Mode coming soon (Switch 2)</h3>
<figure><a title="Pico Park 2 Mouse Level" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/90b4a906bd5f3/pico-park-2-mouse-level.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: TECOPARK</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another game at the Indie World booth was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pico_park_2"><strong>Pico Park 2</strong></a>, the sequel to the 2019 cooperative puzzle-action game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pico_park"><strong>Pico Park</strong></a>, and while it’s out already, we got to play four unreleased levels exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 that utilized the Joy-Con 2’s mouse mode. We’re not being hyperbolic when we say it was the most delightfully chaotic fun we had at BitSummit and perhaps the best use of the mouse mode we’ve seen yet.</p>
<p>You see, of the three other teammates we had to solve these puzzles with, two of them only spoke Japanese. We had to press down on the R Bumper and move the Joy-Con in order to aim our different colored Pico’s distance and trajectory. Once we released the R Bumper, our Picos would go flying across the stage; as this was our only method of movement, hilarity ensued as we timed pressing switches and flying into obstacles that matched our individual Picos’ color without knocking each other into pits.</p>
<p>Language barriers aside, we managed to clear three of the four difficult stages, and came away thoroughly interested in trying out more exclusive Pico Park 2 levels with the mouse controls.</p>
<h3 id="obakeidoro-2-summer-2025-switch-2">Obakeidoro 2 - Summer 2025 (Switch 2)</h3>
<figure><a title="Obakeidoro 2 Capture" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/46565d8dd5ba2/obakeidoro-2-capture.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Freestyle Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Obakeidoro 2</strong> was also at the Nintendo Indie World booth, we sat down with the developers and seven other players to get the full experience of this asymmetrical party game where you take control of either monster ghost girls or the chibi humans they’re trying to capture.</p>
<p>Each match lasts only three minutes as the six chibi humans dash about a haunted mansion, stunning the monsters with their lanterns and avoiding pitfalls and other obstacles as they try not to get captured. The two chibi monsters – ours was riding a little toilet – can phase through walls, grabbing humans and throwing them into a little jail in the middle of the map.</p>
<p>The uncaptured humans, however, can hit several locks hidden throughout the map to free their friends. We played as the monsters first and despite our best efforts, the humans freed their friends several times, though we managed to eke out a heart-pounding victory in the dying seconds.</p>
<p>We then played as the humans and got captured several times; however, by utilizing team up moves one of our allies was able to throw our chibi schoolgirl across a gap in order to reach a final lock to free our friends, giving an easy win and a taste at some hidden depth to this anime-inspired party game.</p>
<h3 id="ratatan-tba-switch-1">Ratatan - TBA (Switch 1)</h3>
<figure><a title="Ratatan Stage" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e1c35a7ae08a5/ratatan-stage.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ratata Arts</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, we got our hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ratatan"><strong>Ratatan</strong></a>, the spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay"><strong>Patapon</strong></a>, which was actually announced during BitSummit 2023 and took home this year’s Vermilion Gate Award, which is awarded to the title that delighted with innovation and intuitive design more than any other.</p>
<p>And we don’t disagree with the BitSummit judges one bit for choosing Ratatan. Fans of Patapon will feel right at home with the rhythm-based gameplay of Ratatan, as you control one of several music-loving gremlin creatures called – wouldn’t you know it – Ratatans that, in turn, use music to motivate their little armies of Cobuns to attack and defend with charming beats.</p>
<p>This time around, Patapon and Ratatan creator Hiroyuki Kotani has seamlessly weaved in roguelike elements after each stage that greatly change how you play against opposing armies and massive boss monsters. We chose the guitar-wielding hedgehog Harigittan and played through the tutorial. While it took us a few minutes to get the hang of playing to a beat, before-long we were taking down castles full of adorable little foes while bobbing our head along to the catchy beats.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to seeing more of Ratatan and the roguelike elements as it launches on Steam Early Access on <strong>25th July</strong>, though there’s no sign of a Switch release date yet.</p>

<h3 id="bashful-adoration-2027-consoles-tbc">Bashful Adoration - 2027 (Consoles TBC)</h3>
<figure><a title="Bashful Adoration Payload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9e6d0805b19dc/bashful-adoration-payload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: KittyWumpas</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of party games, we also sat down with KittyWumpas, an up-and-coming studio out of New Zealand, and their witch-themed 3D platformer packed full of multiplayer party modes titled <strong>Bashful Adoration</strong>.</p>
<p>The game stars four witches that are absolutely enamored with a boy named Merlin. They bicker for his affection in cute little scenes played out between 3D platforming stages filled with collectibles and baddies to whack with brooms, hearkening back similar games you might’ve played on a Nintendo 64 or something more modern like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/a_hat_in_time"><strong>A Hat In Time</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It also features more multiplayer party modes that we could keep track of, including one inspired by <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_league">Rocket League</a></strong> and a deathmatch-type mode with <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_smash_bros">Super Smash Bros.</a></strong>-like percentage build up. These percentages were also seen in the one multiplayer mode we did play: a payload tug-of-war where the payload was none other than Merlin himself.</p>
<p>Taking control of your favorite of the four witches, standing near the love-potioned Merlin will have him slowly float toward your base; however, your rival witches can fly on by and whack you away. The higher your percentage, the farther you’ll fly and bounce around the map.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to seeing more of Bashful Adoration leading up to its expected 2027 release.</p>
<h3 id="lovish-2025-consoles-tbc">Lovish - 2025 (Consoles TBC)</h3>
<figure><a title="Lovish Level" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14da1e8af4084/lovish-level.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: LABS Works</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Back in 2021, we reviewed a charming retro-inspired Metroidvania titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/astalon_tears_of_the_earth"><strong>Astalon: Tears of the Earth</strong></a> by developer LABS Works. At BitSummit they showcased another title called <strong>Lovish</strong>, though this time around it’s a 2D action platformer that takes place in bite-sized rooms with over 150 random events that can occur and greatly change each playthrough.</p>
<p>You take control of the cute little Sir Solomon on his quest to save Princess Tsuna from the Devil Lord. He originally started his quest with some companions but worried Princess Tsuna might fancy them instead of him after being rescued; as a result, he ditched them and set off to rescue her on his own.</p>
<p>We played through about a dozen levels and defeated one boss, greatly enjoying the great retro soundtrack and tight platforming while hunting for Secret Crowns hidden in each. After each level, increasingly absurd events occurred: we unlocked a shop to purchase upgrades like a double jump that allowed us to re-explore past levels, but later found a cryptic message that told us to avoid collecting coins in stage 4-2 in order to summon a space wizard.</p>
<p><strong>Lovish</strong> is all the right levels of absurd and perfect for some handheld gaming on the Nintendo Switches.</p>

<h3 id="sacrifire-2026-switch-1-andamp-2">SacriFire - 2026 (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</h3>
<figure><a title="SacriFire Random Battle" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51537464324bb/sacrifire-random-battle.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Pixelated Milk</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Polish developer Pixelated Milk pitched <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sacrifire">SacriFire</a></strong> to us as <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/vagrant_story">Vagrant Story</a></strong> meets <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/superhot"><strong>Superhot</strong></a>, and while that didn’t make any sense to us at first, it did after playing the lengthy demo. We gave them the benefit of the doubt as we reviewed their previous title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/regalia_of_men_and_monarchs_-_royal_edition"><strong>Regalia: Of Men and Monarchs - Royal Edition Review</strong></a> well.</p>
<p>In SacriFire, you take control of a newly appointed Bishop named Ezekiel. On the day he becomes one, some thieves attack their chapel and steal a box that contains within it all evil. Ezekiel and the other Bishops give chase through simple platforming levels packed full of enemies.</p>
<p>When we ran into an enemy, we warped to a battle screen where an action gauge filled to allow us to attack and cast spells; however, the true genius of SacriFire’s combat system comes from how if we stopped moving, our enemies and their attacks – including projectiles – stopped as well, just like in Superhot, giving us time to strategize how to take them down.</p>
<p>We’re very keen to see more of SacriFire and this unique battle system when it comes to the Nintendo Switch 2 sometime in 2026.</p>

<h3 id="neverway-tba-consoles-tbc">Neverway - TBA (Consoles TBC)</h3>
<figure><a title="Neverway Crafting" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b1b1e05d2adf9/neverway-crafting.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Coldblood Inc</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While not officially announced for either Switch console yet, we’re giving <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2318330/Neverway/">Neverway</a></strong> a slight pass because the development team behind it – Coldblood Inc. – assured us that a Switch release is the eventual goal, and we think their darker take on a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley"><strong>Stardew Valley</strong></a>-like farm sim would be absolutely perfect to play on either handheld hybrid.</p>
<p>We sat down with the developer to play through two different demos: a story-focused snippet and a short combat tutorial.</p>
<p>For the former, we took control of Fiona as her life spirals out of control: she loses her job, her boyfriend breaks up with her, and she can hardly get out of bed. As a helpful little status icon indicated to us, she begins to disassociate on the way home from picking up her work belongings; during, a girl on the train says she can make Fiona’s problems fade away before some creepy spidery creature threatens to pull Fiona into an abyss.</p>
<p>Jumping to an island Fiona moves to in order to get away from it all, she heads to her new home and unpack her stuff, passing by the houses of named residents that she will get to date while you presumably help her farm her way out of her depression – or become the immortal herald of a dead god? We’re not quite sure yet. The combat tutorial highlighted a healthy dash of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past"><strong>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</strong></a> inspiration as we looted a hookshot to cross gaps and swung a sword to take out waves of floating skull monsters.</p>
<p>We’re excited to see more Neverway – and to eventually learn of an official Switch release date.</p>
<h3 id="earth-atlantis-2-tba-consoles-tbc"><strong>Earth Atlantis 2 - TBA (Consoles TBC)</strong></h3>
<figure><a title="Earth Atlantis 2 Boss Fight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fbb962df74aa1/earth-atlantis-2-boss-fight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Pixel Perfex</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We had a lot of great things to say about the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earth_atlantis#overview"><strong>Earth Atlantis</strong></a>, a unique, underwater take on a shoot ‘em up with a striking sepia color palette. Developer Pixel Perfex returned to BitSummit to showcase <strong>Earth Atlantis 2</strong>, which plays like a more realized version of the original with a gorgeous submerged world full of color and powerful underwater monsters to take on.</p>
<p>During our time with the demo, we explored what looked like an underwater Egypt in our little yellow submarine, shooting various aquatic monsters to loot power-ups that gave us the extra missiles or bombs you’d see in any number of schmups inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/gradius"><strong>Gradius</strong></a><strong>.</strong> However, Earth Atlantis 2 takes a much more as you can explore at your leisure as you seek out fair-but-difficult bosses.</p>
<p>The boss we took on was an ancient megalodon with a rocky layer of armor that, when we shot it enough, broke off to reveal a weak point. Even then, the developer helped us out by granting us extra health to get us through the difficult encounter that typically would take several tries to overcome. Once defeated, a new part of the map was revealed and we could continue onward.</p>
<p>Pixel Perfex promised more than 20 unique bosses to take on and more gorgeous underwater environments that we’re looking forward to exploring.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:72023 @ 1753110006 -->
<h3 id="earthion-september-2025-switch-1">Earthion - September 2025 (Switch 1)</h3>
<figure><a title="Earthion Boss Fight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f596fc0461a0e/earthion-boss-fight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ancient</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>There was another shoot ‘em up that caught our attention, and it was a much more traditional one. <strong>Earthion</strong>, you see, is not only being developed by Ancient Corp – a studio founded by renowned composer Yuzo Koshiro – it’s being developed on 16 bit hardware so it truly looks and sounds the part.</p>
<p>That said, from the slick way the starship you control flips into battle at the start of each stage, to how the story presents the starship pilot Azusa Takanashi from a lower angle like she’s in a <strong>Gundam</strong> anime, Earthion feels like it takes 16-bit presentation to the next level, which has us interested in seeing more than that of the small sliver of the first level that we played at BitSummit.</p>
<p>As a classic horizontal-moving shmup, fans of the genre will be right at home here; while the demo we played wasn’t <em>too</em> difficult, we saw the potential for white-knuckle bullet-hell in the later stages along with a promised challenge mode that will undoubtedly cause some thrown controllers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we’ll have to wait a bit longer to play <strong>Earthion</strong> on Switch; it comes to PC on 31st July, though it's been pushed back to September for consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 OLED model may have already been prototyped, as the alleged mid-frame of this system is available for purchase on a Chinese marketplace.</p>



<p>As spotted on the Gaming Leaks subreddit, a user on Xianyu, China's largest second hadn marketplace, is selling the <a href="https://www.goofish.com/item?id=949354611120&amp;spm=widle.12011849.copy.detail&amp;ut_sk=1.Z%2FH%2FPLIumhgDABcsA9HPUVaQ_21407387_1753096684884.copy.detail.949354611120.2219551622872">midframes</a> of an<a href="https://www.goofish.com/item?id=949406620126&amp;spm=widle.12011849.copy.detail&amp;ut_sk=1.Z%2FH%2FPLIumhgDABcsA9HPUVaQ_21407387_1753096684884.copy.detail.949406620126.2219551622872"> alleged Nintendo Switch 2 OLED model</a>, which have been <a href="https://www.goofish.com/item?id=949005279175&amp;spm=widle.12011849.copy.detail&amp;ut_sk=1.Z%2FH%2FPLIumhgDABcsA9HPUVaQ_21407387_1753096684884.copy.detail.949005279175.2219551622872">produced in 2024 </a>as a production sample, and are identical to that of the launch model with the exception of lettering on the side and the silver and white color of two of the midframes on sale. While there's nothing that indicates if these are really a production sample for a future Nintendo Switch 2 OLED model, the user has a lot of items on sale that are likely sourced from production factories, such as blank PlayStation 5 PCBs, spare original Switch and Switch 2 parts and more, so there's the chance that these shells are still legit, even if they are not meant for an OLED model. At the very least, they could indicate that more color variants for the new generation Nintendo system are being prototyped and could be coming at a later date.</p>



<p>Although an OLED display would bring some issues, especially for VRR, the Nintendo Switch 2 would greatly benefit from a better display, as the one featured in the launch model leaves much to be desired. Shortly after launch, it became evident that the display's quality is below average, has disappointing HDR support, and is worse than its predecessor's display in terms of motion quality. As Nintendo is likely aware of these issues, seeing a new model with a better display launch only a few years after the original model wouldn't be surprising.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now available worldwide. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

<p>As someone who finds cyberKeanu a bit more grating at times than is socially acceptable, I was pleased. However, over the weekend a modder's released something that might tempt me into bringing him back, if only so V can respond to being told off for crashing by sarkily calling ol'Reevsey mum.</p>

<p>This mod is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/22694?tab=description">Responsive V</a>, and it's the work of MisterChedda. They've dug into V's voicelines, both used and unused, to give you a bunch of extra animated reactions to incidents that often happen when you're freely roaming around Night City. You know, the likes of bumping into a pedestrian, which now might cause V to wheel around, give them the finger and also say the rude word the finger means, just to add insult to injury.</p>
<p>These reactions vary in intensity, and apply to everything from nicking cars, to having MaxTac or Newatch rock up, and your vehicle ending up either exploded or in the sea. I assume that last one makes you go 'Aw shucks, what am I like?', while every nearby NPC says 'Who else but V?'.</p>

<p>By far the most important reaction the mod adds is the ability to quick clap back at Silverhand if he's spawned in your passenger seat, and you happen to drive in a fashion that triggers one of his six or so lines telling you to not drive so badly. All you can do in the base game is suffer in silence if the man dishes out one of these critiques, and while patch 2.3 does now let you employ the nuclear option of banishing him back into your skull for a couple of days, having a quick back-and-forth as the mod allows is a far superior solution.</p>
<p>It's not a full conversation, so you don't have to worry about being further distracted from your wheelwork by Silverhand getting into a rant about the deep philosophy involved in remembering to brake when you take a corner. It's just a nice little jab exchange that'll make Johnny feel a bit more like a proper passenger, rather than a moody Woody doll whose pull string gets yanked when you wreck your Aerondight.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the mod a go and having V respond 'All right, mom' next time they hit a tree, you'll need to make sure you've got the Phantom Liberty DLC, plus these requirements: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7780">Codeware</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511">redscript</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4885">Mod Settings</a>. The latter allows Responsive V to have its own in-game menu where you can tweak what'll solicit one of these extra reactions to your liking.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-23-lets-you-ditch-ridealong-keanu-reeves-but-i-raise-you-responding-to-his-driving-critiques-via-this-mod]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
After reliving some old-school rivalries with last year's Intellivision-themed DLC, Atari 50 is welcoming another classic contemporary through its interactive museum doors. Namco's legendary line-up of retro titles (or a few of them at least) are arriving in new DLC soon.
</p>
<p>
Atari 50's Namco Legendary Pack introduces an all-new interactive timeline focusing on the Japanese publisher's classic output, exploring the history of its games on Atari hardware through video interviews, archival materials, documents, and photos from the era.
</p>
<p>
And you'd better be a Pac-Man fan! Atari 50's Namco Legendary Pack includes three versions of the classic ball-gobbler - Pac-Man 2600, 5200, and Atari 8-bit, specifically - marking "the first ever re-release of these games for consoles."

<p>
On top of that, you've got US arcade versions of Dig Dug and Xevious ("developed by Namco in Japan and originally released by Atari, re-released in this form for the first time ever"), plus home console versions of Galaga, Xevious, Galaxian, and Dig Dug.
</p>
<p>
There's no word of a release date for all this yet, but it's coming to Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch "soon". And if you've yet to sample Atari 50's retro delights, last year saw the release of a standalone Expanded Edition, combining the already hugely generous base game and its Wider World of Atari DLC into a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/herere-all-19-retro-games-coming-in-atari-50s-paid-the-first-console-war-dlc">single bundle featuring 150+ titles</a>.

They're doing it with gusto.</p>
<p>Indeed, players of DK's latest (and greatest?) adventure are already taking to the internet to proudly display entire areas that they've stripped of all destructible assets! And the game's only been out a few days (thanks, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/culture/613994/donkey-kong-bananza-destruction-mechanics-switch-2-opening-level">Polygon</a>!).</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4knwuox&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>First up, and as seen on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1m2l7dt/i_dug_out_the_entirety_of_the_intro_cave/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=action_bar&amp;embed_host_url=https://gonintendo.com/contents/50918-donkey-kong-bananza-players-have-already-completely-cleared-out-the-game-s-opening">u/NintendoSwitch</a>, one player has totally dug out everything in the opening intro cave, which is impressive!</p>

<p>However, we then have <a href="https://x.com/PJiggles_/status/1946730253281284099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1946730253281284099%7Ctwgr%5E99ce2a455c492436c389579c2f56f7d18dc43487%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fdonkey-kong-bananza-player-smashes-entire-layer-flat%2F">another post on social media</a> that one-ups this by clearing out an entire ruddy map. Is anyone else getting a little twitchy at the idea of having to do this?</p>

<p>There's something horrifically moreish about destroying the levels in this game, there's no doubt about it. Even just smashing up stuff because it looks nice is a good time. As an example of this, we punched all of Void Co's faces off a rock sculpture early in the adventure, just because we could - and also because we hate those guys.</p>
<p>The player below, meanwhile, has shared a relaxing video in which they take the opportunity to ruin a very nice in-game store. Everything begins in a perfectly tranquil nature here, before DK finally gives up and does what he does best. Wrecks the place.</p>

<p>Ahhhhh. That's better! Look, if it's good enough for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/random-shigeru-miyamoto-did-exactly-what-we-did-when-playtesting-donkey-kong-bananza">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, then it's good enough for everyone!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Void Interactive has announced that its tactical shooter&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>has managed to reach a pretty major sales milestone in just four days.</p>

<p><em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-summer" rel="nofollow">released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> last week, and according to a press release, the game has already managed to sell a million copies on both platforms, a milestone it reached within the first four days of its launch.</p>

<p>As Void Interactive points out, when combined with the 9 million sales milestone&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">reached on PC earlier this year</a>, this means the game has managed to hit 10 million sales overall, which is a pretty impressive figure for a game that's proven pretty divisive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ready-or-not-console-sales-1m-4-days-neon.jpg?itok=VU4ZXcf3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ready-or-not-console-sales-1m-4-days-neon.jpg?itok=cckl7ckc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>has hit a million sales on console.</figcaption></figure><p>Void CEO Julio&nbsp;Rodriguez says that it took 36 days for <i>Ready or Not&nbsp;</i>to reach a million sales on PC, but that it managed to achieve this milestone in a tenth of the time on console.</p>

<p>Rodriguez also says his studio is "already hard at work ironing out issues and continuously improving the experience", so if you're not entirely satisfied with your&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>experience on console, there's every chance an update will be along soon to fix that.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused tactical shooter in which you must "defuse hostile and confronting situations" as a member of a SWAT team. You might be dealing with hostage situations, for instance, or you might be dispatched to a robbery, and working alongside your team to defuse such situations is key to the game's core.</p>




<p>Recently, the game has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">come under fire</a> from its PC community for what players perceive as censorship being imposed on the PC version in order for the console releases to go ahead, as well as a perceived graphical downgrade for the PC version to achieve parity with console gamers.</p>

<p>Void Interactive has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">clarified</a> that&nbsp;changes were made to&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>in order to comply with "platform standards, age rating boards, and local legal restrictions", and that those changes were only made "where absolutely required, and only to the letter of the regulations".</p>

            <p>Bang bang. A Doom modder who's been busy recreating the city of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/necropolis">Necropolis</a> from the original Fallout as the setting for some irradiated boomer shooting has released a fresh trailer to the public for the first time in years.</p>
<p>Alexander 'Red888guns' Berezin looks to have been quietly beavering away at GZDoom WAD Fallout: Bakersfield since releasing its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMjJM9HAqqk">last teaser in 2022</a>, having posted fairly regular update blogs for supporters on his <a href="https://boosty.to/red888guns">Boosty profile</a>. For the rest of us, this fresh trailer's the best look we've gotten yet at what Berezin - who's worked on classic Fallout mods like <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2509613179">Olympus 2207</a> and <a href="https://cambragol.github.io/Fallout-Sonora/">Fallout: Sonora</a> - has been up to when not <a href="https://x.com/NewBlood/status/1537228975906627585">doing stuff</a> for publishers New Blood Interactive. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving into the trailer, it kicks off with the sort of pullback through some ruins as fifties-ish music plays that I'm fairly sure you're mandated by law to include in all Fallouty things. Once we're in the shoes of our Vault Doomweller, the shootiness starts.</p>
<p>Roaming around the mod's version of the first Fallout game's Necropolis, you'll be shooting and stabbing away at hordes of ferals, as your face contorts and grimaces on a status bar that's very much the unholy Doollout/Falloom union that you'd hope.</p>

<p>There's a wonderful crunchiness to every attack, as enemies burst into piles of gore that'll make your average bloody mess perk taker erupt into squeals of pure ecstacy. Then, at the end, mirroring how the fight through the city of the dead in Fallout 1 goes, there's a showdown with Harry the Super Mutant. He thinks he's gonna beat your head now, and he might if you're not quick to start blasting.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks like a really cool way to flip an old school Fallout sequence on its head. The mod is currently 60% done, all in all. Berezin breaks that down into four areas, with walls/tiles and scenery both being 80% of the way there, while weapons/UI and creatures are only 50 and 30% sorted respectively. There's no firm release date as of yet, with the modder only committing to getting Fallout: Bakersfield out there before the 2020s are over.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm happy to wait, and I'm not just saying that because it looks like Berezin's pretty handy at blowing  annoyances to bits with a beefy virtual shotgun.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-surprise-update-for-fallout-bakersfield-the-doom-mod-that-rebuilds-the-rpgs-necropolis-as-a-shooter-level]]></content:encoded>

I can’t really say for myself yet. To be honest, I haven’t really done much in Nintendo’s latest open-world reimagining of its iconic ape’s adventures. It’s not because I don’t want to, but because I, like several others, have found <em>Bananza </em>difficult to get through. This isn’t because of a difficult boss fight or tough platforming challenge, but because this game feels like the most expensive fidget toy I’ve ever held in my hands. The coolest thing about <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>is also what makes it a pain in the ass: I’m talking about the destructible environment.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,197589,197586" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>When I first booted up <em>Bananza</em>, I spent over an hour in the first room. No, not the first area, but the first <em>room</em> that Donkey Kong spawns into when you start a new playthrough. What was I doing in a mostly barren cave? I was beating the absolute shit out of the ceiling, floor, and walls in search of hidden packets of gold buried in the stone. And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/culture/613994/donkey-kong-bananza-destruction-mechanics-switch-2-opening-level&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/culture/613994/donkey-kong-bananza-destruction-mechanics-switch-2-opening-level" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I’m not the only player</a></span> who has been captivated (perhaps unwillingly) by the act of giving the environment the ol’ one-two.</p><p>Nintendo made a big deal about how <em>Bananza</em>’s cave structures could be pounded into submission, potentially revealing new areas or treasures waiting for you on the other side. In this game, DK is effectively a miner in search of golden bananas, and it’s genuinely impressive just how thoroughly he’s able to excavate the world. It’s incredibly satisfying to just be able to pull a Stanley Yelnats and plunge into the ground below you whenever you feel so compelled. I can rip a stone off a cave wall and start slapping enemies around with it. DK climbs up walls and can tunnel through the ceiling like it’s nothing. Caves are often meant to feel restrictive in video games, but <em>Bananza</em> makes Donkey Kong a walking drill capable of making tunnel systems at the press of a button. It’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-switch-2-60fps-30fps-nintendo-1851786303&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-switch-2-60fps-30fps-nintendo-1851786303">pretty impressive technical feat</a></span> on top of being a satisfying design space to play around in. But the problem is, being able to tear up the ground underneath you and find a bunch of shiny shit scratches my brain a little <em>too</em> well.</p><figure id="" data-id="2bed8ff5a6e652cb1e8bf9ac3a7c3288" data-recommend-id="image://2bed8ff5a6e652cb1e8bf9ac3a7c3288" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donkey Kong looking annoyed at gold nuggets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Donkey Kong looking annoyed at gold nuggets." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2bed8ff5a6e652cb1e8bf9ac3a7c3288" data-recommend-id="image://2bed8ff5a6e652cb1e8bf9ac3a7c3288" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donkey Kong looking annoyed at gold nuggets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I was diagnosed with OCD last year, and while it’s not the stereotypical clean freak shit you often see depicted in media, it did give me context for some of my odder neurodivergent tendencies. As far as my gaming habits go, however, this was somewhat surprising to me because I’m not usually the completionist type who has to do every little side quest or task, and I generally don’t like games that feel like they’re wasting my time. <em>Bananza</em>, however, has found a way past that mental block and tapped into a more easily activated tendency by giving me a small taste of destruction that inevitably turns into me devouring a meal of demolition.</p><p>Walking through the environment in <em>Bananza</em> is like bee-bopping around in a minefield until I find a stray nugget of gold poking out of a wall. I punch the shiny rock out of the wall, but the wall keeps caving in with every subsequent punch, and every few swings, another piece of gold comes tumbling out of the rubble. Sometimes an entire geyser of gold erupts from the stone, and I can’t simply leave to go to the next area when there could be another one of those waiting for me inside a stalagmite I have yet to pummel. Then, by the time I’ve really gotten into the rhythm of digging around, I realize that I’ve left a lot of destruction in my wake and have lost an hour or so of my day and accomplished nothing.</p><figure id="" data-id="530829a019bb0f00e3a6552ad2304953" data-recommend-id="image://530829a019bb0f00e3a6552ad2304953" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donkey Kong smiles in a barren cave after he rocked its shit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Donkey Kong smiles in a barren cave after he rocked its shit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="530829a019bb0f00e3a6552ad2304953" data-recommend-id="image://530829a019bb0f00e3a6552ad2304953" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donkey Kong smiles in a barren cave after he rocked its shit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I have always considered myself firmly a “goal-oriented” player, and that means I tend to like linear games more than the open-world glut of a lot of modern AAA projects. I get agitated when I feel like I’m not doing something and making real progress, and that discomfort with idle time means I’m usually the type of person who will do a few side quests, but hold off on a lot of the extracurricular stuff until I’ve seen the main quest through. In most video games, these alternate activities are sequestered enough down different pathways that I can keep my mind on my primary goal and come back to them later. With <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, however, the alternate path is underneath my feet with every step. Everything I do chips away at the walls of the cave system, and every inch I break through might lead me to treasure, or at least make a really satisfying crushing sound. I’ll see the end eventually, but y’all go ahead. I’ll catch up after I’ve left no stone unturned.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Despite receiving generally positive reviews, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a> wasn't a commercial hit for Ubisoft, and the company blames the "choppy waters" around the Star Wars IP at the time for the game's disappointing performance. Speaking to shareholders during a Q&amp;A session of its 2025 general meeting, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot referenced the Star Wars brand and how recent projects had tarnished it.</p><p>"Outlaws was released at a time when the brand that it belonged to was in a bit of choppy waters," Guillemot said (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-flopped-because-the-brand-itself-was-in-choppy-waters-ubisoft-ceo-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>). Leading up to the release of Star Wars Outlaws, the IP had experienced turbulence with the poorly received Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker movie, the polarizing TV series The Acolyte, and the mixed reception to The Book of Boba Fett.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-is-dropping-forced-stealth-so-you-can-start-blasting-your-way-out-of-trouble/1100-6527925/" data-ref-id="1100-6527925">Outlaws was also criticized at the time</a>, as the combination of a badly paced intro mission, various technical issues, and several bugs didn't sit too well with players. Most of these issues have been addressed since the game launched last year, and the story of protagonist Kay Vess has continued with two DLC expansions, Wild Card and A Pirate's Fortune.</p><p>While it's unclear if Ubisoft will ever venture back into the Star Wars galaxy--especially now that it has a new division focused on its tentpole IP <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-battlefront/" data-ref-id="5000-183978">and led by Guillemot's own son</a>, Charlie Guillemot--there are<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/2900-3917/" data-ref-id="2900-3917"> several Star Wars games in development at other studios</a>.</p><p>Saber Interactive says that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/" data-ref-id="1100-6533205">Knights of the Old Republic remake isn't dead</a>, Skydance New Media is working on its own untitled Star Wars project, and turn-based tactics fans can look forward to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-zero-company-release-date-story-trailer/1100-6530993/" data-ref-id="1100-6530993">Star Wars: Zero Company</a>.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> social media account on X has now been restored after being hacked and spammed with cryptocurrency posts.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Stellar Blade director Hyung-Tae Kim warned of the scam posts and advised followers not to interact.</p>
<p>"The official Stellar Blade account has been compromised, and unauthorised posts containing cryptocurrency airdrops and suspicious signup promotions are currently being uploaded," said the director on Saturday via his personal account.</p>

<p>"We kindly ask everyone to refrain from engaging with any of these posts and to remain cautious. We are currently in active discussions regarding the recovery of the hacked account, and we sincerely ask for your patience and understanding during this process."</p>
<p>Later that day, he <a href="https://x.com/jamm3rd/status/1946661852488102340">provided further details</a> on the website being operated by the scammers. "Please be advised that this website is not affiliated with Stellar Blade in any way, and we have never issued any cryptocurrency," he said.</p>

<p>Now, the account has been recovered, with a <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1947285271734796293">new post on the official game account</a>.</p>
<p>"We sincerely apologise for the long wait," it reads. "Our official account has now been fully restored. We deeply reflect on this incident and will take every measure to ensure it never happens again."</p>
<p>That means the Stellar Blade X account is now back to its usual postings of protagonist Eve in suggestive clothing.</p>
<p>The development team at Shift Up recently celebrated the release of the game on PC, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-debut-welcomes-record-numbers-for-a-playstation-published-single-player-release">reached a concurrent player count of 183,830 on Steam</a> within its first day on sale.

<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-for-switch-2-reportedly-in-development">Switch 2 version of the game is reportedly on the way</a>, following its PS5 console exclusivity. Meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away">sequel is officially on the way</a> and could arrive by the end of 2026. It will also have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-better-story-than-stellar-blade">a richer narrative than the first Stellar Blade</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-social-media-hacked-by-cryptocurrency-scam-posts-now-fully-restored]]></content:encoded>

A big part of why things feel so quiet right now is that, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786">at any point over the last fifteen years</a></span>, this would be the point in the three-yearly cycle where we’d be inundated with reveals of an all-new generation of pocket monsters, building up to the fall release of the big, new, mainline <em>Pokémon </em>game. Except, for reasons never announced, that’s not happened—we’re experiencing our first four-year gap in the franchise in ages. (God, I <em>hope</em> it’s just four years.) And while <em>Z-A</em> is looking intriguing, and we’ll definitely get a good look at it again tomorrow, one thing it isn’t going to do is add any new Pokémon to the roster.</p><p>So could this Presents be hiding some sort of tease for Gen X? I wish I could believe that, but I have my doubts. If there is going to be a new mainline game next year, all of history suggests it won’t be until around October, and starting reveals over a year early seems unlikely. Still, it’d be good!</p><p>What’s more likely is we’ll get updates for the array of <em>Pokémon</em> games already out there, including <em>Unite</em>, <em>TCG Pocket</em>, <em>Sleep</em> and the rest, as well as reveals for perhaps a couple of new mobile apps and games, and maybe a new multiplayer game. Oh, and something about <em>Horizons</em> season 2, perhaps. Perhaps more on the new season of the wonderful stop-motion <em>Concierge.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The stream will start tomorrow, July 22, at 9 a.m. EDT, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/pokemon&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via the official YouTube channel</a></span>. And intriguingly, if you tune into the Japanese channel an hour earlier, there’s apparently going to be an hour of DJ Pikachu Live? I have no idea. But it could well be promoting a surprise reveal of a DJ-based game in the main event.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legend-z-a-youtube-dj-pikachu-1851786626]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration">Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration</a> is getting another DLC expansion in the form of '<strong>The Namco Legendary Pack DLC</strong>'.</p>
<p>No release date has been set at the time of writing, but the new DLC will contain an additional timeline looking at Namco's history with Atari, along with multiple playable versions of <strong>Atari PAC-MAN</strong>, <strong>GALAGA</strong>, <strong>GALAXIAN</strong>, <strong>DIG DUG</strong>, and <strong>XEVIOUS</strong>.</p>
<p>You can expect a whole load of new photos, archival material, videos, and interviews, with the trailer highlighting more footage from the interview between Atari's co-founder Nolan Bushnell and current CEO Wade Rosen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 3 Atari PAC-MAN games: PAC-MAN 2600, 5200, and Atari 8-bit. This marks the first ever re-release of these games for consoles.</p>
<p>- Interactive timeline exploring the history of Namco titles on Atari consoles featuring video interviews with developers, archival materials and documents, photos from the era, and more.</p>

<p>- Home console versions of GALAGA, XEVIOUS, GALAXIAN, and DIG DUG.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not all, though. For the Atari enthusiasts out there, the company has also announced an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TP3JZ1RMdEA">Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition</a>, featuring a custom design based on the Pac-Man IP with a bonus double-feature game including the brand-new Pac-Man 7800 and the original Pac-Man 2600.</p>
<p>The cartridge will also be made available separately, or via a new '<a href="https://atari.com/products/high-score-collection-7800">High-Score Collection set</a>', which includes all aforementioned games for either the Atari 2600+ or Atari 7800+ (or, indeed, the original 7800).</p>
<p>Atari 50 has already been expanded with two additional DLC packs; one looking at 'The Wider World of Atari', and the other looking at 'The First Console War'.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dying Light: The Beast Final Hands-On (PC) Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-final-hands-on-pc-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-final-hands-on-pc-preview.1248734/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of a world tour leading up to the launch of their latest entry in the zombie survival/parkour action series, Techland recently invited Wccftech and a small number of other content creators and journalists out to California to go hands-on with the opening hours of Dying Light: The Beast.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While our earlier preview was focused on the protagonist Kyle Crane coming to terms with his newfound Beast powers, this session was more intimate, instead centered around the opening hours of the adventure in Castor Peaks (minus the introductory moments where Kyle breaks free from his decade-long captivity). You could consider these where Kyle Crane slowly gets his groove back, returning to the freerunning zombie slayer he once was.</p>



<p>Castor Peaks represents a much needed change in scenery from the concrete jungles of prior Dying Light games. While there are still scattered settlements with tightly clustered buildings to parkour across, much of the landscape is filled with nature and untouched areas free from human influence. Given Castor Peaks’ status as a nature conservation, this fits the setting and builds out the world into more of a playground where Kyle Crane can let his inner beast truly run wild.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Given that Dying Light: The Beast carries off a decade from the original Dying Light, there has clearly been the passage of time where the protagonist wasn’t working on his wallclimbing or hammer throwing. In proper open-world gameplay fashion, this leads the player into a series of tutorial segments meant to both onboard the player and return Kyle Crane back to fighting condition. This means the usual gamut of learning how to wield a melee weapon as well as where and how to climb around the environment. White paint splashed across ledges and open windows serve as pathways for the player to traverse and thankfully they blend well enough into the backdrop of Castor Peaks that one might not even notice they’re present unless actively looking for them.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast’s parkour system still takes some getting used to the intricate jankiness to truly appreciate. While it’s true that Kyle Crane can climb up and mantle over just about anything with a flat surface, some of the more puzzling sections can be an exercise in patience. Rather than moving and clamboring at the speed I’d want to move, sometimes I found myself needing to stop and look over at the ledge I wanted to mantle over to and wait for Kyle to stretch his arm out and indicate that he was locked onto the ledge and by jumping, he would automatically reach for it. There were a number of high stakes moments where the sense of urgency was pulled back by needing to wait for the precision to climb above. Given that Dying Light: The Beast is still an RPG at its core with a robust skill tree, I anticipate seeing some new abilities pop up that will mitigate my concerns with the traversal.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At the same time, combat is the other key pillar to what makes the Dying Light series. Played out entirely in first-person (minus the third-person cutscenes and menus), players will experience the visceral combat through the eyes of Kyle Crane. Whether wielding a one- or two-handed weapon or firearm, zombies are constantly on the move for the protagonist’s flesh and won’t stop until their head is knocked clean off. Dying Light: The Beast features an overhauled dismemberment system and there is a gratuitous amount of gore as Kyle swings away with any implement he can get his hands on. And yes, once again, weapon durability is a constant stuggle to maintain but now that Kyle Crane has been around an apocalypse or two before, he’s skilled enough to repair his weapons on the go with a fair bit of scrap metal and other materials he’s scavenged up. No more having to trade out broken pipes every 90 seconds just because you tried to take on an entire zombie horde instead of taking the high road to run away.</p>

<p>As this session of Dying Light: The Beast was focused on the early hours of Kyle Crane’s revenge story, many of the more interesting upgrades and Beast powers were locked away for players to rediscover. One thing’s for certain though: years of captivity have turned Kyle Crane into a raging beast.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast will launch on August 22nd, 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X and PC for $59.99/$69.99 or as a free standalone DLC for those who purchased the Ultimate Edition of Dying Light 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-preview-the-return-of-crane.1248732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="224ada69-abcb-4bde-8ebc-1cd2a0b91343" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow"><em>Dying Light</em></a> series has always held a special place in the zombie genre. After all, it was one of the first, if not the first, to implement parkour and make it a vital part of surviving. Thankfully, <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> follows the same formula that fans have come to expect while building upon the game's overall story. Ahead of the game's launch, Tech Raptor was recently invited to a hands-on preview event where we got to play a little over four hours of the upcoming game.</p>

<p>Interestingly, <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> breaks the trend of playing as a new character. Instead, players are once again in the boots of Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the first <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ca6b8cd3-8473-4246-ba44-281fcce108ac" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-bad-blood" rel="nofollow"><em>Dying Light</em></a>. But things are a bit different this time around. Due to a series of experiments on him, Crane now has superhuman-like abilities called Beast Mode that allow him to murder anything around him easily. The only way to activate it was by building a bar that would only fill when you attacked someone. If timed right, Beast Mode can help out in the heat of battle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-10.jpg?itok=bNFrlgkd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-10.jpg?itok=dXWvRq8O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This takes Beast Mode to a whole new meaning.</figcaption></figure><p>My demo opened up with Crane running through the woods into a mansion. I noticed early on that The Beast does a great job of blending Urban environments with Nature. There'll be a lot of times where you'll find yourself running through the woods and have nothing to climb onto or jump on. This was a new direction to take the series because, in previous titles, you always had some kind of roof or ledge from which you could jump when needed.</p>

<p>At first, this may not sound like a good idea on paper, but it adds an extra layer of fear in the game. Because in many ways, you're now exposed, and it requires you to think quickly, if not, you run the risk of getting swarmed by a horde of zombies. To combat this, Techland introduced 4x4 trucks that you can drive in certain map regions. Admittedly, though I found myself avoiding cars because of how unreliable they can be, because of how it can get stuck in ditches or in a street filled with abandoned cars, running around proved to be the better method nine times out of ten.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-12-1.jpg?itok=8Quo17_K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-12-1.jpg?itok=Kwz4tieN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nothing like the great outdoors... and zombies.</figcaption></figure><p>Once I entered the mansion and fought through a small group of zombies, I was immediately ambushed by a larger-than-life zombie called Chimera. These are essentially lab-created super zombies that are in Beast Mode 24/7.</p>

<p>Throughout my demo, I fought a small handful of Chimera, and each had its own unique fight. Despite that, they all shared a few common traits. Like Souls-like games, each boss has a second phase, and once you get to it, their moveset would drastically change, and throughout the fight, they would eventually call for backup, and you'd be forced to fight regular zombies while dealing with trying not to get killed by the boss.</p>

<p>As fun and engaging as these fights were, they all handicapped themselves because of how beefy the bosses were. A lot of the time, it felt as if my hits weren't doing too much damage, and this caused nearly all of the fights to drag on longer than I would have liked.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-20.jpg?itok=WkYkA_tT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-20.jpg?itok=U5poB19t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These zombies are about to catch these hands.</figcaption></figure><p>Another thing worth pointing out is some of the tropes implemented in <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>. As I progressed through the story, I was eventually greeted by a woman who betrayed the game's main antagonist. The issue that stood out to me was that it followed an old 2000s trope of having an attractive blonde woman help this dark and broody man through the powers of science, because she couldn't defend or accomplish what she wanted to do herself. It felt odd then and odd now to see such dated clichés being played out again in 2025. But that's where a lot of my complaints begin and end.</p>

<p>Although many of the story beats I got were extremely limited to the small section I was playing, it offered an interesting twist. In short, Crane is looking to get revenge on the man who experimented on him, and to do this, he has to gain the trust of local survivors to ensure he'll have enough manpower to do so. But that wasn't the part that stood out to me. The Beast makes it clear that the big bad of this game is, by all accounts, a monster and someone who lost their humanity in hopes of gaining power. But to take him down, Crane has to become a monster himself, literally.</p>

<p>This is done by mixing his DNA with the dead Chimeras you kill along the way. This proposed a unique question: "How much of yourself can you sell, before you lose your humanity?" Obviously, this question wasn't answered in the few hours I played, but it left me wondering how the bigger picture would unfold.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-16.jpg?itok=8TFALs55 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-16.jpg?itok=gDJI6oDO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Am I a man... Or am I a monster?</figcaption></figure><p>One thing that caught me off guard was the improved combat system. Sure, shooting a bow and gun feels good, but at its core, <em>Dying Light</em> has always been a guerrilla survival game in the sense that just about anything can be a melee weapon. In <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, swinging a weapon around feels a lot more authentic. Seeing the difference in animations between lighting one-handed blades and two-handed hammers was something I appreciated, even more so when I found myself in tight environments, because this forced my character to use these in unique ways that still felt realistic.</p>

<p>In keeping things realistic, The Beast didn't shy away from the gore this time. As I was hacking and slashing through zombies, I immediately saw the effects my weapons were having. For example, every time I would hit a zombie in the face, I would see their flesh and skull open more and more with each hit. Or if I went for a gut attack, their intestines would come flying out.</p>

<p>The nice cherry on top of this was how precise arm attacks would be. I found myself testing how accurate it was. If I used a blade and swung at the hand only, the hand would fall off, but if I hit the elbow, then the bottom half of the arm would fall off. This nice attention to detail helps sell how grim and dark the world of <em>Dying Light</em> is.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-08.jpg?itok=T6lGITMx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-08.jpg?itok=jEQU-Zia 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hack and slash.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, some of <em>Dying Light's</em> core parts are the parkour and Day and Night systems. I'm happy to report that both are as fun and engaging as ever. Like the other Dyling Light games, the world still feels like a massive sandbox. This makes running from rooftop to rooftop even more fun because the game encourages you to run around and find hidden paths that make getting around much easier.</p>

<p>When night hits, the rules of the game are flipped once again. Although it's still possible to be aggressive and hunt down zombies, it's not the best idea. This is mainly because this is one of the only times Volatiles come out, and fighting them is never an easy task. But what's interesting is if you happen to get spotted by one, it'll create a unique sequence that lets you know how many Volatiles are actively trying to kill you. If you have a Volatile chasing you, more will appear, and the hunt for you will be even more challenging to survive.</p>

If you've played any of the games, you can pick up a controller and understand it almost instantly. Although it feels similar to the first two <em>Dying Light</em> games, it captures the charm of what makes them so enjoyable while improving many core features that help take the game in a new direction. <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> will be released on August 22 and will be playable on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep&nbsp;</em>developer The Chinese Room has announced that it's splitting from parent company Sumo Group, following layoffs at the latter earlier this year.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-announces-management-buyout-gaining-independence-from-sumo-digital" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, the British studio's management has bought the studio in order to make it independent. Prior to the buyout, The Chinese Room's future had been uncertain; in February, Sumo Group said it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sumo-group-layoffs-refocus" rel="nofollow">focus more on "development services for partners"</a> rather than original work, although the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>would come under that heading.</p>

<p>The Chinese Room says that its sale to a third party was looking "increasingly likely" before the buyout, and that becoming independent will not only allow it to "work on new, original intellectual property", but also to "partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with [the studio's] vision".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-the-chinese-room.jpg?itok=4nvtcGzZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-the-chinese-room.jpg?itok=19BVgUmW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Chinese Room is working on&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to IGN's report, The Chinese Room is now working on two brand new IPs, but before those see the light of day, the studio will be releasing the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>later this year.</p>

<p>Back in March, the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">once again delayed</a>, this time to October. It's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-yet-again" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> a number of times <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">before</a>, but given that The Chinese Room was only announced as the game's developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" rel="nofollow">back in September 2023</a>, it's entirely possible a lot of the earlier work on the game was thrown out when that development change happened.</p>

<p>In the interim, however, The Chinese Room hasn't been resting on its laurels. Earlier this year, the studio released a paid DLC pack for its narrative horror game&nbsp;<em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chinese-room-still-wakes-the-deep-release-date" rel="nofollow">released in June last year</a>.</p>

Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/how-28-days-later-stranger-things-and-pac-man-influenced-dying-light-beast</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-28-days-later-stranger-things-and-pac-man-influenced-dying-light-the-beast.1248728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ahead of <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, TechRaptor was invited to a hands-on preview where we played the game for a handful of hours. On top of hacking and slashing the army of the dead, we also got to sit down and chat with Tymon Smektala, the franchise director for the <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="224ada69-abcb-4bde-8ebc-1cd2a0b91343" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow">Dying Light</a></em> series, about where the team draws inspiration from and where the series can go from here.</p>

<p>One of the most significant changes about <em>The Beast</em> in comparison to previous games is that a large portion of the game takes place in the woods, where there are few to no areas for players to use parkour to help them get out of a tricky situation. Smektala explains that they wanted to try this out and see if they could take the series to a new location and still feel authentic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bober-the-beaver-screenshot-4.jpg?itok=cDiOMGjk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bober-the-beaver-screenshot-4.jpg?itok=h6cdHukz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Go and touch some grass.</figcaption></figure><p>"We wanted to see if we could have a <em>Dying Light</em> game where we could [occasionally] take away parkour. What we discovered is that it works very well for us because, in a way, parkour is a survival mechanic. You can use it to get away quickly. [Taking away parkour] even adds to the survival aspect because suddenly you feel more exposed and fragile against threats. It adds a lot of tension," Smektala said.</p>

<p>Many survival-horror games involve players running for their lives, but the latest installment of <em>Dying Light</em> introduces a new mechanic called "Beast Mode." In short, this makes you an unstoppable force of nature that can kill just about everything in your path. Smektala told TechRaptor that this was implemented so they could give players a fighting chance when they find themselves overwhelmed by zombies. The idea of having this second wind stemmed from an unlikely game… <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bcdf3e0e-b246-4766-a64d-4a145078a64f" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/shadow-labyrinth-preview-pax-east-2025" rel="nofollow">Pac-Man</a></em>.</p>

<p>"It's kind of the same setup. You feel very fragile because when the ghosts are chasing you, all they need to do is touch you, and you'll die. But when you grab the power pellet, that's when you turn the tables. [Beast Mode] is the same mechanic, and in <em>Pac-Man</em>, the uncertainty of not knowing if you'd reach the power pellet adds to the excitement like in <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>," Smektala said.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-10_0.jpg?itok=u7FiIdsl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-10_0.jpg?itok=JYbWRXAz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to eat some Power Pellets.</figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned in our recent preview, a prominent theme of <em>The Beast</em> is the main character literally becoming a beast to stop someone who's metaphorically a beast. This idea largely stemmed from a Korean film called <em>Old Boy</em>.</p>

<p>The film explores similar themes and shares similar story beats of a person being captured for years, and once they escape, they set out to kill everyone who has wronged them. But <em>Old Boy</em> wasn't the only piece of media that helped inspire <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>. Smektala went on to cite shows such as <em>Twin Peaks</em> and <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e5de03d1-d8cd-419d-8918-561c018bd3c0" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/liches-vecna-and-stranger-things-our-time-with-chris-perkins" rel="nofollow">Stranger Things</a> </em>as also playing a huge role in setting the narrative location for the upcoming game.</p>

<p>"Both take place in those little towns, where they are [cut off from] the outside world, and the outside world doesn't matter," he said. "It all happens within this town, and a lot of very weird and strange things transpire."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-14.jpg?itok=wB3qR7F1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-14.jpg?itok=V-NPwWbJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Parkour!</figcaption></figure><p>Zombie fans may quickly notice how much the game draws inspiration from the <em>28 </em>movie trilogy. This can be seen in the music, scenery, and chases players encounter. When asked if the team used the movie series as a point of reference, Smektala said that Techland views <em>Dying Light</em> as "[one of the] top games in the zombie genre." But the <em>28 </em>series has been a big inspiration for Techland, and he discussed how both series have gone down similar paths.</p>

<p>"All of those movies try to do something different. If you compare <em>28 Days Later </em>and <em>28 Weeks Later</em>, they are completely different movies. Again, <em>28 Years Later</em> is very different when compared to the first two," Smektala said. "What happens in those movies is very similar to what we are doing with <em>Dying Light</em>. <em>28 Days Later</em> was a very intimate movie with mostly one character in a very empty space, where he was feeling weak against zombies. This was a similar feeling to the early hours of <em>Dying Light 1</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-05.jpg?itok=C5rC4OyL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-05.jpg?itok=TrwvJAuc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fight the dead, fear the living.</figcaption></figure><p>"When you look at <em>28 Weeks Later</em>, it's much more focused on action. With people in big action sequences, people shooting guns, and a lot more blockbuster moments. This is the same with <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="224ada69-abcb-4bde-8ebc-1cd2a0b91343" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow">Dying Light 2 Stay Human</a></em>. This was our action game; it was focused on big moments. Now, <em>28 Years Later</em>, is a different story that is similar to <em>The Beast</em>, because it's very experimental in a way. A lot of weird things are happening in <em>28 Years Later</em>, as in <em>The Beast</em>."</p>

<p>Speaking of a lot of weird things happening, <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> introduces a new zombie variant called Chimeras. Smektala said that introducing a new zombie variant can always be difficult because they don't want to lean too far out of the world of realism. So the Chimeras came from the idea of "something that could have happened if you applied proper science to it." That's where a lot of the visual inspiration came into play.</p>

<p>"When it comes to the design of the Chimeras, two main sources of inspiration are anatomy books. The second one is an anime series called <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fa17d54b-1887-4176-82c7-9f626553cc5f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/attack-on-titan-2" rel="nofollow">Attack on Titan</a></em>, which has those types of monsters that are skinless with all of their bodies exposed. That informed the visual designs for the Chimera," he said.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-20_0.jpg?itok=v88fsavZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light_-the-beast-screenshot-20_0.jpg?itok=_rNtwCqj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Chimera or Titan?</figcaption></figure><p>One final piece of information that long-time franchise fans may be excited to hear is that <em>The Beast</em> is supposed to set the canon for the franchise going forward, and it takes place after the first two installments. This is notable because every <em>Dying Light</em> game has multiple endings, and it's left up to the player to decide what ending they want. But according to Smektala, <em>The Beast</em> will have one ending because the team wanted "to set the canon for the universe."</p>

<p>Smektala even teased that The Beast's ending will "answer several questions from both the first and second game." <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> will release on August 22 and will be playable on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

One of those is the mod system, which features a lot of customization and crafting. </p><p>While Digital Extremes hasn’t dished on what its big fall update will include (more info is coming in a devstream on September 25), we do know it will have a new quest called Teacher that will onboard players to the game’s most important buildcrafting tool. Hopefully it’s a good onramp for everyone still looking for one. </p><h2 id="h270071"><a id=""></a>The next story chapter is called<em> The Old Peace</em></h2><p><em>Warframe</em>’s next expansion drops near the end of 2025 and will take players into the past to witness the game’s “most tectonic historical event,” known as “The Old War.” It’ll feature a visual overhaul to player controlled Tenno Operators and WWI-inspired trench warfare. </p><p>It’ll include a playable Excalibur Prime for one of the quests, Caliban Prime, new Sentient allies and enemies, the devil-inspired Warframe Uriel, and two new Protoframes. Most importantly, it’ll set the stage for something the game has never done before.</p><h2 id="h270072"><a id=""></a>2026 will takes players to the distant Tau star system</h2><p>Following the events of <em>The Old Peace</em>, players will, for the first time in Warframe’s history, be taken to the new Tau star system. It was a target for colonization within the game’s fiction long ago, with self-replicating terraforming machines called Sentients tasked with preparing Tau for inhabitation. What will await players there next year is anybody’s guess. </p><h2 id="h270073"><a id=""></a><em>Soulframe</em> is still years away but fans went hands-on with an early test build called <em>Preludes</em></h2><p>In addition to continuing <em>Warframe</em>’s legacy, Digital Extremes has also been busy with the fantasy-based spin-off <em>Soulframe</em>. An extended demo during TennoCon 2025 showed character customization and a player tracking a monster through the woods, using a combination of melee weapons, archer, and spells to survive various woodland threats. While fans were able to try out the pre-alpha <em>Preludes</em> build over the weekend, a lasting free demo sounds a bit farther away. </p><p>Will the game be ready before the end of 2025? That’s sounding less and less likely.  “It’s an aspirational goal,” community manager Sarah Asselin told fans during a Q&amp;A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over the weekend</a></span>. “We’re looking at where we’re at by the end of the year, but we want to feel confident that we’ve built<em> Soulframe</em> out to the point where it feels good to do so, for the players and the developers.” </p><h2 id="h270074"><a id=""></a><em>Warframe</em>’s devs would love to make a Switch 2 version but still haven’t received a dev kit from Nintendo</h2><figure id="" data-id="eaf5981b80d6f1aaf29bba3e598ac81e" data-recommend-id="image://eaf5981b80d6f1aaf29bba3e598ac81e" data-format="png" data-width="1186" data-height="669" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Warframe characters appear on a Switch 2.

Will <em>Warframe</em>, which could certainly benefit from better performance on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid device, be getting a similar treatment?

Absolutely.” </p><p>We’ll see what ends up coming out first: <em>Warframe</em>’s Switch 2 upgrade or <em>Soulframe</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/warframe-soulsframe-switch-2-tau-trailer-tennocon-2025-1851786622]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> released last week, and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-climbs-to-top-of-uk-physical-sales-charts-but-still-sells-less-than-half-of-mario-odyssey">proven a popular addition to the Switch 2's library</a>.</p>
<p>But, while the base game itself has been met with plenty of praise, its inclusion of an artist mode has also tickled many peoples' fancy. This mode is somewhat reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>'s interactive menu, and lets players sculpt their own creations out of rock by using the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>'s mouse controls.</p>
<p>Creations so far have included fellow famous Nintendo faces such as Luigi, as well as carved works showing Banjo of Banjo-Kazooie fame, and even a <a href="https://x.com/michaeljhaley/status/1947011457373335896">Star Wars Death Star</a>. Others have taken things even further, and a little darker, and sculpted DK's crucifixion. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>VOID Interactive's Ready or Not has surpassed 1 million copies sold on consoles, just four days after its console launch, which brings the game's total sales past 10 million, after it hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpasses-9-million-copies-sold-ahead-of-its-console-launch-this-summer/">9 million copies sold on PC earlier this year</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>When we launched Ready or Not on PC, it took about 36 days to reach 1 million units sold. On console, it took about 3.6 days. I’m incredibly proud of the team and what we’ve accomplished together. It’s a huge moment — and one we don’t take for granted,</em>" said developer and publisher VOID Interactive's chief executive officer, Julio Rodriguez, in a press release. "<em>Game reviews are holding strong as we head into our first weekend, and the team is already hard at work ironing out issues and continuously improving the experience. To our players, partners, and everyone who believed in the project — thank you.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption>Ready or Not passes 1 million copies sold on consoles. Image credit: VOID Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>VOID Interactive's chief operating officer and creative director, Stirling Rank, added, "<em>The response from console players has completely blown us away. Going from the days of excitement from our Early Access trailer blowing up on PC to seeing the community grow globally so much across platforms &nbsp;is humbling, but &nbsp;testament to the incredible dedication of the entire VOID Interactive team to make this vision a reality for Ready or Not.</em>"</p>



<p>While the console launch has quickly been the next chapter of success in Ready or Not's story, it's also been another chapter marked with controversy. The console release came with an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337?l=english">update and changes</a> that some players considered to be censorship, with certain aspects of gore, nudity, and violence changed in both the console and PC versions of the game. VOID Interactive maintains that the changes were "<em>to support stability and align with policies enforced by global platforms and age rating bodies."</em></p>



<p>VOID Interactive has always emphasized that Ready or Not is a "<em>hyper-realistic tactical FPS,"</em> and the changes ranging from victims in one level being nude, to now being partially clothed, to a child no longer appearing as having been dismembered post-mortem seem to clash with what players believed the original vision of the game to be. </p>



<p>While players on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/#app_reviews_hash">Steam have taken to review-bombing</a> the game to show their displeasure, it's clear that this uproar hasn't had an overtly negative impact on sales. If you're also dissatisfied with the changes, a player released a mod that reverts the changes to how the game was pre-console launch just <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ready-or-not-modder-retcons-censorship-changes-within-an-hour-of-new-patch-going-live">20 minutes after the update went live</a>.</p>
