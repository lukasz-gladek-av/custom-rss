            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/return-to-actuality-with-invisible-sun-electric-and-indigo-by-monte-cook-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Monte Cook Games has launched another Invisible Sun crowdfunding campaign: Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo. The campaign includes another physical printing of the surreal fantasy TTRPG, a new supplement, and official VTT support.</p>

<h2>The <em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em> Backerkit Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its Backerkit campaign page, <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/monte-cook-games/invisible-sun-indigo" rel="nofollow"><em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em></a> contains two new products for Monte Cook Games' iconic, acclaimed TTRPG.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/invisible-sun-electric-and-indigo-game-box-artwork.jpg?itok=bmqmciZe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/invisible-sun-electric-and-indigo-game-box-artwork.jpg?itok=L7-fex-9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these products is <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em>. This is a re-envisioned version of the physical game with redesigned books and game pieces. If you own a copy of the game via the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/invisible-sun-return-of-black-cube-live-now-on-backerkit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Return of the Black Cube</a> campaign, you already have everything you need to play. Furthermore, the campaign includes the Vislae Companion, a book meant to give players a primer of the setting and gameplay basics.</p>

<p>The campaign's FAQ page further explains the difference between <em>Indigo</em> and the Black Cube. For <em>Indigo</em>, all core rulebooks are softcover, The Path of Suns is a mat instead of a game board, and the elaborate Testament of the Suns is gone. This was done to make <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> a more affordable version of the game. This is reflected in this campaign's (slightly) lower prices compared to the last campaign.</p>

<p>For those already familiar with the game, <em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em> includes a new sourcebook. Titled, <em>The Electric Sun</em>, it details a new emerging form of magic and its effect on the planes of existence beyond our own. It includes new magic, new characters, and new prewritten adventures.</p>

Full game support, including compendium, character sheets, cards, and more, will be coming both to Roll20 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/alchemy-rpg-vtts-and-focus-on-roleplaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alchemy</a>. Considering how complex and dense this RPG is, the introduction of VTT support considerably lowers the barrier to entry for new players.</p>

<p>The different pledge levels for the campaign are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>The Electric Sun (Digital) for $19:</strong> A PDF of <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>Invisible Sun: Indigo (Digital) for $35:</strong> A PDF of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em></li>
	<li><strong>Electric and Indigo (Digital) for $50:</strong> PDFs of both <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> and <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>Invisible Sun: Indigo VTT for $80:</strong> Access to <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> on either Roll20 or Alchemy</li>
	<li><strong>The Electric Sun for $54:</strong> Physical and PDF copies of <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>Invisible Sun: Indigo for $179:</strong> Physical and PDF copies of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em></li>
	<li><strong>Electric and Indigo for $199:</strong> Physical and PDF copies of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> and <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>The Breadth of the Actuality for $287:</strong> Everything in the Electric and Indigo pledge level, digital and physical game props and character tokens, a Testament of Suns, a set of physical Wicked Keys, and five Vislae Companion books</li>
</ul><p>Lastly, the <em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em> campaign addresses how the company will address trade tariffs. Simply put, Monte Cook Games will be decentralizing the production of their products in areas not subject to tariffs. The books will be printed in Canada, the games will be assembled in the US, etc.. Lastly, potential tariff costs have already been factored into the pledge tiers.</p>

<p>Essentially, Monte Cook are they are doing everything possible to address these unwelcome costs to production with this campaign and are maintaining transparency with their users. Given the stated intention of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> to provide a cheaper experience, this makes sense.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the Backerkit campaign has raised $135,999, overtaking its funding goal of $100,000. The campaign ends June 5.</p>

But, just to keep it real simple, Sciel uses a double-sided scythe for a melee weapon. There are actually really heartbreaking reasons for that, but in context, it does mean that despite everything else, she’s still got some powerful melee capabilities you can and should take advantage of. In particular, though, one of her bread-and-butter abilities, Sealed Fate, will depend on what element and what weapon you’ve got equipped, so more than some of the others, you still wanna choose her main weapon wisely, and not just for max Attack power.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Gustave In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>The main reason for that is because the vast majority of her abilities cast some form of Dark energy. She and, later, Monoco are the only ones who have consistent access to Dark skills, and given how rare it is for enemies to have a defense against it, that makes her innately pretty useful. But, of course, that’s the tip of the iceberg.</p><figure id="" data-id="dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-recommend-id="image://dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sciel chooses from her abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sciel chooses from her abilities." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-recommend-id="image://dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sciel chooses from her abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h959255"><a id="foretell"></a>Special mechanic: Foretell and Twilight</h2><p>And now, the feature presentation: Sciel’s tutorial <em>technically</em> tells players all they need to know to use the Foretell system, but it sucks at telling you how to use it effectively. And you can see why, given how easy it is for Sciel to become Death, Destroyer of Worlds with the right loadout. </p><p>So, there’s actually two special mechanics going on here. The first is Foretell. <strong>Think of Sciel’s Foretell cards like they’re little sticky bombs. You can stick a maximum of 10 onto an enemy, and whenever you’re ready, you can Consume them</strong>, which detonates some or all of them for additional damage. Obviously, you want a full payload of 10, and to hopefully not waste too many turns getting there. </p><p>The second is the Twilight mechanic. Each of Sciel’s skills is coded as either a Light or Dark skill, noted by the little sun and moon icons in the upper right of the descriptions in the menus. Using a skill generates a card with either a Sun or Moon on it. <strong>Once you’ve generated at least one Sun card and one Moon card, Sciel enters Twilight mode, which increases damage by 50%, but also doubles the amount of Foretell you can slap onto an enemy from 10 to 20</strong>. That damage increase actually goes up by 25% for every card of one type you generate before generating the opposite card to enter Twilight (i.e. adding multiple Sun cards before generating a Moon and vice versa). </p><p>It’s not a hard mechanic to grasp, but the trickiness mostly comes in the fact that the skill descriptions get very <em>Magic the Gathering</em> real fast, and especially when you’re just getting acclimated, they’re throwing a LOT at you. </p><figure id="" data-id="9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-recommend-id="image://9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Sciel's combat options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Sciel's combat options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-recommend-id="image://9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Sciel's combat options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h959256"><a id="builds"></a>Recommended builds and synergies</h2><p>We could honestly be here all day with this one.

It’s the best go-to trigger for Twilight once you’ve got your cards stacked. It’s right next to Phantom Blade on the Skills tree, so you can grab it early on; it does a pretty absurd amount of damage for only a fourAP cost. Pair it with the Critical Burn or Critical Break Picto/Lumina, and you’ve basically taken a chainsaw to a massive chunk of every enemy’s lifebar.The main thing to remember is that it does attack using your weapon’s element, so be aware if your opponent’s immune so you don’t wind up healing your enemy for thousands of points like a dumbass. And oh yeah, if you think that Skill hurts enemies now, once you’re actually in Twilight, Sealed Fate can be an absolute wrecking ball, especially once you’ve got the enemy up to 20 Foretell. Once you’ve unlocked Gradient Attacks, drop this right after Shadow Bringer, and watch enemies melt away. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Lune In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>While this is just a guide to get you started, it is worth noting just how much the game can and will change once you’ve got stuff like Fortune’s Fate in your back pocket. Also, when you’re finally brave enough to take down the colossal Sprong enemy hanging out in the southwestern part of the map, he’ll drop the Cheater Picto, allowing you to take two turns in a row, and putting that thing on Sciel makes her an absolute monster in terms of building up high Twilight percentages fast. If you go that route—and should—just make sure she has a skill that can trigger a Break, because she can get an enemy there <em>fast</em>. </p><hr><p><br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> is launching in early June amid ongoing drama and uncertainty about tariffs, and now Nintendo has put a dollar amount to how much of a negative impact it's forecasting as a result.</p><p>Speaking to analysts and investors as part of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250509e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the company's latest earnings briefing</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said Nintendo has factored in a negative impact of "several tens of billions of yen at the profit level." Ten billion yen equals about $67 million, so it's not a small amount.</p><p>Furukawa said Nintendo is basing this off the US tariff rates effective April 10. It's now mid-May, and things have developed since then. Just recently, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-us-switzerland-tariffs-negotiations-b3f5174d086e39b2522ab848ddad9372" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the US and China reached an agreement</a> that sees the US drop its previous 145% tariff rate on China down to 30%, with China lowering its rate on the US from 125% to 10%. This deal is set to last for 90 days, which would take it beyond the Switch 2 release date.</p><p>Given Nintendo's forecast was based on what the tariff rate was on April 10, there might be different calculations going on at Nintendo now that tariffs on goods from China have been lowered massively. This has been a fluid situation for Nintendo and many other companies bringing in goods to the US from China (Switch 2 consoles are manufactured in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia).</p><p>Furukawa made these comments during Nintendo's latest earnings briefing on May 8, and the English translation was not posted until today, May 13. The US and China announced their joint trade deal on May 12.</p><p>Furukawa went on to say that the Switch 2 is expected to have a lower profit margin that the original Switch, which has been on sale since 2017.</p><p>"Our basic policy is that for any country or region, if tariffs are imposed, we recognize them as a part of the cost and incorporate them into the price. However, this year marks our first new dedicated video game system launch in eight years, so given our unique situation, our priority is to maintain the momentum of our platforms, which is extremely important for our dedicated video game platform business, and to rapidly expand the install base of our new hardware," Furukawa said.</p><p>The executive added that if there are further changes to tariff policies for China and other markets, Nintendo would consider "what kind of price adjustments would be appropriate," if any.</p><p>For context, Nintendo is <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">projecting</a> 320 billion yen in operating profit and 380 billion yen in ordinary profit for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026, along with 300 billion yen in profit attributable to owners of parent.</p><p>For the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fiscal year that ended March 31, 2024</a>, Nintendo made an operating profit of 528.9 billion yen, an ordinary profit of 680.5 billion yen, and 490.6 billion yen in profit attributable to owners of parent. <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">For the fiscal year that ended March 31, 2025</a>, Nintendo made an operating profit of 282.5 billion yen, an ordinary profit of 372.3 billion yen, and 278.8 billion in profit attributable to owners of parent.</p><p>Nintendo is expecting to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/" data-ref-id="1100-6531389">15 million Switch 2 units during the current fiscal year that ends March 31, 2026</a>, and that's about the same as the original Switch over its first 10 months in the market. Furukawa said the Switch 2's "relatively high" price compared to the original Switch--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">it's $50 more expensive with inflation factored in</a>--represents one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-price-could-affect-early-adoption-nintendo-says/1100-6531493/" data-ref-id="1100-6531493">"challenges to early adoption"</a> of the system.</p><p>"The limits of our hardware production capacity were not a factor in setting our sales volume forecast. Additionally, the tariff situation in the U.S. or a possibility of a recession did not affect our sales volume forecast either," Furukawa said.</p><p>Nintendo held its big Switch 2 Direct on April 2, the same day that US President Donald Trump announced his "Liberation Day" tariffs on China. Responding to this, Nintendo announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 preorders</a> would not begin on April 9, but were instead delayed to later in the month, with many wondering if Nintendo would raise the price of the console as a result. That did not happen, but the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/" data-ref-id="1100-6530965">did raise prices on some Switch 2 accessories. </a></p>

I swore off trading card games when I realized how much money people dump into cracking packs, but I can still appreciate some good <em>Final Fantasy </em>art when I see it. Something I also appreciate is a good bit, and the <em>Magic </em>x <em>Final Fantasy </em>collab handled one of the series’ long-running constants in a truly clever way that even I, someone who doesn’t understand the ruleset of the card game, can appreciate. I’m talking about Cid, a recurring name given to different characters in each mainline <em>Final Fantasy</em>.</p><p>For those who don’t play Square Enix’s RPG anthology series, every <em>Final Fantasy </em>has a character named Cid (though he doesn’t appear physically in the first game, thus he isn’t featured in the <em>Magic</em> collab), but it’s never the same guy twice. If you were to line up every version of Cid next to each other, you’d probably have no idea any of them were related in any way. But they all share the same name, and some of them are among the most beloved characters in the series. <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s iteration was easily <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-16-cid-voice-actor-ralph-ineson-ramuh-1850570377&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-16-cid-voice-actor-ralph-ineson-ramuh-1850570377">the breakout star of the RPG in 2023</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-cid-highwind-shera-smoking-1851298459&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-cid-highwind-shera-smoking-1851298459"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em>’s Cid</a></span> is a personal favorite of mine across the series’ long history.</p><p>So, how do you handle 15 disparate characters who only share a name and (usually) some mechanical skill? You make a card for each of them, of course. <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> will include 15 different cards titled “Cid, Timeless Artificer.” Each card has the same in-game function, so there’s no favoritism on display here, even for more popular Cids. You can have any number of them in your deck, so you could have several variations to use in a game rather than having to pick your favorite. However, there is one wrinkle in all of this worth mentioning: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xv-features-the-first-female-cid-1673478411&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xv-features-the-first-female-cid-1673478411"><em>Final Fantasy XV</em>’s Cindy (Cidney in some territories)</a></span> is nowhere to be seen.</p><p>This omission recalls some weird semantic debates over who the true “Cid” of the 15th game is, as there is indeed a character named Cid in it and he has a card in this set, but his granddaughter Cindy is the mechanic the team interfaces with most of the time. The character spurred strong and sometimes divided opinions among players in 2016, as she was the first female Cid in the series, while also appearing in one of the most notably male-centric <em>Final Fantasy</em> games (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/male-intimacy-and-final-fantasy-xv/1100-6425749/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/male-intimacy-and-final-fantasy-xv/1100-6425749/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for good and ill</a></span>) and wearing a revealing outfit that was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/final-fantasy-xv-has-some-big-problems/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/final-fantasy-xv-has-some-big-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial</a></span>, to say the least.

In terms of price, this works out to roughly $7 for the battle pass if you don't have any of the premium in-game currency saved up. NetEase added that it is considering bringing older battle passes back in the future, but these will cost at least 20% more. There'll be no free rewards in these limited-time battle passes either, as NetEase noted that access to all rewards will require the purchase of the Luxury Battle Pass.</p>

<p>"Future Battle Pass returns might occur, but any such plans will span at least two seasons and be priced at a minimum of 20% higher than the original seasonal rate," the studio said in a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250513/40954_1233900.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.</p><p>This follows a trend of gaming becoming more expensive lately, as a variety of factors like turbulent market conditions, the increasing cost of video game development, and US President Donald Trump's tariff threats <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">have had a knock-on effect on the industry</a>.</p><p>As for why digital goods like battle passes are increasing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-digital-game-prices-are-going-up-too/1100-6531277/">there are multiple reasons here as well</a>. Increasing prices on a digital product can help offset rising costs in other departments, but the simplest explanation here is that these price increases are being made simply because a developer or publisher <em>can </em>do it.</p><p>With the Switch 2 launching next month, we've seen Nintendo raise the price of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">several of its first-party games to $80</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">while Microsoft has announced price increases for its Xbox Series X|S consoles</a> and games as well.</p>

The Illuminate have emerged from the Meridian singularity, and they're bringing the fight to Super Earth. As detailed by Arrowhead in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/" rel="nofollow ">latest Sony blog</a>, this update includes the Stingray, which are enemy fighter jets that provide aerial support for the Illuminate. Stingrays can target players and line up devastating strafing runs. Another new threat is an enemy called Fleshmob, which the developer describes as being a failed Illuminate experiment and a "Frankenstein's monster of Voteless parts."</p>

<p dir="ltr">These are just some of the new enemy types players can encounter. The developer also alludes to other threats by saying, "There have been sightings of other, even larger ships, though details remain unclear on their abilities," so players will likely have a few surprises to discover.</p><p dir="ltr">The update adds weapon customization and progression to Helldivers 2. Now, most primary weapons have levels that are achievable by completing missions, which then will unlock new attachments players can obtain through Requisition. This allows for weapon customization and tuning, such as adjusting ammo capacity, fire rate, recoil, and reload time.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can unlock patterns to visually customize their weapons. A variety of patterns which were previously tied to Warbonds (Viper Commandos, Freedom's Flame, Chemical Agents, and Truth Enforcers Warbonds) will be made available to players on May 15, which is when the new "Masters of Ceremony" Warbond arrives.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Superstore has been changed so items players want are always available, whereas previously they had to wait for items to come back into rotation.</p><p dir="ltr">Arrowhead has also released a new gameplay trailer ahead of the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond-gameplay-trailer/2300-6465961/">Masters of Ceremony Warbond</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-laying-off-3-of-all-employees-affecting-thousands-of-jobs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has confirmed that it is laying off 3% of employees, taken from across all levels, teams and regions that the tech giant works in.</p>
<p>In what will be the biggest set of job cuts since early 2023, this will affect around 6,800 jobs –&nbsp;if we take 3% from the 228,000 strong workforce that the company had in June 2024.</p>


<p>In <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html">a statement to CNBC</a>, a Microsoft spokesperson said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.”</p>
<p>These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said, which is in contrast to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/08/microsoft-confirms-performance-based-job-cuts-across-departments.html">more targeted cuts made back in January</a>. Of course, blanket percentage job cuts couldn’t really be performance related, especially when Microsoft just announced better-than-expected quarterly results, with $24.8 billion in net income and a positive forecast.</p>
<p>That said, given the gigantic scale of the company, the number of markets that it tries to serve and how various different departments could be performing in relation to one another, some of these job cuts could serve to optimise internal structure. It just absolutely sucks that there’s seemingly no good reason for this – good quarter, bad quarter, good economic outlook, bad economic outlook, it doesn’t seem to make a difference these days.</p>

<p>For Microsoft’s now sprawling gaming empire, the impact will likely look like hundreds of job losses. Having ballooned in size thanks to the acquisitions of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard in recent years, Microsoft made job cuts over the last few years with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/25/microsoft-is-laying-off-a-staggering-1900-people-across-xbox-activision-zenimax/">1,900 job losses in early 2024</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">closed studios like Arkane and Tango Gameworks</a> (which was later rescued), split off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/01/toys-for-bob-goes-independent-but-explores-partnership-with-microsoft/">Toys For Bob</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-but-promises-no-studio-closures-or-game-cancellations/">then cut a further 650 jobs</a> last September.</p>
<p>One thing that could help preserve jobs is that a number of studios and teams within Microsoft are unionising. Following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205366/world-of-warcraft-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment">the World of Warcraft team last July</a>, and testers at Bethesda and Raven, <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922">the Overwatch team at Blizzard unionised last week</a>, meaning that the wall-to-wall team of 200 employees will be able to bargain collectively and have some ability to push back against layoffs such as this. Of course, while Microsoft should be recognised for not engaging in union-busting activities, they have also been very slow to actually respond and negotiate with these unions under their umbrella.</p>

The R-rated original live-action horror flick starring Michael B. Jordan (in two roles) brought in more than $120 million domestically over its first three weekends. <em>Sinners </em>even made more money its second weekend than its first, a very rare feat in modern Hollywood. And now it’s pulled off another impressive trick at the box office.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-200-million-domestic-box-office/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-200-million-domestic-box-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>The Wrap</em></a></span><em>,</em> <em>Sinners </em>is the first original Hollywood film to bring in over $200 million domestically since Pixar’s <em>Coco</em> in 2017.

It’s better than <em>Avatar</em> and its sequel. But in terms of sheer box office revenue, I doubt it can compete with James Cameron’s uber-blockbuster. </p><p>That doesn’t change the fact that <em>Sinners</em> is a big hit and will hopefully convince Hollywood that original movies featuring sex that star and are created by Black people can do well in 2025.

			<p>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Studios have <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/">announced</a> a Galactic Emergency, as the Illuminate have begun their "<em>true</em>" invasion, with their goal being to hit Super Earth directly.</p>
<p>The new update adds new enemies for Super Earth's defenders to squash in the name of freedom, including Stingrays, which are described as "<em>jetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky</em>," and the Crescent Overseer, which specializes in attacking Helldivers who are trying to regroup and take cover.</p>
<p>The third new enemy is the one we get the best look at in the trailer for the Galactic Emergency update, the Fleshmob, which looks like what you'd think something called 'Fleshmob' would look like. A big pile of organic matter with more arms than anyone should ever have stomping around in an unsightly manner.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Galactic Emergency Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bO9qCGVQsFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To combat these new foes, Helldivers will have new methods of customizing their weapons, with primary weapons now featuring different attachments that can be unlocked by achieving new levels for each primary weapon. Once you've hit the required level for a weapon, you can unlock the attachment through Requisition, according to the PlayStation Blog post. Customizations range from being able to adjust ammo capacity, muzzles, and add under-barrel attachments. You'll also be able to unlock new cosmetic customizations for your weapons.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Arrowhead also announced that new patterns for previously released Warbonds will be released on May 15, 2025, alongside the launch of the latest Warbond, Masters of Ceremony.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 was one of the biggest games in 2024, and one of the year's biggest surprises, since no one was looking to its release as one of the marquee launches of the year, until it launched and absolutely exploded in popularity. It is easily the biggest success story regarding Sony's live service efforts, which is interesting to note given the context that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-dev-praises-sony-for-their-creative-freedom-was-inspired-by-no-mans-skys-comeback/">as Arrowhead chief executive officer Shams Jorjani said earlier this year,</a> Sony and PlayStation have let Arrowhead steer the ship with Helldivers 2.</p>

            <p>
More than two years on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/microsoft">Microsoft's</a> last mass round of layoffs, the company is laying off a huge amount of staff once again. As reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html">CNBC</a>, the tech giant is laying off 3% of employees across the entire company, meaning all levels, teams, and geographies. While nothing has been directly confirmed as of yet, this does include the possibility that some games studios it owns will be affected too - we'll provide an update if there is one.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to CNBC, a Microsoft spokesperson said that the company will "continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace." The spokesperson also said that one objective of the layoffs is to reduce layers of management. As always, a ridiculously heartless way to frame such a thing. 
</p>

<p>
As of last June, Microsoft had around 228,000 employees, meaning a little under 7000 workers could be out of work soon. This is by far the biggest round of layoffs the company has enacted since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsofts-mass-layoffs-will-affect-starfield-halo-infinite-and-gears-of-war-developers">January 2023</a>, though 650 workers were put out of employment <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">last September too</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's absolutely worth noting that these layoffs come after Microsoft reported that their net income increased by 18% year-on-year <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/microsoft-msft-q3-earnings-report-2025.html">just this April</a>. Doesn't exactly scream a company that desperately needs to make cuts.
</p>
<p>
Again, it's unclear if any games studios under Microsoft's ownership have been affected by this decision. But as a reminder, based on the stats of an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">unofficial games industry layoffs tracker</a>, so far this year there's been an estimated 2200 jobs lost. 2024 saw around 14,600, 2023 around 10,500, and 2022 around 8500. Good luck to those affected.

A remake of the 2004 JRPG The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, this new version follows the same adventure led by Joshua and Estelle, but with 3D graphics, new gameplay mechanics, and more quality of life improvements. You can preorder the game now at a variety of retailers (<a href="https://zdcs.link/9gb1wn?object_uuid=d322f80e-b065-4000-bd5a-9ce4369dfd33&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>).

It didn’t make its way to the West until 2011, when it came out here for PlayStation Portable. The game has two direct sequels, Trails in the Sky SC and Trails in the Sky the 3rd. The overarching Legend of Heroes series spans much more time, with entries releasing between the 1980s and now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is a remake of the first entry in this sub-series. In it, you play as Estelle and Joshua, two Bracers-in-training who travel around the world, helping people in order to earn full Bracer status. The main overarching storyline revolves around the mystery of what happened to Estelle’s father, who has gone missing. The game is known for its many characters and many lines of dialogue. It’s sort of a relaxed, slow moving, hang-out game that verges on visual novel territory at times. It’s great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead of the PS1-style sprite-based graphics of the original, this remake features full 3D anime-style graphics that look basically like the Tales or Dragon Quest games. It looks pretty great, especially since the story of the original is so good. It will be nice to experience it with a more modern presentation. The original game is still available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3375780/Trails_in_the_Sky_1st_Chapter/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>.</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster-nintendo-switch-2">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-capcom-fighting-collection-2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-up-for-preorder">Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-legend-zelda-breath-wild-nintendo-switch-2">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-legend-zelda-tears-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-where-to-preorder">Mafia: The Old Country Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition-switch-2">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-super-mario-party-jamboree-jamboree-tv-nintendo-switch-2">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-pc">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

Not in real life, mind you, but in-game. And while it sounds like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>'s director is fishing for it, there hasn't been a bit on the line from Waffle House.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1922122520406458818" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>, Tekken game director Katsuhiro Harada was responding to fans still eagerly asking for a Waffle House stage in Tekken 8. It's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-director-responds-to-the-many-fans-asking-for-a-waffle-house-level">a frequent demand</a> that's gained a lot of steam as Harada himself has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-director-katsuhiro-harada-has-more-questions-about-waffle-house">expressed interest in learning more on the matter</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Harada said he "fully understands" fans' requests. So much so, in fact, that he's already been thinking about it, and apparently taken action to try and make something happen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Over the past year or more, I've actually tried to make contact through several different channels," said Harada on X/Twitter. "However, and this is purely my own speculation, I suspect that the lack of response may be due to the fact that the project I'm known for revolves around 'fighting-themed video games.'"</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>To be honest, within the bounds of what I can say, I fully understand your (you guys) request—that's precisely why I had considered taking on this challenge. In fact, I had already been thinking about it quite a while ago.</p><p>Over the past year or more, I've actually tried to make… <a href="https://t.co/Sa5oSpk2IZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Sa5oSpk2IZ</a></p></div>— Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1922122520406458818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Harada noted that "no response" equals a very rare case. He also said if using a different name or format is acceptable, as long as "the core message is maintained," then he would be willing to seriously reconsider and explore this again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it seems like Kazuya and Jin won't be settling their familial differences beneath the yellow light of a Waffle House sign anytime soon. A parody version could happen though, or an in-universe facsimile. Harada <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1922113179674345512" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested "Hustle House" in another post</a>, which isn't a bad option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tekken 8 is currently swinging into a new update with <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/tekken-8-patch-notes-v2-01" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patch 2.01</a>, after confirming the <a href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1921383478433665449" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impending addition of Fahkumram</a> to the Tekken 8 roster. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-boss-katsuhiro-harada-says-dev-team-working-around-the-clock-to-improve-tekken-8-amid-backlash-emergency-patch-planned">Back in April</a>, Harada responded to fan frustration over Tekken 8's Season 2, and said the tuning team is working "around the clock" to read feedback and work on future changes for the better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It went on to become a Bethesda tradition <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-players-show-off-its-physics-playground-by-playing-dominoes-with-books-and-sandwiches">that was continued with 2023’s Starfield and its more advanced physics</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, that tradition lives on, with one player spending seven hours lining up books to get the Dominoes chain reaction just right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1kl8pfa/someone_stole_my_video_and_uploaded_it_without/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor Muaxh03</a> uploaded the video below showing their work. We see the books slowly fall and knock the following book in a satisfying fashion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Muaxh03 said they did not use mods to place the books, rather placed them one by one, which sounds particularly grueling. They admit to spawning the books, however. The entire process took seven hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“... almost every time I loaded the save something broke, it was not reliable so yes I had to deal with books falling or glitching most of the time, that's why you can see some desynchronizing on the books, some fall slower or faster,” Muaxh03 explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NPCs were disabled, of course: “I would lose my mind if there was NPCs walking around,” Muaxh03 said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this effort is a good start for Oblivion Remastered Dominoes, previous efforts in past Bethesda games were more elaborate and involved varied objects. But playing around with books in Oblivion, even Oblivion Remastered, is a lot harder than you might think because you can’t rotate and place objects in Oblivion in the same way you can in Starfield or Skyrim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spent the first 1-2 hours trying to learn how to place them good, after that the stairs took 2-3 hours because every time I tested it, it gave me different results, every time I loaded the save something broke,” Muaxh03 said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction from Oblivion players has been universally positive, with a mix of disbelief at the time, effort, and patience that went into placing the books so precisely in a game as fiddly as Oblivion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What next? “Cool now fill a bookcase!” joked one player. “I would sooner fight a god in hand-to-hand combat unarmed. Last time I tried to put a book back the whole room ended up in shambles — SHAMBLES!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Texas Chain Saw Massacre - Nicotero Leatherface Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Gun Interactive says that it feels The Texas Chain Saw Massacre "has reached its full potential" and that it has been able to realize its future for the asymmetrical multiplayer game, allowing it to see its vision for this project toward its "natural" creative end.</p><p>"From the very beginning, we've always had a clear and concise vision for this game. We wanted to push the envelope on multiplayer asymmetrical horror, shed light on this iconic film to a newer generation, and place folks into the beautiful but macabre world of Muerto County and we feel we have achieved that," <a href="https://www.txchainsawgame.com/hub/tcsm-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the studio explained</a>.</p><p>As for the future, Gun Interactive hasn't revealed what its next project is, but it is urging fans to stay tuned.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-hollywoods-iconic-monsters-kicked-off-a-horror-game-revolution/1100-6527506/">One of several asymmetrical multiplayer games based on a horror movie IP</a>, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre stands apart from other games by utilizing a 4v3 structure for its gameplay, forcing survivors to keep an eye out for the chainsaw-wielding Leatherface and his homicidal family. An authentic recreation of the classic slasher movie--right down to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-texas-chain-saw-devs-went-to-extreme-lengths-to-recreate-leatherface-chainsaw/1100-6511374/" data-ref-id="1100-6511374">Leatherface's signature chainsaw</a>--the game was well-received at launch.</p><p>"As one of the year's scariest and best-designed experiences, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has reset the bar for multiplayer horror games," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre review</a>. While the game will still live on with the dedicated fans who regularly play it, the same can't be said for Evil Dead: The Game, as after a brief run, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evil-dead-the-game-has-been-mysteriously-delisted-from-several-storefronts/1100-6531206/">it was pulled from digital storefronts</a> by publisher Boss Team Games.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-at-20-is-the-same-and-increasingly-unrecognizable-and-thats-by-design/1100-6527983/" data-ref-id="1100-6527983">turned 20 last year</a>, and now one of its most viral moments, Leeroy Jenkins, has too.</p><p dir="ltr">The video, originally uploaded to the WoW forums but gaining more traction on May 11, 2005 when it was uploaded to <a href="https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=1666" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Warcraftmovies.com</a>, shows a guild of WoW players in voice chat looking to conquer the Rookery room in the game's Upper Black Rock Spire raid. After going over an elaborate battle plan with a "32.33, repeating of course, percentage of survival," one AFK player, a paladin named Leeroy Jenkins, bolts up and shouts "Time's up, let's do this! Leeeeroyyyy Jenkinsssss!" He runs into the adjacent room and aggroes every dragonkin in sight. Chaos ensues and internet history is made.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mLyOj_QD4a4?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Leeroy Jenkins instantly became an internet icon and helped cement WoW in the public consciousness, his name becoming a call to arms for anyone who was about to do something with gusto without thinking about the consequences. The video has been watched tens of millions of times in the last two decades and became a viral sensation at a time when the modern internet as we know it was still in its infancy (YouTube, for example, was just a few months old at the time of the original video). An <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4&amp;t=2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HD reupload</a> of the video posted to YouTube in 2014 has racked up 26 million views alone.</p><p dir="ltr">That the whole video is staged is beside the point. The comedic writing and timing (and the absolutely absurd strategy of trying to clear out the Rookery room, rather than just avoiding the eggs entirely) was always too good to be true even before the folks behind the video openly admitted it.</p><p dir="ltr">But that is what makes the video so funny and also makes those early days of WoW so special. Here was a time before every raid strategy was known and when players hadn't quite min-maxed the fun out of encounters like this. Leeroy Jenkins blew up not because it was real, but because it was, despite its over-the-top nature, still believable as something that could happen if you joined a random UBRS group of well-meaning idiots. Such was the beauty of WoW's earliest days--something that developer Blizzard looked to recapture with its launch of WoW Classic in 2019.</p><p dir="ltr">References to Leeroy Jenkins would go on to appear in everything from a Jeopardy! question to episodes of Family Guy and How I Met Your Mother. Blizzard has immortalized Leeroy Jenkins in a number of different ways too, including an official NPC who was added to the game during the Warlords of Draenor expansion and more recently played a role in WoW's in-game 20th anniversary event. He is also on various Hearthstone cards, and Blizzard even reward's WoW players with a special title, "Jenkins," for succeeding in UBRS where Leeroy and his group failed.</p><p dir="ltr">Leeroy Jenkins continues to be an important reminder of what kind of hilarity can ensue when players don't take games too seriously and instead live in the moment. Even though his group failed miserably (on purpose), Leeroy's final words in the video still ring true today. Even in the face of ridicule and adversity, it's the fun we had along the way and the little things that matter. After all, at least he has chicken.</p>
