            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magpie-games-and-failbetter-games-announces-official-fallen-london-ttrpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Failbetter Games has announced a crowdfunding campaign for <em>Fallen London</em>. The campaign isn't for a videogame spin-off but an official <em>Fallen London TTRPG</em> being developed alongside Magpie Games.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fallen London TTRPG</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>The <em>Fallen London TTRPG</em> was announced <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/failbettergames.bsky.social/post/3lgx6srhssc2a" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Bluesky Social</a> by the official Failbetter Games account. It announced that the Kickstarter campaign will go live on February 11th at 10 AM ET.</p>

This guide contains six premade characters, the core rules, and a playable adventure titled "The Disappearance of the Transfigured Poet."</p>

<p>The official Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magpiegames/fallen-london-the-roleplaying-game" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> promotes additional incentives for the <em>Fallen London TTRPG</em>. In addition to several physical products, the core rulebook, a GM screen, custom six-sided dice, etc., stretch goals include digital items for your character in the Fallen London browser game. Lastly, those who back the campaign in the first 48 hours will get a physical Devilbone Die at no additional charge.</p>

However, given Magpie's track record of adapting properties like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/avatar-legends-republic-city-supplement-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/root-tabletop-rpg-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Root</em></a>, there's a good chance it will use the Powered by The Apocalypse system. A mechanically light, story and character-centric system where players just roll 2d6 to resolve challenges.</p>

<p><em>Fallen London</em> made its debut in 2009, originally under the name <em>Echo Bazaar</em>, as a browser-based interactive narrative game. The game was packed with branching story decisions, involved <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallen-london-to-conclude-ambition-storylines" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ambition Quests</a>, and in-depth worldbuilding of a version of Victorian London that had sunken into a vast cavern under the Earth called the Neath.</p>

<p>In this new suberranean home, London changed into something twisted. The city streets twisted into a labyrinth, inhuman creatures arrived trading in esoteric goods like human souls. and even physical law itself has faded in this state of darkness. The original experience is still receiving new quests and updates to this day.</p>

<p>Alongside the impressive longevity of this main game, Failbetter Games has developed other titles set in the Fallen London universe. These include the shipfaring horror game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sunless-sea-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sunless Sea</em></a>, the sequel <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/sunless-skies-fallen-london-anniversary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sunless Skies</em></a>, and the visual novel <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mask-of-rose-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mark of the Rose</em></a>.</p>

It’s since been followed by survival sim <em>Grounded </em>and the Renaissance detective RPG <em>Pentiment</em>, with <em>Avowed</em> arriving next month and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> expected by the end of the year. The studio has also been helping the <em>State of Decay 3</em> team with its open world tech. That’s a lot!</p><p>While Gonzalez was quick to silence fan speculation that he might be working on a long-requested <em>Fallout: New Vegas </em>sequel, which wouldn’t have been completely shocking considering what transpired in the first season of the <em>Fallout </em>TV show, it’ll be interesting to see what he does end up working on at Obsidian. Will it be the team’s next big RPG franchise, or a completely different genre mash-up that explores new territory for the studio? I’ll be happy with whatever it might be, as long as it arrives sometime this decade. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>BioWare’s headcount is . According to a new report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, the company now sits at less than 100 employees after having over 200 people just two years ago.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODM1MTgzMSwiZXhwIjoxNzM4OTU2NjMxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUVlXVThUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.91ztnslkcG02JwTwRRfVCXIJp8FOdqGBjCNQgz-bE8k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The report says</a> that a number of employees who were put “temporarily” on new teams were informed that those moves were permanent. No longer were they BioWare employees helping out in a different area. </p>



<p>Schreier’s report also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-bioware-employees-worried-about-more-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-bioware-employees-worried-about-more-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corroborates </a>Insider Gaming’s exclusive report that “dozens” of people were let go as part of this wave of layoffs at the studio.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“If they want to work at BioWare again in the future, they would have to look for job openings and re-apply,” Schreier writes. He adds that, for now at least, a small team will  work on the next game in the Mass Effect series. This team is being led by “company veteran who oversaw the development on the original trilogy as well as on 2019’s&nbsp;Anthem”. The goal is to then expand as needed later on in production.</p>







<p>As sources told Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-moves-some-employees-to-other-ea-projects-while-developing-mass-effect-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">after the memo</a> from BioWare was released, there is still an internal evaluation being done in order to see where things can be improved. There is still a worry from those who spoke under the condition of anonymity that more layoffs and moves within the studio are coming.</p>



<p>Neither EA nor BioWare have responded to multiple requests for comment on the state of things at the studio.</p>

Australia-based Twitch streamer Lance McDonald first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0tqppZDYxw">developed the mod back in 2020</a> before <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1359037954576928769?mx=2">making it available to download in 2021</a>. Lance <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1885347693125566806">announced today in a post on X</a> that Sony Interactive Entertainment asked them to remove download links for the patch.</p></div><p>The hack’s sole purpose was to get <em>Bloodborne </em>running at a smoother 60 fps with improved frame pacing. FromSoftware originally released <em>Bloodborne</em> back in 2015 for the PlayStation 4, and the game has always been locked at 30 fps with occasional stuttering from inconsistent pacing (the 30 frames within each second were not always on-screen for equal amounts of time). The beloved game’s graphical limitations have persisted even on the PS4 Pro and while playing it via backwards compatibility on the PlayStation 5.</p><p>Lance’s mod has received its share of testing and praise from the “Soulsbourne” community that covet FromSoftware games but wish their technical and graphical chops were more cutting-edge. This includes being spotlighted by creators like Digital Foundry, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hDIvDPRcPA">interviewed McDonald about his hack back in 2020</a>, used his mod to make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOn2ludP6gM">a 4K / 60 fps representation on PS5 using AI upscaling</a>, and recently published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zjzBbdl7hk"><em>Bloodborne</em> PS4 emulation video</a> that really juices up the performance and has an extra-spicy video thumbnail aimed squarely at Sony.</p><p>For years, the most rabid of <em>Bloodborne </em>fans have been quick to jump at any <em>Bloodborne</em>-related news as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173905/sony-teases-bloodborne-in-astros-playroom-update-hours-ahead-of-summer-game-fest">a potential clue</a> to an upcoming, long-awaited remake. And in this case, it only takes a short scroll of McDonald’s replies on his post to see people speculating that this takedown means Sony <em>must </em>be nearing some kind of announcement in time for the 10-year anniversary of <em>Bloodborne’s</em> release. Or, perhaps, Sony is just taking a page from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Nintendo’s playbook</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Clash, introduced in season 12, is <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s newest game mode. As director Aaron Keller describes it, the mode was inspired by the original hero shooter’s two-point capture maps, and was meant to give players a mode in which they could shift rapidly between attacking and defending objectives. After feedback from players, however, Blizzard has decided to temporarily remove it from the game’s ranked play in season 15.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,196049" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In a new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24167662/director-s-take-looking-back-and-looking-ahead/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24167662/director-s-take-looking-back-and-looking-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Director’s Take blog</a></span>, Keller says that the team wants to reexamine the Clash mode and see if it can make it feel more fair. He notes in his write-up that the mode feels unbalanced compared to the rest in the game. If one team manages to steamroll another and keep that momentum going, a Clash match can end almost as quickly as it began. This is unlike most <em>Overwatch 2</em> modes in which, even if you start the match on the wrong foot, you feel like regrouping with your team for a coordinated push can still win you the round. While the team sorts out what changes it wants to make, Clash will stay in quickplay rotation, meaning you can still play the mode if you’re not trying to climb up the ranks. Fans seem pretty jazzed about this, as several have found Clash to be lopsided and frustrating. Keller’s full explanation reads as follows:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Speaking of game modes, we want to take a moment on what to expect for Clash in Quick Play and Competitive. This past year, we introduced Clash, which was inspired by the original Assault maps, but gave players a chance to attack and defend throughout the course of the match. Clash has had some really good matches, but we’ve also seen a lot of constructive feedback. Right now, Clash has a few problems, with some matches having a team steamroll and ending much faster than a typical <em>Overwatch</em> game. It can also be confusing as to which point is active for some players. So starting in Season 15, Clash maps are going to be removed out of Competitive Play, as we take the time to look at these maps and work to find ways to deliver the best Competitive experience for all of our players. We’ll keep you updated on the progress we make there. In the meantime, we are going to keep Clash in Quick Play and other unranked game modes. </p></blockquote><p><em>Overwatch 2</em>’s 15th season begins on February 18, which will be shortly after Blizzard hosts the <em>Overwatch 2 </em>Spotlight event on February 12.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/multiversus-will-go-offline-only-after-season-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Warner Bros. is holding up the cartoon white flag and saying “That’s all Folks!” to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>, with support for the character-filled brawler coming to an end after Season 5 on 30th May 2025. On that date, the game will be removed from online stores and servers will be shut down, but it will still be playable offline.</p>
<p>All online features will run up until 30th May at 9AM PST (5PM UK time), after which point the game will be playable offline only, with solo AI battles or couch multiplayer with up to four players.</p>


<p>In order to keep the game accessible, you must play and log in at some time during Season 5 – from 4th February to 30th May – which will create the necessary save file and online account links to allow you to play offline with all earned and purchased content.</p>
<p>As a precursor to the game’s shutdown, real money purchases have been taken down from today. You can no longer purchase Gleamium, though it and character tokens can be used through to the server shutdown.</p>
<p>For more information, you can visit the <a href="https://go.wbgames.com/MVSFAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MultiVersus Season 5 FAQ.</a></p>

<p>The MultiVersus team at Player First Games wrote a little thank you at the end of the announcement:</p>
<p>Most importantly, we want to thank every player and person who has ever played or supported MultiVersus. All of us on the Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games teams have poured our heart and soul into this game. We will be forever grateful for the incredible support of the MultiVersus community throughout this journey.​</p>
<p>&nbsp;​We hope that you all enjoy the final Season of MultiVersus.</p>
<p>MultiVersus burst onto the scene in 2022, offering a Super Smash Bros. contender filled with characters drawn from across the Warner Bros. media empire. However, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/27/multiversus-open-beta-already-smashing-steam-records/">after an initial surge of popularity for the open beta</a>, the rapidly growing community started to highlight gameplay deficiencies and developer Player First Games struggled to keep up, while also producing all the regular content that a free-to-play live service needs.</p>
<p>So the game was pulled from storefronts, instead of trying to roll through to a full release, and only reappeared last year.&nbsp;While the revamp has certainly benefitted MultiVersus in some respects, Miguel wasn’t overly enamoured by the game’s return last month <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/multiversus-2024-preview-back-but-is-it-better/">in his write-up</a>. On one hand some of the game’s rough edges have been rounded off and the inclusion of singleplayer/co-op content helps bolster the overall MultiVersus package. However, the reduced tempo of combat has proven divisive and when it comes to monetisation, the game is no less aggressive.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. admitted in financial reports that MultiVersus’ revival had underperformed expectations, so alongside <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/">the end of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, the writing was on the wall.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping Player First Games get the opportunity to craft something new and fun.</p>

			<p>It's not been a secret that the games market has been struggling for a while now, with there being constant layoffs and studio closures all across the globe, whether it be from people not playing the games, not wanting them, or just simply being unable to afford them. It's becoming increasingly common that games are getting more expensive, meaning people may not be able to find the money to purchase them, especially in a cost-of-living crisis. Despite these factors, it's been said that the games market will grow by 4.6% in one with inflation. This information comes from <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MiDiA Research</a>'s Global Games Forecasts.</p>
<p>One of the key points that is mentioned is that the games market is mature, so it is highly unlikely that it will ever experience double-digit growth, and instead, the industry will only see slight growth during this period. It's also estimated that software revenues will continue to grow thanks to massive premium releases coming out this year. This includes Grand Theft Auto 6, Monster Hunter Wilds, and the games that will be released for the Nintendo Switch 2 when that inevitably releases.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, there are a ton of live-service games, with major developers deciding to try their luck with live-service games and not having the expected outcome. This has happened with multiple titles, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/">Concord</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/">MultiVersus</a>. However, it's predicted that instead of developing live-service games, developers will go back to premium games, with in-game spending decreasing to 67% near 2031.</p>
<p>"It is time to say goodbye to "survive 'til 25" and hello to "stick 'til 26" and beyond, but with tempered expectations for future growth in this mature market. The market (again, also including hardware, software, and subscriptions) will grow from $236.9 billion in 2025 to $280.1 billion in 2031," says Rhys Elliott, Games Analyst at MiDiA Research.</p>
<p>While there will always be a debate within the gaming community about whether mobile gaming makes you a gamer, mobile continues to do a significant amount of lifting for software revenue, with 54% of all software revenue coming from mobile games. The significant premium games being released this year will also be a huge boost for revenue, especially with games like Monster Hunter Wilds, Civilization VII, and Assassin's Creed Shadows all being released in Q1.</p>
<p>"Things will continue to be difficult in the games market, and these challenging market conditions mean developers are being forced to think smarter to succeed. Luckily, the industry is teeming with some of the smartest, most creative, and passionate minds in the world," says Elliott.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since James Gunn became the new boss of DC studios, it feels like he sticks to one formula: everything looks like his Suicide Squad.&nbsp;</p><p>2008, the year of the housing crisis and the subsequent Great Recession, is as good a time of death as any for the fiction of the American Dream. Economic forces manipulated by kleptocrats have completely unbalanced our received wisdom that anyone, regardless of their station and prestige, was afforded the opportunity to rise to success. But you can’t really kill a dream in America; you can only commodify it. That same year, the American Dream was reborn, repurposed, and repackaged by corporate America. Not for people, but for a new promise that any <em>property, </em>afforded the opportunity, could rise to prominence.&nbsp;</p><p>Marvel Studios’ “Avengers Initiative” was a project built from necessity. Facing bankruptcy in the 90s, Stan Lee and pals found themselves selling off the film rights to their most successful characters<em>—</em>Spider-Man, X-Men, the Fantastic Four<em>—</em>just to stay afloat. All they were left with once they had the chance to make a go of it themselves were the B-Stringers: an alcoholic tech bro, an Allied Propaganda mascot, a technically public domain anyway Norse god, a Hulk. To everyone’s multi-billion dollar surprise, they made it work. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">They made it work so well that it kind of ruined movies.</a> But, significantly, it defeated the conventional comic book movie wisdom that to make a huge runaway hit, you needed a Superman or a Batman. Maybe you could build your empire on some weird little freak nobody’s even heard of. But how weird, how freaky, can we really get here?</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>James Gunn became one of the most successful men in Hollywood today answering that question. Coming up with the proudly sophomoric and sloppy underdogs of Troma Entertainment (think <em>Toxic Avenger</em>), he made his studio bones on a couple pretty decent <em>Scooby-Doo </em>movies, and proved his superhero bona fides on the pitch black Rainn Wilson and Elliot Page comedy <em>Super, </em>which does a better job of being a <em>Watchmen </em>movie than Zack Snyder’s <em>Watchmen</em>. So it was only a matter of time before Marvel Cinematic Universe mastermind Kevin Feige, known so well today for his modus operandi of taking promising, unique independent filmmakers and chaining them like Prometheus to his studio system, tapped him to make something Marvel.&nbsp;</p><p>Feige had been talking in public about adapting the rather obscure ragtag Marvel space heroes, the “Guardians of the Galaxy,” since at least 2010 during that year’s San Diego Comic-Con. Though the team had existed in some form or another since 1969, the version of the team that Feige was interested in—the one we’d see at the movies—was brand new. The Guardians as we know them, Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket Raccoon, didn’t actually exist as a team anywhere until 2008, in a series relaunch by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. No stranger to working as the underdog, it was just the project where James Gunn would thrive.</p><p>How DC got their hand on that ball was a matter of some cancel culture serendipity. During the space between the second and third <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>movies, <a href="https://deadline.com/2018/07/james-gunn-fired-guardians-of-the-galaxy-disney-offensive-tweets-1202430392/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some outrageously tasteless tweets</a> James Gunn wrote ten years prior resurfaced. Disney, the owners of the Marvel Studios brand since 2009, cut ties with Gunn over it for about a week<em>—</em>just long enough for DC’s own parent company, Warner Bros., to swoop in with their own Guardians-caliber offer. But who were DC’s equivalent to Marvel’s scrappy Guardians of the Galaxy?</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="THE SUICIDE SQUAD – Official Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jz1FrtMIh5c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>That was was a puzzle DC had already solved, poorly but accurately, with the Academy Award winning 2016 <em>Suicide Squad </em>(Best Makeup and Hairstyling). The influences Gunn had on what Warner Bros. wanted their Suicide Squad to be were apparent to anyone with eyes, ears, or a short term memory: the needle dropping soundtrack, the gleeful gore, the often puerile comedy. But without Gunn himself, the film had none of the heart, or sense of character. Unlike the Guardians, the Squad as we know them today—give or take a Harley—has existed with its current premise since 1986. And as fortune would have it, they’re even better suited to Feige’s original hail mary casting of the Guardians for unleashing the spigot on that IP-flowing fountain. Because that’s exactly what they were designed for 40 years ago.</p><p>Here’s something I often find myself writing when we’re talking about comics: let’s go back to <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths. </em>In 1985, DC Comics published their first major crossover event to clear the decks on 50 years of crufted up comic book continuity, all to present a less intimidating face to new readers. One benefit of this was, with nearly every character starting over on equal footing, it didn’t just have to be Batman and Superman rising to the fore. There were new opportunities for the thousands of characters starting fresh right alongside them. It was to this end that John Ostrander and Len Wein created a new vehicle to showcase the obscurities of DC’s roster, giving them new cause to get in front of readers’ eyes: a new, Post-Crisis incarnation of the Suicide Squad.</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>The original Suicide Squad, a team which appeared in issues of <em>The Brave and the Bold </em>in the late 50s and early 60s, wasn’t much more than a riff on Jack Kirby’s Challengers of the Unknown. But in the 1986 <em>Legends </em>miniseries, setting up much of the early status quo for the Post-Crisis DC Universe, Wein and Ostrander took the concept in an entirely new direction—one which, under the complex, authoritative figure of Amanda Waller, would feature a rotating team of cast-off villains, forgotten heroes, and former supporting characters. Not just the likes of lesser Batman and Flash villains like Deadshot and Captain Boomerang, but heroes like Vixen, whose own solo title was preemptively aborted in a 1978 industry crunch; Bronze Tiger, blaxploitation martial arts sidekick to Dennis O’Neil’s <em>Richard Dragon, Kung-Fu Fighter</em>; Enchantress, a former backup feature to Supergirl; and Nightshade, part of a collection of characters recently acquired from the defunct Charlton Comics which DC sought to integrate into their own Post-Crisis universe.</p><p>The resulting spin-off, 1987’s <em>Suicide Squad, </em>thus became one of the most versatile titles in DC’s catalog. Amanda Waller’s nuanced morality allowed for the team, depending on its roster, to take on missions from either side of the morality spectrum at any level of scale, from quelling small town white nationalists to grappling with the forces of Darkseid on Apokolips. Following in the tradition of the Golden Age Justice Society of America, whose <em>All-Star Comics </em>in the 1940s was functionally a home for heroes to stay in the spotlight without titles to call their own, <em>Suicide Squad </em>literally served as a rehabilitation clinic not just in fiction as sentence-reducing labor for its incarcerated members, but for the images of those characters themselves, elevating what might have once been a C or a D list character as high as a B. As Iron Man—nobody’s favorite superhero before 2008—would prove to the world, a B is really all you need.</p><p>So, James Gunn does <em>The Suicide Squad, </em>a loose sequel to the previous non-definite articled <em>Suicide Squad </em>that doesn’t require you to watch the first film at all. Not a lot of people watched this one either, but most were charitable in affording that to the continued horrors of a deadly pandemic, and HBO Max’s short-sighted year long “Same Day Streaming” policy which had filmmakers none too pleased. Critically, it was the fifth-best reviewed DC film of all time.</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>If anything made <em>The Suicide Squad </em>work, it was the massive number of weirdos at play. Some pulled from the deepest benches of DC history, like Javelin and The Weasel; some invented for the story, like The Detachable Kid and Ratcatcher 2. Like the first movie, much of it revolved around Harley Quinn—a character who was at first controversially associated with the Suicide Squad franchise in the 2011 “New 52” comic relaunch, and 14 years later is still more often than not the series star. Unlike the previous film, <em>The Suicide Squad </em>gave emotional arcs to its less prominent players. The likes of Polka-Dot Man, King Shark, and even the generally Squad-ubiquitous but dry-toast-bland Rick Flag all got their own beats that elevated them into new favorites.</p><p>One character, a comic relief turned third act villain, would be the focus of Gunn’s next DC project. John Cena’s Peacemaker was credibly both hilarious and threatening, but we never got to know the man under the helmet like we did the other central members of the team. The legend goes that Gunn spent one week during production of <em>The Suicide Squad </em>banging out a full 8 episode script for a <em>Peacemaker </em>TV show. It was greenlit right away.</p><p>The internet loved <em>Peacemaker</em>, with its <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/peacemaker-dance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modern dance intro</a> and stream-of-consciousness dialogue. But despite the title, Gunn always insisted that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/peacemaker-was-a-comic-book-show-in-all-the-right-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Peacemaker </em>was an ensemble piece</a>. And it was! Just as important as Peacemaker’s own story arc reckoning with his Neo-Nazi father who pushed him into vigilantism is his brilliant supporting cast of Amanda Waller’s estranged daughter, Leota Adebayo; put-upon Belle Reve warden turned problem asset babysitter John Economos; disguised alien agent on the side of humanity, Clemson Murn; James Gunn’s wife, who is fine; and an autistically swagged up incarnation of Marv Wolfman’s Vigilante. James Gunn had created another Suicide Squad.</p><figure><figcaption>The Suicide Squad/Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure><p>In 2022, as we were all still doing the <em>Peacemaker </em>cast’s “Do You Wanna Taste It” dance, Warner Bros. did something extremely rare: they made a good decision. With the future direction of the DC cinematic universe in shambles after power plays from Zack Snyder, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and a seemingly endless cascade of otherwise bad reviews, the corporate leadership turned to the one guy who, if you at least looked at it accepting the outside influence of a pandemic, hadn’t fucked it all up. Along with his established business partner Peter Safran, James Gunn was put in charge of what would now be called “DC Studios.” Where none had really existed before, Gunn and Safran would be DC’s own Kevins Feige.</p><p>James Gunn got to work announcing a full slate of new DC projects. The very first would be an animated series which just wrapped up on HBO Max: <em>Creature Commandos</em>, a series about a team of misfit monsters embarking on a suicide mission for Amanda Waller<em>. </em>It was yet another Suicide Squad. He announced a film adaptation of Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch’s <em>The Authority, </em>a team of morally ambiguous superhumans who do the things heroes won’t. Another Suicide Squad. Even <em>Superman</em>, the live action film DC has pinned all its hopes on as the ground claimed by superhero movies for a decade gives way to video game movies, is full of weird superheroes: Hawkgirl, Metamorpho, Mister Terrific, and Guy Gardner, the most obnoxious Green Lantern. Anyone familiar with the mythology of the Justice League can recognize what Gunn is doing: setting up his own simulacrum of Keith Giffen and JM DeMatteis’ most irreverent vision of the team, Justice League International, a collective of third-stringers cast in the shadow of the more famous heroes they couldn’t get. That’s right. It’s another Suicide Squad.</p><p>So why does this keep happening? Is it the only move Gunn has? I don’t think so. He’s proven himself a more versatile filmmaker than that. But imagine you’re wagering hundreds of millions of dollars on the success of a film. That’s going to make it difficult to break the mold, and make a risky decision. You’re going to stick with what works until it doesn’t. And so far, at least critically, what seems to work for Gunn is Suicide Squads. We’ll see if that bears out in real dollars, but it’s a better bet than a complete unknown.</p><p>From a creative standpoint, it’s not a bad thing either. The best thing about DC Comics, when it gets out of its own way, is that it’s not actually the Batman and Superman Company. It’s a publishing house filled with strange, imaginative, often contradictory characters and concepts, which really buzzes at its best when you get those A-Listers out of the way. There are 30,000 freaks and weirdos who live together in this universe created by hundreds of creative voices over 90 years of work, and the absurdity of their coexistence compounds that exponentially. This is comics. It’s Suicide Squad.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/does-elon-musks-gaming-rig-suck-or-not"><h3>I Am Disgusted By Elon Musk’s Gaming Setup</h3></a><p>Watching these streams hurt me but I have to know: is one of the wealthiest men on earth using a mediocre streaming setup?</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/god-is-a-geek-calvin-robinson-nazi-salute-elon-musk"><h3>God Is A Geek Staff Quits Following Ex-Priest Owner’s Nazi Salute</h3></a><p>"It will be hard to start again ... but this is the right thing to do"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Fortnite OG has officially entered the next phase, going into Chapter 1, Season 2. There have been some re-added points of interest that are bound to get the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-og-sees-a-million-active-players-in-first-20-minutes/">nostalgia flowing</a> for those long-term Fortnite players, while others will get to experience the beginning of Fortnite for the first time. This, of course, includes places like Tilted Towers and Shifty Shafts. <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/go-full-tilt-into-fortnite-og-chapter-1-season-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other memorable areas</a>, such as Junk Junction, Haunted Hills, and Snobby Shores, have returned to the game after being gone for a while. If you want to see what to expect from the new season, you can check it out in the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Go Full Tilt - Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 2 is Live!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9b543Z6aus?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since it's a new season, a new battle pass comes along with it. The all-new OG Pass is out, offering players 45 tiers of rewards that are based on iconic moments throughout Chapter 1 Season 2. This includes items that are inspired by Sparkle Specialist and Black Knight, which were outfits that OG players would have been able to get in the original Chapter 1 Season 2 Battle Pass. It also includes the Cuddle Team Leader, which was an outfit that first came out during Chapter 1 Season 2.</p>
<p>This battle pass functions exactly the same as the other battle passes that are available in the game. You just have to play the game and get XP in any Fortnite experience, which will then add up and allow you to claim rewards across the battle pass. The OG pass is a single track combining both free and premium rewards. You can either purchase the pass for 1,000 V-Bucks or get it by subscribing to Fortnite Crew. The Season ends on March 25, giving you plenty of time to get your games in and unlock the rewards on the pass.</p>
<p>The loot pool has been expanded, introducing gear from the classic Chapter 1 Season 2, including items such as Cozy Campfire, Chug Jug, and Suppressed Pistol.</p>
<p>Alongside this event, the Valentine 2025 update has gone live in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life, where you can wander around town spreading love and gaining the ability to earn a Cupid's Surprise. You can also get Flowers, Love Letters, and Heart Wands as gifts to give out. This update also comes with new daily activities that you can participate in. The<a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/lego-fortnite-brick-life-the-valentines-2025-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> full details</a> have been posted on the official Fortnite website, where you can read all about it. The Valentine's event is due to end on February 21.</p>

                <p>Just over four years ago, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-acquires-esports-tournament-platform-smashgg/1100-6485077/" data-ref-id="1100-6485077">purchased the esports tournament organizing platform</a> Start.gg, which was then known as Smash.gg before its rebranding. Now, Start.gg has announced that Microsoft no longer owns the site and stated that it will "be returning to its roots as an independent company supporting grassroots and professional esports communities."</p><p>Chris Ogle--the co-founder of Smash.gg--shared the news on <a href="https://blog.start.gg/start-gg-returns-to-its-roots-816f31962d3b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Medium</a> and thanked Microsoft and Xbox for their support. He also noted that the site will continue with members from the original Smash.gg team alongside "grassroots tournament organizers, and engineers who are passionate about improving the platform for the communities we support."</p><p>One of the biggest changes going forward is that starting on February 14, Start.gg will be charging a registration fee to support the expenses of running the site. In addition to making that change for the sustainability of the business, Start.gg will be upgrading its user interface and tournament support.</p><p>"Since our inception back in 2015, our goal has always been to foster esports communities around the games people love to play," wrote Ogle. "This goal remains at the heart of everything we do, and we look forward to continuing our journey with you."</p><p>Despite some downward trends in the gaming industry, esports remain popular.

<p>The Call of Duty League’s Major I tournament is unravelling in Madrid as we speak. It’s the first major CDL event in Europe in several years, and the fans are <strong>electric</strong>. One player who wants to see more events in Europe is OpTic Texas’ Shotzzy, who I caught up with after OpTic’s close win over LA Guerrillas M8.</p>



<p>It has been <strong>many years </strong>since Call of Duty esports (outside of Warzone) landed in London, but that’s a fan – and a player – favourite for a future event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-love-the-eu-crowd">‘I Love The EU Crowd’</h2>



<p>Speaking after a 3 – 2 win over LAG that was closer than many people expected, Shotzzy revealed his love for the EU crowd:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I love the EU crowd, they’re insane. I love y’all.</p>



<p>I will say you guys are definitely the better crowd than NA, but obviously we love NA, so.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When I probed and asked if Shotzzy wanted to go anywhere else in Europe, he revealed: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d say London. I had a really bad interview back then, in London, so I’ve got to get my get back.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>OpTic’s Huke, who started with the team following Pred’s sudden departure last year, mirrored Shotzzy’s sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think the EU crowd is crazy, I’m not going to lie – in a good way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>OpTic Texas came into Major I as the first seed, but a 2 – 3 loss handed down by the Miami Heretics (damn that curse) sent the team into the elimination bracket. Following a win over LAG M8, OpTic now moves forward to face the Carolina Royal Ravens.</p>



<p>At the first CDL Minor tournament, the Royal Ravens forcefully ejected OpTic Texas from the running, before being promptly eliminated by FaZe. Could this be an opportunity for OpTic Texas to, as Shotzzy puts it, ‘get their get back’?</p>



<p>Stay tuned for more of the latest news from the CDL Major I tournament in Madrid.</p>

Just put your reticle directly on the enemy’s upper head to ensure you splatter their brain matter.</li><li><strong>Eye</strong> - Since you’re probably going to be aiming for the head frequently, you’re almost certain to hit some eyeballs along the way. If not, this is pretty self-explanatory, so just line up a soldier’s peeper and blast away.</li><li><strong>Heart</strong> - It might come as a surprise that Nazis have a heart, but you should still explode ‘em. Line up your shot slightly left-of-center on their chest to make it happen.</li><li><strong>Lung</strong> - The lungs are located on each side of the chest wall, so you’re all but certain to score plenty of shots on them when aiming for center mass.</li><li><strong>Intestine</strong> - The intestines can be hit by aiming just below the belly button and just above the crotch. Also, gross.</li><li><strong>Stomach</strong> - The stomach holds all the bile that Nazis spew, so let’s burst it. You can find this one in the upper left abdomen. If you aim a bit too high, you’ll score a lung shot, though, so this one may take some practice.</li><li><strong>Liver</strong> - The liver is located in the upper right abdomen. As with the stomach, aiming too high can result in a lung shot, so just keep at it until you figure out just the right spot.</li><li><strong>Kidney</strong> - The kidneys are located on the left and right sides of the lower abdomen. These are tiny little organs and require a pinpoint shot. Just aim right above the butt on either side and you’ll eventually get one.</li><li><strong>Testicle</strong> - Yes, you can shoot Nazis in the balls. Aim directly at their crotch and fire away. Since Nazis have such pathetic little baby nuts, this one could take a bit of time to perfect, but it’s worth it for the killcam.</li></ul><p>When you’ve shot every organ in the game, you’ll earn yourself the “Open Surgery” trophy or achievement for being such a damn good sharpshooter. Reward yourself by shooting more Nazis.</p><hr><p><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em> is available now on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Windows PCs via Steam.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Welcome everyone to Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast for January 31, 2025. In this week’s episode: Xbox is doubling down on multiplatform releases, Battlefield doesn’t want to screw up again, and the layoffs continue across the games industry.</p>



<p>Mike, Grant, and Albert also play quick gaming trivia that Grant may or may not have been prepared for. Oh, and Tom Henderson joins to talk about the latest gaming rumors and speculation regarding Ubisoft (again), the next God of War game being set in Egypt, and even Marvel Rivals’ developers hiding fake characters in the game in order to catch leakers.</p>
