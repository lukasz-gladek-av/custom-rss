            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cards-against-humanity-sues-spacex-for-15-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tabletop gaming and major tech companies are brushing against one another. The publisher of the popular card game, Cards Against Humanity, has filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk's company SpaceX for trespassing on private property they have purchased.</p>

<p>According to a report <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/elon-musks-spacex-sued-by-cards-against-humanity-alleged-trespassing-texas/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by CBS</a>, <em>Cards Against Humanity</em> filed a lawsuit this week in Texas court towards SpaceX. It alleges that SpaceX treated a vacant plot of land in Cameron County owned by <em>Cards Against Humanity</em> as its own for the past six months.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cards-against-humanity-card-artwork.jpg?itok=i_IqXiZP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cards-against-humanity-card-artwork.jpg?itok=nq4mtkGh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The lawsuit continues stating SpaceX has been acquiring other plots of land near the property and has been placing construction materials, gravel, and other debris on that land without asking permission to do so. According to the company, the land even has a "no trespassing" sign.</p>
<p>The company is asking for $15 million in damages, including a vegetation loss on the land.</p>
<p><em>Cards Against Humanity</em> purchased the vacant plot of land in 2017. In an official post titled "<a href="https://www.cardsagainsthumanitysavesamerica.com/"><em>Cards Against Humanity</em> Saves America</a>," the company explains the purchase of the land was to help prevent former US President Donald Trump from building a wall on the US/Mexico border.</p>
<p>The post explains that 150,000 people paid $15 each to purchase the vacant border land. In addition, they retained a law firm specialized in eminent domain. This would make any effort to claim the land as expensive and time-consuming as possible.</p>
<p>For a company known for making a notoriously raunchy party game packed with dark jokes, this gesture cemented the company's reputation of mischievous philanthropy. Another example is when they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/us-news-blog/2012/dec/19/cards-against-humanity-wikimedia">donated $70,000</a> to the WIkipedia Foundation in 2012.</p>
<p>That mischief may now be legally plaguing another highly contentious billionaire seven years after the fact.</p>
<p>SpaceX has not officially responded to this lawsuit at time of writing.</p>

The show reportedly has Chris Mundy (<em>Ozark</em>), Damon Lindelof (<em>Watchmen</em>, <em>Lost</em>) and comics writer Tom King signed on, with filming aiming to start early next year. </p><p>This would be by far the biggest role Chandler has landed since starring in <em>Friday Night Lights</em>, the prestige sports soap opera chronicling the virtues and struggles of high school football players in a small Texas town. It went five seasons and eventually won Chandler an Emmy. Prior to that, he was best known for the CBS series <em>Early Edition</em> about a guy morally burdened by the knowledge of the future thanks to getting a magical edition of the Chicago Sun-Times 24 hours ahead of time. </p><p><em>Lanterns</em> also marks the first time fans will have gotten a live-action look at Green Lantern since the 2011 movie starring Ryan Reynolds. Despite references here and there in TV shows like<em> Smallville </em>and <em>Arrow</em>, the character has never gotten much dedicated screen time outside of animated series and movies, even missing out on Zack Snyder’s stab at a <em>Justice League</em>-fueled DCU. The <em>Lantern</em> series follows this fall’s <em>Penguin</em> spin-off, however, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-tv-series-show-hbo-review-release-date-1851647024&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-tv-series-show-hbo-review-release-date-1851647024">which has received decent reviews</a></span>.<br></p><p>Hopefully, the HBO take on Green Lantern similarly puts story and characters ahead of comic book easter eggs and action set pieces. Time for Chandler to go from practicing “clear eyes, full heart” to “in brightest day, in blackest night.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The next Assassin’s Creed Shadows dev diary has leaked online, showing off new gameplay and including some footage of how the world will change depending on the weather.</p>



<p><span>The leak comes from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com.cn/assassins-creed-codename-red/51099/video/ci-ke-xin-tiao-ying-kai-fa-zhe-ri-zhi-di-er-ji" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN China,</a>&nbsp;and while the gameplay is almost certainly going to be taken down, we’ll have mirrors of the footage available b</span>elow:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As shown in the new gameplay, Assassin’s Creed Shadows features “a new generation world,” which pushes the boundaries of a fully dynamic world. This includes a full season cycle, making the world not only appear different but also impacting your character’s movements and how you navigate it. For example, a hard-to-reach area might be blocked off because of a large body of water, but in the wintertime, that freezes over, making it accessible. </p>



<p>The new footage also showcases the new animation system used in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which creates an even more immersive world for players to enjoy.</p>



<p>The gameplay also reveals your ‘Hideout’, described as having one acre of land. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-red-exclusive-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hideout</a> is where the player can build, at their own will, the like of an armory, dojo, alter, and more. These buildings are customizable, too, from being able to pick the building location, to being able to choose your roof design to the interior layout and where you can display the likes of your weapons and armor can be displayed.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will launch on November 12th, 2024, for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

In fact, the project almost sounds like it started as a Zelda Maker title--similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-maker-2-review-make-my-day/1900-6417189/" data-ref-id="1900-6417189">the Super Mario Maker series</a>--but this time focused on dungeons to create and share. Grezzo's Satoshi Terada, who co-directed the game with Sano, discussed his team's opportunity to create a new game in the Zelda series and their different ideas.</p><p dir="ltr">"We were exploring a few different ways to play the game in parallel. In one approach, Link could copy and paste various objects, such as doors and candlesticks, to create original dungeons," Terada said. "During this exploration phase, this idea was called an "edit dungeon" because players could create their own Legend of Zelda gameplay."</p><p dir="ltr">Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma added that "while it's fun to create your own dungeon and let other people play it," what stood out to him was copying and pasting items. Obviously, that led to one of the game's main hooks: "The gameplay was shifted from creating dungeons up until then to using copied-and-pasted items as tools to further your own adventure."</p><p dir="ltr">This led to Sano mentioning that Aonuma basically upended the tea table, a phrase usually attributed to Shigeru Miyamoto. But she backed up Aonuma on the shift, saying: "Of course, creating dungeons was fun, but being able to copy various objects and use them in different places was even more fun."</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-rom-has-reportedly-leaked/1100-6526473/" data-ref-id="1100-6526473">the Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom ROM reportedly leaked</a>, so be careful of spoilers online with the game releasing later this week on September 26.

			<p><span>How long could it take to play 50 games, really?</span></p>
		</div>
	<div>
		<p>Once again, I am under siege by video games. I've put more hours into <em>The Plucky Square</em>, charmed enough by its aesthetics to overlook how boring it is. I've made progress in <em>Arco</em>, but I can feel it slipping away again after being away for two weeks. (That game is going to end up on a lot of "why didn't anyone play this" lists in a few years, mark my words.) Perhaps I should be thankful Nintendo didn't send me <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom </em>early, so that I don't have to worry about spending time with it until this weekend. And every time I think about <em>Space Marine 2</em>, at least I remember that we're probably going to just keep streaming it. </p><p>-pk, who at least can say they've finished <em>Astro Bot</em>, discourse and all</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY:</strong> We moved forward in our Francis Ford Coppola era of My Turn, as Rob picked Hearts of Darkness, a documentary about the making of <em>Apocalypse Now</em>. It's a fascinating watch, regardless of whether you've seen <em>Apocalypse Now</em>. In fact, I'd argue the movie is kinda boring (but important!) and the documentary conveys enough about for you to kinda feel like you watched it. You're certainly find to listen to the podcast if you haven't watched the movie in a little while, anyway.</li><li><strong>TUESDAY: </strong>We're recording an early episode of HOA that you'll hear a little down the line. Our new recording schedule dictates us turning on microphones a week in advance, which doesn't really work for Sports!, which requires a faster turnaround. Our plan is to—sigh—weigh in on the Bears and the other going ons in the NFL next week. That'll record next Monday, and get out...as soon as we can? In the afternoon, Rob and Cado will be headed to <em>Frostpunk 2</em>.</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY: </strong>I've put a bunch of hours into The Plucky Square, though it's looking unlikely I'll have a chance to play The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom before this recording—next week, I suppose! But there should be plenty to chat about on Remap Radio, between State of Play and TGS.</li><li>THURSDAY: Maybe this time I'll pay closer attention to the clock, so that I don't end up taking my youngest to her soccer class late. But hey, such is the nature of our Wheel of GeForce NOW streams—they're a ton of fun.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY:</strong> Besides Remap Radio publishing, we're going to try Remap's demo format, where we play a game for a set amount of time on a clock, and apply it to <em>UFO 50</em>. You'll also get a new letter series from Rob on Friday, as well.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[How Much is the PS5 Anniversary Edition?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-is-the-ps5-anniversary-edition/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-much-is-the-ps5-anniversary-edition.989352/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-is-the-ps5-anniversary-edition/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following the announcement of the PS5 Pro, which everyone laughed about because of its excruciating price tag, Sony had the last laugh with the PS5 Anniversary Edition. It’s seriously gorgeous, and I, like many others, want one for the nostalgia. But it’s easy to say, “Oh, I’ll buy on day one,” when you don’t know the price tag. Well, here’s how much the PS5 Anniversary Edition will set you back!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-ps5-anniversary-edition-cost">What Does the PS5 Anniversary Edition Cost?</h2>



<p>Are you ready for this? The PS4 Anniversary Edition price is set at <strong>$499.99 USD for the PS5 Slim (Digital Edition) and $79.99 USD for the DualSense 30th Anniversary Limited Edition Wireless Controller</strong>.</p>



<p>To complete the set, you’re looking at approximately $579.98 for the console bundle and an additional controller. Of course, they’re limited edition, which means the bundle will sell out quickly.</p>



<p>Is it more expensive than the usual PlayStation 5? Yeah! By about $50, which isn’t too severe considering the system’s unique aesthetic and limited nature. It’s a collector’s item more so than anything else.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the bundle isn’t just the console and a controller, which makes it even more worthwhile. It includes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Edition</strong></li>



<li><strong>DualSense</strong></li>



<li><strong>Faceplate</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vertical Stand</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sticker (Collector’s Edition)</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>However, whether the price tag is worthwhile or not for you is completely up to you!</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-pre-order-the-ps5-anniversary-edition">Where to Pre-Order the PS5 Anniversary Edition</h2>



<p>If you want to score the PS5 Anniversary Edition for yourself, the best way to purchase one is directly from Sony. You’ll likely want to avoid third-party sellers, such as eBay, as there are bound to be countless scalpers trying to help you part ways with your hard-earned money.</p>



<p>Instead, visit <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sony’s direct shop</a> for more information on the 30th Anniversary Edition bundles. You can purchase one starting September 26. Sony will also sell the limited-edition console via a few participating retailers.</p>



<hr>



<p>You might want to consider grabbing a PlayStation 5 sooner rather than later, especially considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-is-exclusive-to-ps5-for-a-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 is exclusive to PS5 for one year</a>!

			<p>Sony has just <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1838254671456018525" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that a new State of Play broadcast will air tomorrow on YouTube and Twitch at 3 PM Pacific Time / 6 PM Eastern Time | September 25 at 12 AM Central European Time / 7 AM Japan Time, available in English and Japanese languages. It's been nearly four months since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-featuring-14-announced-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous one</a>, which featured the following fourteen titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Astro Bot</li>
<li>Concord</li>
<li>God of War Ragnarok PC</li>
<li>Until Dawn</li>
<li>Skydance's Behemoth</li>
<li>Path of Exile 2</li>
<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>
<li>Silent Hill 2</li>
<li>Alien: Rogue Incursion</li>
<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
<li>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</li>
<li>Ballad of Antara</li>
<li>Infinity Nikki</li>
<li>Where Winds Meet</li>
</ul>
<p>This upcoming State of Play will feature even more games. Sony remained pretty vague but confirmed there will be 'over 20 PS5 and PS VR2 games)' developed by studios from all over the world.</p>
<p>Among those, we'll probably hear about Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered (already <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-rated-by-esrb-for-ps5-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a> by the ESRB) and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-is-reportedly-getting-a-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> Days Gone remaster. Other than that, it's anyone's guess, but it would be best to keep expectations in check. Sony reserves its big first-party reveals for the PlayStation Showcase events, while State of Play broadcasts are dedicated to third-party studios and minor projects like remasters.</p>

The consumable item <strong>Goddess Scales</strong> allows you to reset a character’s Elemental Plot progression, but this does not show up in bulk until Chapter Seven. For context, Chapter Seven is the start of the game’s final act, so you’ll have already seen most of the main story content by this point. Additionally, this is only a one-use item, so you can’t use these willy-nilly to test new builds. You’ll want to plan exactly how you want to respec a character before you use one of these.<br></p><p>That said, <strong>I strongly recommend holding off on using Goddess Scales until you clear the main story in <em>Visions of Mana</em></strong>. If you want to know why, let’s get into the nitty gritty of how <em>Visions of Mana</em> progresses in its post-game.</p><h2 id="h3647"><a id=""></a><strong>Where to find Goddess Scales in <em>Visions of Mana</em></strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="1c4a1ccc700ce8ba846199b5b50b184b" data-recommend-id="image://1c4a1ccc700ce8ba846199b5b50b184b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Goddess Scales screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Goddess Scales screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1c4a1ccc700ce8ba846199b5b50b184b" data-recommend-id="image://1c4a1ccc700ce8ba846199b5b50b184b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Goddess Scales screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As mentioned above, Goddess Scales won’t appear in <em>Visions of Mana</em> until the late game. You’ll likely first encounter this item by <strong>opening treasure chests</strong>, which are thankfully marked right on your map screen. By the time you’ve obtained all eight elementals, you should be able to collect every treasure chest you see (save maybe chests hidden in ruins, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/visions-of-mana-how-to-beat-ruins-guide-1851646843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/visions-of-mana-how-to-beat-ruins-guide-1851646843">though even those should be feasible by this point</a></span>). By my count, I was able to obtain five Goddess Scales this way.</p><p>The other source of Goddess Scales comes from the <strong>Grizzly Exchange</strong>. You know, the shop run by the Dudbear that goes “Badu badudu bub.” Starting in Chapter Seven, you can purchase five Goddess Scales for 20 Grizzly Syrups each. Then, once you enter the post-game content after Chapter Nine, you can purchase an additional five Goddess Scales.</p><p>By the post-game, <strong>I had found fifteen Goddess Scales in total</strong>. That’s three respecs per character, or five respecs for your main team if you don’t use anyone else. As far as I can tell, there are no ways to grind for Goddess Scales outside of replaying the game all over via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-visions-of-mana-square-enix-rpg-1851635405&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-visions-of-mana-square-enix-rpg-1851635405">New Game Plus</a></span>. While this should offer enough chances for you to customize your team exactly how you want, you still want to be careful before using these.</p><h2 id="h3648"><a id=""></a><strong>Why you should wait until the postgame until you use Goddess Scales</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ee22226dc4b1e359a1d6b03c445c9b2d" data-recommend-id="image://ee22226dc4b1e359a1d6b03c445c9b2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ARGH!

It's a giant orange cricket with giant claw arms." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Throughout most of the main story of <em>Visions of Mana</em>, you’ll have access to the first two tiers of each character’s Elemental Plot. If you explore the world and gather Elementite as they become available, you should have plenty of Elemental Points to experiment with different classes and obtain most of the spells that each character can natively learn. Only in Chapter Seven will you start obtaining each character’s third tier of the Elemental Plot, and by this point you should feel generally decided on which classes each character can learn. Maybe your build isn’t as optimized as you like, but you should fare well if you only focus on maxing out the classes your party currently mains.</p><p>The big thing here is that Chapter Eight and Chapter Nine consist of the game’s final dungeon and final boss respectively. There isn’t a ton of game left once you start finding Goddess Scales.</p><p>After you beat the final boss, you’ll unlock the post-game of <em>Visions of Mana</em>. Visit the Dudbear’s Grizzly Exchange again, and not only can you purchase additional Goddess Scales, you can buy the Tonics to unlock each character’s final tier of their Elemental Plots for a total of 100 Grizzly Syrups. Max out the class of any character’s Elemental Plot, and, surprise, it turns out <strong>your base class can equip any of the skills of any class you’ve maxed out</strong>.</p><p><strong>That’s right, you functionally have cross-classing now, and you’ll <em>need</em> to respec every character to get the most out of this system</strong>. Instead of grabbing helpful skills from any line of the Elemental Plot, you’ll want to reinvest all your points into two or three classes to make builds that can take on the post-game superbosses.</p><p>If you already respecced everyone in Chapter Seven, you should still have two more chances to respec your party in your pocket. But this leaves you short on chances to adjust your builds, especially if you want to rethink your party after finding out a superboss resists every element in the game.</p><p>To be fair, <em>Visions of Mana</em> doesn’t sport a terribly robust post-game. If you want to use a Goddess Scale before this point, it’s not the end of the world. But when faced with the hardest content in the entire game, you’ll feel happy to have that extra security in case you need to rethink your team. Make an extra save file after the postgame to be safe!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In parts 1 and 2 of this interview, the company reveals a number of tidbits about Echoes of Wisdom, including Grezzo as the elusive co-development studio behind the project and Tomomi Sano as the game's director, and first-ever female director on The Legend of Zelda series.</p><p>You can read the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-1/?utm_source=SW-AAA&amp;utm_medium=sotwnoa&amp;utm_campaign=N1141-01&amp;utm_id=N1141-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full interviews yourself</a>, but here are some highlights. First off, Sano has a rich history in the industry, earning her first credit in 1998 for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-3">editing stage textures on Tekken 3</a>. She began working with Nintendo in 2004 as a coordinator on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-party-6">Mario Party 6</a>, and over time was involved in a number of Nintendo-published and supported projects. Her first Zelda credit was in 2011 on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</a> as a coordinator, and she followed it up with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/04/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask-3d-review">same role on Majora's Mask 3D</a> a few years later. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/23/sano-zelda-1727113341689.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Tomomi Sano is Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom's director. Image credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p>In 2016, Sano served as <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd">assistant director on Twilight Princess HD</a>, and was also assistant director on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-and-luigi-superstar-saga-bowsers-minions">Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-and-luigi-bowsers-inside-story-bowser-jrs-journey">Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey</a>. Most recently, she was a project coordinator on the Switch version of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/19/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review">Link's Awakening in 2019</a>. According to the interviews, Aonuma apparently "almost always" asks Sano to be involved with Legend of Zelda projects at Grezzo.</p><h2>The origins of Echoes of Wisdom</h2><p>Grezzo and Nintendo co-developed Echoes of Wisdom, but in the interview, series producer Eiji Aonuma says that Grezzo had an even greater role than usual on the game. Apparently, Nintendo wanted Grezzo's take on Link's Awakening to serve as a blueprint for top-down Zelda games this generation, but  didn't just want to only do remakes. So the team asked Grezzo to pitch ideas internally for a new Legend of Zelda game, marking the first time the studio was challenged to participate in a Zelda project from the conceptual state. According to Aonuma, everyone in the studio participated across disciplines, pitching ideas to Aonuma, and it took Nintendo three days to review all the proposals.</p><p>Ultimately, the idea that won wasn't exactly what Echoes is now, though it was kind of close. The winner was a "copy-and-paste" gameplay style combining the "top-down and side-view" gameplay styles seen in Link's Awakening.</p><p>"These were the two basic elements, and from there, I asked them to think of ways to add some freedom," Aonuma says. "Having worked on games in the Legend of Zelda series over the years, we started to feel that fans may not continue playing this franchise unless they can think independently and try various things freely on their own, rather than following a set path. Even when it comes to solving puzzles – in a game in the Legend of Zelda series, having the excitement of solving puzzles in your own unique way makes the game 'Legend of Zelda-like.' Hence, we need to increase the degree of freedom to achieve that. With this in mind, I asked Grezzo to use those two elements as a foundation for the gameplay and add freedom on top of it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>What Grezzo came up with was more of a "dungeon editor" game than what Echoes of Wisdom ended up being, where Link could copy and paste objects to create original dungeons. They prototyped this version for about a year, but Aonuma "upended the tea table" so to speak in changing the premise to focus more on copy-and-paste as a gameplay and puzzle-solving tool.</p><p>The rest of the interview discusses some of the different ways in which Nintendo and Grezzo had to navigate the challenges of giving a player access to copy-and-pasting over 100 objects in the game anywhere, anytime. That includes challenges with how every object can interact with both top-down and side-view gameplay, and struggles in ensuring gameplay didn't feel too slow while the player waits for enemies and echoes to take actions against one another.</p><p>One particular sticking point, per Aonuma, was placing restrictions on what the player can do with Echoes early on, or in dungeons. Earlier in development, Aonuma says the team tried to put restrictions on Echo use out of fear players would break the game. But over time, they discovered this wasn't necessary, and gradually lifted these restrictions until the final version of the game had almost none from the start.</p><p>All this led to further enabling players to "be mischievous," which was a key phrase used during development.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We wanted to do some things that were really out there.</p></div><p>"We came up with this key phrase because we wanted to do some things that were really out there," Aonuma says. "For example, if you roll something like a spike roller along the ground, that's a lot of work, because it can hit all kinds of things, but if we didn't allow for this possibility, it wouldn't be fun. (Laughs) The development team called these kinds of ideas 'being mischievous.'"</p><p>Sano adds that the team created a document explaining what "being mischievous" meant "so that everyone could return to this concept if they weren't sure how to proceed."</p><p>"There were three rules," continues Grezzo director Satoshi Terada. "Be able to paste things however, wherever, and whenever you like. Make it possible to complete puzzles using things that aren't there."</p><p>Sano shares the third. "Being able to find uses for echoes that are so ingenious it almost feels like cheating should be part of what makes this game fun."</p><p>Aonuma concludes by referencing the Myahm Agana shrine from Breath of the Wild, an infamous motion-sensor puzzle where players had to use the Switch controller to move a platform and tilt a ball through a maze to a finish line. However, the puzzle also allowed players to flip the entire platform upside down and roll the ball across a smooth surface to the goal.</p><p>"If this kind of solution isn't allowed, then it's not fun," says Aonuma.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ara-history-untold-review.989310/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ara-history-untold-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ara: History Untold is the latest in a procession of turn-based 4X games trying to settle on the once-sovereign territory of Sid Meier's Civilization, and it's one of the more competent challengers to do so. The liveliness and detail of its animated towns and cities never fail to delight me – as a historical ant farm, at least. But it expects more of us as a world leader than Civ ever has, and doesn't really provide us with the tools to make it truly feel good to be the king.</p><p>On a basic level, Ara doesn't have a vastly different view of history from its 4X forebears. Starting from roughly Neolithic times, you race down a tech tree split up into three acts of four ages each along a familiar and narrow path based mostly on Europe and its colonial offshoots. One little twist I did appreciate is that the final, futuristic era has a lot more to do with general AI, transhumanism, and cybernetics than going to space, which I think is a necessary and likely step on the path ahead of us that often gets skipped over in favor of interstellar travel.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Much like Civ, Ara lets you select from an array of historical leaders who appear in a simple but expressive 3D style. Alongside familiar faces like Caesar and Shaka Zulu, we also get some less conventional "rulers" like Copernicus for Poland and Sappho for Greece, which is a nice touch. </p><p>Their bonuses are all underwhelmingly passive, though. None of them can really do anything the others can't. And there are no culturally unique units – at least, not from your leader choice. You can unlock a couple wildcards, like Berserkers from building a brewery, but they're available to anyone who meets the right conditions. There's also a system of opposing personality traits that maybe could have been interesting, because it does affect how other leaders will initially view you diplomatically, but I didn't find it to be that impactful. Also, some of them provide a negative modifier with no upside, which seems very strange from a balance perspective, since the leaders who have them don't seem to get anything to make up for this.</p><h2><strong>Wonderful World</strong></h2><p>Ara's procedurally-generated worlds are positively enthralling to look at. Everything from trees to houses are rendered at a much smaller scale than in other, similar games, which makes the world feel larger and more authentic. Every town square, windmill, and even herd of wild animals is fully animated, bringing liveliness to every corner of the map. I honestly enjoy the simple act of panning around, watching my people go about their lives.</p><p>It's not all great, though. Road-building, which is fully automated, tends to make these nonsensical tangles with too many sharp angles to look organic. You could argue this is to simulate real-world traffic engineering debacles, but it doesn't look nice compared to everything else.</p><p>Performance can also get a little bit iffy in the late game, at least on the largest map size. The more of the fog I lifted, the more frames I lost, even on a 4070 Super GPU. We never quite reached slideshow territory, but I did end up having to turn some settings down in the last 100 turns or so.</p><p>I was also a little disappointed that there isn't much difference in architecture other than which era you're in. At least judging by the civs I played, it seems like a farm or a residential neighborhood for any given time period looks about the same no matter who built it. And this just further reinforces the feeling that your leader choice is little more than a set of numerical bonuses.</p><h2><strong>The Economy, Fools</strong></h2><p>Where Ara almost literally grinds to a halt is also its most interesting gameplay innovation. While food, gold, science, and production – the usual gang – are all here, Ara features a very in-depth, goods-based manufacturing economy. You can harvest grain, which can then be made into bread at a bakery, which can then be used as an ingredient in gourmet meals at an inn. This continues all the way up to things like refrigerators and game consoles in the later eras.</p><p>You can either spend these goods as a one-time cost to slot them into a specific building's inventory, like adding plows to a farm to increase its productivity, or consume them as amenities in your city-center for a temporary benefit. In theory, I like this a lot. In bigger settlements, simply producing the generic "food" resource will eventually become insufficient to feed the masses. But if you refine your crops into grain stores and preserves, and produce enough to keep those amenity slots full on an ongoing basis, you can grow much larger. Most manufactured goods also have multiple options for what you can make them with, including just spending gold if you don't have access to the base resources. I really liked the decision-making and economic planning involved here at smaller scales.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>ARA: History Untold - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The problem is that this becomes a nightmare to manage with even two or three fair-sized cities. There's no notification I could find or enable for when a city has a free amenity slot, for example. Nor when I could potentially fill an empty supplies slot on a production building, or swap out those supplies with a better option I had recently unlocked through technology. It also won't warn you when you have idle experts – Ara's version of specialists from Civ, who appear as your population increases and can be slotted to supercharge specific buildings.</p><p>There's not even a really convenient way to keep track of your economy. There is a tooltip that will show you a basic balance sheet of everything you're producing and consuming, but it's too small, there's no way to sort the rows by anything but alphabetical order, and it eventually fills up with so many types of goods that it becomes overwhelming. Or you can look at a grid view, which is a bit easier to navigate, but doesn't include the spreadsheet and still can't be sorted.</p><p>To really optimize my economy, I had to open dozens of individual building menus every time I unlocked a new tech or gained access to a new type of tools. And since this is essentially the core mechanic in Ara, everything else starts to collapse around it. The late game really gets to be a tedious slog, unless you pull far enough ahead that you can simply stop caring about most of the mechanics, which is what eventually happened to me on the default difficulty.</p><h2><strong>To The Strongest</strong></h2><p>Combat is fine. It's very automatic, with some rock-paper-scissors unit choices and unlockable formations that can give you modest bonuses based on the types of troops you have access to, adding a little bit of tactical decision-making. Engagements play out in full 3D, which is neat to watch the first few times as potentially hundreds of troops clash, but these animations lost their appeal for me fairly quickly since they're not especially dynamic.</p><p>Ara also includes a knockout mechanic, which is something I'm generally not a fan of. After a certain number of players have reached Age 5 and Age 9, the ones with the least accumulated Prestige – your overall score based on everything from military victories to total population – are removed from the map, with their cities becoming explorable ruins.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Len's Top 10 4X Games</h3><p>The best games to explore, expand, exploit, and extol in 2024.</p></div><p>It's possible to turn this off for human players, which is nice. But I didn't really get the sense that streamlining the later eras to just a handful of great powers was worth losing the diplomatic complexity of a larger cast. In a 12-player game, eight will move on to Act 2 and five will remain competing for the top spot in Act 3. It's also just weird the second time it happens, with bustling Enlightenment-era cities vanishing overnight.</p><p>Diplomacy is as basic as it could possibly be in this type of game, with the ability to send gifts, declare wars, open borders, and broker alliances and research agreements. Trade can be useful in the early game when you don't have access to a resource you really need for a higher-tier building, but you need to heavily commit to it to have enough merchant capacity later on to even make a dent in your goods deficit.</p><p>Government, religion, and advisers are also pretty unmemorable. Like leader choice, it's just stacking more numerical modifiers. They don't typically unlock new playstyles or new ways to solve problems. They just make you marginally better at doing things you could already do anyway.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Shirley Curry, the 88-year-old YouTuber better known as the Skyrim Grandma, has announced her retirement, saying she's "bored to death" of making gaming videos.
</p>
<p>
Curry uploaded her first Skyrim gameplay video to YouTube in 2015, and had amassed over 1m subscribers by 2021. Despite suffering a stroke that same year, Curry soon returned to her gaming chair and has continued to post videos of her adventures in Tamriel since then.
</p>
<p>
But now, Curry's Skyrim journey has finally reached its end. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNGH8o3LDBo">vlog</a> titled 'No More Gaming Videos' shared over the weekend, Curry told fans, "It seems I spend most of my time sitting in here at this computer, and lately - probably for the last month - I walk in here and look at my computer, and think 'I've got to make a video today'. And then I just shake my head at myself and say, 'I don't want to, I have no desire to, and I turn around and walk back out.'"

<p>
"I'm just doing it for fun, and it isn't fun anymore. I'm tired of it, and I'm bored to death with it. So I'm making the decision now, totally, finally, I am not going to be making any more game videos."
</p>
<p>
Curry doesn't, however, plan on disappearing from YouTube entirely. Despite admitting to fans, "I'm old and I'm tired, and I don't feel like doing much anymore", she says she'll still make vlogs "every so often". These will include updates on her life, the books she's reading, maybe even some of her own writing. And away from the camera, Curry is "going to start making a quilt I've been wanting to make for a very long time".
</p>
<p>
And as Curry points out - before signing off with, "I'll see you in a blog later on, I promise" - those missing her regular gaming escapades have nearly a decade of earlier videos to enjoy. And if that's still not enough Skyrim Grandma, there's always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-skyrim-grandma-is-now-a-skyrim-follower-thanks-to-a-mod">2021's fan-made Shirley Follower Mod</a>, which adds Curry to Skyrim as a two-handed barbarian companion, complete with a fully fleshed-out, lore-friendly backstory.
</p>
<p>
That particular mode emerged following a fan petition to "immortalise" Curry in The Elder Scrolls 6, after she lamented the game was likely so far away she "probably won't get to play it". Three years later, The Elder Scrolls 6 is still nowhere in sight, but here's to Curry's well-earned retirement from gaming, and best wishes on that quilt.

		<p>Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus was<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/20/kingdom-two-crowns-call-of-olympus-dlc-revealed/"> originally revealed back in May</a>, and now it has a release date. Players who want to venture through a new version of Olympus can do so when the Call of Olympus DLC releases on October 8th. In the Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus DLC, the Greed has started to take over the home of the Gods, who require your aid.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus | Date Reveal Trailer | Wishlist Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fsx2lMf-A98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Journeying to the top of Mount Olympus will not be a simple feat, as to gain access you need to gain the favour of some of the gods, including Athena, Hermes, Artemis, and Hephaestus. In addition to that, players will travel to Temple and Quest islands, which hold artifacts to use against Greed, treasures, and challenges to complete. In total, there are four artifacts to be found that represent one of the gods. There are also new mounts to find and unlock within the DLC, with those being the Chimera, the underworld’s guardian Cerberus, Pegasus, and Donkey. The Greed is also stronger this time round with boss battles having multiple stages to complete to beat them, but you do get allies of your own. You can build a fleet of ships to join you, use siege weapons, and have Hoplites fight with you.</p>

<p>In our Kingdom Two Crowns review, Thomas said,&nbsp;<em>“Kingdom Two Crowns feels more like an extensive update than a new entry to the series, but the base game is still so immensely enjoyable that it doesn’t really matter. This is the perfect starting point for new players, and those who are returning might still be surprised by some of the secrets to be found.”</em></p>

<p>Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, iOS, and Android. It will be £8.49 on consoles, and £3.49 for mobile devices.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-dev-wanted-to-make-two-games-at-once-but-one-is-winning-out/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios publicly <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-larian-studios-2-new-original-projects-best-work-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> a while ago that it is working on two major new projects following its decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-4-playable-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abandon the plan to make a Baldur's Gate 3 seque</a>l. What we didn't know for certain is that Larian is planning to make them at the same time, not one after the other, but as Larian CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-studio-wanted-to-make-2-rpgs-at-once-but-its-devs-got-swallowed-by-the-ambitions-of-the-one-we-want-to-release-first/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Gamesradar</a>, one of the projects is winning out.</p>
<p><em>We had some people who were dedicated to the other one, and they just got swallowed by the ambitions of the one that we want to release first. So we will try and do it concurrently, but we have to figure out how to leave people alone.</em></p>
<p>Vincke then tackled another major issue for the studio. While the Larian CEO originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-breaks-814k-steam-ccu-but-larian-wants-the-next-game-to-be-smaller-and-to-stay-independent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hoped</a> to make a smaller game after the gargantuan Baldur's Gate 3, he is now coming to terms with the fact that the next games are going to be really large, too.</p>
<p><em>We always say we do want to rein in our ambitions, but then we start thinking, and the machine is meant to make large games. We were made for making large, ambitious RPGs and to try new stuff.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the core problems - it's not really a problem - but one of the core problems to do what you're suggesting is that we actually know what we want from our gameplay systems, how to evolve them, how to do new things…and they're all big.</em></p>
<p>It's not surprising, given the growth of the studio. Just four months ago, Larian <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-opens-new-office-in-warsaw-to-help-make-its-two-very-ambitious-new-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the opening of a new office in Warsaw, Poland. This is the seventh office, following the headquarters in Ghent and the offices in Quebec City, Dublin, Kuala Lumpur, Guildford, and Barcelona. The total headcount is around 500, making Larian effectively a triple-A developer at this point.</p>

                <p>Assassin's Creed Invictus, a multiplayer-focused title in Ubisoft's long running franchise, is reportedly inspired by the round-based gameplay of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fall-guys/" data-ref-id="5000-497671">Fall Guys</a> and will support up to 16 players, according to a leaker.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft announced Assassin's Creed Invictus back in 2022 alongside a host of other Assassin's Creed projects, but no official details other than its multiplayer nature or a release date have been officially revealed since.

		<p>Sony has announced that a State of Play will be taking place tomorrow, September 24th at 3PM PDT/6pm EDT/ 11pm BST. The show will last 30 minutes with news and updates for around 20 games to be showcased.</p>
<p>The games include both PS5 and PSVR 2 titles, and there is likely to be more news about games that will take advantage of the PS5 Pro’s specs. The State of Play will stream across YouTube and Twitch.</p>


<p>There are not that many rumours around to say what will be shown, though one that has been persistent the last week is a Days Gone remaster, which may or may not generate a similar reaction the news of the Horizon Zero Dawn remaster. If there is a remaster announcement then many would be waiting for games like Bloodborne, which would be a very popular option for fans.</p>
<p>Sony’s State of Play comes a few days before Tokyo Game Show gets into full swing, so there could be some early surprises from Japanese studios. Microsoft also have a Tokyo Game Show showcase taking place this week, with that happening on September 26th, and that will have a focus on games from Japanese studios.</p>

		<p>Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings game has been given a new release date, following on from i<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/14/cosy-hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-delayed-to-2025/">ts delay from a couple of weeks back</a>. That new release date is March 25th, 2025, and from then on you will be able to live the cost life of a Hobbit. To mark the news, a brand new behind the scenes look at the development of Tales of the Shire has been released focusing on features and inspirations.</p>

<p>Tales of the Shire allows players to create their own Hobbit, who lives in Bywater and can establish their own life. As time passes in Bywater, other Hobbits will come to ask your Hobbit for help on matters. Additionally, you can do all the cosy things a Hobbit’s life should consist of, including growing your own vegetables, going fishing, trading items with neighbours, and cooking up meals. You can wander around Bywater visiting other Hobbits and going to the shop, or venture a bit further out to forage in the fields for supplies.</p>
<p><em>“Wētā Workshop has been trusted with J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth universe for more than 25 years, and over that time we have built up a deep understanding of the lore and a real love of Middle-earth that flows through our creative work across screen, collectibles and now, our cosy sims games,”</em> said Richard Taylor, Co-founder and CEO at Wētā Workshop. <em>“Tales of the&nbsp;<span>Shire</span>&nbsp;allows us to inspire our talents in an entirely new medium and, ultimately, create this game for people just like us – fans of The Lord of the Rings. This is a beautiful way that players who are looking for a quieter, more peaceful time can discover this in a less explored corner of this universe.”</em></p>

<p>Tales of the Shire will be released for PC via Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and it will also be available on Netflix.</p>

PlatinumGames is far from a Nintendo exclusive developer, having also released the likes of the Bayonetta and Nier franchises elsewhere.</p><p>A multiplatform release would be commercially attractive, however, as The Wonderful 101 has perhaps gone unnoticed as both a PlatinumGames game and a Nintendo game. It certainly earned positive reviews, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wonderful-101-remastered-review">with IGN's own returning a 9/10</a> and calling it "one of the best action games of a generation."</p><p>It hasn't made much of an impact despite this, though did receive a surprise expansion last year as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wonderful-101-remastered-gets-free-dlc-shadow-drop-today">the After School Hero downloadable content was shadow dropped</a> by PlatinumGames.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
