As reported by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/">Games Fray</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/us-patent-office-boss-orders-reexamination-of-nintendos-controversial-summon-character-and-let-it-fight-pokmon-patent-which-ip-lawyer-claims-further-undermines-credibility-of-its-case-against-palworld">IGN</a>), the U.S. Patent Office boss John Squires (no, not quite The Stone Roses guitarist - close, though) has ordered the reexamination of Nintendo's “summon sub-character and let it fight” patent.</p>
<p>The patent was previously granted "without any objection" to Nintendo, though Squires points to two previous patents from Konami in 2002 and Nintendo itself in 2019 which may viewed as "prior art" references. Squires says that both are “important in deciding whether the claims are patentable,” while each “raises a substantial new question of patentability".</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22frmpiqw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>It's important to note that the reexamination doesn't necessarily mean that the patent will ultimately be rejected, but Games Fray writer Florian Mueller says that this is now "highly likely" given the circumstances. Mueller also says that the very nature of the reexamination "further undermines the credibility" of Nintendo's patent.</p>
<p>As for why this has occurred, Mueller surmises that it's likely a direct result of the public outrage that followed when news broke of Nintendo's patent submission. The article argues that "No system is perfect, which is why there must be processes in place to fix issues".</p>
<p>Mueller closes by stating that there will likely be no further developments in Nintendo's case against Palworld nor any of the patents that relate to it in this calendar year. Decisions will likely be made in 2026, however, particularly by Presiding Judge Motoyuki Nakashima, who leads the patent division of the Tokyo District Court. Mueller states that, given all of the developments relating to this case, "It is ever more likely that Nintendo will lose".</p>
<p>Nintendo had recently been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendos-pokemon-catching-related-patent-has-been-rejected-in-japan">dealt another legal blow</a> when its patent related to catching <strong>Pokémon</strong> was rejected in Japan due to lacking an "inventive step", and that "the claimed invention(s) could have easily been made by persons who have common knowledge in the technical field".</p>
<p>Things may still sway in Nintendo's favour, but to say that this legal battle has been much more compelling than any of us has expected would be an understatement. We'll be keen to see how things shake out in the months to come.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/aloft-preview-bloom-and-blight-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aloft-preview-%E2%80%93-bloom-blight-overhauls-plenty-still-no-sign-of-v1-0.1343299/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Aloft is a cozy-looking cooperative sandbox survival game from developer Astrolabe Interactive and publisher Funcom that’s been <a href="https://wccftech.com/aloft-by-astrolabe-interactive-scheduled-to-launch-into-early-access-on-january-15th/">out in early access since January 15, 2025. </a>While its v1.0 release isn’t on deck (at least based on what Astrolabe told me), the studio is getting ready to deliver a significant update with its Bloom &amp; Blight expansion.</p>



<p>Ahead of Bloom &amp; Blight’s release today, I got the chance to check out a short presentation from Astrolabe going over everything that’s new in this update and to see just how much of the game is being overhauled and revamped. Seemingly, it’s a lot.</p>



<p>To start, the highlights: a new world generation system, an entirely revamped progression system, a reworked restoration system, new tool and weapon tiers, two new corruption strains, and the addition of wind tunnels to help you travel faster across the sky.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Aloft: Bloom and Blight. Image credit: Astrolabe Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It's all together the biggest update that developer Astrolabe Interactive has pushed out to Aloft, with the top three highlights listed in the graphic above being the three biggest game-changers for players.</p>



<p>The new, revamped progression system adds research points to player progression and lets players spend earned research points however they like for their playstyle. The knowledge tree also now works with the points system, which overall gives you more freedom in the kind of survival experience you're building for yourself in Aloft.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Aloft: Bloom and Blight. Image credit: Astrolabe Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The reworked restoration of corrupted islands and Life Trees makes removing corruption more rewarding than before, particularly because when you've restored an island and removed all signs of corruption you now get access to the inner basin of Life Trees.</p>



<p>They're essentially mini underground areas for you to explore and gather more resources from, and add plenty of depth to the visual experience of Aloft as these great-looking underground areas to explore.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Aloft: Bloom and Blight. Image credit: Astrolabe Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The reworked restoration system also comes with improvements to the combat and additions to the kinds of corruption you can face, and the ability to better study the corruption so you can be better prepared to fight against it. </p>



<p>Studying and collecting samples from corruption anomalies, lost anchors, and knowledge stones all play into the new progression system and advance their various tech trees, which then lets you craft more complex contraptions to improve your islands and thrive instead of just survive in Aloft. Collecting them and more research and knowledge points also leads to better tools, which now have new tiers in the Bloom and Blight update.</p>



<p>Windstone and Serrated Bone tools do more damage and have larger areas of effect, with Serrated Bone tools now being the top tier for all tools, doing more damage than Windstone variants, while Windstone variants fall in between Serrated and regular stone tools.</p>

</figure>



<p>The two new kinds of corrupted enemies (shown in the third photo above) are Sportox and Floglade, which add new challenges for players, including spores that disable your glider for a short period of time, grounding you and forcing you to engage more directly with the combat.</p>



<p>And speaking of gliders, the last major highlight in this update is the inclusion of wind tunnels, which help you travel faster across the sky as you turn any island you want into a ship. You can try using your glider in wind tunnels, but your glider isn't built for it and you'll get much farther, much faster, by using them when piloting your island ships.</p>



<p>Overall, Aloft has changed a lot since it released in early access at the start of this year, and its Bloom and Blight update is the biggest one yet. Its changes feel foundational, like the early access period has taken a turn and more than a few strides towards its eventual v1.0 release.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Aloft: Bloom and Blight. Image credit: Astrolabe Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even though that release isn't on the immediate horizon, the roadmap shared by Astrolabe Interactive shows how Aloft will continue going through big changes, so big that, beginning with this update, it's a whole new version of the game. You can still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1660080/view/613178682495730920?l=english">access the version of the game that Aloft was before this update,</a> but the fact that it is now dubbed the 'Legacy' version is just another sign of how much has changed.</p>



<p>While it won't be this year, hopefully, we'll have a better idea as to when v1.0 is on its way by this time next year, if it hasn't already arrived.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The hack-and-slash <a href="https://kotaku.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-the-kotaku-review-1845702074"><em>Warriors</em> spin-offs</a> on Nintendo Switch have been easy to skip. The arcade action can be fun and the character interactions rewarding for fans of the given franchise, but for the most part they’ve done little to break out of the fan service bubble. <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> might be different. Early reviews suggest the <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> spin-off isn’t just a must-play for hardcore fans but a decent action game that new Switch 2 owners should be paying attention to.</p> <p>Out November 6 as an exclusive for Nintendo’s new hardware, the Koei Tecmo-developed musou game is the first major next-gen-only release the Switch 2 has seen since <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> in July. It’s currently sporting a not altogether impressive Metacritic score of 78, which is exactly in line with how the previous games in the subseries, <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> and <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em>, performed. Beneath some of the criticism of the repetitive combat and less-than-excellent mission design, however, early reviews are generally more positive than I was expecting.</p>

 <p>“I might hesitate to call<em>&nbsp;Age of Imprisonment</em> an ‘essential’ Switch 2 game, but it’s a crucial piece of giving the system a strongly varied first-year lineup,” writes Hayes Madsen <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review">for<em> Inverse</em></a>, who praised some of its<em> Star Fox</em>-like missions and said the story “genuinely enhances&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom.” </em>Chris Scullion, reviewing <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">for <em>VGC</em>,</a> was even more upbeat, writing, <em>“Age of Imprisonment</em> may be the most serious of the <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> games to date, but it’s also the one with the most engaging and rewarding combat.”</p>

 <p>Not everyone was equally impressed. “Repetition is baked into the genre, but its zen-like nature is stripped away in the latter parts of <em>Age of Imprisonment</em>‘s campaign as you’re forced to replay the same sorts of missions over and over again,” wrote Richard Wakeling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-link-to-the-past/1900-6418434/">for <em>GameSpot</em></a>. “Many missions only take place in small slithers of battlefields, and even the ones in bigger areas shuffle you quite cleanly from point to point,” wrote Oscar Taylor-Kent <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">for<em> Gamesradar</em></a>. “There’s very little sense of scope to any of the environments, instead feeling just like corridors and rooms.”</p> <p>One thing to note: some big sites haven’t even published their <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> reviews yet because Nintendo’s embargo restrictions were too onerous. “Restrictions Nintendo sent alongside a review code were particularly strict this time around, preventing reviews that publish ahead of launch from discussing&nbsp;<em>any&nbsp;</em>non-public story details whatsoever,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review">reported<em> IGN</em></a>. <em>The Verge </em>also opted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/813136/review-imprisoned-for-now">to wait until launch</a> to share its review. <em>Polygon</em> isn’t <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marioprime.bsky.social/post/3m4spqbnwwk2o">publishing its take yet either</a>. In the meantime, here’s what everyone else is saying.</p> <h2><em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-link-to-the-past/1900-6418434/">GameSpot</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“Without any technical hiccups getting in the way, combat is still the star of <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>. Unique Skills and Sync Strikes bring increased depth to its hack-and-slash histrionics, while elements of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> are smartly adapted to fit the musou genre. The story doesn’t feel essential enough to satisfy pure Zelda fans, but by ironing out its predecessor’s performance issues and introducing a varied roster of rewarding characters, <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> marks a high point for the spin-off series thus far.” — Richard Wakeling</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-switch-2-review-1235458481/">Rolling Stone</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“As a <em>Zelda</em>&nbsp;title, it effectively continues the worldbuilding from the&nbsp;<em>Beath of the Wild</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>&nbsp;duology; it also provides a sense of real agency for the princess herself, who somehow hadn’t even starred in her own game until last year’s disappointing&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>. As a musou, it also manages to elevate the well-worn trappings of the subgenre by incorporating a shocking amount of actual&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em> mechanics.” — Christopher Cruz</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review">Inverse</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“The core structure of<em>&nbsp;Age of Imprisonment&nbsp;</em>is entirely focused on taking over bases and fighting bosses. You don’t need to control the battlefield like in the <em>Fire Emblem</em> games, and allies largely can’t do damage to enemies — they’re only there to help support you. A good way to think of it is that this is a character action game (like <em>Devil May Cry</em>) grafted onto the bones of the <em>Warriors</em> structure — but it works.” — Hayes Madsen</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">Gamesradar</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“<em>Age of Calamity</em> had a range of diverse and interestingly shaped maps, but<em> Age of Imprisonment</em>‘s feel bland in comparison – even when some maps are essentially the same as in the other game, the undemanding structure makes them worse in this outing. One specific wooded area is still a banger, though. Revisiting <em>Age of Calamity</em> alongside this new one, I had way more fun fighting back through even early encounters there, with sprawling battlefields and pockets of fighting.” — Oscar Taylor-Kent</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/18880-hyrule-warriors-age-imprisonment-review">RPG Site</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>For a certain type of player, <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> will be the single game you’ll end up sinking the most time into on your Switch 2. If it wasn’t for every other RPG I’ve yet to play this year, I might have ended up in those shoes. <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> isn’t just a great <em>Zelda</em> spinoff, but confidently stands among some of the singular best games in the entire <em>Zelda</em> series. I simply can’t recommend it enough for anyone who is a fan of the <em>Warriors</em>‘ genre. — James Galizio</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-impressions-review-story-gameplay">Eurogamer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>Oh, and here’s a bonus: this is one of these games that&nbsp;<em>runs well</em>. I don’t associate <em>Warriors</em> with that, even on higher-end consoles. But this is great. I don’t know if it began life as a Switch 1 game and was then shifted to the successor machine or what, but whatever the reasoning I’m thrilled to note that this looks nice enough but also maintains a solid and high frame rate, even when hundreds of troops are bouncing around on screen. — Alex Donaldson</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">VGC</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>In terms of the actual gameplay itself, <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is undoubtedly still a<em> Warriors</em> game – for the uninitiated, Koei Tecmo’s <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> series has had numerous licensed spin-offs for the likes of <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Dragon Quest</em>,<em> Fire Emblem</em>, <em>Persona</em> and these <em>Zelda</em>-themed <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> titles – but it also feels a bit like a game trying even more than its predecessors to appeal to those not interested in its hack-and-slash principles. — Chris Scullion</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">PC Mag</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>I went into <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> thinking I knew what to expect, but I was surprised by what I found. The improved performance—especially in local multiplayer—as well as the tweaks to combat really made the game stand out among the many <em>Warriors</em> titles. <em>Zelda</em> fans looking for a traditional adventure should look elsewhere. But if you’re down for an <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-pc-action-games" target="_self" rel="noopener">action game</a> that’ll easily steal dozens of hours of your life, <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> is a terrific time. — Zackery Cuevas</p></blockquote>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-beginner-telescope-now-costs-as-much-as-a-toy-yet-comes-with-two-real-eyepieces-2000641087</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve all looked up at the night sky and wondered what those lights really look like up close. Stars, planets, the craters on the moon – they’re all up there, waiting to be explored but telescopes have always seemed either too expensive or too complicated to bother with.</p>
<p>The <em>Hexeum</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5327/">beginner telescope just dropped to $85 from $149 on Amazon</a>, and brings real astronomy within reach of anyone curious enough to point it at the sky. This isn’t a toy telescope that shows you blurry dots, it’s an<strong> 80mm aperture refractor with actual quality optics, two real eyepieces and a Barlow lens that magnifies the moon up to 180 times</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5327/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Optics That Show You Something Worth Seeing</h2>
<p>With an aperture of 80mm, it captures much more light compared to smaller and entry-level scopes which will directly translate into a view that is brighter and clearer of the night’s starry objects. The focal length of 600mm at f/6.7 gives a balance between the wide-field views for star clusters and closer views of planets and the moon. Fully multi-coated lenses mean reduced light loss and increased brightness and clarity in the image so instead of a washed-out blob, you’re actually seeing sharp detail.</p>
<p>Right out of the box, the two eyepieces give you flexibility: The <strong>25mm eyepiece gives 24x magnification,</strong> perfect for scanning the sky to find objects or viewing larger targets like the Andromeda Galaxy or the Pleiades star cluster. The <strong>10mm eyepiece bumps you up to 60x magnification</strong> for detailed views of the moon’s craters, Jupiter’s bands or Saturn’s rings. The 3<strong>x Barlow lens triples the magnifying power of each eyepiece</strong> and pushes you to 72x and 180x when you want to zoom in even closer.</p>



<p>The adjustable aluminum tripod holds the telescope steady during viewing which is more important than one might think. Any shimmy or wobble gets magnified along with the image and turns the planets into jittery blurs. Sturdy construction means you don’t have to fight vibrations every time you touch the scope, so smooth focusing isn’t a problem. <strong>A phone adapter lets you snap photos of what you see</strong> by mounting your smartphone onto the eyepiece and turns casual star-gazing into shareable moments.</p>
<p>For $85, you’re paying what some people spend on a nice dinner for a tool that opens up an entirely new hobby. The lifetime maintenance support means you’re covered if anything goes wrong, and the responsive customer service handles questions within 24 hours. This telescope gives you real views of real astronomical objects-the phases of Venus, the moons of Jupiter orbiting in real-time, the rings of Saturn and countless star clusters.</p>

		<p>Warhammer Survivors is the new game from Auroch Digital, which has previously developed Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun and is working on Boltgun 2. Warhammer Survivors is less Boltgun and more Vampire Survivors in style, and that isn’t a surprise since Auroch Digital has partnered up with poncle and is using their game engine. Warhammer Survivors is an official Survivors game, but standalone and dripping in Warhammer action and lore.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer Survivors Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P5E_EaxN1qo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You can really see the common ground between Vampire Survivors and this game, from the style of the pixel art to the pace of movement and the way that upgrades are dropped in boxes.</p>
<p>Players will be able to upgrade weapons and abilities so each run can last longer. Some of those weapons are the Boltgun, the Astartes Chainsword, and the Whirlwind Axes. Auroch Digital has also announced some of the playable characters for Warhammer Survivors including:</p>


<ul>
<li>Malum Caedo<wbr></li>
<li>Kozlowski&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li>Brother Luca&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<wbr><b>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Neave Blacktalon,</li>
<li>Sharynn Azurwath<wbr></li>
<li>Gotrek Gurnisson<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>These characters and others will be tasked with fighting Skaven and Tyranid swarms.&nbsp; Warhammer Survivors is due to be released in 2026 for PC via Steam.</p>

<p>That's because the dev has revealed a new DLC, 'Celestial Haven', which will be coming to Steam later this month, with a Switch release following "shortly after", and it is packed (we mean <em>packed</em>) with adorable little pets.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kjsqxw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Celestial Haven adds a brand-new 'Shelter' area to the game's hub world, where you can house a troop of cute little critters to assist you on your runs. There are cat-like Lupo, doggy Vulpo, chinchilla-esque Pantero, and mythical Grifo and Draketo, all of whom will dig up rewards as you play and cheer you on whenever you level up.</p>
<p>We know you're thinking it too, and yes, you can pet all of them in the Shelter. <em>Thank god</em>.</p>
<p>The DLC will be listed for a minimum price of <strong>$1.99</strong> on Steam, with all proceeds going to the French animal charity <a href="https://one-voice.fr/en/">One Voice</a>. Come on, there's something particularly sweet about protecting both virtual <em>and</em> real animals, right?</p>
<p>Here's a handful of screenshots and the official DLC rundown from the Celestial Haven <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4116520/Astral_Ascent__Celestial_Haven/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Celestial Haven DLC</strong> creates a cozy new spot in main hub where your lovely companions will get together, play and rest.</p>
<p>But they're not just cute: they're valuable companions you can bring along on your explorations. They’ll assist you during the runs by using its instincts to sniff out and dig up special rewards across the rooms. As good pets, they’ll follow you everywhere and celebrate your victories — from defeating a tough Zodiac to perfecting a room.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We had a wonderful time with Astral Ascent when it launched on Switch a few years back, calling it "probably the best roguelike since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a>" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/astral-ascent">our review</a>. Throw in some pettable animals for good measure, and we'd say you're onto a winner.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/logitech-g502-hero-gaming-mouse-is-going-for-peanuts-amazon-clears-out-last-units-at-47-off.1343251/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You know it: your gaming mouse is what makes… or breaks your performance. That split-second delay, the cursor skipping across the screen during a flick shot, or buttons that don’t register fast enough-all deal breakers when you’re trying to rank up. The Logitech G502 Hero has been a favorite among serious gamers for years and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5326/">Amazon just dropped the price from $69 down to $37 as they clear out remaining stock</a>. This<strong> 46% discount</strong> brings one of the most respected gaming mice down to impulse-buy territory.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5326/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Precision That Matters in Games</h2>
<p>The Hero 25K sensor tracks with 1:1 accuracy over a range from 100 to 25,600 DPI, which means the cursor goes exactly where you want it without any smoothing, filtering, or acceleration messing with your muscle memory. High DPI settings let you make huge sweeping movements with tiny hand motions, perfect for fast-paced shooters where you need to whip around instantly. Lower DPI gives you pixel-perfect precision for sniping or editing work when you need that surgical control.</p>
<p>The adjustable weight system lets you change how the mouse feels in your hand by <strong>adding up to five 3.6-gram weights or taking them away</strong>. Some gamers like a light mouse to move quickly around, while some like it with more heft for stability and control. You’ll be able to try different weight configurations until you find what feels right for how you grip the mouse and what games you play.</p>



<p>The <strong>11 programmable buttons</strong> give you instant access to abilities, macros or commands without reaching for your keyboard. Map your most-used actions to thumb buttons, assign weapon switches to side clicks or set up complex macro sequences for MMOs and MOBAs. The <strong>onboard memory stores up to five profiles</strong> directly on the mouse so your settings follow you to LAN parties, friend’s houses, or tournament setups without needing to reinstall software.</p>
<p>The <strong>RGB lighting syncs with other Logitech G gear</strong> via Lightsync technology and lets you coordinate colors across your whole setup. You can match your team colors, set up reactive lighting that responds to in-game events or just pick colors that look good on your desk. The lighting isn’t just aesthetic either: you can set different colors for different DPI levels so you know at a glance which sensitivity you’re running.</p>
<p>The <strong>wired connection eliminates any sort of battery anxiety or input lag</strong> that a wireless mouse may introduce. You never have to stop mid-game to charge it, never have drops in connection during clutch moments, and never have to deal with added weight from batteries. The braided cable resists tangling and holds up better than its rubber-coated alternatives, which inevitably crack and fray.</p>
<p>For $37, this mouse is cheaper than going out to dinner but upgrades a piece of hardware you touch for hours every single day.</p>

                <p>Vampire Survivors has spawned a wave of games inspired by it in the years since it was first released, and Warhammer Survivors is the next game set in this genre of endless hordes and power-ups. Featuring characters and weapons from both Warhammer 40K and Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, Warhammer Survivors is a co-production between Auroch Digital and Vampire Survivors developer Poncle, using the same engine that powers the roguelite survivors game it's inspired by. It's scheduled to launch in 2026 for PC via Steam.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5E_EaxN1qo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P5E_EaxN1qo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Like Vampire Survivors, the focus will be on taking down waves of enemies, powering up your character, and evolving your weapons. You can choose to play in the sci-fi world of Warhammer 40K or the fantasy realm of Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, and the roster includes characters like Malum Caedo, Neave Blacktalon, and more.</p><p>As for the weapons, Auroch Digital says you can expect favorites like the Astartes chainsword, whirlwind axes, and Bolter gun, and once combined with certain power-ups, players will be able to clear the screen of any heretics.</p><p>This is just one of several Warhammer 40K games in development, as fans of the franchise can also look forward <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-announced-coming-next-year-to-pc/1100-6534085/" data-ref-id="1100-6534085">Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War 4</a> on PC next year.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-announced-very-unexpected-spin-off-out-now/1100-6531732/" data-ref-id="1100-6531732"> Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2</a> was officially revealed in May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-now-in-development/1100-6530114/" data-ref-id="1100-6530114">Space Marine 3 is in development</a>, and Rogue Trader studio Owlcat Games is working on a new CRPG, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-announced-from-rogue-trader-studio/1100-6531733/" data-ref-id="1100-6531733">called Dark Heresy</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>According to research from analytics firm Ampere Analysis (per <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/consumers-spend-twice-as-much-on-video-game-remakes-than-remasters-according-to-research/">VGC</a>), over the last two years, players spent twice as much on remakes of video games compared to remasters. It's no secret that players are, for the most part, fond of a good remake and remaster. In the last two years (2024-2025), according to Ampere, across Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation, 72.4 million players spent approximately $1.4 billion on remakes and remasters and microtransactions related to them.</p>



<p>Between January 2024 and September 2025, a period during which 15 remakes were released and 27 remasters, on average, players spent 2.2x more on remakes. Of course, there are a lot of factors here, like how remakes cost more to make, and as a result, cost more for players to buy. Remasters can cost less to make, but, as Ampere puts it, they "<em>offer faster turnaround and lower cost, but generally deliver less engagement</em>."</p>



<p>That's not always the case; The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is a huge exception in that period between January 2024 and September 2025, a game that continues to sell well and even as of last week is <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tops-us-sales-charts-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima-covid-era-numbers/">one of the top-five best-selling premium games in the US in 2025 so far</a>. Over <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-registered-9-million-players/">9 million players</a> have stepped back into Oblivion, and according to Ampere, it reached $180 million in consumer spending and 7 million monthly active users on PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam at its peak.</p>



<p>Senior analyst at Ampere Analysis, Katie Holt added, "<em>As games and IP development costs escalate, publishers are increasingly raiding their back catalogues for cost-effective remakes and remasters. Publishers deciding between a full remake versus a remaster have to balance franchise planning, investment risk, age of content, platform support, and more when choosing which route to take</em>."</p>



<p>Remakes and remasters have become a massive part of the industry over the last decade, and there's no sign of that changing anytime soon. But with this research in mind, it'll be interesting to see if/how the approach to remasters and remakes changes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher AdHoc Studio has revealed that its episodic adventure game-slash-management sim&nbsp;<em>Dispatch&nbsp;</em>has reached a major sales milestone within its first ten days on release.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:zeyme7h7gsicdx2zt2mjwlu5/post/3m4r2a5kiww23" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, the studio begins by saying that selling "80 million copies" in the space of two days "would've been nice", but that managing to sell a million within ten days is "still pretty good".</p>

<p>That's likely including sales on both PC and PlayStation 5, where the game's first four episodes are currently available. Episodes 5 and 6 will launch tomorrow, while the concluding Episodes 7 and 8 will arrive next week.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-sales-1m-management.jpg?itok=c7K4awwQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-sales-1m-management.jpg?itok=PhR3MRTT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dispatch&nbsp;</em>isn't just a Telltale-esque adventure game, but a management sim as well.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dispatch</em>, it's a "superhero workplace comedy" created by AdHoc Studio, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-telltale-employees-go-on-to-form-adhoc-studio" rel="nofollow">formed from the ashes</a> of Telltale following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/updatedtelltale-games-begins-closing-entering-assignment-proceedings" rel="nofollow">the latter's dissolution back in 2018</a>. The studio also incorporates former personnel from studios like Ubisoft and&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree</em>'s Night School.</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Dispatch&nbsp;</em>sees you playing as a dispatcher who must send superheroes around the city to combat crime. It's up to you to decide which hero's power set and personality best match each crime as it comes up.</p>

<p>Of course, this being a game created by former Telltale staffers, there's also a choice-based adventure element in which you'll buld relationships, learn more about your colleagues, and make decisions that affect the way the story progresses.</p>

<p><em>Dispatch&nbsp;</em>boasts a pretty prestigious voice cast as well as its all-star development team; actors like&nbsp;<em>Breaking Bad</em>'s Aaron Paul,&nbsp;<em>Hades II</em>'s Erin Yvette, and <i>The Last of Us II</i>'s Laura Bailey are part of the cast, among other big names.</p>




<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Dispatch&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013259" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, where the first four episodes are waiting for you.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial statement for the second quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year (as well as the first half of the year as a whole), and it looks like Switch 2 games like&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>are selling pretty well.</p>

<p>As part of its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fiscal results</a>, Nintendo has revealed sales numbers for games released within the last few months, and&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>is currently sitting pretty at 9.57 million sales. Given that the Switch 2 itself has sold just over 10 million units to date, that's a pretty high adoption rate for the racer.</p>

<p>3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, meanwhile, has racked up 3.49 million sales for itself, and given that&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong&nbsp;</em>is perhaps not quite as powerful an IP as&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>when it comes to moving units (although there's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-super-mario-odyssey-team" rel="nofollow">developer in common</a> in this case), that's not bad at all.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-financials.jpg?itok=GuYQhjjn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-financials.jpg?itok=eNCRXiI2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sales of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>have been pretty strong so far.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, in the same period, <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</i>still managed to rack up 1.37 million sales, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-mario-party-jamboree-whole-party-and-then-some" rel="nofollow">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>&nbsp;</em>wasn't far behind, likely boosted by the Switch 2 Edition that launched back in July.</p>

<p>This quarter saw Nintendo's sales and operating profit leap when compared to the same period last year, as you'd probably expect given that the Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">was released in June</a> (which technically sits in the first quarter of the year).</p>

<p>According to Nintendo, sales slowed slightly during this quarter "compared to the high demand seen immediately following" the Switch 2's launch, but the console still managed to shift 4.54 million units between July and September.</p>

<p>All told, it's more good news for Nintendo, and it suggests the company might well have been justified in reportedly asking for 25 million Switch 2 units to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-25m-production-report" rel="nofollow">manufactured by March next year</a>.</p>

              <p>VR headsets open up gaming, entertainment and productivity in ways that a regular screen just can’t match but the entry price usually makes you hesitate. The Meta Quest 3S 128GB normally sells for $299 on Meta’s official website with nothing extra included.: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/">undercuts that price by $10, dropping it to $289, and throws in an exclusive Cardboard Hero Bundle for Gorilla Tag worth $45</a> that includes the Handiwork Helmet, Handiwork Armor, and 1000 shiny rocks.</p>
<p>You’re essentially <strong>getting $55 in extra value compared to buying directly from Meta</strong>, which explains why Amazon moved over 10,000 units in the past month alone. And you also get a 3-month Meta Horizon+ trial subscription.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mixed Reality That Actually Makes Sense</h2>
<p>The Quest 3S brings mixed reality right into your living room and merges digital objects with your real environment. You could place a virtual screen on your actual wall, play a game where aliens climb through your real furniture or set up multiple browser windows floating around your desk while still seeing your keyboard and coffee mug.</p>
<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor gives the Quest a double boost in graphical performance for smoother-running games with sharper details, and less stuttering during extreme action scenes. The high-definition resolution makes text readable when you’re browsing the web or working in the virtual space, solving one of the biggest complaints about earlier VR headsets where everything looked fuzzy.</p>
<p>The <strong>128GB storage gives you room for dozens of games and apps</strong> without constantly deleting things just to make space. Most VR games run from 2-10GB, so you can have your favorites installed alongside your productivity apps, social platforms, and entertainment content. Wireless freedom means no cables tethering to a PC or gaming console-just put on and jump into what you want to do.</p>



<p>With Touch Plus controllers, you get precision in games and apps while realistic haptic feedback lets you feel textures, impacts, and interactions. Ditch controllers entirely and use hand tracking to swipe through menus, grab virtual objects, or gesture in social spaces. The flexibility of switching between controller precision for gaming and natural hand movements for casual browsing makes the system adapt to whatever you’re doing, not force you into one control scheme.</p>



<p><strong>Home Theater Mode turns any room into your personal cinema</strong> with a massive virtual screen in front of you while it dimmers your surroundings. You can watch movies, sports, or YouTube on a screen that feels bigger than most people’s actual TVs while you lounge on your couch. You can plug in any standard headphones using a USB-C adapter into the 3.5mm headphone jack or plug in USB-C headphones directly for private audio that doesn’t disturb anyone else in the house.</p>
<p>The <strong>3-month Meta Horizon+ trial subscription</strong> includes access to a rotating catalog of games with new additions each month, giving you plenty to explore right out of the box without buying individual titles immediately.</p>
<p>The Amazon-exclusive Gorilla Tag bundle adds immediate value for one of VR’s most popular multiplayer games. Gorilla Tag has millions of players running around virtual playgrounds using arm movements to climb and jump, and the Cardboard Hero gear gives your character a unique look right from the start. The $45 value of this bonus content combined with the $10 price reduction makes Amazon’s deal mathematically better than buying from Meta directly.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendos-patent-in-palworld-dispute-is-being-reexamined-by-uspto/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-patent-in-palworld-dispute-is-being-reexamined-by-uspto.1343191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A significant development has transpired in Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against Palworld, as one of their patents is being reexamined by the US Patent Office. </p>



<p>For those wondering, in September 2025, Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-acquires-another-patent-for-character-summons-as-palworld-lawsuit-continues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired a patent</a> amid its lawsuit against Palworld. The patent in question, US Patent No. 12,403,397, relates to summoning characters and allowing them to engage in combat against one another. Now, the USPTO director has personally ordered the office to reexamine the patent. </p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-patent-against-palworld-is-being-reexamined-due-to-two-prior-art-references">Nintendo’s Patent Against Palworld is Being Reexamined Due to Two Prior Art References</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesFray</a>, USPTO Director John A. Squires has&nbsp;personally&nbsp;ordered,&nbsp;at his own initiative, that the organisation reexamines Nintendo’s patent against Palworld due to two older US patent applications. US Patent No. 12,403,397’s claims 1, 13, 25, and 26 are the ones under review, and if they fall, then the other ones will fall as well, like “a house of cards.” The reexamination is being conducted due to the failure to cite prior art references in support of the issuance of this patent </p>



<p>The two prior art references have been specified as well. Nintendo’s ‘397 patent is related to character summons in combat, and it seems Konami and Nintendo itself have patents that can be considered prior art. Konami’s patent application was filed in 2001 and published in 2002. The other is Nintendo’s own patent application, which was filed in 2019 and published in 2020. Both of these prior art references “teach a player being allowed to perform a battle in a manual mode and in a simpler, automatic mode.”</p>



<p>For those wondering, reexamination doesn’t mean the patent will be revoked. Nintendo will have two months to come up with a response, and during that time, third parties can also present challenges through other prior art references. Moreover, if Nintendo tries to sue over patent ‘397 in a United States District Court, the “court would stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the reexamination.”</p>



<p>The director initiated the order for Ex Parte Reexamination to address the element that the original examiner believed made Nintendo’s patent distinct from the prior art. Moreover, there might not be any more developments in Nintendo’s lawsuit against Palworld in this calendar year. But, 2026 should see some decisions come into play by Presiding Judge Motoyuki Nakashima. </p>



<p>Regarding the lawsuit, one of Nintendo’s anti-Palworld patents was recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendos-anti-palworld-patent-application-gets-rejected-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rejected in Japan</a>. Additionally, the Switch 2 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-10-million-sales-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed 10 million units sold</a>.

(Notably, Kill Bill <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair-to-hit-theaters-later-this-year-complete-with-all-new-anime-sequence">is set for re-release on December 5</a> as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair">Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</a>, a fresh, newly-combined version of the two Kill Bill films — something that would be well-timed for a Fortnite crossover.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a separate tease, a collection of Fortnite characters appeared yesterday at a LA Dodgers victory celebration, holding up signs and posing for photos with fans. Banana hero Peely, hotdog man The Brat, and rapper pickle Big Dill were spotted by fan <a href="https://twitter.com/Reetlol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1985521856028565880%7Ctwgr%5Ecf08f4a5fb977123883191ca1ce2b3f06cd9c585%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Ffortnite-chapter-seven-teases-kill-bill-crossover-points-to-usa-setting" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reetlol</a>, and can be seen holding signs saying "Game 7 first, Chapter Seven Next!!," "Seven," and "Nov 29" — a date fans now think is when we'll get a first glimpse at Chapter Seven.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr">👀 <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Fortnite</a> <a href="https://t.co/GHAsz9OuzC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GHAsz9OuzC</a></p>— JOGO Reet (@Reetlol) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reetlol/status/1985521856028565880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite has always labelled the different incarnations of its battle royale map as different "chapters" of the game (which are then sub-divided into seasons). But this one, fans have noticed, is being referred to as Chapter <em>Seven</em>, spelt out, rather than the usual Chapter 7 numbering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seven holds a big significance in Fortnite lore (and thankfully no, it's nothing to do with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skrilla-claims-viral-hit-doot-doot-6-7-is-in-gta-6-im-going-to-be-my-own-person-on-there-playing-my-own-music">the 6-7 meme</a>). Throughout Fortnite's first five years, The Seven were slowly revealed as a heroic team of characters who defended the game's multiverse, and who led the charge during the game's big story events (such as the one where the original Chapter 1 Island got sucked into a black hole). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the years, The Seven's helmeted heroes were revealed to include characters played by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Brie Larsen, though after Chapter 3's grand finale, the team's story was abruptly concluded, with their members seemingly defeated and dispursed. More recent Chapters have acted as something of a reset of the game's narrative, following the departure of Epic Games' previous creative lead Donald Mustard, though fans have long held out hope of seeing The Seven once again. In a Chapter named after them, surely it's finally time?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Separately, numerous Fortnite leakers have claimed that the Chapter Seven map will include a large desert biome, with mention of an "Area 51" style location. FortniteLeaks, meanwhile, has specifically reported that the game will feature a weapon called the Gambler Shotgun — "which is related to one of the major themes of the map."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, fans are putting two and two together and arriving at the idea of Chapter Seven featuring a Nevada-style location, and have suggested a crossover with another upcoming franchise: Fallout. The game has already featured Fallout in the shape of an outfit sporting the franchise's power suit. But with new episodes of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout TV series</a> scheduled to debut from December 17, fans have wondered whether a larger collaboration is also now on the cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until then, there's three weeks left of Fortnite's really very enjoyable The Simpsons era to enjoy, before a big live event on November 29 that's expected to usher in Chapter Seven — and whatever it holds — in style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Medios y Media/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

I was a little upset about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That actually was a lot of the reason for me being a little sour at that time. Because I was like yo, WTF guys? This s**t’s awesome. Let’s keep going. Let’s finish this s**t.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have had snippets of information about GTA 5’s fabled story DLC over the years. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-gta-6-waiting-in-the-wings-fans-find-possible-evidence-of-cut-gta-5-story-dlc-canned-bully-2"><u>GTA dataminers have also discovered a reference to Trevor with a jetpack</u></a>, which suggests story mode DLC was repurposed into GTA Online, as Robino said. In 2018, Rockstar finally unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-5/The_Doomsday_Heist"><u>GTA Online's Doomsday Heist missions</u></a> alongside the Thruster jetpack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking on the <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=-F5wXQ6TeJHbbkfI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lex Fridman podcast</a>, Rockstar Games co-founder and former lead writer Dan Houser has addressed this DLC for the first time, insisting that if the developer had continued with it, it wouldn’t have been able to make 2018’s Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The internet knows we made a DLC… single-player DLC for GTA 5 that never came out,” Houser said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was one when you played as Trevor, but he was a secret agent. It was cute. It never quite came together, and it was never finished. It was about half done when it got abandoned. But I think if that had come out, we probably wouldn’t have gotten to make Red Dead 2. So, there are always compromises.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the first time Houser has addressed the canceled GTA 5 story DLC, but it turns out there’s another project he would have loved to have made while he was at the studio: GTA Zombies. “I liked the idea of it, it was a GTA zombie game,” he said. “That would have been funny. I think that could have been quite fun.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every GTA Game Ranked</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA fans often lament the loss of single-player story DLC for GTA 5 after it did so well for previous GTA games. Houser said he remains a big fan of single-player DLC, and is hoping to make some as part of his new company, Absurd Ventures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I like making the stories,” he said. “For me, I love the model of GTA 4 when you had the extra stories coming afterwards, or Red Dead 1 when you had the zombie pack coming afterwards. I like just doing these extra things. So, I would personally like to have done more of that in that company. And with stuff we’re doing in the future, we’re going to try and come up with worlds where we can add more stories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I like single-player DLC. I just think the audience loves it, and it’s really fun to make.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/gettyimages-2237849657-1762257766339.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dan Houser at 2025 Los Angeles Comic Con.

In September, he said he felt "absolutely nothing" inside for GTA 6 because he’s never been a fan of video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a number of revelations in Lex Fridman’s Dan Houser interview, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-question-if-you-can-even-make-a-good-open-world-spy-game-rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-finally-explains-why-agent-never-happened">the fate of canceled PS3 exclusive Agent</a>, and Houser’s thoughts on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-needed-guns-you-needed-these-larger-than-life-characters-rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-explains-why-grand-theft-auto-wont-leave-the-united-states">why GTA won’t leave the United States in terms of setting</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Microsoft has debuted a new advertisement for Xbox Game Pass aimed at reminding people that they don't have to wait very long to play more games. The "New Games Added All The Time" ad focuses on a sad-looking, tired person sitting inside a disc-return box waiting for someone to return a game so they can play it. This is meant to highlight how people used to rent games at places like Blockbuster but had to wait, in some cases at least, for people to return their copies.</p><p>"That was then," the ad states before cutting to the person sitting at their desk at home and booting up a game from the Game Pass library. "Now, new games are added all the time," the ad says.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5IJn83bV_8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q5IJn83bV_8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Microsoft normally adds games to Game Pass across two waves each month, and there are currently <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 850 titles</a> available to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p><p>While it's true Microsoft adds more and more games to the Game Pass library on an ongoing basis, the company also removes games twice a month as well. For October, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games#consoleleavingsoon" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the titles set for removal is Stalker 2</a>, and some people are complaining about this given it was heavily promoted by Microsoft as an Xbox console exclusive.</p><p>It's being removed this month presumably due to the expiration of an agreement, as the game lands on PS5 on November 20, which is exactly one year after the game came to Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Microsoft recently announced a huge price hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, raising the monthly cost from $20 to $30. Most major retailers have not adopted the price hike, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now/1100-6535504/" data-ref-id="1100-6535504">Game Pass Ultimate remains $20 at GameStop, Amazon, Best Buy, and others.</a></p>
