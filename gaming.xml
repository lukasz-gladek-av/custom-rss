            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dice-throne-announces-industry-veteran-as-ceo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A tabletop industry veteran has just been announced as CEO of development studio, Dice Throne. The company has a consistent track record of well-received titles, and with a new head at the helm, that quality has the potential to grow.</p>

<h2>The New Dice Throne CEO Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a press release, Dice Throne has announced Casey Sershon as their CEO. Sershon has over a decade of experience in the tabletop industry. He served as Senior Director of Business and Development at The Op, playing an active role in every part of the business, including helping the development team make <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-dice-throne-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Marvel Dice Throne</em></a> and <em>X-Men Dice Throne</em>.</p>

It is a competitive board game where players roll dice and play cards to manipulate those dice results to beat their opponents. It debuted in 2018 and has remained consistently popular, spawning waves of supplements and several successful Kickstarter projects. Its most recent, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dicethrone/dice-throne-outcasts" rel="nofollow"><em>Outcasts</em></a>, raised more than $1.6 million.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;"Joining Dice Throne is an honor. This team and the community around it are something special, and their passion for these games is unrivaled. I plan to preserve and build upon what Nate has had such a pivotal role in creating so fans can trust that what they love about Dice Throne is here to stay,” explains Casey Sershon, CEO of Dice Throne. “My top priority will be expanding on the incredible community we’ve fostered and continuing the company’s growth. I’m excited to leverage my game industry experience to help the brand reach new heights and fans. The surface of Dice Throne’s potential has barely been scratched.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sershon's new role of CEO begins at the cusp of a tumultuous time for the tabletop industry. As the United States has sworn in convicted felon and President Donald Trump for a second term, his proposed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deep-regrets-developer-voices-potential-impact-of-imposing-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a> may have an adverse effect on tabletop prices across the entire industry. Offsetting such production costs will be a challenge for all involved.</p>

That said, <em>Origins </em>is far from a by-the-books <em>Dynasty Warriors </em>game. The shift to a central main character in lieu of a huge roster of <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms </em>heroes has stirred controversy among fans, but also, there’s a world map now! The story has branching paths! You can pursue Lu Bu in a vaguely Persona-style social link! I’ll let you decide how romantic that last one is for yourself.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195734" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195734,196411,195189" data-current="195734"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21246.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Point is, <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> has many quirks for both series newbies and longtime fans to learn. And while I never felt that any of the game’s underlying mechanics were especially obtuse as a hyper-casual Musou fan, I did have to learn some basic lessons the hard way. So to help you out on your journey, here are five tips that I wish I knew when I started <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</em></p><h2 id="h32448"><a id="weapons"></a>Study your weapon’s moveset</h2><figure id="" data-id="f87798a87915ddeda07f2ac8b0e156fb" data-recommend-id="image://f87798a87915ddeda07f2ac8b0e156fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins. The protagonist is attacking a warrior in a snowy battleground. He is in the air spinning around with his sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins. The protagonist is attacking a warrior in a snowy battleground. He is in the air spinning around with his sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f87798a87915ddeda07f2ac8b0e156fb" data-recommend-id="image://f87798a87915ddeda07f2ac8b0e156fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins. The protagonist is attacking a warrior in a snowy battleground. He is in the air spinning around with his sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’ve played older <em>Warriors </em>games, your muscle memory may default to the series’ classic combo system of mashing basic attacks and ending your series of blows with a unique heavy attack finisher. However, only a couple weapons really work like that here. Other weapons have unique gimmicks that radically change the way you play. You can button mash your way to victory in many battles, but you’ll leave a lot of power on the table if you don’t utilize your equipped weapon’s mechanics.</p><p>For this reason, I strongly recommend reviewing your weapon’s moveset description in your main menu throughout the gamer. You might not master each weapon immediately after trying them out, but with enough practice you can pull off some absolutely brutal combos against bosses and armies alike. You’ll also unlock new attacks as you level up your proficiency with each weapon, which can be easy to forget about as you breeze through the results screen of each battle. If you use Twin Pikes and you don’t run around flailing your pole-arms in front of you while you <em>KatamariDamacy</em> a ball of enemy soldiers in front of you, you’ve never really used Twin Pikes at all.</p><h2 id="h32449"><a id="fight"></a>Don’t bother fighting every skirmish</h2><figure id="" data-id="4cd77c2db385c2258096ae957fd69cb1" data-recommend-id="image://4cd77c2db385c2258096ae957fd69cb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The main character is on the world map, where he towers over the small mountains and cities around him. A girl with a quest marker on her head and a conspicuous white circle are seen in front of him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Very early in the game, you’ll see Skirmishes appear on the world map. These are typically short optional battles that award some extra experience points, but you shouldn’t stop and fight every Skirmish you see. These fights all respawn regularly, so you’re bound to see the same encounters pop up even after you’ve cleared them several times. You can get some nice rewards, but they primarily exist for grinding.</p><p>This isn’t to be confused with Missions, which look like Skirmishes on the map but feature an orange outline and a soldier standing atop them. These can give you valuable rewards and permanent upgrades, so they are absolutely worth completing ASAP. Also, some allies may specifically ask you to complete a battle that looks like a Skirmish on the map, which you shouldn’t ignore.</p><h2 id="h32450"><a id="allies"></a>Some allies aren’t worth saving</h2><figure id="" data-id="80023d46ce9b9a790e8e6ea0d420592c" data-recommend-id="image://80023d46ce9b9a790e8e6ea0d420592c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The main character is on a grey horse as he charges into battle alongside his army." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="80023d46ce9b9a790e8e6ea0d420592c" data-recommend-id="image://80023d46ce9b9a790e8e6ea0d420592c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins. The main character is on a grey horse as he charges into battle alongside his army." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the throes of battle, you’ll inevitably see allied officers who ask for your assistance. They’ll immediately recover their health if you rush to them in time, and battles flow smoother the more allies you keep alive. Unfortunately, you’ll also come across instances in which an ally just isn’t worth saving, as morbid as that sounds. If an officer rushes into a huge army by himself, you’ll put the entire mission in jeopardy by rushing after him.</p><p>In battles where your allies are spread out across a huge battlefield, you can wind up doing more harm than good by wasting time rushing after everyone. In fact, sometimes the best thing you can do for your army is to conquer nearby bases and defeat enemy officers in front of you, which can raise your army’s morale and give them the strength to succeed on their own. There’s no hard science for when you should and shouldn’t play the savior, just know that sometimes the cold and calculating option is the most compassionate.</p><h2 id="h32451"><a id="upgrades"></a>Only spend money on essential weapon upgrades</h2><figure id="" data-id="5cc4a5eeb838f4dbbc8395c2f485d5bc" data-recommend-id="image://5cc4a5eeb838f4dbbc8395c2f485d5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the weapon menu in Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The protagonist has the ring weapon equipped, it’s stats show it has a +8 modifier with three additional traits." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Shops on the world map will routinely update with new weapons you can purchase, and at a glance, these will look like huge upgrades. We’re talking upwards of 50-percent increases to your weapon’s attack stat, so how could you turn that down? </p><p>In actuality, you often don’t <em>need </em>those huge upgrades the moment you see them. You’ll typically find even better weapons as loot in combat, making those purchases largely wasteful. Even worse, money is surprisingly scarce unless you obsessively grind, so you’ll quickly run your cash reserves dry by overspending. Occasional weapon upgrades help if you’re struggling with a tough battle and you haven’t gotten lucky with your weapon drops, but otherwise you should save your money.</p><h2 id="h32452"><a id="point"></a>’Points-of-no-return’ are spelled out clearly</h2><figure id="" data-id="d023c40c6e58bab2ca2da2ca9b8a4cec" data-recommend-id="image://d023c40c6e58bab2ca2da2ca9b8a4cec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The protagonist walks up a grassy hill towards a tree with pink leaves" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As you progress in the main story, characters will start making a big to-do about how you’ll need to align yourself with one of the game’s three factions. You must inevitably romance one of the three kingdoms, if you will. This will come to head during Chapter Three, but even then, you’ll see a warning about any crucial decision point before it happens. Your points of no return can involve choosing which side of a battle you’ll fight for before you engage, which will break your relationship with whichever faction you oppose. In other words, it’s not going to take you by surprise.</p><p>Which allies should you align yourself with on your first playthrough? I’ll leave that decision up to you, though I will say that <strong>Sun Jian’s initial battles in chapter 3 are worth experiencing on your first run through, even if you ultimately don’t ally with them</strong>. Just know that you’ll eventually unlock the ability to check out the story paths you initially missed, so don’t stress your decisions here too much. Follow your heart, carve your own path, and enjoy stacking up a pile of a thousand enemy corpses in a matter of minutes. It’s all in good fun, I assure you. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Game Developer Conference organisers have <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">shared the results</a> of this year's State of the Game Industry survey - intended to provide a snapshot of current trends and sentiments among developers - revealing, among other things, that one in ten respondents lost their jobs in 2024, following the devastating wave of layoffs seen across the industry.
</p>
<p>
This year's State of Games Industry report surveyed over 3000 developers across a range of topics, but layoffs were once again front of mind as the widespread industry job cuts of 2023 continued into 2024 - with figures suggesting 13000 employees lost their jobs last year. According to GDC's survey, not only did one in ten developers report having been laid off directly, 41 percent of respondents said they'd felt the impact of layoffs in some way. The area reportedly most affected by layoffs was game narrative at 19 percent.
</p>
<p>
Respondents cited restructuring, declining revenue, and marketing shifts as the main reason for job cuts, with many blaming "specific issues like Covid-era over-expansion, rising production costs, declining player interest, unrealistic expectations for the 'next big hit', poor leadership and mismanagement" as the reason why layoffs have continued to impact the games industry.

<p>
Elsewhere, unionisation remains a talking point, with one-fifth of respondents saying they'd discussed unionising over the past 12 months. 29 percent said their companies were supportive of the discussions, while 19 percent were mixed and 12 percent opposed unionisation.
</p>
<p>
GDC also questioned respondents on average working hours, with 57 percent saying they worked 40 hours or less a week. 13 percent of those survey worked more than 51 hours per week - up from 8 percent last year - with two-third attributing their hours to self-pressure.
</p><p>
As for the platforms developers are currently focusing their attention on, PC once again leads the charge by a significant margin, with 80 percent of those surveyed saying they were currently developing PC games - up from 66 percent last year. While GDC wasn't able to confidently state a reason for this increase, it speculated a link to the popularity of Steam Deck - with 44 percent expressing an interest in Valve's platform.
</p>
<p>
Over on console, 38 percent of developers reported they're currently making games for PS5, compared to 34 percent for Xbox Series X/S, while 20 percent are developing for Switch. As for Nintendo's recently unveiled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>, eight percent of developers said they're developing for the platform - the same figure reported in last year's GDC survey.
</p>
<p>
Respondents also shared their thoughts on live service gaming - another area generating headlines right now, as studios continue to pull the plug on floundering or still-in-development titles. 42 percent of those surveyed said they weren't interested in working on live service games, but those who saw value in them did so for various reasons: "not only on the financial side, but also in player experience and community building".
</p>
<p>
Those with less enthusiasm blamed "declining player interest, creative stagnation, predatory practices and micro-transactions, and the risk of developer burnout", as well as concerns around market saturation and the difficulty of building a sustainable player base.
</p>
<p>
And as for AI, 30 percent of respondents said they believed AI is having a negative impact on the industry - a 12 percent increase from last year - with many sharing concerns around "intellectual property theft, energy consumption, a decrease in quality from AI-generated content, potential biases within AI programs and regulation issues". Despite these reservations, 52 percent said their companies have implemented generative AI - with respondents in business and finance most likely to use AI tools (51 percent), followed by production and team leadership (41 percent), and community, marketing, and PR (39 percent).
</p><p>
GDC's full State of the Game Industry report can be <a href="https://reg.gdconf.com/state-of-game-industry-2025">downloaded from its website</a> (registration is required) and is well worth a read, offering a fascinating snapshot of current developer sentiment and trends following an extremely challenging year for the industry.

While I can’t yet confirm or deny whether <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> has <em>that </em>much content (I would <em>love </em>to have 300 spare hours to find out), I can say that Omega Force’s latest title almost certainly won’t leave you wanting for stuff to fight.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196884" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Rise Of The Ronin Hides A Cool Nioh Easter Egg" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="163" data-playlist="196884,196646,195207" data-current="196884"><div><p>Rise Of The Ronin Hides A Cool Nioh Easter Egg</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22438.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>My first playthrough took a little over 40 hours to complete.

There’s technically a short prologue chapter too, but it’s only a single tutorial battle to get your feet wet with the combat. Every chapter is roughly equal in terms of length, though you may wind up spending the most time in Chapter Three for reasons I’ll explain below.</p><h2 id="h666366"><a id="story"></a><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>has three branching story paths</h2><figure id="" data-id="dba3025d082e764f69c5152f6415da67" data-recommend-id="image://dba3025d082e764f69c5152f6415da67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

This is standard <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms </em>stuff, so that part shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. From here, you can engage with the three factions on a freelance basis like you’re someone who writes online professionally. But unlike someone who writes online professionally, one of your employers will eventually want to hire you full time. This will lock you into a unique story path for the remainder of Chapter Three, and that will persist into chapters four and five.</p><p>Several unique stages are locked behind each branching story path. Following my first playthrough, my stats indicated that I had only completed 50% of the missions in the game. In other words, there’s a healthy amount of replay value here, which brings me to my final point.</p><figure id="" data-id="eb712e464c098f6ece23c8813466b9a3" data-recommend-id="image://eb712e464c098f6ece23c8813466b9a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The main character is holding what appears to be a polearm as rain falls upon him.</p><h2 id="h666367"><a id="postgame"></a> What’s the postgame like in <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>?</h2><p>True to series tradition, there’s a lot of game to play after you reach the first ending. You’ll surely want to see how those other story paths play out, and <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>gives you great tools to do just that. Here’s everything you’ll unlock once you start your postgame file.</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>You’ll gain the ability to freely replay any battle in the game, including optional missions you might have seen and initially missed. Additionally, you can restart the game from the beginning of any chapter <em>and </em>before any battle that leads to a new story branch depending on how you complete it. Yes, there are branching paths in the branching paths!</li><li>Your level cap will get a permanent increase, adding extra levels to each weapon for you to gain.</li><li>An extra weapon type can be found in the postgame as well, which is so insanely strong that it’s worth the insane amount of cash it costs in the shop. I won’t reveal <em>exactly </em>what it is, but it’s a very fun piece of fan service.</li><li>On top of the new weapon type, a stronger grade of weapons enters the pool too. You can purchase these outright, or you can find them in basic story missions. </li><li>Also, you can upgrade your weapons! This should be familiar to <em>Warriors </em>fans, but you can use spare weapons to both pass on useful traits or bestow raw power upgrades to your favorite armament. This does cost money though, so make sure you don’t blow through your reserves right off the bat.</li><li>Finally, an all new difficulty level is unlocked in the postgame. This changes fundamental rules of the game to skew things in your foes’ favor, but your rewards after each battle will dramatically increase. Also, you’ll find new optional challenges in several battles on this difficulty that will grant powerful new equipment and items upon completion. Do note that this difficulty is <em>really </em>intended for high level players, to the point that you’ll be dramatically underleveled for it even after a full playthrough. You’ll likely need to level up by playing through the other story paths before you challenge the game on this difficulty.  </li></ol><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>could very well require a triple digit number of hours before you accomplish everything it has to offer.

But that aside, if we’re judging solely on how long a game can divert your attention away from doing your dishes, <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> is a solid package as-is.<br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Recently, the team at Battlestate Games rolled out a survey designed to poll Escape from Tarkov players on a variety of topics. In the last few weeks since the most recent wipe hit the game, players worldwide have been suffering under the weight of performance issues, network problems, bugs, and of course, vast swathes of cheaters plaguing the game.</p>



<p>The BSG team revealed that details and results from the most recent survey will be shared online in due course, but for now, they’ve pledged to ‘actively work to resolve’ the key challenges everyone is facing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-promises">Big Promises</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1881773608764092783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on social media</a>, Battlestate Games explained that ‘several technical updates’ are set to hit Escape from Tarkov in the ‘near future’, correcting problems such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Issues causing FPS drops and stuttering in various locations</li>



<li>Issues that caused complete sound loss during raids</li>



<li>Instances where sound was not correctly played indoors</li>



<li>Fixes for issues when loading into a raid as a Scav</li>



<li>Issues where players couldn’t interact with the Lightkeeper due to incorrect spawn points for the Zryachiy and his guards</li>



<li>All causes of invisible bot spawns in raids</li>



<li>Visual adjustments aimed at correcting fog effects on various locations</li>



<li>Issues with item availability and in-game trader quests</li>



<li>Issues where players would receive empty crafts in the “Cultist Circle” module of the Hideout</li>



<li>Client freezing when posting an offer on the flea market for an item found via the “Linked Search” function</li>



<li>Adding a graphics settings parameter: “Disable frame limit in-game when Nvidia Reflex is turned off”</li>



<li>Incorrect functionality of the Cyclone “Shahin” 3.7x thermal scope.</li>
</ul>



<p>Fans were quick to jump on the post and suggest further changes and quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<p>Among the suggestions sat topics like new spawn locations and loot routes on certain maps, more intricate mechanics in the Hideout, and adding more features to PvE that <strong>are not </strong>included in the ‘offline’ mode.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov remains the most popular extraction shooter in the world, even if it is suffering with more than a few issues at present. As always, the cycle will continue – players will start dropping off now to enjoy other games, but by the time the next wipe arrives, they’ll be gearing up to come back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-dmz-2026-rumour-claim/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>As Black Ops 6 surfaced last year, rumours started circulating online regarding the potential revival of DMZ. It was noted by some Call of Duty leakers that DMZ – the failed extraction shooter mode – would be returning in Call of Duty ‘2026’, but since then, the leaks have run relatively silent.</p>



<p>Earlier today, TheGhostOfHope stressed again on social media that DMZ is coming back with whatever Call of Duty game hits the market in 2026.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-time-to-raid">Time to Raid</h2>



<p>Call of Duty’s DMZ mode was released alongside Modern Warfare II and Warzone 2.0 in 2022, and it quickly became a fan-favourite game mode. In DMZ, players were tasked with entering Al-Mazrah, completing tasks, securing loot, killing enemies, and then extracting again without being wiped out.</p>



<p>It was a good enough mode, but the content train faltered very early on and it was ultimately discontinued before it had time to shine. It doesn’t help that it was overshadowed by the bigger and more impactful players in the extraction shooter space like Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>On Twitter (X), TheGhostOfHope posted a ‘small leak on the TL’, claiming:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>DMZ returns as third gamemode in COD2026</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By ‘third gamemode’, the leaker is referring to the mode that sits alongside the campaign and traditional multiplayer offering. In Black Ops 6, that’s a full-fledged COD Zombies offering.</p>



<p>DMZ was a unique enough mode in the Call of Duty space, giving players a massive battle royale map to explore like never before. It empowered users to team up, as well – PvP combat wasn’t the default way forward, and players were even <strong>punished </strong>for killing other raiders. </p>



<p>Do you think DMZ coming back would be a win, or is it a waste of time? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348858/microsoft-edge-game-assist-game-bar-browser<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is rolling out its new in-game browser overlay on Windows 11 this week, after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/23/24303988/microsoft-game-assist-browser-overlay-game-bar-pc-gaming">months of beta testing</a>. The Microsoft Edge Game Assist feature is a widget that appears in the Game Bar in Windows 11 much like Valve’s Steam overlay browser. It’s also game-aware, so it can detect games you’re playing and offer up tips and guides in a little side panel.</p><p>The Game Assist overlay was previously restricted to beta users, but it’s <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2025/01/21/expanding-microsoft-edge-game-assist-preview-to-edge-stable/">now available in the stable version</a> of Microsoft Edge. If you want to enable the in-game browser you can open up Microsoft Edge and go to Settings and more &gt; Settings and then search for Game Assist and install the widget. The Game Assist feature will then be available in the Game Bar, which can be opened with the Windows key + G.</p><p>“The initial preview of Game Assist offers contextual tips and guides for a selection of popular PC games while we optimize the experience based on your feedback,” explains William Devereux, senior product manager for Microsoft Edge. Microsoft has also added support for more popular PC games, including <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, <em>Marvel Rivals,</em> and <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>“We’ll add tips and guides for even more popular games throughout the preview and over time,” says Devereux. “In the meantime, you can still use Game Assist to browse your favorite guides or other websites while playing any game.”</p><p>Game Assist works by using the same cookies, autofill, and favorites data from your main Microsoft Edge browser. Microsoft has also added support for extensions like ad blockers to this Game Assist feature, and it’s planning to add support for keyboard shortcuts in the future, alongside an improved picture-in-picture experience and the ability to add a tab from Microsoft Edge to the sidebar.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s it, right? Well, no. It gets more complicated! </p><p>In 2023, before <em>Aquaman</em>, DC released <em>Blue Beetle</em>.

Got it? Well, if not, just reread this thing or tweet at James Gunn. I’ve tried my best to explain it all and my head hurts so I’m going to go take a nap. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The results of the 13th annual State of the Game Industry Survey have been released, shining a light on how developers feel about all manner of hot-button industry topics, including generative AI.</p><p>The majority of surveyed developers (52%) said they work for companies that use generative AI, with 36% reporting that they personally use such tools for game development. While the majority of surveyed developers are working at companies that use generative AI, 30% of respondents said they believe generative AI is having a negative impact on the video game business (up 12% from 2023). The surveyed developers cited things like IP theft, energy consumption, and AI program biases as contributing to their feelings toward generative AI.</p><p>The survey also founded that Business and Finance roles (51%) were the most likely to use AI tools, with Production and Team Leadership (41%), and Community, Marketing, and PR (49%) following. What's more, the survey found that 28% of developers between ages 18-34 used AI technologies at work, compared to 47% for video game developers over the age of 55.</p><p>AI has been a controversial topic in video games and beyond, in part over fears about job losses. Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">rise in AI will lead to job losses in the short term</a> but will ultimately create more jobs total, just like what happened with previous labor revolutions. Video game actors also remain on strike, due in part to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">concerns about the use of AI. </a></p><p>Outside of AI, the State of the Game Industry study found that men make up 66% of the work force, down from 75% in 2020. Women and non-binary developers account for 32% of all game developers, up from 29% and 24% in the prior years. The percent of respondents identifying as LGBTQ+ was 24%, and white/caucasian developers accounted for 59% of the total game developer base in the study.</p><p>The study also touched upon industry layoffs, with the largest percentage (30%) saying they were not at all concerned about future layoffs. The study organizers said this surprising statistic might have to do with the number of "N/A" responses it got from developers who may have already been laid off. Layoffs in the video game industry were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">rampant in 2024 and have continued in 2025</a>.</p><p>Another data point from the survey found that PC is far and away the most popular platform for developers, with a whopping 80% of respondents saying they were currently making a game for PC. This was followed by PS5 (38%), Xbox Series X|S (34%), Android (29%), and iOS (28%).</p><p>The study also covered live-service games, with the biggest percentage (42%) saying they would not want to make a live-service title as their next game, with only 13% saying they would want to. The live-service game market is big and potentially lucrative, but it's also highly competitive. Sony recently made headlines for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">cancelling two more live-service games, including a God of War title</a>, following a strategic review.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250121745145/en/The-2025-Game-Industry-Survey-Reveals-Increasing-Impact-Of-Layoffs-Concerns-With-The-Usage-Of-Generative-AI-Funding-Challenges-and-More" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">State of the Game Industry study</a> was compiled from more than 3,000 developer responses, published and compiled in partnership between the Game Developers Conference and Omdia. The study is largely drawn from responses from independent and AA studio developers. Only 15% of responses came from AAA developers, down from 18% a year before.</p>

			<p>It's been announced today by Marvel Games and NetEase Games that a special Spring Festival event will be coming to Marvel Rivals. Since its release, this title has been widely successful, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">title already winning awards</a>. The Spring Festival will be coming to Marvel Rivals on January 23 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET / 9 AM GMT, where a new limited-time game mode will be available for players to participate in.</p>
<p>This game mode is called Clash of Dancing Lions and allows players to participate in a 3v3 on a designated map to try and gain possession of the ball and get it over to the scoring zones that are on either side of the field. The first team to reach the designated score will be the winner of the Clash of Dancing Lions event.</p>
<p>By participating in the Clash of Dancing Lions event in Marvel Rivals, players will be able to get limited-time items such as the Star-Lord: Lion's Mane costume, nameplate, and spray. That is just the tip of the reward iceberg, as there is plenty more to unlock, including a Gallery Card customization event named Fortune &amp; Colors.</p>
<p>If you want to see what you can expect from the Marvel Rivals event, you can check out the Spring Festival trailer below, which showcases the Clashing Lions costumes. This includes Star-Lord: Lion's Mane, Iron Fist: Lion's Gaze, and Black Widow: Lion's Heartbeat. These costumes won't all be available to begin with, and will release over the following weeks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Rivals | The Spring Festival Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1ogvqoq09I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition, Marvel Rivals will have a special Spider-Man 2 bundle, which comes with the Advanced Suit 2.0, nameplate, and spray, coming on January 30. This is to celebrate the launch of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PC.</p>
<p>The game has received three patches thus far, with the first season well underway. Players also got to experience Season 0 when the game was first released, which had just under half of the content that Season 1 currently has. Already there are many players flying through the ranks, with the likes of <a href="https://esports.gg/news/marvel-rivals/shroud-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shroud considering creating a Marvel Rivals esports organization</a> because he likes the game so much.</p>
<p>Whether that will come to fruition anytime soon remains to be seen, but as the game continues to remain popular, it's possible that this will become a staple in the esports genre amongst giants like Overwatch 2, Valorant, and League of Legends, for example.</p>

The news was <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1881728578712474019">shared on X</a> and featured a shout out to The Game Awards. </p><p>“To everyone who picked up Balatro after seeing it at <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards">@thegameawards</a>, we hope you’re having an amazing time with it!” the post read. <em>Balatro</em> was featured prominently during The Game Awards, nominated for a number of awards including Game of the Year and winning the best indie, best debut indie, and best mobile categories. </p><p>On X, Wout van Halderen, PR manager for <em>Balatro</em> publisher Playstack, added that the game had sold 3.5 million copies <a href="https://x.com/TheHashtag0nist/status/1881729707521257851">by the first week of December</a>. With The Game Awards taking place the second week in December, the implication is that <em>Balatro</em> received a significant 1.5 million unit bump in sales after being featured during Keighley’s Christmas Commercial telethon. Even more impressive, the 5 million figure is total units sold and doesn’t count the number of downloads the game got for being on the Apple Arcade subscription.</p><p>Since its launch in February, <em>Balatro</em> has quickly become one of the biggest indie hits of 2024. <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/balatro-localthunk-interview">Developed by a single person</a> over the course of two years, the poker roguelike has garnered a reputation for being a well-crafted “number-go-up” game with its developer leaning in on the joke that <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1839702508454687062">it devours players’ free and not-so-free time</a>.</p><div><p>In the 11 months since the game’s release, it’s only gotten small, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278578/balatro-is-getting-more-cards-featuring-other-games">cosmetic</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319769/dont-watch-this-balatro-video">updates</a> but developer LocalThunk has hinted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215342/balatro-free-major-gameplay-update-2025">a major gameplay-focused update</a> is forthcoming this year.</p></div><p>Jimbo help us all. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A tooltip will eventually let you know that you can break boxes around the map to earn additional Materials, but by the time it gives you this information, you may have already passed up a handful of them. </p><p>So, hey, I just figured I’d let you know to <strong>keep an eye out for boxes with a glow around them</strong> because I’m a nice guy who wants you to be able to afford to buy the first Magic Vial from the Craftery, which will net you an extra Relic slot. You’re welcome. No, really, don’t sweat it.</p><h2 id="h32376"><a id="yolvan"></a>Put Yolvan to good use</h2><figure id="" data-id="fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-recommend-id="image://fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A homunculi fires a projectile at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A homunculi fires a projectile at an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-recommend-id="image://fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A homunculi fires a projectile at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>During the game’s opening hour or so, you’ll fight Yolvan and earn him as a Homunculi that you can equip. Since he fires projectiles, <strong>assign Yolvan to your shoulder button attack slot so that you can hold his attack down</strong> while you use melee attacks, too. This can massively improve the speed at which you deplete the Break Gauge of basic enemies, allowing you to pummel them into submission.</p><p>When the Craftery begins selling Mixed Parts (pretty early on), make sure to buy some and use them to <strong>purchase Yolvan’s Eviscerate ability</strong> to make him even more of a force to be reckoned with. Holding down the button for this ability will unleash a tornado attack that stuns several enemies at once while dishing out surprisingly good damage in the process. Since it can hit multiple enemies at once, it’s a pretty great upgrade over his basic attack in most scenarios.</p><h2 id="h32377"><a id="muninn"></a>Always keep Muninn out</h2><figure id="" data-id="348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-recommend-id="image://348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A flying homunculi accompanies the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A flying homunculi accompanies the protagonist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-recommend-id="image://348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A flying homunculi accompanies the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll get Muninn when exploring the Magicite Mine. This Homunculi can be equipped and summoned to accompany you passively. Unlike most Homunculi, this means you don’t have to press any buttons to make Muninn attack.

<p>When was the last time you dove into Diablo Immortal? Following its bout of controversy upon release, namely, the egregious monetization practices that saw many spending hundreds to thousands of dollars on gems and power-ups for their miniature characters on-screen, I dropped the game. However, Blizzard has continuously updated and improved the experience since its launch. They recently dropped a few new updates, addressing player feedback. Here are the Diablo Immortal patch notes for the past week!</p>



<h2 id="h-january-bug-fixes-for-diablo-immortal">January Bug Fixes for Diablo Immortal</h2>



<p>The past few weeks have brought about a handful of bug fixes for Diablo Immortal that vastly improve the game through performance and gameplay tweaks. While they appear minor on the surface, these updates do make a difference!</p>



<h3 id="h-january-21"><strong>January 21</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would become immobile after entering a Wild Brawl match.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-january-14"><strong>January 14</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed minor visual issues in Westmarch.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed performance issues that caused crashes.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>UI</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where several bundles wouldn’t appear in the Shop.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where players couldn’t interact with the Familiar Expeditions menu.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-is-diablo-immortal-worth-playing-now">Is Diablo Immortal Worth Playing Now?</h2>



<p>If you tried to play Diablo Immortal previously, specifically a year or so ago, then you’re probably a little jaded on the mobile ARPG. But if you’ve yet to try it, now’s an excellent time. At the end of last year, specifically in December, Blizzard pumped out a few updates that genuinely improved the game. There’s word the studio intends to reduce the overall cost of gems, too. That’s a huge boon to current and returning players.</p>



<p>If you don’t have a powerful computer or gaming console for Diablo IV and Path of Exile 2, then Diablo Immortal will suffice for the time being.</p>



<p>What’s your favorite class in Diablo Immortal? Let us know in the comments below, or visit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forum</a> to discuss the ARPG!</p>



<hr>



<p>If you do play Diablo IV, don’t forget to jump into the new season—Season of Witchcraft. You’ll find the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-season-7-start-date-and-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start date and time here</a>!</p>
