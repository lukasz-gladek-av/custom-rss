<p>There was never any doubt that the <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> would bring some heat in the merch department on the run-up to launch. Nintendo may have its Talking Flower primed and ready to go as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Mario Wonder Switch 2</a> tie-in (brand synergy, and all that), but we dare you to take one look at the 'Nintendo The Super Mario Galaxy Movie: Hatchin' Yoshi Interactive Toy' (catchy, right?) and <em>not</em> tell us that it's adorable.</p>
<p>The name is pretty self-explanatory on this one. Hatchin' Yoshi is an interactive toy that sees our beloved dino 'hatch' from his eggshell casing and then respond to touch and voice commands. He can rock back and forth, shake his little head, say his name — come on, what else do you expect from the little fella?</p>
<p>All of this cuteness doesn't come cheap, mind you. The Yoshi toy is now available to pre-order from <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smythstoys.com%2Fuk%2Fen-gb%2Ftoys%2Ffashion-and-dolls%2Finteractive-pets%2Fnintendo-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hatchin-yoshi-interactive-toy-egg%2Fp%2F254238&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Smyths Toys</a> here in the UK for <strong>£59.99</strong>, with <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/205546/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FYSH-INA-Interactive-Hatching%2F17692502283" rel="sponsored noopener">Walmart</a>'s <strong>$49.88</strong> pre-orders opening in North America soon. According to the Smyths listing, the toy is expected to launch in early April, which perfectly lines up with the Galaxy Movie's new release date.</p>

<p>This is the latest 'hatching' toy from Spin Master, the company behind the similar '<a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smythstoys.com%2Fuk%2Fen-gb%2Ftoys%2Ffashion-and-dolls%2Fhatchimals%2Fc%2FSM06010426&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Hatchimals</a>' and '<a href="https://www.spinmaster.com/en-US/brands/primal-hatch/">Primal Hatch</a>' ranges. Hey, the kids are clearly all about eggs these days.</p>
<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will arrive in cinemas on 1st April. Nintendo came in hot with some fresh posters last week, and short TV spots and official trailers continue to show us more of what's in store. Let's hope Nintendo and Illumination still have a few surprises up their sleeve in time for the premiere.</p>

            <p>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has become the latest game to have its initially listed recommended RAM requirement yanked down by a substantial amount, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-gets-updated-system-requirements-with-iois-apologies">following in the footsteps</a> of fellow 2026 release 007: First Light.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Developers TT Games announced in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215200/view/509605417596223740">Steam post</a> that the recommended RAM number for da bat's latest adventure now sits at 16GB rather than the initially announced 32GB.</p>
<p>"Please note, our PC specs at this stage are not final," the studio added, citing this revision as being the product of some ongoing testing. "We will be continuing to optimize and make improvements as we move closer to launch." The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215200/LEGO_Batman_Legacy_of_the_Dark_Knight/">rest of the specs</a>, including an Intel Core i7-12700K or AMD Ryzen 7 7700X CPU and GeForce RTX 3080 with 10GB or Radeon RX 6800 XT with 16GB, remain as they were for now, An SSD is also still listed as a hard requirement in both the recommended and minimum specs.</p>
<p>The RAM revision comes amid what our hardware and occasional kitchenware guru James has dubbed RAMnarok. Basically, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">RAM prices have gone through the roof</a> thanks to vast swaths of it being hoovered up for AI-related uses. So, those selling RAM for use in consumer PCs have had to jack up their prices to offset the beefier sums they're having to fork over to fill up their parts conveyor belts during this RAM shortage or simply to take advantage of the scarcity meaning you'll struggle to get ahold of some at a cheaper price elsewhere.</p><p>It's bad, especially when the knock-on effects for hardware like the recently delayed Steam Machine are taken into account. Hence games like Legacy of the Dark Knight dropping their RAM requirements where testing reveals they can, making them a more attractive proposition to folks who don't want to face the potential of paying through the nose for an upgrade to their existing rigs just to play. If RAM prices weren't soaring, such tweaks wouldn't be as big a deal, but they are, so here we are.</p>

            <p>Happy this week, all! It’s time once again to load the Maw up with new PC games, that we may stave off the apocalypse till next Monday. This week covers a wide spectrum of flavours and textures: papery, Dodo-ish, ducklike, inky, formaldehyde-y, pasty, furry, feculent, and fishy. Once you’re done throwing up, get back here and run your protesting eyes over the full list. As ever, we welcome your urgent suggestions.</p>
<h2>Monday 16th February</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2720940/Book_Smugglers/">Book Smugglers</a> is a point and click adventure about circulating forbidden texts in 19th century Tsarist Lithuania.  </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3362750/Stormbridge/">Stormbridge</a> is a strictly horizontal blend of tower defence and city builder in which you stretch out a settlement rightwards, while raising defences against an encroaching tempest on the left.</li>
<li>For people who want more randomisation and playdough faces in their Ogre Battling, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622820/Dobbel_Dungeon/">Dobbel Dungeon</a> is a turn-based tactics affair in which characters roll dice each turn to determine the moves they can perform.</li>
<li>Out this day in early access, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2720920/ASTROBOTANICA/">Astrobotanica</a> is a somewhat Crash Bandicoot-esque puzzle ‘n’ survival game in which you are an extra-terrestrial botanist making sense of prehistoric Earth, feat. Neanderthals and Dodos.</li>
<li>Let’s savagely rebut the chonky ‘take me to your chief mammoth hunter’ bonhomie of that last entry with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3885910/Alien_Morgue/">Alien Morgue</a>, in which you do autopsies on little green men. (You don’t appear to be playing a Neanderthal or a Dodo.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 17th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Time to once again dust off those parched and abraded Zelda memories with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1583520/Under_The_Island/">Under The Island</a>, a top-down island dungeon puzzler featuring six biomes replete with grass you can slash to reveal health hearts.</li>
<li>Friendslop’s bottomless chum bucket has claimed Cthulhu in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3140720/Ritual_Party/">Ritual Party</a>, which is about four buds (or <em>are</em> you?) trying to perform a hellish ritual. Please, somebody help me think of a non-pejorative word for “friendslop” that rolls off the tongue as easily. The best I have are “Overcookie” and “Lethalcomp”.</li>
<li>No time for friendslop, actually, for today marks the dawning of duck-builders. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510020/Placid_Plastic_Deck__A_Quiet_Quest/">Placid Plastic Deck: A Quiet Quest</a> (pictured) is a deeply suspicious card-battler.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2714150/Beyond_the_Doors/">Beyond The Doors</a> is a finicky surveillance sim in which you accept mysterious requests to bug your neighbours, while probing the enigmas of the architecture itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3514630/Roach_Post/">Roach Post</a> is a cheery roguelite puzzler in which you stick together postage stamps with the help of an army of cockroaches.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2059570/Forgotlings/">Forgotlings</a> is a posh-looking, VA-heavy action adventure set in a world of discarded sentient objects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 18th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nice cavernous origami world you’ve got there, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4240550/Blank/">Blank</a>. Shame if somebody were to platform all over it.</li>
<li>Equal parts horny, despairing and whimsical, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878760/KILL_THE_WITCH/">Kill The Witch</a> is an early access 2D action platformer in which you are a witch with a baseball bat.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2781470/The_Killing_Stone/">The Killing Stone</a> is an Inscryptic confection from the makers of The Blackout Club. You are in the Arctic, playing a cursed boardgame to save the souls of a noble family from the Devil.</li>
<li>The criminal absence of licensed music notwithstanding, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a> looks to be a pleasant “what if”-driven strategy management port of TV’s definitive trip to the Delta Quadrant. Off to the Transporter room with you, Neelix - you’re doing a one-man-raid on the Borg Cube.</li>
<li>People who pre-fur the Star Foxy breed of space sim might want to throw their pennies at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2674650/FUR_Squadron_Phoenix/"> FUR Squadron Phoenix</a>. Neelix’s tufty mug wouldn’t look out of place here, now that I think of it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 19th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today brings quite the haul. Let’s barge through them at pace. Firstly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701440/PARANORMASIGHT_The_Mermaids_Curse/">PARANORMASIGHT: The Mermaid's Curse</a> is a sun-baked mystery horror novel in which an ensemble cast wrangle with some ghastly fishwomen.</li>
<li>The N64-to-Gamecube era lives on in “expressive” platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585890/Demon_Tides/">Demon Tides</a>, which casts you as a transforming devil princess.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">Styx: Blades Of Greed</a> is your latest helping of putrid and snarky open world goblin stealth.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010610/LOVE_ETERNAL/">Love Eternal</a> is an introspective horror platformer we might blithely summarise as Playdead X Celeste. </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878580/Key_Fairy/">Key Fairy</a> is a “hand-drawn, pacifist, folkloric, bullet-hell” game in which you grapple past monsters, salvaging their shattered stars, and solve riddles in a forest of scratchy blood and ink.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4341390/Nightsoil/">Nightsoil</a> is possibly the first turd collection game I’ve covered, and certainly the first emotive turd collection game I’ve covered.</li>
<li>Get the sense that all is not well on this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3622230/MOONROT/">particular gas giant moon</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 20th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Just a couple more before we go gently into that good Friday night. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3949290/Ys_X_Proud_Nordics/">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> is an updated version of a 2023 entrant in the sprawling Ys series, best known (to me, anyway) for popularising the concept of bumpslash combat.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3525970/Horripilant/">Horripilant</a> is an incremental dungeon clicker about an old knight in a world of Junji Ito-esque filthbastards.</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s going on in the Treehouse this week? James is biffing several larger hardware stories, and threatening to educate the rest of us about teraflops. Mark wants to walk the desert – hurting, longing, dancing to disco music. Julian may have an awkward tale to tell about a PC game he shouldn’t admit to have played. I am thinking about open worlds and city builders, because I am nothing if not shackled to genre. Callum is biding his time before the Requiem, and Ollie is eyeing the months ahead through a telescope (and also, possibly playing more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>). Jeremy ain’t in yet. How about you?</p>

It’s called Become, and it tells the tale of a single sperm (called a spermatazoon) seeking to make his mark and fertilize an egg, accomplishing what he was put on this Earth (or in a pair of balls) to do.</p>



<p>It’s a third-person adventure-survival game that has been created by two developers, and it’s set to launch on Steam later this year. Needless to say, it’s <strong>ballsy</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-become-one-of-millions">Become One of Millions</h2>



<p>Become is a unique game that takes players and throws them into the role of a spermatazoon, hellbent on beating hundreds of millions of competitors to achieve the ultimate goal, kick-starting a new life. It has a few customization elements, a two-to-three-hour story, and impressive visuals, considering the whole game takes place inside… Well, you know.</p>



<p>Per the game’s blurb on Steam:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Experience life’s fantastical journey as one of millions of sperm. Survive the microcosm dangers, wiggle, dash and compete through the human reproductive system and create new life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Become, players must navigate treacherous terrain, swimming through currents and upgrading themselves through the collection of sugars and proteins, all with the goal of being the hardiest and most efficient little swimmer.</p>



<p>It’s educational, too. The duo of developers has stressed that Become allows players to ‘learn about the reproductive microcosm’. However, it’s done in a way that isn’t as crude as you might think, as the disclaimer mentions nothing more than ‘humorous references to sperm and conception.’</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for Become:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Become - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hb4Pjyfs6IQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In a world of gargantuan AAA (and AAAA) games, Become might just be about to prove that size doesn’t matter, and you can still get a nice amount of bang for your buck by shooting out and giving this game a go. Who knows? The price for Become hasn’t been revealed just yet, but it shouldn’t be too much, all things considered.</p>







<p>How much would you pay to give the gift of digital, animated life? Let us know if you’re interested in Become on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you have been following tech news <span>over the past few months, you are well aware of how the&nbsp;<strong>widespread adoption of AI</strong>&nbsp;is causing many</span> issues for consumers, with <strong>prices of components</strong> such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ram-prices-are-flattening-out-over-the-past-few-days-but-dont-be-fooled/"><strong>RAM</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sandisk-wd-black-sn7100-sn8100-1-tb-ssds-have-risen-to-246-366/">SSDs</a></strong> <strong>skyrocketing</strong> in a matter of days. </p>



<p>These price increases and the limited availability of components for anything that is not supposed to be used in an AI data center is making things difficult even for console manufacturers, so much so that <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Sony is reportedly actively considering a delay of its PlayStation 6 system.</strong></p>



<p>In a new report posted today on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a></strong>, according to people "<em>familiar</em>" with the company's thinking, <em>"Sony Group Corp. is now considering pushing back the debut of its next PlayStation console to 2028 or even 2029."</em></p>



<p> While this isn't the first time we have heard of a possible <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-likely-to-be-delayed-longer-than-many-expected-leaving-prices-the-only-things-that-will-keep-evolving-and-not-for-the-better/">delay for the PlayStation 6</a></strong> beyond the expected 2027 release window, the number of reports in the past few weeks suggests <strong>this is no longer a last-case scenario but a concrete possibility.</strong></p>



<p>Things are not any easier for the manufacturers who managed to release their hardware before this <strong>chip crisis</strong> showed its ugly head. According to people familiar with the company's plan who spoke with Bloomberg, Nintendo is also <strong>contemplating raising the price of the Nintendo Switch 2</strong> in 2026. </p>



<p>Again, this isn't very surprising. Back in November, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa revealed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-remain-stable/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 price</strong></a> was expected to remain stable in the immediate future unless "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">significant changes in external factors, such as a shift in tariff assumptions, or other unexpected event</em>." Still, this is an unfortunate turn of events that will eventually <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">price many gamers out of current-generation systems.</strong></p>



<p>The PlayStation 6 may not be the only next-generation console to see a consistent delay over its expected release window. The <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/amds-semi-custom-soc-thatll-power-the-next-gen-xbox-is-progressing-well-to-support-a-launch-in-2027-says-amd-ceo/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">next-generation Xbox may launch in 2027</strong></a>, but that is reportedly a <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">best-case scenario</strong></a>, and with the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-cost-double-playstation-6/">Magnus APU being more expensive</a></strong> than the chip powering Sony's systems, the system would be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">commercially</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">doomed</strong> if it launched at a very high price that would be in complete contrast to the concept of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">affordability</strong> that makes <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">consoles enticing to consumers.</strong></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> is one of those multiplayer games that continue to thrive without making much noise outside their core communities. In fact, last year brought a number of substantial changes to the game through the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rainbow-six-siege-x-update-detailed-as-game-goes-free-to-play">Rainbow Six Siege X update</a>. Shame about those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rainbow-six-siege-still-struggling-after-ubisoft-was-forced-to-briefly-intentionally-shut-it-down-following-third-party-hack">massive attacks from hackers</a> though.</p>
<p>In any case, a new year brings new opportunities, and this next content drop had probably been brewing for a long while. The rumours were true: Solid Snake as seen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> is coming to the game on 3rd March. Yep, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-finally-frees-mgs4-from-the-ps3-with-august-release-date-sony-state-of-play">Konami has gone beast mode</a> and is even doing a huge collaboration now with a publisher that was a major competitor years ago.</p> <figure>

<p>The reveal trailer is self-explanatory: Sam Fisher (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> series) and Solid Snake in the same game? Working together? Time-travel back to the mid-2000s with this trailer and you'd blow the gaming industry's collective mind. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>-ification of every franchise big enough is real, but if that's the future of entertainment, we might as well enjoy team-ups that always were destined to happen.</p>
<p>Fisher joined Rainbow Six Siege a few years back, when it was starting to embrace the potential of crossovers with other IPs. Of course, it's far more shocking when those big collabs happen with different publishers, and even more special when we're talking about stealth game legends. And if you were thinking Solid Snake is just a skin or a lazy operator design, you'd be wrong:</p><figure>

<p>As thoroughly described by <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/7wYca8Fw674NP93tZe9uDe/solid-snake-joins-rainbow-six-siege-in-operation-silent-hunt">the blog post on Operation Silent Hunt</a>, "Solid Snake excels at tracking down Defender positions and scavenging supplies on the battlefield to adapt to any situation" thanks to the familiar Soliton Radar MKIII gadget and an "On-Site Procurement ability." The battle pass for this season instantly unlocks Snake and includes cosmetics for other operators, like the Psycho Mantis outfit for Smoke. Later, a mystery new mode will be added alongside more MGS outfits and the long-awaited team-up with Sam Fisher, which is a limited-time mode of sorts.</p>
<p>Beyond the fan excitement surrounding Snake's arrival to R6 Siege, it's safe to say this new addition to the roster will shake the meta up in big ways, as the stealth legend is a master of controlling movement in the battlefield and can carry more secondary gadgets. Can he be a lore-friendly <em>and</em> balanced operator? Let's hope so.</p>

			<p>The core concept of Aerial Knight’s Dropshot is utterly bonkers. You and your opponents leap from a plane, circling hundreds of miles above the ground. None of you have parachutes though, and instead you willingly freefall to your doom. As you plummet, you must shoot your fellow plummeters with your magic finger gun – yes, really. Your objective is to kill them all before you hit the ground. Oh, and your player character is called Smoke Wallace. He has purple skin and magical powers because he was bitten by the same radioactive dragon that ate all of his family. You see? Bonkers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Aerial_Knight's DropShot - Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/akOVT_R3QXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bright and garish, the visuals are all acid-soaked kaleidoscopic weirdness. It’s not my kind of thing, but this game certainly has a striking and attention-grabbing look. Gameplay is structured around small levels that last for sixty seconds, Dropshot is gaming for the TikTok generation. Each level is intended as a dopamine hit but to be quickly forgotten. As you fall from a first-person perspective, you’ll need to dodge floating islands, laser traps and your opponents’ return fire to stay alive, and with only two lives, this can be challenging. Kill efficiently and stylishly and you’ll rack up points and a high grade, the idea being to return to each level numerous times to hit a high score and achieve a perfect run. The problem is, that despite the bonkers premise and over the top visuals, the gameplay itself is rather pedestrian, leaving me with little interest in returning to a level once it was done.</p>



<p>The biggest issue is speed; there’s little sense of any. As you hurtle through the sky, it should be an adrenaline rush, like knee-sliding in Platinum Games’ Vanquish, or hurtling round a tight corner far too fast in F-Zero. Instead, it’s more akin to strolling to the shops to buy some bread. This is an oddly muted experience, rather than dodging floating islands and traps by the skin of your teeth, you seem to have a veritable age to gently steer yourself out of the way.</p>

<p>Achieving a high score amounts to little more than the eye-straining task of having to spot your tiny freefalling opponents in the distance, slowly line up a shot, and take them out. You’ll likely fail to spot them all on the first attempt, forcing you to attempt the level numerous times to catch them. Often your foes will kill you first, but you’ll have little idea that a bullet is coming. One moment you’re alive, the next you’re dead, with little to no visual clues that an attack is incoming. Worse, the collision detection isn’t great – possibly due to the challenges of basing the game around a first-person view – meaning sometimes you die, sometimes you survive, and you’re really not sure why.</p>
<p>There are two other game modes. The first is a boss battle that sees you fighting an enormous dragon, a nasty fella who can absorb a whole lot of damage, forcing you to conserve your ammo and keep a look out for ammunition drops to fall through. This is certainly more enjoyable than the main game. Primarily because it resolves the issue of the irritating unseen enemy attacks, as the dragon blasts you with big obvious fireballs that must be quickly shot from the sky, bringing some old-school light gun game shenanigans to proceedings.</p>

<p>The final mode is a straight up race between you and your rival to catch a golden egg before you hit the ground. This does, finally, get the pulse racing, as due to numerous speed boosters things end up fast and frantic. Darting through arrays of laser beams, narrowly avoiding chunks of rock, finally I can see what the development team were going for. If these thrills and spills could be replicated throughout the rest of the game, then Aerial Knight’s Dropshot would be an absolute indie banger. As it is, there’s just too many of the boring levels getting in the way of the good stuff.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Just like with its bizarre setting and over-the-top visuals, the overall experience of Aerial Knight’s Dropshot is uneven. There’s complete brilliance in places, such as the thrilling races, but they come alongside some rather uninspired and borderline frustrating combat. If I could just have a game full of the rival chases, and get rid of the fighting, this would be terrific. As it is, it’s alright.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This weekend, Polish developer <strong>Bloober Team</strong> unveiled <strong>Layers of Fear 3</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pASWkDkyaY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a special event celebrating the horror franchise's 10th anniversary</a>. Bloober Team founder and CEO <strong>Piotr Babieno</strong> appeared to discuss <strong>the great importance of Layers of Fear for the studio</strong>:</p>



<p><em>For Bloober Team, Layers of Fear isn't just a title from our past. It marked the moment when we understood what kind of studio we want to be, what type of games we want to create. Tonight, we want to honor that legacy and show you that Layers of Fear is still alive, still evolving, and still finding new ways to haunt.</em></p>



<p>Then, Creative Director and Lead Designer <strong>Mateusz Lenart</strong> spoke about the philosophy behind these horror games:</p>



<p><em>Layers of Fear was imagined as a tribute to artists and a thin line between inspiration and obsession. Creativity can be both beautiful and destructive while shaped by ambition and the fear of failure. Our goal was to show that by placing the player inside of an artist's unraveling mind, we invite empathy rather than judgment, changing horror into a deeply human experience.</em></p>



<p><em>When we started making the game in 2015, we were a team of around 20 people. It was a very personal project for us, and everyone put their own inspirations and experiences into the game's art style and narrative themes. We are extremely grateful that the game resonated with so many people throughout the years. Layers of Fear is the game for the artist within you. And as every artistic journey, the deeper you go into it, the more you discover about yourself. </em></p>



<p>Babieno then announced that the original soundtrack <strong>will be made available on both CD and vinyl</strong>. Moreover, they unveiled a partnership with <strong>Foksal Publishing Group</strong> to create <strong>novels</strong> based on the Layers of Fear franchise, starting with one written by <strong>Marta Bijan</strong> and scheduled for release in <strong>late 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>However, for gamers, the juiciest announcement came right at the end of the livestream: a teaser for Layers of Fear 3.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's clearly early days still. The studio recently released <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: New Dawn</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is remaking Silent Hill 1</a></strong>, after <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doing a great job with Silent Hill 2</a></strong>.</p>

            <p>There's nothing more spooky than having to neatly get your message across in a limited number of words which may or may not have to rhyme or stick to iambic pentameter. That's something Polish horror devs Bloober Team clearly understand, since they whipped out some William Blake poetry over the weekend, in order to reveal that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a> 3 will be a thing.</p>

<p>The folks behind 2024's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-2-review">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> used this reveal to close out a Valentines' weekend showcase commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Layers of Fear series, which kicked off with 2016's Layers of Fear. In this cinematic teaser for the next entry, a creepy bloke creepily read through Blake's The Sick Rose while sitting in a creepy chair surrounded by creepy portraits, one of which was of a strange hairless creature with no nose and two pointed fangs. The poem goes <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43682/the-sick-rose">as follows</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>O Rose thou art sick.</p>
<p>The invisible worm,</p>
<p>That flies in the night</p>
<p>In the howling storm:</p>
<p>Has found out thy bed</p>
<p>Of crimson joy:</p>
<p>And his dark secret love</p>
<p>Does thy life destroy</p></blockquote>
<p>Midway through the creepy bloke's reading, one of the paintings falls off the wall. Rather than blaming shoddy sticking apparatus, the man instead said: "Don't you worry about my little friend there, he tries to help. But the poor thing hasn't quite got the hang of the afterlife yet."</p><p>The teaser ended with the creepy bloke getting creepily serious for a second and turning over an hourglass. Sadly, there was no indication of when Layers of Fear 3 might arrive, so it remains to the release dateless void for now.</p>
<p>"Layers of Fear is an effective scare 'em up but the sense of dislocation and the lack of character development left me feeling as if I'd enjoyed a thematically messy series of shocks rather than a cohesive horror story," Adam Smith (RPS in peace) wrote in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layers-of-fear-review">his review</a> of the first game in the series. "It's a collection of scary things that are tangentially related to the idea of creative blocks and familial cruelty rather than an exploration of the artist or his personality flaws. By the time the credits rolled, I knew very little about this particular painter that I couldn't have learned by reading a brief synopsis."</p>
<p>Here's hoping Layers of Fear 3's spooks delve a bit deeper and deliver an undeniably through scarening.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Since November came around and Escape from Tarkov hit 1.0, hundreds of people have shared their accomplishments on social media regarding the game’s completion. With the introduction of 1.0, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlestate-games/" id="1450">Battlestate Games</a> added a campaign to Escape from Tarkov, which means the game can literally roll credits and give players one of four endings.</p>



<p>Recently, one user shared an intense revelation. They’ve managed to get <strong>the best ending </strong>in Escape from Tarkov while using what might be the game’s <strong>worst weapon</strong>, as long as you don’t count the Blicky as a true contender.</p>







<h2 id="h-terminal-toz-style">Terminal, TOZ-Style</h2>



<p>Hours ago, a YouTuber by the name of ‘Freakatoid’ shared the news that they’d completed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a> with the ‘Humanity’ ending <strong>while using a TOZ bolt-action shotgun</strong>. That’s right, the memeable weapon that’s typically wielded exclusively by the most bargain-basement, bottom-of-the-barrel scavs.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It took Freaktoid more than five weeks of consecutive attempts (51 in total) to punch through Terminal while using the TOZ-106. Midway through the attempt spree, Freakatoid shared screenshots of their progress, including an insane image of a <strong>PvE run </strong>on Woods with the TOZ-106 that included the taking down of at least two PMCs, Partizan, Shturman, and his guards.</p>



<p>Okay, so it was in PvE, but it was with a gun that’s widely considered the worst weapon in Escape from Tarkov, which makes it commendable.</p>



<p>For reference, here’s the gun:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>However, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/" id="161469">completion of Escape from Tarkov</a> <strong>with </strong>the TOZ, a 20-gauge shotgun that at the most can be fitted with five-shot magazines and a range of 20/70 shells, was done on PvP. As you might know, Terminal is <strong>exclusively </strong>PvE right now, so it might render that concept moot, but nobody else is out here completing the game like this.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape From Tarkov: Toz Terminal Completion (Unedited)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q3ZgGQyl764?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>To get it done, Freakatoid used a dual-TOZ loadout, one loaded with a Vortex Razor scope and slugs for picking off enemies at range, while the other was stock with five-shot magazines and heavy buck shells for close-range encounters. He went in loaded for bear with a Ronin respirator mask and a 6B45 vest with tier-five plates, and a rig filled to the brim with heals and magazines.</p>



<p>In the comments under their post, Freakatoid was challenged to complete the game with a PM pistol, a small Marakov handgun that might work a little better as it can be fitted with an 84-round magazine.</p>



<p>Maybe that’s his next challenge; he certainly seems open to it.</p>







<p>Is this the most impressive Escape from Tarkov completion you’ve seen? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>So, we know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-hour-with-pokopia-suggests-itll-might-be-the-best-pokemon-spin-off-ever-and-its-more-viva-pinata-than-minecraft-or-animal-crossing">looking impressive</a> so far, and we've also been told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-director">it's a pretty long game</a> even if you aren't planning on sticking around after the credits roll. With so much to do and a multiplayer option that's promising one of the most relaxing experiences of the year, how do its online functionalities work exactly?</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66124">Famitsu's big interview</a> with key Pokémon, Game Freak, and Koei Tecmo figures (hat tip to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kano01.bsky.social/post/3mexpgsz4t22m">Kano on Bluesky</a>), we've found out about another bit of info that should please everyone who was already looking forward to the game, especially those who spent way too much time playing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> with friends on private servers back in the day.</p>
<p>Before getting into how the multiplayer actually works in Pokopia, game director Takuto Edagawa revealed the project is Omega Force's largest to date: "I can't give you a specific number of people, but this is the largest number of people involved in any title developed by ω-Force (Omega Force)* to date." Moreover, creative work on the game wasn't one-sided with Game Freak and The Pokémon Company only approving submissions; new Pokémon designs were created and iterated on together all the way through.</p>
<p>About multiplayer, Edagawa says it indeed works as explained in the trailer released so far: You can either visit a host's main island or develop a "blank" one that's completely separate from the story mode progress. That second one allows players to "work together" in order to fully develop and reshape it into the peaceful village of their dreams.</p><p>The important bit here is that "even if the host (island owner) isn't playing, everyone can join in and play." The team is calling this system "Cloud Island" and it essentially works like you were thinking: Minecraft's private, persistent servers. This potentially means it's the sort of online feature that will one day go offline, but it opens up many possibilities and should make Pokémon Pokopia immensely more attractive for those of us whose schedules rarely line up. In fact, Edagawa basically states <em>that</em> was the driving force behind the functionality.</p>
<p>With only a little over two weeks to go, Pokopia is looking like one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>'s strongest exclusives yet, and I'm personally thinking it's going to be among 2026's biggest hits. Are you excited by the news on how multiplayer works or are you going full solo?</p>

            <p>If learning that the next entry into the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> series was going multiplatform had you worried about the graphical quality of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s upcoming narrative rollercoaster, a recent interview with director Naoki Hamaguchi should put those fears to rest.</p>
<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-will-not-compromise-on-graphics-whatsoever-despite-multiplatform-shift-director-naoki-hamaguchi-addresses-co/">Speaking to Automaton</a>, Hamaguchi reassured fans concerned about the graphical quality of FF7 Remake, when asked whether recent ports to the Xbox Series S or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> had any impact on development.</p>
<p>"Both the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox versions have been incredibly well received and generated a lot of buzz online," Hamaguchi said. "That attention has also made me realize how many people are worried about this issue. However, our decision to go multiplatform with the FF7 Remake series will not in any way lower the quality of the third installment. Our development structure simply doesn't work that way to begin with. ...I suppose I'll just have to keep saying it (laughs). "</p>
<p>Later in the interview Hamaguchi explained that due to the gradual explosion of PC popularity in Japan, and the faster rate of PC adoption in the West, the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series is being built with PCs in mind, reducing the quality of assets for medium-end platforms like the PS5 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, then lower still for other platforms.</p><p>"While PC gaming is gradually expanding in Japan, overseas growth has been even more rapid," Hamaguchi  explained. "The market has broadened tremendously across both consoles and PC. The FF7 Remake series has sold very well on platforms like Steam and the Epic Games Store, so we develop assets with the broad PC market in mind. In fact, our 3D assets are created at the highest quality level based on PC as the foundation.</p>
<p>"When FFVII Rebirth launched, there was talk about how the PC version looked better than the PS5 version, and our philosophy will not change for the third installment. As our fundamental principle, we do not design assets to meet the lowest baseline. Instead, we create them for high-end environments first. "</p>
<p>As of March last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-series-has-now-sold-over-200m-copies-worldwide">the Final Fantasy series had sold over 200m copies worldwide</a>, while the Final Fantasy 7 Remake sold 8.7m copies at the time. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">Its sequel, as well as Final Fantasy 16 did not meet expectations according to Square Enix</a>.</p>

            <p>A console release for Steam's cat-breeding roguelike Mewgenics is currently in the works.</p>
<p>That's coming from none other than Mewgenics' co-creator Edmund McMillen, who over the weekend responded to a question on social media about when players can expect a console release of the indie hit.</p>
<p>Alas, while McMillen and his fellow co-creator Tyler Glaiel are working on this console version "now", it isn't clear when it will be released. "Not sure when it will be done," <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2022933090423968119">McMillen said</a>.</p>
<p>On the plus side, though, it sounds like everyone regardless of console preference could get a bite of the Mewgenics pie, as McMillen added "at this point it might be in Dev for all systems". Personally, I can picture losing more than a few hours to Mewgenics while curled up in bed with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p><p>In a subsequent post, McMillen again affirmed a console version is on the cards, and that <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2023170140435796357?s=20">there is DLC coming</a>. It doesn't sound like this DLC will be free, though, with the <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2023171863946613160?s=20">developer stating</a> "it's going to take a lot of work/people".</p>
<p>As for that DLC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-dlc-is-coming-but-dont-expect-it-any-time-soon">McMillen has said the Mewgenics team will start work on DLC "in a few months"</a>, only after seeing exactly what it is fans actually like about the game.</p>
<p>Oh, and also, McMillen was not expecting Mewgenics to become the hit that it has. As a reminder, the game sold 150k copies in six hours, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-a-breakout-hit-on-steam-it-sold-150000-copies-in-six-hours-and-its-already-made-its-development-costs">swiftly making back its development costs</a>. That figure has since increased, and last week developer Glaiel revealed Mewgenics had sold half a million units in just 36 hours. That's not too shabby at all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/#app_reviews_hash">Steam reviews</a> are sitting at a "Very Positive" average, with comments such as "McMillen you did it again I want to punch you". There is also a lot of love for Mewgenics' soundtrack, which has been described as both "amazing" and "bonkers".</p>

<p>The lovely Christian Donlan has already been hands-on with Mewgenics, and all in all was quite taken with it. "If I have one point to leave you with - other than the fact that the soundtrack is rich with brilliant original songs - it's this: the core of Mewgenics may be simple and familiar, but the game that unfolds across all these runs is huge, and obviously so, even from my position about nine or ten hours in," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-an-infernal-machine-that-runs-on-cats">Eurogamer's Mewgenics Now Playing feature</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In 2024, after years of seemingly turning a blind eye, <strong>Nintendo</strong> brought the DMCA takedown hammer hard on Switch emulators like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuzu</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryujinx</a></strong>. Despite the significant blow, however, it was far from the end of the Nintendo Switch emulator scene. Ryujinx and Yuzu forks are still available, and brand new emulators like <strong>Eden</strong> and <strong>Citron</strong>, just to name two, have emerged over time. Nintendo's latest big release, <strong>Metroid Prime 4</strong>, was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-runs-well-on-pc-emulators-can-even-be-played-in-stereo-3d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediately playable on those Switch emulators</a></strong>.</p>



<p>On Friday, though, the Switch emulator scene suffered another scare as Nintendo <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1r32zz6/comment/o51du26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a new DMCA takedown notice</a></strong> targeting the GitHub pages of most remaining emulators, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Citron</li>



<li>Eden</li>



<li>Kenji-NX</li>



<li>MeloNX</li>



<li>Pine</li>



<li>Pomelo</li>



<li>Ryubing</li>



<li>Ryujinx</li>



<li>Skyline</li>



<li>Sudachi</li>



<li>Sumi</li>



<li>Suyu</li>



<li>Yuzu</li>
</ul>



<p>The Citron website <a href="https://citron-emu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appears to be dead</a>, and the same goes for <a href="https://melonx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MeloNX</a>. However, many of the other Switch emulators are still normally available, including Eden, currently the most popular one. In Eden's Discord, one of the project managers sent the following message on Friday:</p>



<p><em>Nintendo issued a DMCA takedown request against our Releases repository, hosted at https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases. At the time we're unsure what exactly will happen to that repository (or when anything will happen), but the most likely scenario is that it's removed and you won't be able to access our stable releases on GitHub anymore. Our source code is unaffected, as it isn't hosted on GitHub. The only thing targeted was our GitHub releases page. Not the source code, not our Actions workflow, nothing on our self-hosted Git instance, not even our development PR/Master/Nightly builds. The source code is always available at https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden, and releases are also mirrored at https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden/releases. Our development will continue as always!</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, a new build (v0.2.0-rc1) <a href="https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/tag/v0.2.0-rc1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was uploaded yesterday to the GitHub Releases page</a>, where downloads are still available. So, I reached out to the project managers to find out what was going on, and they told me <strong>they're fighting the takedown notice</strong> with a proper argument that Eden's repository <strong>does not infringe any laws or GitHub's hosting policies</strong>.</p>



<p>I then asked Eden founder Camille LaVey <span>whether the goal was to continue&nbsp;<strong>even if the DMCA takedown succeeded</strong></span> and removed their GitHub Releases page. Here's his reply:</p>



<p><em>Effectively, as founder of Eden, I can say that we want to keep continuing the work in the preservation of videogames, allowing game owners to benefit from this beyond their original hardware. Since this is a community-driven project, we always look to provide the best result possible for all; yet, we're never sure of what the future can bring, so we're always trying to ask the community to help us in any way they can, so Eden can still be alive for the years to come.</em></p>



<p>We'll keep you posted on what happens to Switch emulators after the latest Nintendo crackdown. Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Thing</li>



<li>Person</li>



<li>Place</li>



<li>Animal</li>



<li>Work</li>



<li>Nature</li>



<li>Game</li>



<li>Concept</li>



<li>Idea</li>



<li>Food</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-contexto-hints-for-today-february-16-2026">Contexto Hints For Today, February 16, 2026</h2>



<p>Without giving away today’s Contexto answer, here are a few helpful hints to get you thinking in the right direction:</p>

<li><strong>Hint 2:</strong>&nbsp;It comes around every week</li>

<li>June</li>



<li>Afternoon</li>

It is a relatively new game, launched in 2024, in which players seek a common theme among words in a 6×8 letter grid.</p>

<h2 id="block-e2995432-719e-4ed6-8fad-a1db37670203">How To Play Strands</h2>



<p id="block-da980997-0420-4527-946e-b66c49bf3d07">Strands is a daily word search that challenges you to find words with a common theme. There’s also a Spanagram that reveals the deeper theme behind the words.</p>



<ul id="block-d0bea02d-4b9f-4991-b9db-3b35778ff3bf">
<li>Words that are three letters and under do not count.</li>



<li>Words that reveal the correct theme appear in blue.</li>



<li>The Spanagram turns yellow when found.</li>



<li>Finding three words that don’t fit the theme will reveal a hint to help you find the proper words.</li>
</ul>



<p id="block-5e597b53-af1c-4c06-a00c-6c5a4694e9e0">The goal is to string together as many words as possible. Every letter on the grid gets used! Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a popular online trend.</p>



<p id="block-cd7aaa7f-9491-4ad0-b994-72d0102c5bed">Strands can only be played on the New York Times website. You can also play on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NYT Games app.</a></p>

<p id="block-23b6a5a9-2c25-47c2-a0ea-e23a99c87abd">The Strands’ answers for Game #715 are all about the Olympics. When you realize the theme, you’ll find the Spanagram. If you can get that first, it might be a perfect 10. Admittedly, I struggled and needed a whopping six in-game hints. A bummer after two days of needing any. But, hey, if you need some hints, keep reading.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Six Invitational has finally wrapped in Paris, and FaZe Clan stands victorious. The organization is the <strong>first </strong>in Rainbow Six esports history to win back-to-back Six Invitational tournaments, marking a spot in the history books.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan beat Team Secret in the grand final in Paris, defeating the <strong>fan-favorite side</strong>, to lift the hammer and secure the $1 million prize. It was no big <em>secret </em>that the crowd was firmly against FaZe Clan in Paris, especially given the presence of Team Secret’s French competitor, Mowwwgli, who has failed to win on home turf.</p>







<h2 id="h-faze-clan-has-won-this-year-s-six-invitational">FaZe Clan Has Won This Year’s Six Invitational</h2>



<p>FaZe Clan has lifted the hammer in Paris in front of a roaring crowd, for better or worse. Today’s excitement was kicked off by Ubisoft unveiling this year’s Rainbow Six roadmap, and it blew the roof off the stadium.</p>



<p>From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solid-snake-rainbow-six-siege-revealed/" id="176941">Solid Snake as an Operator</a> to Ranked 3.0, and from a new social hub to four stacked seasons this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-year-11-roadmap-revealed/" id="176923">Year 11 is <strong>heavy</strong></a><strong> </strong>for Rainbow Six Siege fans.</p>



<p>As with almost every other year, the schedule began with a glorious Six Invitational, which is regarded as one of the most valuable esports tournaments in the business. It’s a multi-million-dollar event backed by Ubisoft, and this year, it went to Paris. It was recently revealed that <strong>next year’s event </strong>will be heading to Brazil.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan, which claimed the prize last year in Boston, had a brilliant tournament through and through. From a top finish in the group stage with just one close loss to a storm through the upper bracket in the playoffs, FaZe Clan refused to relent.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the grand final, FaZe pushed out Fluxo W7M, Wildcard, and Team Falcons, all before meeting Team Secret in the ultimate showdown. Team Secret also had serious momentum, having gone on a wild lower-bracket sprint and eliminating some heavy players to make it into the final series.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan was relentless, hitting Team Secret with an insane 3-1 finish. The first series on Consulate wrapped with a 7-4, while Bank saw FaZe yield a 7-2 scoreline. Team Secret came back miraculously on the final map, Fortress, pushing the game into OT, earning the team a slight respite.</p>



<p>It wasn’t enough to clutch up the final map, though, leaving FaZe Clan to secure another map win in OT on Border.</p>



<p>Last year, Team Secret won at the Esports World Cup, while FaZe Clan dropped out hard in 10th place. It’s safe to say that FaZe redeemed itself in Paris by winning back-to-back Six Invitational tournaments.</p>

<p>Edmund McMillen is one of the creators of the new cat-breeding roguelike game called Mewgenics. So far, the game has been released only on PC, where it holds a “very positive” review score based on over 10,000 reviews.</p>



<p>Recently, McMillen responded to a Twitter question about when players can expect a console release. In response, he said it’s currently being worked on, but they don’t yet know when it will be completed. However, it may be in development for all systems.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-mewgenics-is-a-smash-success">Mewgenics Is A Smash Success</h2>



<p>Mewgenics, in its first week on the market, is currently sitting at 89 on Metacritic with an overall user score of 8.1. The game currently has over 115,000 concurrent players on Steam, breaking its previous record of over 102,000 set earlier this morning. Edmund McMillen has been pleasantly surprised by the success.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game features a voice cast of several long-time internet personalities. Among those are Ethan and Hila Klein from h3h3 and iDubbbz. McMillen recently responded to criticisms of the casting choices, explaining why he stands by them and how long the process took.

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Nintendo Switch 2 </a>Virtual Boy accessories support VR-enabled Nintendo Switch games.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Virtual Boy is coming to Nintendo Switch Online’s Nintendo Classics catalog on February 17. To play Virtual Boy games, Nintendo is releasing two headset accessories. One headset will be a full-size Virtual Boy mock-up. The other is a cardboard version.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-new-virtual-boy-accessory-works-with-existing-switch-titles">Nintendo’s New Virtual Boy Accessory Works With Existing Switch Titles</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/confirmed-switchs-virtual-boy-headset-can-play-vr-supported-switch-games-including-breath-of-the-wild-and-mario-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to Video Games Chronicle,</a> these accessories will work not only with Virtual Boy games but also with existing Nintendo Switch games that support VR. Nintendo, as part of its Labo lineup, allowed players to build their own cardboard VR headset.</p>



<p>To experiment with VR, they added specific game modes for four titles: Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Super Mario Odyssey, and Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. It’s also noted that the Switch 2 edition of Breath of the Wild retains the VR option</p>



<p>Per VGC, the main Nintendo Virtual Boy accessory, designed for stationary use, includes the classic red Virtual Boy filter over the lenses, but players can remove it to play Switch VR games in full color. The cardboard accessory is actually a wearable headset.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/billionaires-found-the-next-dumb-thing-to-gamble-the-economy-on-and-its-the-moon-2000669225</link>
            <guid>1436863</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I know we’re all at our limit with tech ventures that the financial powerhouses of the world rapidly rally around as more foundational and beneficial resources to civilization wane. I know we don’t have enough ear space to fill with all the promises of utopian computer advancements that in practice require comical amounts of human intervention. That after all of the crypto, NFTs, AI, video pivots and pets.com collapses, the last thing we need is more gambling on speculative futurist nonsense. But hear me out: what if we fucked with the moon?</p> <p>This week, Deutsche Bank said they are fixing their attention to the “moon economy.” Earth’s lonely little celestial satellite, greeting us each night, shifting the tides and summoning werewolves. Though the grand prize of the 1960s space race, it hasn’t really taken center stage in the human imagination for generations. While we love our big floating space rock, it doesn’t have the potential or allure of Mars, our nearest understudy. The richest among us have begun to feel otherwise.</p>

 <p>Deutsche Bank’s focus is on Intuitive Machines, a Houston-based company developing tech for lunar exploration. They’re primed for the windfall of any moon-bound interest, and Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu says the moon economy “may have just gone through a key inflection point.” Which is to say we’re gearing up for a nitwit-off.</p> <p>Through 2025, the White House stated a renewed interest in moon missions. As part of the Artemis program, the U.S.A. is looking to beat China to the moon for military infrastructure and spycraft securities. That space race has kicked off a second, simultaneous one amongst billionaires. Jeff Bezos announced that Blue Origin is aiming to develop lunar landers for the program. It plays into the tension between NASA and SpaceX, whose progress on their contract has been sluggish.</p>

 <p>Incapable of sitting still, Elon Musk, who previously wrote off the moon as “a distraction,” said he is shifting SpaceX’s focus toward building a “self-growing city” there. It’s a screeching pivot for SpaceX, a company whose sole mission is colonizing Mars. “We can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” Musk posted.</p>

 <p>Obviously government contracts are a financial boon in and of themselves. Much of Musk’s fortune comes from federal arrangements. But what’s the long-term economic benefit of chilling on the moon? Never mind establishing the first space city? As far as space campaigns go, it’s much easier to launch off a low-gravity body than fighting to escape Earth’s orbit and barrier of space junk (though new complications will surely emerge). You probably wouldn’t be surprised to hear this moon situation links up with the current AI situation.</p> <p>You’ve probably noticed AI, for all of its promises, is incredibly expensive. Consumer technology is in disarray as firms get first dibs on microchips. Data center construction is the toothpick holding up the American economy. The use of electricity and water cooling is exhaustive to local infrastructure. To set up camp on the moon would solve… some of that. If you think that sounds risky and untested, you’re correct. Just like current AI ventures, a loose promise is enough to bet the house on.</p>

 <p>The original space race ended on a win, something our current futurists are desperate to secure. It came through sweatbox collaborations between technicians, physicists and experts across all disciplines. It was to prove the capitalist west was greater than the USSR and develop some new rockets along the way, but still required putting that glory before short-term gains. The theme of the last decade has been “why we can’t have nice things.” There are strong use cases for the blockchain, language learning models and moon bases alike. But instead of researching and refining how this tech can secure a better future for all, we’re subjected to useless tchotchkes at the cost of breathable air. Our survival into this century is increasingly beholden to refried futurists, addicted to singular persuasive visions that don’t behave well with reality.</p>

<p>Speaking about the launch of the Sega Genesis, known as the Mega Drive outside of America, Sato told <a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu </a>in a Sega retrospective that there was a belief that customers would appreciate video games in the same way they had with music. As such, they chose to make it look like an audio device.</p>



<p>“Since the Mega Drive was a machine that you put in front of your TV, our concept was to make it look like an audio player. So we painted the body black and put the “16BIT” lettering in a gold print. That gold printing, by the way, was very expensive. (laughs) But we really wanted to play up the fact that this was the very first 16-bit home console,” he said.</p>







<h2 id="h-sato-wanted-wireless-controllers-for-the-sega-dreamcast">Sato Wanted Wireless Controllers for the Sega Dreamcast</h2>



<p>The Sega Dreamcast was Sega’s final hardware release. When discussing the platform, he noted some of his wishes for the console. He noted that he wanted a more cube-shaped design, similar to the Nintendo GameCube, but he really wanted wireless controllers.</p>



<p>“Personally, I wanted a more cube-shaped design like the Nintendo Gamecube, but we ultimately ended up with what you see today. One thing I truly wanted was wireless controllers. Those long cords are annoying. Next time, it will be wireless for sure! (laughs)”</p>



<p>That was a generation ahead, as wireless gameplay would not become the pack-in standard until the PS3 and Xbox 360 generation. A true innovator.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming sends its condolences to the family and friends of Hideki Sato.</p>

<p>Stellar Blade could be coming to more platforms in the near future.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/stellar-blade/" id="1204">Stellar Blade</a> was originally a PlayStation exclusive in 2024. It was later ported to PC. Developer <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;code=ir_eng&amp;idx=316&amp;category=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SHIFT UP Corporation</a> is now touting the game’s success in its recent Q3 earnings report. They are also looking ahead to the Future of the Stellar Blade IP.</p>



<p>In the latest quarter, the game continued to sell copies steadily. In particular, the PC port saw strong sales, and its very positive Steam rating was highlighted in the report.</p>







<h2>Stellar Blade Could See Releases on New Platforms</h2>



<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/shift-up/" id="1687">SHIFT UP Corporation</a> expects the game’s popularity and overall brand to continue to grow. Additionally, they plan to make the game accessible to even more players. </p>



<p>To do that, they plan to run promotional sales across both platforms and are even considering expanding to platforms beyond PlayStation and PC.</p>



<p>“To further enhance brand recognition and boost sales, we plan to carry out various promotional activities and are considering additional platform expansions to make Stellar Blade accessible to more players,” it’s noted.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-era-of-console-exclusives-continues-to-fade-away">The Era of Console Exclusives Continues to Fade Away</h2>



<p>Not only is PlayStation porting some of its popular exclusives to PC, but Microsoft continues to push the idea that “Everything is an Xbox.”</p>



<p>As such, major Microsoft releases, such as Halo, are now being ported to PlayStation. The strategy will continue, as the forthcoming Fable title will also be available on PlayStation. <span>Learn more about Xbox games on PlayS</span>tation&nbsp;at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-studios-head-admits-inconsistency-in-multiplatform-release-strategy/" id="171816">this link.</a></p>
