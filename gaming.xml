			<p>It's been almost two years since Hello Games took 2023's edition of The Game Awards by storm with the stunning reveal trailer of <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-is-a-planet-sized-fantasy-online-multiplayer-sandbox-rpg-from-no-mans-sky-developer-hello-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Light No Fire</a>, quickly becoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-handily-tops-youtube-views-for-tga-2023-trailers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most viewed trailer shown at the event</a>.</p>



<p>The next game of the independent UK studio behind No Man's Sky immediately made a lasting impression on games. Whereas NMS tried to create a whole galaxy to explore, Light No Fire focuses on a single planet, but with the ambitious goal of making it truly Earth-sized as never before in games. This new survival adventure game distinguishes itself from the studio's previous work with its high-fantasy setting, as showcased in the trailer, which features staple fantasy creatures such as dragons, skeletons, anthropomorphic races, and more.  </p>



<p>Another exciting aspect of Light no Fire is the promise to host the entire community on this massive planet with no loading screens or instancing, offering players a single procedural Earth-like planet on which all traversal is continuous and everything players build or discover exists in a shared ecosystem.</p>



<p>The planet's geography also appears to be highly varied. The trailer and screenshots show towering mountains, deep oceans, and numerous distinct biomes. Many of the technological advancements <a href="https://wccftech.com/massive-update-releases-for-no-mans-sky-adding-new-storyline-deep-sea-diving-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced in recent No Man's Sky updates</a> are being used to create more advanced atmospheres, oceans, and fauna for Light No Fire.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the goal is to create a fully shared multiplayer world where players can “carve a life together,” meet others organically, and travel, build, and fight cooperatively. Buildings and settlements are persistent and can be discovered by others, reinforcing the sense of a unified community. Exploration will be a big part of the game, of course. Players will have the opportunity to climb extreme mountains and sail the ocean with ships and their discovery and naming of places feeds into the shared world state. There will also be 'unique enemies' and valuable resources to discover throughout the world.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Critically, Hello Games also promised that the survival sandbox already seen in No Man's Sky will be bolstered by the depth of a roleplaying game. That said, there's still a lot we don't know about Light No Fire, and it looks like things may stay that way for quite a while.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/275850/view/627816662678110800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recap of the many updates released this year for No Man's Sky</a>, founder and managing director Sean Murray told the community that a 'tiny team' is continuing to work 'at pace' in the background on Light No Fire. Murray added that he's 'really pleased' with the progress and believes the game will be something special, but most fans took this brief statement to mean the game might still be several years out.</p>



<p>Granted, Hello Games only has around fifty employees, and given the pace of updates coming to No Man's Sky, it's somewhat obvious that they don't have a large team working on this new project. Still, it might eventually come to a place where they must choose whether to increase in size or remove some people from No Man's Sky in favor of Light No Fire. </p>



<p>Either way, the developer got notoriously burned with the launch of No Man's Sky. <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-finally-reaches-very-positive-overall-user-review-rating-on-steam-8-years-after-disastrous-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It took them eight years to regain the 'Very Positive' user review rating on Steam</a>, and they definitely don't want to botch another release, even if it means taking more time with it.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/830340/news-tower-indie-game-management-sim</link>
            <guid>1368088</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Have you ever looked at <em>The Washington Post </em>and thought, “Why is a billionaire allowed to use his massive wealth to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619887/jeff-bezos-washington-post-opinion-section-limits-free-speech-markets">influence</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon/626809/washington-post-editor">punish</a> editorial decisions at one of the nation’s premier newspapers?” and / or “I wonder if I could do that?” Well, <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1649950%2FNews_Tower%2F" rel="sponsored">News Towe</a>r</em> can help you answer at least one of those questions.</p><p><em>News Tower</em>, out now on Steam, is a management sim game that covers the business of running a newspaper in the 1930s. Players inherit a struggling paper with aims to turn it into New York’s premier news destination, but they’ll have to manage everything from keeping the lights on, keeping their reporters happy, and keeping rival newspapers, mobsters, lawsuits, fake news, and old news at bay.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption>Here’s what your tower can look like with all the money in the world.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Sparrow Night</cite></span></p></section><p>In addition to providing all the news fit to print, your main job in <em>News Tower</em> is making your employees efficient and happy. Smells, loud noises, heat, and lacking a sense of purpose all degrade their happiness, leading to sloppy, slow work. You can mitigate those annoyances by building office walls, installing fans, and generally making your tower a good place to work. Initially, I was confused that some of my employees were unhappy even though they all had their own offices. It was only when I started adding little amenities like plants, clocks, and decorative wallpaper — items not strictly tied to increasing their skills or getting rid of annoyances — that they improved. Hmm, wonder if there’s a metaphor in there somewhere?</p><p>I love this little game and not only because it’s rare to have one that caters to my specific profession. Management sims can get tedious, especially if the majority of gameplay is done by reading text and menus (*cough* <em>Crusader Kings</em> *cough*). But <em>News Tower</em> feels more like a god playing with dolls than with spreadsheets. Employees amble across the screen, filing reports and repairing broken fixtures with the charming jank of <em>South Park</em>’s Terrance and Phillip puppets. Your news tower responds to you as you build it up, with light fixtures jangling and dust clouds swirling every time you move walls around. When it’s time to go to print, you have to throw a big switch that makes a pleasing and tactile <em>ka-thunk</em> noise. Even the soundtrack adds to the immersion, with <a href="https://youtu.be/r2S1I_ien6A?si=JWvsAyg1quJHP-RU">iconic big band drum licks</a> playing as your paper flies through the presses just like in the moving pictures.</p><p>Playing <em>News Tower</em> as a journalist surprised me in ways I should have expected but did not prepare for. I went into this with the goal of playing it as true to life as the systems would allow, thinking that my skills would translate easily and quickly into success. But so far, I’ve bankrupted my newspaper, <em>The Star</em>, on three separate occasions.</p><div><p><figcaption>Break sales records while breaking the corporate bank account.</figcaption></p></div><p>Every week, your news wire operator brings stories that you can assign to your reporters. You choose which stories to pursue based on multiple factors, including what readers in a certain district want, synergy with other stories you’re working on, and your reporters’ strengths.</p><p>There are also powerful factions like the mob, the mayor, and more who, depending on if you’re courting them or not, can influence your decisions. It’s easy to say, like I did, “I’m an ethical journalist, I won’t let anyone dictate what I can write about!” But that calculation swiftly changes when the mob offers me cash to leave any stories about crime on the cutting room floor or when pleasing the mayor gets me favorable deals on the loans I need to keep my reporters paid. Even though I never took cash, I did play along with the different factions so long as their requests stayed within what I deemed ethically acceptable. After all, that’s how the game is played for real. But also like real life, money turned out to be my biggest challenge.</p><div><p><figcaption>You can play nice with the mob for cash or run the risk of having your reporters’ knees broken.</figcaption></p></div><p>Over time, all your employees grow in skill, requiring higher salaries. I could have replaced the senior reporters with cheaper newbies, but that would have slowed the paper down, and I had gotten used to stories coming in on Thursday and Friday instead of the Sunday deadline (with abundant, self-aware apologies to my editor). Paper was another ironic money sink. As my reporters improved and articles came in faster, I was forced to expand my paper’s size up to two- and three-page runs. So though I was breaking sales records and pleasing readers with high-quality journalism, I was hardly making a profit because it cost so much extra money to print.</p><p>There was a point where I reached a happy medium where the paper was profitable and of good reputation and quality. But I was feeling a bit of FOMO because <em>The Star</em> wasn’t printing even higher-quality stories because it didn’t have a photographer. So I took my healthy profits and hired a photographer, thinking that’d solve my problem… but it made things worse. I didn’t realize that a photographer just taking the pictures wouldn’t be enough to get them on the page. I had to hire a developer and build them a dark room, then hire a chemical processor and build them their own room because the chemical smell impacted employee morale. My single, thoughtless purchase behind chasing a new technology turned into an avalanche of expenses that eventually led me to bankruptcy. Okay, yeah there’s definitely some metaphors in here.<br>I don’t love <em>News Tower</em> because it’s professional flattery wrapped up in a management sim. I love it because it pretty faithfully exposes why good journalism is so hard to find these days. Being a craven opportunist will net you the cash but none of the quality. Do the work the right way, and your paper will get choked to death by bigger competitors with less scruples. After many failures, I’m doing a run where I’m expanding as slowly and cost-effectively as I can without taking any favors, no matter what. I can see why Mr. Bezos does what he does, running a newspaper ethically is <em>hard. </em>I’m gonna do it anyway.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/830340/news-tower-indie-game-management-sim]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-clears-star-wars-imperial-star-destroyer-now-selling-4-8-rated-set-at-new-all-time-low-2000648724</link>
            <guid>1368082</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Putting together a huge LEGO set is one of those rare things that gets kids and adults to stop looking at screens. And when it comes to the Danish toy maker’s line, Star Wars themes are by far the best and the most popular. Harry Potter sets might get some love, but the galaxy far, far away is always at the top of the sales charts.</p>
<p>The problem with famous Star Wars builds is that they almost never go on sale for a lot less, so you have to be patient and wait for the right time to get one at a good price. The good news is that during Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6094/">the iconic Imperial Star destroyer set is on sale for $119 on Amazon, down from its normal price of $159</a>. As you might know, this model is one of the most popular ships in the entire collection.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6094/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Legendary Ship That Will Actually Fit on Your Shelf</h2>
<p>This<strong> 1,555-piece set</strong> turns the scary wedge-shaped cruiser from<em> A New Hope</em> into a brick model. The size is just right so it doesn’t take up too much space on your display and <strong>the finished model is 18 inches long and just over 6 inches tall</strong> so it stands out on a bookshelf without taking up an entire wall. LEGO made this version with a hidden carry handle that folds into the hull so that this way, younger builders can swoop it around the room during imaginary space battles without it falling apart in their hands.</p>



<p>The real magic happens inside the hull where LEGO packed in <strong>several rooms that show off the Empire’s harsh military style</strong>: There is a real bridge with command stations, a separate control room with technical panels, and even a break room because Stormtroopers need coffee breaks too. The armory has weapons for the crew, and the cargo area has the glowing Kyber Crystal pieces and thermal detonators that refer to deeper Star Wars lore.</p>
<p>These little things on the inside turn the build from a simple display piece into something you can actually explore and move around, which keeps the fun going long after the building is done. The engineering also makes sure that you can get to these areas without having to take down the whole building. The hinged panels swing open easily and lock back into place securely.</p>



<p>There are <strong>seven mini-figures in the box, and the main one is Darth Vader in full black armor and a cape</strong>. There’s also an Imperial Gunner, an Imperial Navy Trooper, and Commander Praji and a standard Stormtrooper is the backbone of the Empire’s forces. The set also comes with a <strong>25th anniversary edition of Cal Kestis</strong> from the Jedi video game series: This is a one-of-a-kind collectible that won’t be available in future releases.</p>
<p>This $40 discount is a big deal for a high-end LEGO set of this size and difficulty, especially since Star Wars collaborations don’t usually get discounts this big outside of big shopping events. You’re paying about $0,076 per piece, which is much less than the usual ratio that LEGO charges for licensed themes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker Is Willing to Make Zero Margin on Its USB-C Charger 2-Pack, Cheaper Than Strarbucks Coffee]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/charge-multiple-devices-on-the-go-for-just-11-with-this-2-pack-of-ankers-20w-charger-2000648506</link>
            <guid>1368079</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Keeping your devices charged at all times doesn’t have to be complicated. Those who use multiple gadgets to get through their days can greatly benefit from dual-port chargers that make it easy to top up to two essentials at the same time. And today is a great time to pick a couple for literal pennies.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6079/">A 2-pack of Anker’s 20W charger, which typically sits at $19, just dropped to $11 at Amazon, after a whopping 41% discount</a>. Each of these comes with two ports, and with this deal, you’re basically paying just a little over $5 for each. The offer applies to the black color option. Others are discounted too, but the prices vary. For instance, the white option is sitting at $13, while green and purple are going for $14 each. Plus, for every color except black, discounts are only available to Prime members. These are Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals (even though the event is behind us), but they’re selling out fast. Get yours before the stock runs out or Amazon decides to push the price back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast, But Safe Charging for Your Essentials</h2>
<p>The charger is designed to be compact and portable. It fits in the palm of your hand, slides into your pocket, and can be tossed into any backpack without bulking things up. Getting two of these means you can keep one for home use, while the other in your laptop bag or car for hassle-free on-the-go usage. Two ports (one USB-C and one USB-A) let you power two devices at the same time. The 20W output isn’t massive, but still decent to juice your essentials up without taking too long. It can fast charge an iPhone 16 from 0 to 50% in around 30 minutes. You’ll enjoy maximum power when using a single port. When both are in use, expect each to deliver 7.5W max output.</p>



<p>A 5 ft USB-C to USB-C cable is included with each charger, which is long enough for you to be able to use the connected devices comfortably as they charge. As for compatibility, it plays nicely with a range of devices. These include iPhone Series 15 through 17, iPhone Pro Series (2024, 2023, 2022, 2021), the latest Google Pixel devices, recent Samsung phones, and even Galaxy tablets. You will also be able to power your earbuds, select iPad configurations, plus smartwatches with each. Basically, it covers all the devices you rely on on a regular basis. But despite all the power, the charger stays calm and cool as it works. Anker’s enhanced safety system includes overvoltage protection, temperature control, and other helpful safety features to protect your devices from long-term wear, while also maintaining their battery health.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6079/">Included in the box are two Anker chargers, a 2-pack 5 ft USB-C to USB-C cable, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty, in case something goes wrong. You can now grab this bundle for just $11.</a> It’s open to all shoppers, but Prime members will enjoy free delivery with their purchase, too. If you’re not one, you can still get free delivery, but only on orders above $35. Just don’t wait too long to grab the deal, as it’s going to end soon. Holiday rush is in full swing, and as a general rule, if you spot something you like, jump in on it while there’s still time. Additionally, there’s plenty more going at a discount right now, so it’s a good time to stock up on both the essentials and pricey options without blowing your budget.</p>

<p>Core, blimey!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Fireshine Games and developer Pugstorm dazzled us with the gorgeous survival sandbox game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/core_keeper">Core Keeper</a> back in September last year, and today they have announced that more is on the way in the shape of a swanky new Switch 2 Edition.</p>
<p>Arriving on <strong>28th January</strong>, you can expect this one to feature beefed-up graphical fidelity and frame rate (targeting 60fps), as well as a bunch of visual tweaks in the lighting, shadow, water quality and particle effect departments to keep things looking super sleek.</p>
<p>What's more, the Switch 2 version will include native eight-player co-op — a substantial step up from the original's four — and anyone can get involved with a session, even if you're playing on Switch 1 (assuming the session is being hosted by a S2 player, of course).</p>
<p>And the best part of all: this Switch 2 Edition upgrade will be <em>completely free</em> for those who already own the game on the old hardware!</p>
<p>The good news doesn't end there either. Fireshine Games and Pugstorm have <em>also</em> announced that the free 'Volt &amp; Voltage' update will be arriving on all systems on the very same day. This packs in a new biome to explore, fresh enemy types and bosses, and a bunch of cool new weapons. It promises to be a rather beefy one, so if you've been looking for an excuse to dive back in, this might just be the perfect opportunity.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/core-keeper">our review</a> of the original Switch 1 release, we called Core Keeper "a wonderfully engaging and mysterious survival sandbox that is tough to put down once it gets its hooks in you," and it's certainly one to watch if you're a fan of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terraria">Terraria</a>. Bring on even more in January!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreen-65w-wall-charger-4-ports-hits-record-low-day-after-black-friday-amazon-forgot-to-stop-deals-2000648712</link>
            <guid>1368070</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Having a lot of chargers plugged into every outlet makes a mess of cables and adapters that takes up space and looks bad. The Ugreen Nexode 65W charger combines everything into one small unit so you can charge your laptop, phone, and tablet all at once from one wall outlet. And the good news is that right now, this <strong>four-port GaN charger</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/">is down from its usual price of $39 to $24</a> on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charges 4 Devices at Once</h2>
<p>The charger can be so small because of the new Gallium Nitride technology while Standard silicon-based chargers need bigger parts to safely handle 65W output. GaN works better and makes less heat which lets Ugreen fit a lot of charging power into a package that is only 2.64 x 1.65 x 1.5 inches. The <strong>foldable plug design</strong> makes it even more portable because the prongs tuck away flat which keeps other things in your bag from getting scratched and stops the charger from getting stuck on fabric.</p>
<p>The <strong>four-port setup with three USB-C outputs and one USB-A port</strong> works with almost all of your devices. You can charge your MacBook Pro through the main USB-C port at full speed which is 65W. This is the same speed as Apple’s own charger which charges a MacBook Air to 51% in just 30 minutes. The other ports can charge your phone, wireless earbuds, tablet, or even a Steam Deck at the same time.</p>



<p>Built-in protections keep the device from getting too hot or too much current, and they automatically change the power delivery when they sense a problem. You don’t have to worry about power surges or overheating problems that cheap chargers have when you leave devices plugged in overnight.</p>
<p>The <strong>smart power distribution system</strong> gives out watts based on what is connected and what each device needs: When you charge your phone, it gives it the right amount of power to charge quickly without giving it too much power, which could hurt the battery over time. When you add your laptop to the mix, the charger changes its power budget to give priority to the device that needs more power.</p>
<p>You get here <strong>four ports and 65W of power for $24 which is less than what most single-port chargers cost</strong>. Plus, the package is smaller than most laptop adapters.</p>

              <p>Black Friday weekend is here, and with that comes tons of deals across every product category under the sun ranging from vacuums to coffee makers to, yes, even video games. Amazon has the PlayStation 5 Slim on sale for $100 off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5801/">This disc edition of the console has recently been priced as high as $550, but during this weekend, you can grab the system of just $450.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5801/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tons of Games</h2>
<p>Okay we all love our memes about the PS5 saving it has no games. And while maybe at this point in the console’s lifecycle we were hoping for a little more, the library of choices you have for what to play is far more than the barren wasteland Twitter makes it out to be.</p>
<p>The new <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> is one of the best looking and best playing action games of the generation. <em>Returnal</em> is a fast-paced third-person shooter roguelike with eary vibes reminiscent of <em>Metroid</em>. <em>Astro Bot</em> is our much-needed plunge back into the 3D mascot platforming genre. It’s a brilliantly fun love letter to all things PlayStation and earned its title as 2024’s Game of the Year at The Game Awards last year.</p>
<p>Then if you missed out on the PS4 generation, you have countless titles waiting for you to dip into—some of which even enhanced for their move onto the PlayStation 5.&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part 1 </em>and <em>The Last of Us: Part 2</em> regularly get cited as the best story in video games. Well, at least the first one does (though I am a stark defender of the second one). Form your own opinion on the choices made by the iconic characters in these post-apocalypse stories that went on to inspire and HBO adaptation.</p>
<p>Access a bunch of these instant classics with a subscription to PlayStation Plus Premium. You’ll be able to access hundreds of games across PlayStation generations like&nbsp;<em>Control, Kingdom Hearts 3, Final Fantasy VII Remake,&nbsp;</em>and more.</p>



<h2>Expandable Storage</h2>
<p>While this model PlayStation 5 is marketed as having a 1TB SSD, your actual usable storage isn’t quite that. Much of the internal drive’s space is dedicated toward system software that enables the PS5 be, well, a PS5. Out of the box, its more accurate to say you’ll be working with a little over 850GB.</p>
<p>If you’d prefer more space, you can always expand it. The PS5 Slim’s storage is expandable via an internal SSD slot. Brands like Crucial, Samsung, and Wester Digital all make SSDs which come with heatsinks and are compatible for installation in a PlayStation 5. Much of those you’ll be able find on sale this weekend and next between Black Friday and Cyber Week. Installation is pretty easy too. There are any number of tutorial videos to choose from on YouTube. All it takes is a screw driver and five minutes of your time.</p>

            <p>Netflix's Assassin's Creed show will reportedly explore ancient Rome.</p>
<p>That's according to a new report by <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-set-to-explore-ancient-rome">Nexus Point News</a>, which claims sources say the TV show will explore a time period hitherto untouched by the game series, and feature figures such as Emperor Nero and Seneca the Younger. If true, that would see the series set between 54-68 AD.</p>
<p>According to the official blurb for Netflix's take on Assassin's Creed, the series will be "centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions - one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Toby Wallace is entering the world of Assassin's Creed. </p><p>He's the first series regular cast for the live-action series adaptation of Ubisoft's best-selling video game franchise. <a href="https://t.co/BNwFV84QQL">pic.twitter.com/BNwFV84QQL</a></p></div>— xᴉlɟʇǝu (@netflix) <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1993386705487827274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">was first announced in 2020</a>. The long-in-the-works series is being helmed by Roberto Patino (DMZ, Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Homecoming, The Killing), who will serve as creators, showrunners, and executive producers on the show. Filming is currently reported to be starting next year, in Italy.</p><p>As we reported earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-assassins-creed-adaptation-lands-first-lead-cast-member-in-euphoria-and-eden-actor">Toby Wallace will play a co-lead in the Assassin's Creed series</a>, which is based on Ubisoft's games of the same name. Beyond that, who Wallace will play has not been announced yet, but according to the publication the upcoming show will feature characters different from the games.</p>

            <p>Build A Rocket Boy has quietly released a "free starter pack" to resuscitate its flailing action-adventure game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a>.</p>
<p>The free pack, which was released yesterday (28th November), hopes to snag new players by offering a taster of the "ever-expanding gameplay experience of MindsEye".</p>
<p>"Dive into an action-packed mission in the campaign and preview a selection of new playable content that is delivered regularly through ARCADIA," the description teases.</p>

<p>The demo sees you play as Jacob Diaz, a former soldier with a neural implant and fractured memories, "drawn into an explosion that erupts into a high-speed chase and fierce firefight through the city".</p>
<p>It features the story mission Robin Hood and access to a "variety" of ARCADIA missions and challenges, which are "updated regularly". Here's what's currently on offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Garden Party – Drone Race</li>
<li>Chase The Sun – Drone Race</li>
<li>Honor Among Thieves</li>
<li>Downtown - Goin' Haywire</li>
<li>Crosstown Traffic – Checkpoint Race</li>
<li>Rude Interruption</li>
<li>Turbulence - Race</li>
<li>Free Bird – Sky Race</li>
<li>Winging It – Checkpoint Race</li>
<li>Craz-Eye Taxi – Checkpoint Race</li>
<li>Friendly Fire</li>
<li>Cruise Control – Sky Race</li>
<li>Fractured Echo – Survival Horde</li>
<li>Road To Hell - Race</li>
</ul>
<p>The free starter pack is available on Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series consoles.</p>
<p>Last month, MindsEye boss and Build A Rocket Boy studio founder Leslie Benzies alleged in an internal meeting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-alleges-saboteurs-within-the-company-were-behind-its-poor-reception-according-to-new-report">"saboteurs" within the company were behind the game's poor reception</a>. Shortly after confirming redundancies, he said negativity towards the game was "uncalled for" and alleged "internal and external" forces scuppered the game's launch.</p>
<p>Benzies' comments come just weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-developers-sign-damning-open-letter-against-studio-execs-over-longstanding-disrespect-and-mistreatment-following-games-disastrous-launch">MindsEye developers signed an open letter against studio execs</a> over "longstanding disrespect and mistreatment".</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">wasn't the first time the game's negative reaction has been blamed on others</a>. Even before the game was released, studio co-CEO Mark Gerhard claimed in an exchange on the MindsEye Discord server that "all the people who reacted negatively were financed by someone". He later added there was a "concerted effort" against the studio, and it "doesn't take much to guess who".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launch-what-we-didnt-hope-for-says-io-interactive-ceo-as-publishing-future-in-question">Publisher IO Interactive has since distanced itself from the project</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/save-space-and-boost-efficiency-with-ankers-675-usb-c-docking-station-while-its-going-for-32-less-2000648509</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Docking stations are a great way to manage multiple devices on your desk without cord clutter. You plug everything into a single unit and keep it beside your monitor for easy access. But what if we told you there’s an even more efficient way of doing things?</p>
<p>Anker’s 675 USB-C Docking Station doubles as a monitor stand and lets you connect up to 12 devices at the same time! <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/">On a regular day, it would run you around $250, but all thanks to Black Friday, you can grab one for just $170 today.</a> That’s after a massive 32% discount. Even better, you’ll enjoy free shipping with your purchase, whether you’re a Prime member or not. The main sale event is technically over, and Cyber Monday is still a couple of days away. This lingering deal is a great way to save on an efficient charging solution if you missed grabbing it yesterday and can’t wait for Monday!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Saves Space</h2>
<p>It looks like a regular monitor/laptop stand, even though it’s anything but that. You’re getting a bunch of ports on the side, including a 100W max USB-C upstream port, 3 USB-A ports, 2 USB-C ports, SD/microSD card slots, a 4K HDMI port, a wireless charging pad, and an Ethernet port. That’s everything you need to connect all your essentials, plus a few extras, without feeling limited. Place your monitor on the top, and then add a keyboard, external storage, headphones, and more. The wireless charging pad makes it easy to top up your smartphone while you’re busy being productive. All of us have our phones on our workstations anyway, so it’s a great way to juice them up instead of letting them sit idle. The 100W max USB-C upstream port charges your laptop as you work, just as well. Note that the dock does not support display via any of the USB-C ports. You can only do that using the single HDMI port. It shouldn’t be a problem, though, unless you’re looking for a bigger, multi-monitor setup with three or four screens.</p>
<p>There’s some space under the dock that you can use to store your keyboard and mouse when not in use. Just push them under once you’re done working, and come back to a clean, tidy setup the next day. Raising your monitor to your eye level also promotes a better posture, as you can easily sit up straight instead of slouching.</p>



<p>Exceptional stability comes from an Aircraft-Grade aluminum alloy body with an anti-slip silicone strip for sturdiness. The curved edge design makes the overall look and feel premium. It’s built to blend into any workstation, from the most basic ones to those that have quite a lot going on in terms of personality. Getting started is straightforward, as just plugging your laptop in wakes your entire workstation up. The dock plays nicely with a wide range of laptops and monitors, including Dell XPS, Lenovo, iMac, MacBook, and more. OS-wise, it works well with Windows 10 and 11, plus macOS 10.14 and above.</p>
<p>The package comes with the docking station, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6077/"> The current deal brings the price down to just $170, which is basically nothing for the features it offers.</a> You’re saving a nice $80 on a solution that’s going to make your workstation much more efficient and a whole lot cleaner.</p>

If you know the score in City Trials, as is the case with any race on any track in this game, you'll reap the rewards directly, and so being able to quickly grab the best power-ups (that's all those ludicrously massive icons that littler the arena) alongside a proper knowledge of the fastest routes, most protected avenues, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-how-to-reach-city-trials-floating-garden-and-floating-island">secret areas</a>, and all that jazz, will make you a winner. Oh, wonderful skill-based racing with a high-skill ceiling - you <em>were</em> hiding in there all along.</p>

<p>So. Given that I'm rightly enamoured with the air riding here, and given that I've been so impressed by a game that manages to remove acceleration control (one of the best bits of driving) whilst still remaining more strategic and engaging than other racers of its ilk, it's shame to have a complaint, but I do.</p>
<p>As we reported a little while back, Kirby Air Riders creator and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> guru Masahiro Sakurai has said that there will <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/sakurai-has-no-plans-for-kirby-air-riders-dlc-everything-is-here">not be any more DLC for the game</a>. Sad (and also slightly spoiled) face. And it's a sad face because as much as I adore City Trial, I think its biggest strengths are drawn from and highlighted by its map - as a map you have to learn so well.</p>
<p>However, in having to get so very familiar with it to succeed against the best that online play can throw at you, only having the one to play on is something that's gonna limit my time with this one, and maybe, ultimately, bring it to a premature end.</p>
<p>If I was aware of even one new City Trial map coming down the pipeline, I'd be confident in the fact that Kirby Air Riders would remain on my Switch 2 indefinitely. And it still may do, by the way, because I just can't get enough of Rick.</p>
<p><em>Why</em>? Well, because he's a huge and cuddly hamster and I love him. But that's a different story.</p>

<p>No, what I mean is <em>why</em> can't we just have one more map? It's not an issue in any way in the rest of the game's modes, and the minigames that see out a round of City Trial are superb - nothing needs doing there.</p>
<p>Indeed, I fully feel as though Sakurai is being 100% genuine in his "<em>Everything is here...I've thrown everything I have into this game from the start"</em> statement when announcing that DLC was a no-go. I just...can't we just have even one more? (How hard can it be to design a breathtakingly brilliant map that works in solo <em>and</em> online play for player counts that vary wildly? I mean, <em>come on.</em>)</p>
<p>There's a ton of content here when you dig into Air Ride, there's endless reams of stuff to unlock and collect in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-all-playable-characters-and-how-to-unlock-for-every-game-mode">characters</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-all-tracks-and-how-to-unlock">tracks</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-all-machines-and-how-to-unlock">machines</a> in Road Trip, but the very nature of City Trials, with its hyper-fixation on this single (admittedly large and very well thought-out) Skyah map, surely means that it'll only continue to thrive and surprise if they chuck more maps in there for the long-term riders to tuck into.</p>
<p>C'mon, Nintendo. Let us feast on the fun of learning another area inside out whilst crushing our foes in online match-ups.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apples-2025-macbook-pro-dropped-to-its-lowest-price-ever-for-black-friday-2000648462</link>
            <guid>1368034</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday and Cyber Week are upon us. Now is the time to save big on tech stuff, home good, and everything else under the sun. Been thinking about upgrading your laptop? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6078/">Amazon is offering the Apple MacBook Pro at its lowest price yet, with a 16% discount that slashes $251 off the regular price, bringing it down to just $1,349</a>. If you’ve been eyeing this powerhouse laptop, there’s no better time to grab it.</p>
<p data-start="484" data-end="1070">This particular model is the 2025 version of the MacBook Pro, featuring Apple’s latest M5 chip, built to handle even the most demanding tasks. The M5 is equipped with a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, delivering exceptional performance for everything from creative work to software development. The 16GB of memory and 512GB SSD ensure smooth multitasking and plenty of storage space for your files, apps, and media. This MacBook Pro can tackle everything from heavy video editing project to coding to everyday tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6078/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="484" data-end="1070">Built for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p data-start="1072" data-end="1516">AI has taken over the zeitgeist so its unsurprising Apple’s marketing around the M5 chip is leading with the buzzword. It’s been engineered for what Apple calls “Apple Intelligence,” making it powerful enough for automatically compiling tons of code, responding to AI prompts, and generating images based solely on descriptions. Whether you engage with AI or now, the chip’s power still translates into faster performance and more efficiency, so you can get more done in less time.</p>
<p data-start="1518" data-end="1947">Battery life on the 2025 MacBook Pro is exceptional. Thanks to the M5 chip, you can expect up to 24 hours of continuous use on a single charge, which is an incredible improvement over Intel-based MacBook Pro models. In fact, this is up to 14 times longer battery life than previous Intel versions, allowing you to work, stream, and browse for hours without worrying about finding an outlet.</p>
<p data-start="1949" data-end="2358">The MacBook Pro’s 14.2-inch Liquid Retina display is another highlight. The screen boasts an impressive 1,600 nits of brightness and supports a wide color gamut, delivering vibrant, true-to-life colors that will make all your photos, videos, and creative projects pop. The display’s able to render one billion colors, ensuring incredible detail and accuracy when watching a movie or editing photos.</p>


<p data-start="2360" data-end="2782">For those who rely on video calls—whether for work, school, or just catching up with loved ones—the MacBook Pro has some great little features . The built-in 12MP camera shoots in full 1080p HD, ensuring that you always look your best during meetings or virtual hangouts. The three-microphone array works alongside the six-speaker system to create an immersive sound experience, using spatial audio technology to ensure clear audio on both ends of the call.</p>
<p data-start="2784" data-end="3289">The camera also features Apple’s Center Stage, which uses AI to automatically adjust the camera’s angle as you move, ensuring you remain centered in the frame throughout video calls. No matter where you are in the room, Center Stage keeps you in view. This feature is compatible with pretty much all the popular video call apps like FaceTime and Zoom.</p>
<p data-start="3291" data-end="3572">This model is available in two elegant color options: space black and silver, so you can choose the one that best suits your style. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6078/">Both are on sale for Cyber Monday at its all-time low price of just $1,349.</a></p>

            <p>A new Dead Rising game is reportedly in development.</p>
<p>While there's been no formal word of a follow-up game, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-dead-rising-game-development-set-in-hollywood">mp1st</a> claims Capcom has another "major" Dead Rising project in the works, reportedly set in Hollywood.</p>

<p>According to the site's sources, the game has been in development since 2023. Codenamed 'Rec', it reportedly sees the return of Frank West and <em>may</em> be a direct sequel to the 2006 zombie game (the source seemingly wouldn't confirm either way). Isabela Keyes and the game's signature Psychopaths will also be returning.</p>
<p>For those who can't remember that far back, 2010's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-rising-2">Dead Rising 2</a> boasted similar gameplay to the original game, but featured a completely different character. West only returned in Dead Rising 2's Case West DLC.</p>
<p>That's not all, either. The same source claims the main villain will be "an extravagant and deranged film director who forces Frank and other survivors into various trials, all in the pursuit of filming his 'perfect movie'."</p>
<p>We'll also see the return of his "time limit mechanic" and his infamous camera. Sadly, there's no firm commitment to a release date at this stage, though.</p>
<p>We gave last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-review">Dead Rising's Deluxe Remaster a middling three out of five stars</a>, writing "the over-the-top zombie shenanigans still hold up in 2024, but next to the remaster from 2016, this is definitely geared more toward first-time players than returning fans."</p>

              <p>Since Black Friday Week started, Amazon has sold hundreds of thousands of Xbox controllers. Even though it’s now the weekend after Thanksgiving, there are still great deals on these gaming essentials but the problem is that a lot of the color options are already sold out. However, the famous <em>Carbon Black</em> version is still available this Saturday morning and is now at its lowest price ever: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">$39, down from its usual price of $64</a>. This is the <strong>2025 model with all the newest features</strong> and at this price, you’re getting Microsoft’s best controller for almost 40% less than what you’d normally pay.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play on Any Platforms</h2>
<p>The new Xbox wireless controller has some important improvements over older models. For example, it works with more than just traditional gaming setups as you can can<strong> connect this controller to your Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows PC, Android devices, iOS devices, Fire TV Sticks, smart TVs, and even VR headsets</strong> without wires using Bluetooth. You only need to buy one controller that works with all of your devices so you don’t have to switch between different peripherals for different platforms.</p>
<p>Microsoft improved the ergonomics by adding a <strong>textured grip to the triggers, bumpers, and back case</strong>. This makes it easier to control the game for long periods of time. The hybrid D-pad has a faceted design that makes it easier to make both sweeping and exact directional inputs. This makes a big difference in fighting games and platformers where every input counts. The <strong>controller also has a dedicated Share button</strong> that lets you take screenshots and video clips without stopping the game which makes it easier to make content if you like streaming or just want to save special moments.</p>



<p>The included AA batteries last a long time and <strong>give you up to 40 hours of gameplay</strong>. If you want to use rechargeable batteries instead, you can switch to the Play and Charge Kit. You can now keep a stable connection up to 30 feet away from your device, which gives you more options for how to set up your gaming area. Dynamic latency input technology makes the time between pressing a button and an action on the screen shorter. This makes the game feel more responsive, which competitive gamers will love, but casual gamers will also benefit from it.</p>
<p>The Carbon Black color is the <strong>classic Xbox look that never goes out of style</strong>: It has a matte finish that doesn’t show fingerprints as easily as glossy finishes. The housing is sturdy and doesn’t flex or creak, and the buttons give satisfying feedback without being too loud. You can also use the Xbox Accessories app to change the buttons on your controller to fit your needs for certain games or accessibility, which is more customization than most third-party controllers offer.</p>
<p>For $39, you get the newest controller technology from Microsoft which is less than what last generation’s model usually costs. The price is at an all-time low, and the improvements coming in 2025 will make it even better.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Razer Blackshark V3 PRO—Even Better Than Brilliant]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/review-razer-blackshark-v3-pro/</link>
            <guid>1368022</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Razer Blackshark V2 Pro was my go-to headset for the longest time, and it was also the pick of many of the world’s best esports pro players. That’s why I was elated when Razer revealed the Blackshark V3 Pro, the next generation of the award-winning headset, packed with upgraded technology but retaining the classic, flawless aesthetic that we all knew and loved.</p>



<p>The Razer Blackshark V3 Pro is out now and selling like hot cakes. In this review, I’m breaking down exactly why this headset is worth every penny of the somewhat expensive price tag.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-razer-blackshark-v3-pro-worth-269-99">Is the Razer Blackshark V3 Pro Worth $269.99?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing this review, the Razer Blackshark V3 Pro had a price tag of $269.99, which might seem exorbitant to some. However, the technology that’s packed into this headset more than makes the tag worthwhile, and there’s a reason why the world’s best pro players, especially those in the Call of Duty space, rely on this device.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the fundamentals. This is a wireless ANC headset, which means that when you’re playing, you’re unencumbered by cables and you won’t hear a thing around you. You’re completely in the zone and loving life, and that’s what this headset is all about.</p>



<p>It uses Razer’s Hyperspeed technology to ensure you’re getting low-latency connections that deliver your audio as clearly and efficiently as possible, which is of the utmost importance for <strong>any gamer</strong>, as audio desync is a harrowing issue that prevents the pinnacle of performance being delivered.</p>



<p>If you’re playing as part of a team, you’ve got the Hyperclear, detachable boom mic, which has a fat pop filter to keep your vocals clean and your callouts succinct. I used the boom mic on a range of software to test it out, from OBS to Audacity, and from Discord to in-game voice chats, and I can confirm it’s just as clear as most desktop podcast microphones, which is <strong>nice</strong>.</p>



<p>The Razer Blackshark V3 Pro comes in a range of designs, from black to white, and from ‘esports green’ to a special-edition Counter-Strike 2 version. I’m a <strong>huge </strong>fan of the esports green variant, which is available exclusively from Razer, but for my review of this headset, I used the clean white version.</p>



<p>For this new generation of the Razer Blackshark headset, the tech titan has pumped new technology behind the cups. The extremely capable drivers have been tweaked to reduce harmonic distortion, the bass range has been improved, and the directional audio capabilities are second-to-none, thanks to the THX Spatial on-board mechanics.</p>



<p>Put simply, you’ll hear a foot scraping on the floor across the map and be able to pinpoint exactly where it came from.</p>



<p>It gets better, though.</p>



<p>The Razer Blackshark V3 Pro has <strong>quad mode</strong> connectivity, which means it can work with 2.4Ghz wireless bands, Bluetooth, USB inputs, <strong>or </strong>via a 3.5mm cable. The battery is also nuts, and without ANC turned on, you can get up to 70 hours of battery life. The only negative I have about the headset is that it could really do with a dock of some kind to make charging more ‘comfortable’ and seamless.</p>



<p>That’s why I love the Astro A50 Gen 5, after all.</p>



<p>Interchangeable faceplates, app control, customization through the Razer Synapse software, and incredible levels of comfort thanks to a low-weight profile and comfy cushioning all come together to make this one of the best headsets on the market right now for both casual and pro gamers.</p>



<p>Don’t sleep on the Razer Blackshark V3 Pro.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Razer Raiju V3 PRO Review—An Elite Alternative to Scuf and Battle Beaver]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/razer-raiju-v3-pro-review/</link>
            <guid>1368019</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re in the market for a ‘pro-grade’ controller and are considering a Scuf or a Battle Beaver, put those thoughts on hold. Instead, take a look at the Razer Raiju V3 Pro, an all-new device that’s customizable, capable, and created by the best technical minds at Razer, one of the most reputable gaming brands around.</p>



<p>In this Razer Raiju V3 Pro review, I’ll help you understand why this is one of the best alternatives to the eye-wateringly expensive pro controllers on the market, and why it’s definitely worth your investment.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-razer-raiju-v3-pro-worth-219-99">Is the Razer Raiju V3 Pro Worth $219.99?</h2>



<p>The Razer Raiju V3 Pro will set you back a pretty penny, but it’s worth every cent. I’ve been trialling this wonderful controller for a couple of weeks on <strong>both </strong>PlayStation and PC as I write this, and I have had a brilliant time. I’ve used it across Battlefield 6, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and ARC Raiders, and in every situation put before me, the controller has excelled.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the build.</p>



<p>The controller is bigger than your average Dualsense controller, but it uses a similar mapping in terms of thumbsticks and face buttons. It has the classic trackpad that you’ve learned to associate with PlayStation controllers, but the triggers and shoulder buttons are more reminiscent of an Xbox controller. It’s the perfect hybrid, in my eyes.</p>



<p>You’ve got two extra buttons alongside the shoulder inputs, and up to <strong>four </strong>tactile inputs on the back, all of which are hot-swappable and customizable in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>The thumbsticks are modular and can be swapped out just as quickly, and you get extras in the attractive carry pack that the controller comes in to suit your needs.</p>



<p>Additionally, almost every input on the controller is ‘mouse-click’ in build, the triggers come with stops that you can switch on and off to suit your game, and the entire thing is wrapped up in a comfortable, durable shell that looks great and feels nice in your hands.</p>



<p>It’s as premium as you can get, and it still comes in under the cost of a Scuf or a Battle Beaver.</p>



<p>But wait, <strong>there’s more!</strong></p>



<p>The Razer Raiju V3 Pro can be further adjusted with Razer’s Synapse software, which includes creating on-board profiles, setting actuation points, adjusting deadzones, remapping inputs, and so on.</p>



<p>If you want to use the controller wirelessly on a PS5, you’re covered. If you’d rather go wired on a PC, you can do that too – and you can switch between those inputs easily enough. The Razer Raiju V3 Pro is marketed as a ‘lag-free, esports-grade’ device, which means you have lightning-fast response times and super-low latency inputs.</p>



<p>It’s expensive, but that’s the point. It’s a premium controller that’ll suit the best pro players in the world, and it has been crafted in collaboration with those very competitors, especially in the Call of Duty space. It takes a while to get used to the inputs if you’ve never used a controller like this, but it’s well worth investing that time to seek those results in-game.</p>



<p>I can’t fault the Razer Raiju V3 Pro controller, and that’s rare for me when it comes to reviewing peripherals.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ve bought a Raiju V3 Pro and what you think about it.</p>

            <guid>1368007</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A rot that started long ago in the Jade Abbey has surged, making a final push, seeking to taint the sacred water of the Everspring. One of its former keepers has gathered a group to stop this from happening, hoping to save the entire realm from falling entirely to the Chaos god Nurgle. <em>Warhammer Quest</em> is back! In this spoiler-free article, we check out the brand new set, <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em>.</p>

<p>We've covered previous editions of <i>Warhammer Quest</i> on the site, including the futuristic <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> iteration, <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/on-tabletop-warhammer-quest-blackstone-fortress" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Blackstone Fortress</a>, and the horror-filled streets of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-quest-cursed-city-preview" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Cursed City</a>.</p>




<h2>What's the Quest?</h2>

<p>The original <i>Warhammer Quest </i>hit tabletops in 1995, following the earlier success of <em>HeroQuest</em>, which has also seen a recent revival. Games Workshop brought <em>Warhammer Quest</em> back in 2016, and since then, we've seen new iterations, using the same concept of players cooperatively exploring and conquering a dungeon. Each edition has had variations in rules and mechanics, along with a brand-new setting for each.</p>

<p>This time, <em>Warhammer Quest</em> continues to explore the depths of the <em>Age of Sigmar</em> setting, moving away from the snowy, cramped, and death-filled streets of Ulfenkarn to Ghyran, the realm of life, and the Jade Abbey, the source of the powerful waters of the Everspring, for which Nurlge, the plague god, has set his sights.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-3.jpg?itok=xg-rblNb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-3.jpg?itok=ElU6mTxL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I absolutely love the background for <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em>. Gelgus Pust, a Chaos Champion of Nurgle, has sought to control the Everspring ever since he betrayed his order. Once a senior in the Jade Abbey, his lust for power corrupted him, and he brought others with him in a revolt that nearly captured the Everspring. To stop him, the Everqueen flooded the Jade Abbey, wiping out attackers and defenders alike, but keeping the Everspring from falling into the Chaos God's hands.</p>

<p>Pust has since been on a ruthless campaign, steadily weakening the defences of the Jade Abbey over centuries until he's now in a position to strike. But there are heroes willing to risk it all to stop him. Gathered by Inara Sion, a former colleague of Gelgus and the last surviving member of the Jade Circle, tasked with defending the Everspring. The battle between Pust and Inara, finally coming to settle the score after centuries, sets the stage for the adventure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-2.jpg?itok=bovzTfmG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-2.jpg?itok=f9iIgzaG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> map book makes game set up incredibly fast.</figcaption></figure><h2>Mechanics Of Life</h2>

<p><em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> has several mechanical changes from previous editions. The first is the inclusion of a map book, which takes the place of the map tiles from previous editions. This takes away the ability to randomly generate maps and instead fixes maps to those available in the map book. There is still variety to be found, and different missions, enemies, and map placement can make the same map into an entirely new experience. The benefit of the map book is that it speeds up setup time to almost nothing, as you only have to find the map page of the quest card, set up the enemies, heroes, and items, and you're ready to play. In a game that can serve as an entry game into the wider <em>Warhammer</em> and <em>Age of Sigmar</em> settings, this change is very welcome and lets you focus on the core delivery, rather than spending time building a map out of tiles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-6.jpg?itok=6DygxOqc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-6.jpg?itok=8fs4yIAY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each characters turn in&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater </em>is driven by actions cards.</figcaption></figure><p>The second noticeable mechanical change is that actions are now cards. Each hero starts with 3 core action cards, move, attack, and aid, and each has the dual effect of letting you complete the action and providing the energy to complete other actions. Each time you use an action card, you need to expend other action cards with enough energy to complete the action, which can include the action you are completing.</p>

<p>So you can exhaust the aid card to move, then exhaust the move card to move, and then the attack card to attack, or use all 3 to attack, or any combination thereof. Characters can also gain other action cards, increasing their available energy for the turn, and actions not on cards can also be taken with special quest actions, or individual character actions detailed on their character card. This mechanic will be familiar to those who've played <em>Warhammer Quest The Adventure Card Game</em>, and was one of my favorite mechanics from the game.</p>

<p>I've always loved the action card mechanic, it makes it super clear what you can do each turn and keeps everything really clean visually, especially as you gain actions that provide energy. It really feels like leveling up your hero as they can complete more each turn. The action mechanics themselves are also really straightforward, with the number of dice to roll in an attack listed, and the number you need to roll as well. Enemies block attacks equal to their defence value, which keeps combat really quick.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-8.jpg?itok=yTIJn9Pl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-8.jpg?itok=XsGDPQ2T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Most characters in&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> have random movement values, which keeps the action tense.</figcaption></figure><p>Most of the starting characters have a random value for movement, which I was initially skeptical of, but was on board with immediately when playing. It takes away from the fixed puzzle nature of some games, where you know if you move here, you can attack or take this action. The randomness of possibly having to take 2 move actions to get to where you need to be, or having a great dice roll and getting there in 1 move, feels very heroic. It also feels very in keeping with regular board games, where your movement is usually based on a dice roll. The exception to this is Drolf, the Duardin, who has a fixed move. This feels very thematic and sets Drolf out with the fixed, determined nature of the Duardin, but also their restriction on speed.</p>

<p>Enemies are controlled with custom dice that give them a simple series of actions they carry out when activated, with stronger enemies taking multiple actions as they scale up. Their movement and attacks feel purposeful, but are quick and simple enough that you get to focus on the heroes, rather than getting bogged down in the minutia of individual swarms of enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-4.jpg?itok=WGNRjMoA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-4.jpg?itok=D34wIT77 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The 4 initial heroes of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater </em>give a solid mix of range and melee combat prowess.</figcaption></figure><h2>Heroes Of The Tale</h2>

<p><em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> features 4 heroes initially, and 3 unlockable heroes that you'll see on the box of the game, and as you put the miniatures together for the set. We'll leave you to discover the 3 unlockable heroes, but the 4 core heroes are:</p>

<ul><li>Edmark Valoran, known as the Manticore Knight, has the best defense of the heroes and has a chance to damage adjacent enemies when he blocks their hits. He starts the game with the Shield of the Manticore, which can be used to automatically block a hit before a saving throw.</li>
	<li>Bren Tylis, the Renegade Saint, gets to choose each round to reroll her move, attack, or save rolls. It's a pretty powerful ability, giving you a better chance to achieve what you need to that round. Bren starts the game with the Relics of the Past equipment card, which can be used when you discard a reward card to stop it from being discarded on a 5+, which is great for keeping some single-use items around.</li>
	<li>Inara Sion, the Cleansing Blade, has a poor defence, but a great ranged attack to keep her&nbsp;away from enemies. They also have a Barrier of Water ability on their card, which can be used like the core abilities to block hexes to enemies, and make lethal hexes safe for the heroes. Their Blade of Flowing Water equipment also lets her&nbsp;move the counter for free, without having to power the ability.</li>
	<li>Drolf Ironhead, the Grizzled Explorer, has a fixed movement, a ranged attack, and can ignore lethal hexes by sprinting through them (by spending more energy on the move card to move 6 hexes instead of the standard movement). They come equipped with the Ranger's Kit, which can let them move through blocked hexes, which is amazing for last-minute objective saves or flanking an enemy who might have your party pinned.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-5.jpg?itok=ZqPwGYau 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-5.jpg?itok=eopu3qqp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each of the 3&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> acts in the campaign are driven by the act cards. Cleanse the Spawn Pit is used as the tutorial for your first game.</figcaption></figure><h2>Standing Against The Rot</h2>

<p>The <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> campaign consists of 3 acts, and each act is made up of 15 act cards (drawn randomly from 32 for each act). Each act has a final boss (of which there are 3 possible scenarios to face them in), and another 14 cards made up of encounters, events, and rest sites.</p>

<p>This means that you could play the game through all 3 acts, deliberately using different cards for each play-through, and have 2 unique play-throughs with still a spare card and an extra boss scenario, but the randomisation element will keep each play-through unique, or if you just want a one-off game, you can use any of the acts in skirmish mode.</p>

<p>Playing through the campaign first, before embarking on skirmish mode, is worthwhile, as you unlock extra characters and rewards as you do, and it avoids spoilers in skirmish mode, should you wish to play through the entire campaign.</p>

<p>Each encounter is pretty fast to play through, and you can get through a few in an evening, or half an act if you're lucky with event and rest site cards. This is helped by the quick setup for each encounter, letting you progress onto the next quickly. There are also several storage boxes for the heroes and acts, to keep the cards tidy in the box, and help you remember where you got to if you do have to pack away before finishing the campaign.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-7.jpg?itok=MTW8yZpT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-7.jpg?itok=-syZg5L0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater </em>final boss. Gelgus Pust!</figcaption></figure><h2>Warhammer Quest Darkwater Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>I had an absolute blast with<i> Warhammer Quest Darkwater.</i> I started my journey into miniatures gaming with <em>Heroquest</em> in the early '90s,&nbsp;and I played the original <em>Warhammer Quest</em> on release a few years later, so there's always been a bit of nostalgia here for me. Having also played the last 2 iterations, <em>Blackstone Fortress</em> and <em>Cursed City</em>, and reviewing them here on the site, this has been one of my favourite dungeon crawler games to date. The setting is perfect, and it captures the oppressive rot nature of Nurgle, whilst still being accessible for gamers who might be having their first experience here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Set up is fast, and games have a great flow with straightforward AI control for the enemies. The heroes feel unique, and the campaign is fast-flowing, but long enough to give it a great sense of depth. Repeat plays are also possible with the number of act cards across the 3 acts, and randomising them when generating the campaign. Previous <em>Warhammer Quest</em> editions got multiple expansions, and I hope that we see that here for <em>Darkwater</em> too.</p>

<hr>



<h3 id="h-kdd-headset-stand-with-charging-station">KDD Headset Stand With Charging Station</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Any streamer or content creator needs to ensure they have all their required equipment fully charged and ready to go, which is where the KDD Headset Stand comes in perfectly. Equipped with 2 USB and 1 type-C charging port, it can be used to charge smartphones, tablets, headphones, controllers, and more, making it among the best gifts for streamers.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-overhead-camera-mount-with-ring-light">Overhead Camera Mount with Ring Light</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re thinking of doing top-down content, like pack openings or drawings, an overhead camera with a light is a must-have, and this has both in one.

<hr>



<h3 id="h-pqrqp-3-in-1-wireless-lavalier-microphone">PQRQP 3-in-1 Wireless Lavalier Microphone</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Recording content on the go means you should have a clippable microphone to block out background noise and focus on exactly the source you want, and this 3-in-1 microphone presents an affordable option. Compatible with iPhone, Android, cameras, and more, it’s the perfect tool for content creating on the go.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-frigidaire-retro-9-can-personal-fridge">Frigidaire Retro 9-Can Personal Fridge</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Long sessions on stream or editing content can be taxing, and you don’t want to have to keep on going in and out for refreshments.

<hr>



<h3 id="h-elgato-prompter">Elgato Prompter</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Keeping engaged with chat is crucial for any live streamer or content creator, but you don’t want to crank your neck turning your head to different monitors.

<hr>



<h3 id="h-neewer-collapsible-backdrop">Neewer Collapsible Backdrop</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A green screen might not be an immediate necessity but, once you start using it, you’ll never look the other way again. The Neewer Collapsible Backdrop has both green and blue screen, coming double-sided, and is easy to put up and store, all available for a decent price.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-elgato-4k-s-external-capture-card">Elgato 4K S External Capture Card</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A capture card is one of the most important items for any streamer or content creators, as it quickly captures all content from an external source, like a console, and connects it to PC and your stream. Without it, you’ll be limited on your options when streaming, and it should be one of the first things you pick up when you get started.</p>

        <p><strong>A Letter from the Developers</strong></p><p>To everyone who has been waiting for this game, we are truly sorry.</p><p>The release date has been moved to “2026.” We apologize for keeping you waiting yet again. The support we’ve received, from the excitement voiced across various communities to the feedback from players who tried the demo at events, has been a tremendous source of encouragement for our team. We are deeply grateful.</p><p>This project involves implementing an unusual system into the game. We believe this system will make the experience truly one-of-a-kind, but such an ambitious approach also presents significant challenges.</p><p>There were moments when we wondered if perhaps creating a game like this was too early for us—or even for humanity—but after much trial and error, the final vision is gradually taking shape. Because we want to present the game at its best, we kindly ask for a little more time.</p><p>Additionally, because of how the game plays, the user interface, and story all change based on the player’s actions. Which means even sharing small bits of information becomes potential spoilers. This has made it difficult to communicate ongoing progress through social media, even though development is continuing steadily each day under director EIKI.</p><p>We are eagerly looking forward to the day when we can share this game with all of you, and we hope you will look forward to it as well. Your patience would mean the world to us.</p><p>Thank you once again for your continued support of <em>EDEN.schemata();</em>.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/eden-schemata-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

Yunyun all over this ♡♡♡♡ world with your degen otaku-posting.</p><p>High and vibin’ with denpa songs, we’ll corrupt the entire Internet! Hehe. all we need is a bit of otaku love, that’s all.</p><p>This is a rhythm-adventure game where you play as a hikikomori (shut-in) girl who’s high on denpa songs. Become Yunyun-brained and lose all self-control to anonymously post on social media and destroy the world with your Yunyun brain rot.<br><!-- AD: content -->
        </p>Have a Doki-Doki experience with over 30 denpa songs and multiple endings.<ul><li>Q. Why did she become a hikikomori?</li><li>Q. How does anonymous online posting lead to world destruction?</li><li>Q. Does a happy ending exist for a degenerate otaku?</li></ul><p>The answers to those “Q’s” lie at the convergence of insanity and denpa psychosis. Now, put those headphones on and become ill with <em>Yunyun Syndrome!? Rhythm Psychosis</em>.</p><p><strong>Groove to the DENPA!</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Anonymously Post Online and Infect the Whole World with Yunyun-Brain!</strong> – Get high on denpa songs and sink in the depths of social media!! Browse social media at the start of the song to check up on your Yunyun cult and haters. And then prepare for the climax where you can start dropping posts left and right. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [105 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully posting will cause other social media users to become psychotically Yunyun-ified.

Her obsessive love for the fictional character “Yunyun” is for sure an illness. Her overly “high” state from overdosing denpa songs causes her to propagate Yunyun love. Will there really be a happy end for such a degenerate otaku?</li><li><strong>Yunyun</strong> – A fictional character that loves Qtie. A very much angelic devil. She will speak to Qtie through the monitor screen. Whilst the truth is unknown, most likely, she is just a figment of Qtie’s imagination. It’s joever for her.</li></ul><p><strong>About Denpa Songs!</strong></p><p>“Denpa” is a genre of music that is intentionally strange and catchy. All playable songs in this game are denpa songs. Many popular denpa songs such as “it’s a cherry kissing explosion” (Sakuranbo Kiss) and many more are featured!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Second Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Yunyun Syndrome!

<p>This follows the news in July that Nintendo would be discontinuing Switch Online Vouchers.

        <p><em>All Adrift</em> is an aesthetic epic on a cosmic scale—a fusion of literary text, painterly visuals, and the interplay of classical and modern music.</p><p>The player becomes Sian Lightchaser—a survivor of an immortal, cursed race, captured by the Arwin Empire and forced to perform surgery on the history of the universe.</p><p>She is imprisoned in the role of a Sacred Author, tasked with creating a religion to glorify Arwin’s eternal authority and the deification of its ruling class.<br>Sian drifts through a cosmos where the ending war has dragged on for four centuries beyond the armistice, repainting the history of the universe as both victim and collaborator.</p><p>This work is a narrative-driven <a title="Genres > Simulation [885 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> adventure that explores the irony of guilt and <a title="Genres > Survival [486 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> through Sian—dispatched across multiple universes to create “Arwinism” for those who massacred her own people, and compelled to confront the unfathomable vastness and histories of the cosmos as she operates on the past and present of planets.</p><p>It is not merely a “game to be played,” but a “philosophical opera” that asks how humanity survives within the indelible memory of its own sins.</p><p>…</p><p>Sian sits in the carriage, gazing out the window. A beautiful flash of gold spreads like a fracture, cracking through the white clouds, as if to swallow the entire sky, then fades. Arwin Type 38; perhaps the light shed by that terminal technology as it swept across yet another helpless galaxy. She envisions the histories erased by that fleeting light. Are those the scars of human sin, or the creases of a world fading away? Either could be true. In an age where humane reflection itself has turned into an odd taste, she plays, if only briefly, the role of an oddity.</p><p>Sian still sits in the carriage, gazing out the window. Among the guides busily selling death, one rushes toward the carriage with the vigor of a market peddler, reminding her that this planet she has just arrived on is experimenting with the entertainment of death.</p><p><strong>The Most Ecstatic Deaths: Best Selection</strong></p><p>That ironic title is brazenly stitched in bright thread across the cover the guide thrusts at her window—beside an illustration of the dead, smiling faintly as they lie in ordered rows. The headless coachman gestured threateningly for him to leave. The guide’s eyes, having found no head to glare at, briefly wandered the coachman’s body—until they caught the emblem of Arwin. The moment they did, his eyes dropped, as if to escape a gaze that does not exist.</p><p>In front of all this fuss, Sian sits in the carriage, gazing out the window. Her focus drifts indifferently to the billboard above the road.</p><p><strong>Casualties Today: 91,060,000,080</strong></p><p>Four hundred years of ceasefire, held in the name of peace negotiations—and despite centuries of propaganda declaring that “the war is ending,” countless lives still vanish each day, leaving nothing behind, consumed as numbers wielded by those who are unaccountable. Just a numbers game. An endless numbers game. A goddamn huge numbers game. As Sian stares at the board, trying to count the numbers that must have vanished during the long truce, when a sudden voice bursts from the carriage speaker, the fervent cry of the propaganda hour.</p><p>“History is written in Arwin’s handwriting!”</p><p>Lies.</p><p>“Our noble honor is born from devotion to the Empire…”</p><p>Noble lies.</p><p>“The great Arwinian does not fear death—death fears the Arwinian!”</p><p>Great, filthy lies.</p><p>“Entrust your future to the Empire!”</p><p>That one’s honest.</p><p>In this world that can reach every star, whose freedom stretches long only to narrow into a cage, Sian listens to the propaganda echoing through the carriage and thinks.</p><p>Is even this not enough? After obliterating all those peoples, after wiping out all those planets, after rendering all those lives less than mere numbers, is there still something left that must be carved away, resurrecting even this forbidden technology of cosmic surgery?</p><p>She looks at the cursed surgical instrument in her hand, the tool that can turn every life beyond the window into something less than a number. The weight of karma crushes her, suffocating every thought and feeling. Tomorrow’s throat lies in her hand. And now, it is her turn to wield it.</p><p>Surely, there is no god in such a cruel world. Certainly not. Even if there were, it would not be one from which we could hope for salvation. But that was the story up to now. What of tomorrow? At the heart of Arwin’s capital, a tower white enough to be black coils like a serpent, coveting the seat of a godless world as it creeps darkly toward tomorrow.</p><p>Above all these stories, Sian sits imprisoned in the carriage. For a while yet, she will remain so.</p><p>Ribbit!</p><p><strong>Staff</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Producer, Director, Writer, Game Design Director, Art Director, Music Producer:</strong> Bae Sang Hyun</li><li><strong>Game Designer, Programmer:</strong> Woo Gi Hun</li><li><strong>Composer:</strong> Park Na Hyun</li><li><strong>Voice Cast:</strong> <a title="Games > Mare [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mare">Mare</a> Flos, Bae Sang Hyun, Kim Han Baek</li><li><strong>Trailer Voice:</strong> Kim Sin Woo</li></ul></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/story-driven-adventure-game-all-adrift-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

The game progresses in semi-real time, and players intervene while watching over the <a title="Genres > Action [3,239 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s of the residents.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>December 31, 1988. Due to the murder of a resident “Ms. Noroi” in one of her apartment rooms, the apartment was in danger of being demolished.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>It was a story that was no stranger to “Urami-chan,” the earthbound spirit in her room. Jishibei spirits disappear when they no longer have a place to call their own. With the advice of the human spirit “Onebii,” she returned to the past and took action to change Noroi’s future.</p><p><strong>How to Play</strong></p><p>One month from the time Ms. Noroi moved in until she was murdered.
