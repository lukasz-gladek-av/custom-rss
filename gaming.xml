<p>Winter roadmap reveals all</p>

<figure data-uuid="0bb127315c942"><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Claws of Awaji" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0bb127315c942/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> arrived as an <em>almost</em> complete package on Switch 2 at the end of last year. The only content missing from this portable version was the Claws of Awaji expansion — which had landed on other systems back in September — for which Ubisoft provided a vague 'coming later in 2026' release window. Well, the big Ubi has today been a bit more specific.</p>
<p>As revealed in the new <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/5DtVYhhrhh2Oe2JXEjxpSU/ac-shadows-parkour-challenge-and-tu-118-get-ready-for-manual-jumps">Shadows Winter Roadmap</a>, the expansion will launch on Switch 2 on <strong>10th March</strong>. This paid DLC includes a whole new area to explore and storyline to follow, as Naoe and Yasuke head to the island of Awaji to track down a lost treasure. There are also new weapons and skins to unlock in the DLC, all of which can be carried back over to the main game to use as you please.</p><div><figure data-videoid="yv59MOA4ebw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytyv59MOA4ebw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed773c0eiwvpgk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Before this expansion comes our way, however, Ubisoft has another title update for Shadows, which it'll be dropping tomorrow (17th February). The ver. 1.1.8 update includes new detailed stat pages, a fresh visual feedback for critical hits, and marks the addition of a manual jump option in parkour.</p>
<figure data-uuid="829da49edcd79"><a title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Winter 2026 Roadmap" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/829da49edcd79/assassins-creed-shadows-winter-2026-roadmap.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only other thing on the roadmap as it stands is the game's one-year anniversary celebration, which Ubisoft has said will kick off on 20th March with livestreams and giveaways.</p>
<p>We had a great time with Shadows when it arrived on Switch 2 last year, calling it "a colossal achievement and one of the best-looking games on Nintendo’s console" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">our 8/10 review</a>. Our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a> weren't quite as hot on the Claws of Awaji expansion following its PS5 release, claiming that "it never really elevates itself beyond the base game" in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji">their 6/10 review</a>. We'll have to wait and see what we make of it on Switch 2 next month!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pim-neill-girl-scout-cookie-record-thin-mint-2000669457</link>
            <guid>1437553</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s that time of year when millions of young girls learn what it takes to be an entrepreneur—Girl Scout cookie season! Selling cookies can be challenging, but for one 6-year-old, reaching record-breaking sales is a piece of cookie cake. All it took was some clever social media buildcrafting and algorithm exploits.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Pim Neill is a Daisy Scout in Pittsburgh. On Sunday, she finally made it to a whopping 100,000 cookie box sales in just a single season, blowing past the national record. </span><span>A modern girl in a modern world, Pim and her family made social media posts to promote her cookies to wild success.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Hi, my name is Pim. Do you wanna buy some Girl Scout cookies?” Pim asks in a TikTok, holding a box of Thin Mints. Her blue glasses match her Girl Scout vest, and she ends the video with a gracious, “Thank you.” The TikTok has over five million views.</span></p>   <p><span>While her astronomical success may be attributed to the internet, that isn’t stopping Pim from also putting in the work the traditional way: going door-to-door in her neighborhood.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Pim wanted to join the Girl Scouts because when she was 3, she saw the girls selling cookies,” Luke Anorak-Neill, Pim’s dad, </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/pim-neill-girl-scout-cookies-record/"><span>told</span></a><span> CBS Pittsburgh. “This whole thing started by her observing girls performing what most people think is the only thing Girl Scouts do, and that’s sell Girl Scout cookies.”</span></p>

 <p><span>At first, Anorak-Neill had trouble finding a troop for Pim to join. “Our first troop, unfortunately, when we tried to join and ask questions about joining, the lady said that Pim’s disabilities would hold back the troop, and they didn’t want her to join,” he said. “And that was really disappointing, but I decided she must not speak for all Girl Scouts as a whole.”</span></p> <p><span>Pim was turned away from another troop for being too young. But finally, her family eventually found a match: a kindergarten-only troop where she is now a Daisy Scout with 10 other girls. </span><span>She began her history-making cookie campaign at the start of January. “We’ve had so much support from Girl Scouts navigating it,” said Anorak-Neill. “We’ve had a lot of support, and we’re just excited that we’re inspiring so many more girls.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Pim’s favorite cookies are Thin Mints, but she has also grown a liking for Samoas. You can buy Thin Mints, Samoas, and more from </span><a href="https://digitalcookie.girlscouts.org/scout/pim391562"><span>Pim’s digital storefront</span></a><span> until March 22.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of the most well-received games of 2025 could be heading to Xbox Game Pass. A post on social media on Monday talked about the future of additions to Xbox Game Pass this year, with a not-so-subtle tease of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p>



<p><strong>“We’ve got quite the release slate lined up for Xbox Game Pass so far, this is going to be a huge year,”</strong> <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/2023442179625259508?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the “email” reads.</a> <strong>“Oh, and speaking of upcoming releases… well, I shouldn’t say too much, but if you’re getting quite hungry for a fun adventure, all I can say is that something big is about to be deliverance’d to Xbox Game Pass…”</strong></p>







<p>While not specifically naming the game, using the term “deliverance’d” is a dead giveaway for what’s to come. Xbox is getting ready to announce the next wave of games for the service, which could see it come sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>The original Kingdom Come: Deliverance is already available on the subscription service for those with an Ultimate, PC, or Premium membership.</p>

            <guid>1437544</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="a5d0fca22c7d9"><a title="Horses!" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a5d0fca22c7d9/horses.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Kate Gray</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>In the magazine business, the back page is where you'd find all the weird goofs that we couldn't fit in anywhere else. Some may call it "filler"; we prefer "a whole page to make terrible jokes that are tangentially related to the content of the mag".</em></p>
<p><em>We don't have pages on the internet, but we still love terrible jokes — so welcome to our semi-regular feature, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/back-page">Back Page</a>.</em> <em>Today, Kate celebrates the approaching Chinese New Year with a look at the finest equines in video games...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It's almost the Year of the Horse, y'all! The Chinese Zodiac calendar has rolled around once more to this majestic four-legged muscle-beast, after 12 years of horseless behaviour. In fact, the last time it was The Year of the Horse, it was <em>also</em> the tail-end of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/03/feature_looking_back_on_the_year_of_luigi">The Year of Luigi</a>. Remember that? Remember how beautiful life was in 2014? Life can be beautiful again, with the help of horse.</p>
<p>Now, you might be wondering what makes me qualified to write about horses, when I am neither a horse nor a horse expert. But I've written lists of the Best Cows in Games before, and horses are actually a lot like cows in many ways, if you really think about it (four legs, lives on farm, could very easily kill you). Also, if that's not enough, I've enlisted the help of Actual Horse Expert, <strong>Alice Ruppert</strong>, who runs <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/">The Mane Quest</a>, the internet's premier Horse Game Website, to agree with my horse opinions.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:161473,117581,183995/kates-ever-growing-list-of-animal-related-back-pages @ 1771268461 -->
<p>So, now that you know that I am 100% very knowledgeable about horses, here are the <strong>Best Horses on the Nintendo Switch</strong>, in no particular order, because I don't want to upset the horses and have them kick me in the skull.</p>
<h2><del>Kate's</del> Nintendo Life's Official List Of Best Horses</h2>
<h3>Epona</h3>
<figure data-uuid="ec89a9de90d18"><a title="Zelda honse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ec89a9de90d18/zelda-honse.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>She waited seven years for us! What a good horse — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate, Amateur Enjoyer Of Horses:</strong> We'll start off basic with everyone's favourite video game horse: Epona. Link's steady companion from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Ocarina of Time</a> onwards, this chestnut mare was raised by Malon and is iconic enough to earn her own song <em>and</em> appear on the title screen.</p>
<p>Yes, in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, Link can obtain some very cool horses — the Giant Horse and the Royal White Stallion — but it's always Epona that has our heart. She's a good, good horse.</p>
<p><strong>Alice Ruppert, Horse Expert:</strong> My special shoutout goes to <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2019/9/17/horses-in-games-companions-and-collectibles">Twilight Princess’ Epona</a>, where she even gets her own rescue subplot, and unlocking her as a mount is made infinitely more satisfying by virtue of having to fight to get her back. Acquiring in-game mounts through story missions like that is so underrated, and I want more of it!</p>
<h3>Roach</h3>
<figure data-uuid="99c5cdb252316"><a title="Roach" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/99c5cdb252316/roach.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Now kiss — <em><span></span> Image: CD Projekt Red / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Geralt's faithful steed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher</a>, Roach, is actually a <em>bunch</em> of horses, because it turns out that Geralt goes through horses like he goes through girlfriends. But he always has a Roach, and that Roach always patiently listens to him as he talks about stuff, as detailed in this quote from Blood and Wine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Many a witcher has talked over the nuts and bolts of his current contract with his horse while staring at the stars shining above the lonely road, though few would ever admit to this."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the same journal entry also lightly ribs Roach for her tendency to act in an un-horse-like manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In truth, though, he was very attached to her and would never trade her for any other horse. Not even one which, when summoned, would never stand helpless in front of a seemingly easily surmountable obstacle, such as a low fence or stray piece of timber. Nor even one which would sometimes, in some incomprehensible fashion, wind up dancing on some peasant's roof. 'Well,' Geralt would say with a shrug. 'A witcher's horse isn't a normal animal. Constant contact with magic beverages and Signs must have left a mark.'"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Geralt doesn't really have a lot of friends, but Roach is definitely one of them. Isn't that just lovely?</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> Roach is love, Roach is life. Though, I gotta say: massive missed opportunity in The Witcher 3 that they didn’t just recolour Roach while Geralt is on Skellige without any further comment on it! Like, we see in the cutscenes that Geralt arrives by shipwreck, no way he brought a horse along! It would have been so funny for Roach to just be a visibly different horse while he’s on the island, and to switch back whenever you fast-travel back to the mainland.</p>
<p>I am SO excited to see what CDPR ends up doing with Kelpie in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/witcher_4">The Witcher 4</a>… Because that <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2025/6/4/welcome-kelpie-an-unreal-tech-showcase-gives-us-a-first-look-at-ciris-horse-in-the-witcher-4">tech demo they showed</a> was immensely promising, not just in terms of animation and anatomy, but also in treating the horse like a <a href="https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2026/1/9/living-creatures-vs-meat-motorcycles-how-to-make-horses-in-games-feel-alive">character, rather than a vehicle</a>!</p>
<h3>Skyrim Horses</h3>
<figure data-uuid="a2bbfc5b70212"><a title="Skyrim horse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a2bbfc5b70212/skyrim-horse.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Iconic.</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Yes, you can walk across <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim">Skyrim</a>. Yes, you can hire horsecarts to fast-travel you to places. But there's a reason that navigating sheer cliffs via horse is referred to as 'Skyrimming' your way up a mountain (at least, in my household).</p>
<p>Horses in Skyrim allow you to cheese your way up previously insurmountable obstacles, with their powerful and probably magic legs that can apparently handle the craggiest of terrain with no problems. We can learn a lesson or two from Skyrim's horses. Mostly about rock climbing.</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> I have to say, for all the silly rock climbing antics people make fun of when it comes to Skyrim horses, the models themselves actually manage to look quite good even when being vertically plastered to cliffs! Say what you will about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F5b39bjcgfyzd1.jpeg">t</a>he above image, but that still looks a lot better to me than many alternatives, where the inverse kinematics lead to horribly broken-looking bent forelegs!</p>

<h3>The Horse From A Wonderful Life</h3>
<figure data-uuid="f979f6bf4e207"><a title="AWL horse" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f979f6bf4e207/awl-horse.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>This is Not How Horses Work — <em><span></span> Image: Marvelous / XSEED</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: So far, many of our best horses have had some specific boon — friendship, mountain climbing, cool songs — but the horse from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_a_wonderful_life">Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life</a> is just a Very Nice Horse. The Harvest Moon games are beloved for their extremely likeable cows, which means that this lovely horse gets overlooked.</p>
<p>But look at it! Such a gloriously long face! Even for a horse! Regard its little hooves! Witness its voluminous tail! And it comes in <em>three colours!</em> This horse is a nice horse.</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> This one loses points for its beady eyes, weirdly placed foreleg joints, and flesh-colored ears, even if it <em>does</em> have a nicely voluminous tail.</p>
<h3>Pokémon Horses</h3>
<figure data-uuid="221d6b8e17d3c"><a title="Spectrier but big" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/221d6b8e17d3c/spectrier-but-big.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>My steed is too big — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Game Freak</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kate</strong>: Forgive me for grouping all these fine fillies and stellar stallions together, but we'd be here all day if I did them all separately.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Pokémon</a> has a lot of good horses, you see.</p>
<p>There's the dual legendaries, <strong>Spectrier</strong> and <strong>Glastrier</strong> – the former, a gloriously goth horse that would have been my absolute favourite as an emo tween, and the latter a stately ice-horse with the ability Chilling Neigh, which is immediately cool as heck.</p>
<p>There's <strong>Ponyta</strong> and <strong>Rapidash</strong>, the beloved horses from the OG 150, with their adorable candy floss Galarian forms, and their (very appropriate for the Year of the Fire Horse) flaming manes.</p>
<p>There's <strong>Mudsdale</strong>, the shire-horse-like lad who evolves, somehow, from a donkey, with big, beefy legs that can carry you across the plains of Alola <em>or</em> stomp your opponents into submission.</p>
<p>Then there's <strong>Keldeo</strong>, the mythical Colt Pokémon, with the alternate form of "what if really big horn", which functions as a sword. Very neat! Very dangerous! I'm glad real-life horses don't have face-knives!</p>
<figure data-uuid="21ce64a074f46"><a title="Arceus" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/21ce64a074f46/arceus.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Horse-god. Or god-horse. Either way, definitely a horse — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Game Freak</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, we've got <strong>Arceus</strong> — the literal god of the Pokémon world — who is less obviously 'horse' than the others, thanks to its pointy feet and deer-like grace, but we're calling it a horse.</p>
<p>With two legendary horses, one mythical horse, and an actual god horse, we have the suspicion that there's someone on the Game Freak team who really, <em>really</em> likes horses. And who can blame them?</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> I love Mudsdale for being rare draft horse representation, but Ponyta and Rapidash are the <em>clear</em> winners of ‘best horse Pokémon’, if you ask me. You know how people sometimes complain that all Pokémon designs are getting rounder and don’t have sharp lines anymore? That applies to almost all cartoon horses, too, but actually having some sharp lines and edges are what makes cartoon horses more horse-y! Ponyta and Rapidash had some <em>edge</em>, and that’s wonderful. Also, they’re literally on fire. What else can you ask for?</p>

<p><strong>Kate</strong>: This horse can wear hats. It's an expensive investment, but well worth it. Because it can WEAR HATS.</p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>, but I will never not be salty that of all animals in the game, this is the only one you cannot build a relationship with, and you cannot do <em>anything</em> that would count as ‘taking care of it’. No filling a water bowl, like you can for your dog or cat, no feeding or giving treats, no hearts to fill up, no stable upgrades.

            <p>
Creative Assembly have just detailed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>’s first character pack, these being “smaller, focused content drops built around a single character with their own unique feature, supported by a handful of exciting new units”, priced (in this case) at £3.99, $4.99 or €4.99 apiece. 
</p>
<p>
Yes, it’s Creative Assembly once again nosing at the shards of your smashed piggy bank, but the developers have, in theory, pre-empted any rancour over DLC nickel-and-diming by making the character pack cat-themed. Everybody loves cats! Even when they cost as much as a medium oatmilk latte. Especially cats like Bhashiva – an entirely new Warhammer character - and her company of Tiger Warriors. Look at her ickle grumpy face! Look at her ickle flaming twin katara! ARGH get it off me get it off me get it off me, etcetera.
</p>
<p>
Bhashiva and her feline gangsters will form part of the Grand Cathay faction, though sadly not, it seems, because some Creative Assembly designer spotted an obvious pun and was immediately assigned £100,000. The pack’s paid contents are one Legendary Lord, one Lord, three regular units, and a “Unique Campaign Feature, Final Battle, Quest Battle etc”.
</p>
<p>
What manner of combatant is Bhashiva, then? She’s a stealthy wrecking ball, equipped with incendiary weapons and a Heaven’s Gate blink-style ability. “Each strike not only scorches her victims but weakens their resistance to flame, letting her plough through fights the moment she commits,” enthuses <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/94">a blog post on CA’s site</a>. “Her agility is at the core of her playstyle; she darts between threats, repositions effortlessly, and uses her mastery of stealth to pick the perfect moment to appear.” 
</p>
<p>
Battle designer Josh King adds that “she’s the quiet dread in the back of your mind”. How very unlike my family’s own moggy, best summarised as “the quiet shitter in the back of the bedroom cupboard”.
</p>
<p>
As for the Tiger Warriors, they’re a gang of nippy ambushers and so, relatively exotic among the boxy formations of regular Grand Cathay. Their Clawspeaker spellcasters are vanguard units equipped with a mix of healing, beast and shadow lore, making them an “incredibly versatile force multiplier.” 
</p><p>
 If you don’t already own the Grand Cathay DLC, buying the Tiger Warrior character pack includes access to “the core Grand Cathay roster to ensure you get a complete experience”. We can expect more details down the line. Also down the line: the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 3’s Lords of the End Times expansion, which is chock full of necromancers. And sometime after that, the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-40000">Total War: Warhammer 40,000</a> - one of Julian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/julians-most-anticipated-games-for-2026">most anticipated games of 2026</a>. And sometime after that, a long time probably, the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creative-assembly-reveal-total-war-medieval-3-while-teasing-a-huge-game-reveal-to-follow">Total War: Medieval 3</a>.

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

These have been shared across the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/supermariomovie/">Galaxy Movie social accounts</a> and as a daily upload on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a>, but we thought it would be a good idea to gather them all together for you check out in one place.</p>
<p>Below, we've done just that! You'll find each of the seven posters in the order they were revealed, accompanied by a write-up of some smaller details you might have missed. Let's-a go!</p>

<p>"Same hero, new adventure."</p>
<p>You might have already spotted this one in our coverage from last week, but it's too good not to mention again. Aside from Mario pulling his iconic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Galaxy</a> 'spin' pose, we'll also give a shoutout to the range of enemies on display here. <em>Sledge Bro</em>? That's a deeper cut than we expected.</p>
<h3 id="luigi">Luigi</h3>
<figure data-uuid="cf1ecf62abd60"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cf1ecf62abd60/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Conquering his fears, no bones about it."</p>
<p>Luigi's spotlight is expectedly fear-filled, <em>but</em> we do get a closer look at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> Tostarena setting that we first saw in the film's initial reveal trailer and its skeletal inhabitants. It looks... well, like Tostarena.</p>
<h3 id="bowser">Bowser</h3>
<figure data-uuid="39ee7a3fa8d61"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39ee7a3fa8d61/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"He's got an ax (or two) to grind."</p>
<p>Aside from looking really rather threatening with those two axes held aloft, Bowser's poster crams a lot into the background. The big wheel and Bullet Bill merry-go-round have a whiff of World Bowser from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/super_mario_3d_world">Super Mario 3D World</a>, and what's with that giant UFO in the sky? Huh, looks like the King of the Koopas will be getting big again after all.</p>
<h3 id="peach-andamp-toad">Peach &amp; Toad</h3>
<figure data-uuid="40287951410dc"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/40287951410dc/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Always looking out for the little guy."</p>
<p>Wow, there are <em>a lot</em> of cameos in this one. The penguins make a return from the first movie, but we've also got the Galaxy Star Bunnies, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a>'s Pianta, a Conkdor, and even some Whittles from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>. And what's with all of those rockets blasting off to a nearby galaxy? Hmm, a lot to digest here.</p>
<h3 id="rosalina">Rosalina</h3>
<figure data-uuid="de4cce9f161ca"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/de4cce9f161ca/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"The stars of a new story."</p>
<p>Yep, we're fans of this Rosalina design. There's a particularly cute Baby Luma on the left, and our first proper look at the Comet Observatory in the background on the right.</p>
<h3 id="bowser-jr">Bowser Jr.</h3>
<figure data-uuid="5464d43f9f1e2"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5464d43f9f1e2/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"No wonder he's a menace."</p>
<p>A Bowser Jr-shaped planet, battleships, and a magic paintbrush that spits Piranha Plant ink? It's no wonder those Koopas down the bottom look scared.</p>
<h3 id="yoshi-baby-mario-andamp-baby-luigi">Yoshi, Baby Mario &amp; Baby Luigi</h3>
<figure data-uuid="0b37fe21a2978"><a title="Mario Galaxy Movie Character Posters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b37fe21a2978/mario-galaxy-movie-character-posters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The realistic T. rex model and waterfall-covered planet in the background have us wondering whether the Cascade Kingdom is joining Tostarena as another Odyssey cameo. It seems likely, no?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“No One Is Safe on the Platform”: Developers Call Out Valve’s Lacking Moderation of Abuse and Bigotry on Steam Forums and Reviews]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/valve-lack-of-steam-user-reviews-forums-moderation-called-out-by-developers/</link>
            <guid>1437511</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's well known that user reviews on <strong>Steam</strong> are a mixed bag, to say the least. You'll get everything from actually thoughtful reviews to snap reactions based on less than an hour spent with the game, and often see a slew of negative reviews that are clearly part of a review-bombing campaign of players complaining about a singular issue, regardless of that issue factoring in on the game's quality.</p>



<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/feb/16/bigotry-steam-pc-moderation-developers-speak-out">The Guardian</a> delves into another aspect of Steam's user reviews and forums, with developers and even some content creators speaking out about the <strong>abuse</strong> and <strong>bigotry</strong> that <strong>Valve</strong> allows to run rampant on the platform, despite several statements directly violating content guidelines set by Valve.</p>



<p>More than calling out the content itself, the issue developers and creators have is Valve's apparent unwillingness to do anything about it, offering little to no support, even with reviews that violate their own content guidelines. </p>



<p>One example included in the report describes how game designer <strong>Nathalie Lawhead</strong> wasn't able to get reviews with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alienmelon.bsky.social/post/3mbgpbpewsc2i">antisemitic comments that also mocked allegations she made regarding her sexual assault</a>, without using her public following, and ultimately, had to step outside the moderation process by directly asking someone they knew at Valve to remove the reviews.</p>



<p>Valve's moderators had cleared both reviews after Lawhead initially reported them, which prevented Lawhead from reporting them a second time, since developers cannot report a cleared review without the author editing it. The reviews were also cleared despite Valve's <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6862-8119-C23E-EA7B">user-generated content</a> and online <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/online_conduct">content guides</a> citing "<em>insults or harassment</em>," "<em>discrimination</em>," and "<em>public accusations towards others</em>" as examples of what not to do in user reviews. </p>



<p>Lawhead was able to remove the antisemitic review, while the other, which, like its antisemitic counterpart, accused Lawhead of lying about their sexual assault, cleared moderation even after it had been reported by others. It was then that Lawhead was able to get it removed after speaking with someone they knew at Valve. Before Lawhead took that route, all Valve said in response to their report was "<em>We aren't in a position to verify the accuracy of statements made in user reviews</em>," with Valve adding, "<em>we don't try to moderate reviews based on accuracy</em>," and claiming it was against removing reviews as it could be seen as "<em>censorship</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Everyone is at one another's throats all the time in reviews</em>," said content creator Bri 'BlondePizza' Moore. "<em>It ensures<strong> no one is safe on the platform; developers and consumers alike</strong></em>." For Lawhead's part, getting the response they got from Valve was "<em>crushing,</em>" adding, "<em>the implication seems to be that I must prove my sexual assault [to Steam] if I want to be protected from harassment over it. I am hard-pressed to see where the misunderstanding might be. They had all the information regarding the situation. It's an obvious stance. It's a choice</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This was too much work just for two obviously unjustifiable reviews</em>," Lawhead added. "<em>I think this entire process of moderation is <strong>broken</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Another example shared in the report describes how another developer, who did not have the kind of public following Lawhead did to fall back on, was unsuccessful in getting user reviews removed that had nothing to do with their game, and everything to do with whether the developer properly observed the assassination of Charlie Kirk last year.</p>



<p>Their game, <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1785940/COVEN/">Coven</a></strong>, is a first-person shooter and action game described as a "<em>hyper-violent retro FPS</em>," and it has also been targeted by a Steam curator, '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45778915">CharlieTweetsDetected,</a>' which recommends games based solely on whether the developer has posted something negative or not about Charlie Kirk's death. The developer, who wished only to be identified as Ethan, said that Steam was not interested or didn't seeminigly care that several of Coven's negative reviews stemmed from the curator list.</p>



<p>"<em>For sure, the 'anti-woke' curators brought insincere negative attention to the game</em>," says <strong>Émi Lefèvre</strong>, a developer behind <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1582650/Caravan_SandWitch/">Caravan SandWitch</a></strong>, a game that has several negative reviews that call it "<em>too LGBTQ...there is no future or continuation for these sad gays and lesbians</em>."</p>



<p>Lefèvre continues, "<em>Valve's refusal to moderate any of this is making Steam reviews and forums the battleground for some kind of culture war, and is making them unsafe for marginalized people and regular gamers trying to simply enjoy the game they bought</em>."</p>



<p>One developer who tried to report transphobic reviews to Steam was told they should "<em>continue working on the product, while letting the community use the helpfulness feature to surface reviews that they agree with or find to be uninformed</em>," language that was exactly similar to what Lawhead was told five years prior, showing no change or growth in its process in half a decade.</p>



<p>"<em>To us, it seemed that in Steam's [view], hateful comments about an individual is abuse - but targeting it towards a group of people is totally fine, that's welcome speech,</em>" said Phi, who received the above response when trying to remove transphobic reviews from their game. "<em>We had no other choice for what to do about transphobia in our reviews. They're still up there today</em>."</p>



<p>Lawhead concluded, "<em>If I am to continue existing on Steam, I am under the impression that I will have to go through this exhausting ordeal every time I want to report abuse. <strong>This shouldn't be normal.</strong></em><strong>"</strong></p>



<p>Valve's apparent unwillingness to moderate these reviews or even update its moderation process is only compounded as a problem when you consider that Steam is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-new-concurrent-player-record-over-41-million-players/">largest digital platform for PC games</a>, one that <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-majority-of-game-developers-believe-steam-has-monopoly-on-pc-game-distribution/">many developers believe to be a monopoly</a>. Beyond the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-operator-valve-faces-a-656m-class-action-lawsuit-over-its-excessive-30-cut-of-all-steam-sales/">economic issues this causes</a>, developers are forced to choose between publishing their games on platforms where Lawhead admits game publishers "<em>don't take you seriously</em>" because you're not on Steam, or stay on Steam, and endure reams of abuse. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Dev Bullied By Toxic Gamers Into Deleting Post About Toxic Gamers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-developer-delete-post-toxic-reviews-2000669452</link>
            <guid>1437502</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, recently laid off <em>Highguard</em> developer Josh Sobel opened up about what it felt like revealing the game <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">at the Game Awards 2025</a>&nbsp;and then watching some of the loudest parts of the internet dunk on the game up through its January launch. One of the things he called out was people <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-dev-who-just-lost-his-job-calls-out-toxic-online-reaction-2000668306">“gleefully” trying to manifest</a> the online hero shooter’s immediate downfall. The response to his earnest inside look at having worked on the game was immediately greeted by such a harsh and toxic backlash he’s now deleted the post as well as the rest of his account.</p> <p>“I’m not saying our failure is purely the fault of gamer culture and that the game would have thrived without the negative discourse, but it absolutely played a role. All products are at the whims of the consumers, and the consumers put absurd amounts of effort into slandering&nbsp;<em>Highguard</em>. And it worked,” Sobel wrote on X on February 12, just days after Wildlight Entertainment <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-studio-developer-layoffs-wildlight-entertainment-2000667841">announced sweeping staff cuts</a>.</p>

 <p>The post kicked off a fresh firestorm from a diffuse mob of angry online gamers and social media clout chasers who used the message to attack <em>Highguard</em>‘s developers as out of touch. They were accused of trying to deflect blame for making a game that just didn’t connect with many players. As happened with<em> Concord</em> before it, some people started looking for any post by anybody who worked on <em>Highguard</em> that they could find to start dunking on the person and the game.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update:</p> <p>Josh Sobel has now deleted his X account entirely, just days after publishing an article blaming gamers for Highguard’s failure.</p> <p>Looks like the deflection didn’t land the way he expected. <a href="https://t.co/IQCneqclUm">https://t.co/IQCneqclUm</a> <a href="https://t.co/faxHwewyK4">pic.twitter.com/faxHwewyK4</a></p> <p>— MasteroftheTDS (@MasteroftheTDS) <a href="https://twitter.com/MasteroftheTDS/status/2023075675348074690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Look, a few different things can be true here at same time. According to the <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/2022730613141442903">data firm Ampere Analysis</a>, an estimated 1.54 million people played <em>Highguard</em> last month. That’s around what Palworld hit when it launched. In other words, tons of people tried <em>Highguard</em> and then didn’t come back. That already makes it completely different from the apathy bomb Concord launched into. It also suggests that despite despite all the people trying to “manifest” failure on social media, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em> had its shot</a> to find a big audience and just couldn’t capitalize.</p>

 <p>But it’s also true that regardless of whether it had any impact on initial downloads and playtime, anyone who paid attention to <em>Highguard</em> at all during it’s launch would have though the developers had advertised the game by dropping kittens off rooftops. Thousands of negative reviews by people who barely played a single match did get posted to Steam and plenty of people online were jonesing for a “Concord 2.0” flameout.</p>

 <p>Even if you think Sobel’s argument that an artificial gravity well of bad-faith negativity hurt the game is wrong, it still sucks that it happened. It’s also, frankly, bizarre. Another overlooked point made by the developer who, remember, had just lost his job working on his dream game, was that Wildlight Entertainment was not some mega publisher chasing market fits on a spreadsheet. <em>Highguard</em> was not a live service game designed in a lab by Excel.</p> <p>Not every game can succeed. Even great ones fail. But you can’t <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">champion risk-taking in game development</a> while also engaging in witch hunts against people just for placing bets you don’t like.</p>

<p>The fifth chapter of Poppy Playtime is almost upon us, and console fans are bound to be wondering whether they can get in on the action. </p>







<p>It’s not one they’ll want to miss, either, as it’s rumoured to be the final part of the long-running saga. If you’re a PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch owner and a fan of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a>, here’s whether you can continue the journey or not.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-on-playstation-5">Can You Play Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 On PlayStation 5? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Watch your step. Image by Mob Entertainment.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Despite Chapters one through three being available on Sony’s latest console, Chapter 5 of Poppy Playtime will not be readily available on PlayStation 5 at launch. </strong></p>



<p>The franchise was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-release-times/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally released on PC</a> all those years ago, and ever since, the titles have first and foremost debuted there. Console ports were eventually developed for some older chapters, but it looks like PS5 fans will have to miss out—at least at launch.</p>



<p>It has been confirmed that a PS5 port will be developed in the future, but how far away it is remains to be seen. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 On Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s equally bad news for Xbox fans, as Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 won’t be available on either Xbox console alongside the PC launch. </strong></p>







<p>Xbox fans often get the short end of the stick, with numerous titles opting to miss their systems in recent years. However, Chapter 5 of Poppy Playtime should arrive on Xbox eventually; it’s just a matter of when. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 On Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>Nintendo fans don’t fare any better; Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 will not be on the Nintendo Switch 2 at launch.</strong></p>



<p>It might be majorly disappointing for Poppy Playtime fans, but there is a silver lining. As has been mentioned numerous times, console ports will arrive in the future, typically a few months after the PC release. It’s a shame, but console ports take time, especially for Indie devs like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mob-entertainment/" id="3160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mob Entertainment</a>. </p>

<p>Mob Entertainment has excelled at delivering grit-your-teeth, bite-your-nails action through the Poppy Playtime series. It’s always been a well-priced franchise for such replayable content, but questions are being asked about Poppy Playtime Chapter 5’s price.</p>



<p>Greater quality means more work, which unfortunately factors in increased cost. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a> has gotten bigger as the years have gone on, but so has its price tag. Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 could be the end for the franchise, and it could go out with an expensive bang.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5">How Much Is Poppy Playtime Chapter 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Needs more light. Credit to Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>While there is no official confirmation as yet, Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is expected to cost about $25, possibly going up to $30.</strong></p>



<p>Everything shown from the Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 gameplay trailer suggests this is the most complete game to date. Mob Entertainment’s indie project has gone from free-to-play to a fairly premium price tag.</p>

</ul>



<p>It’s unlikely Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is going to buck the trend, and it’s looking very likely that the price will go up again. In keeping with the previous chapter’s increase, Chapter 5 is probably going to cost in the region of $25-30 or £20-25. </p>



<p>Chapters 2 through 4 have seen a five-dollar increase each time. Still, this is mostly guesswork based on previous games and logic, so this is only a prediction for now.</p>



<p>This guide will be updated with the accurate price once the game is out and everyone knows for sure, so keep checking back!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-have-previous-poppy-playtime-chapters-cost">How Much Have Previous Poppy Playtime Chapters Cost?</h2>



<p><strong>Historical data shows that each new chapter has raised the price between $5-10, with the first game having started as a free-to-play download.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, the first game was (and still is) completely free to play. The journey had to start somewhere, and the price has only gone up as the years have gone by.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a> developer Fuse Games has said its racing adventure will feature a "good mix" of new faces and classic characters from a galaxy far, far away, following the reveal of Phantom Menace returnee Ben Quadinaros. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN as part of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-star-wars-galactic-racer-interview-why-its-not-open-world-how-its-story-mode-works-and-when-its-set">wide-ranging interview on Star Wars: Galactic Racer's track-based design, story mode and innovative boost gameplay</a>, creative director Kieran Crimmins teased that fans will be able to look forward to more characters from previous Star Wars movies and games joining the fray. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's going to be a good mix of familiar faces and new characters," Crimmins said. "Obviously we want to get that mix right, so no matter what kind of Star Wars media you've engaged with, whether it be a movie or game, there's a bunch of familiarity in there when it comes to the space. Otherwise it wouldn't feel like an authentic Star Wars experience. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"So there's both familiar faces and new characters," Crimmins continued, acknowledging Sebulba and Quadinaros. "We can't talk about who exactly they are just yet though, sorry."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who else might appear? While less well known, it's possible that other participants seen in Episode 1's podrace might appear, alongside Sebulba and Quadinaros. The Boonta Eve Classic had 18 participants, though poor Ratts Tyerell died during the race, while Anakin Skywalker... well, we all know what happened to him. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've seen racing as an activity and as a sport in Star Wars has been around in many forms, right?" Fuse Games founder and CEO Matt Webster said at another point, going on to potentially hint at racers from other parts of Star Wars being included. "Episode 1's podracing we all know and love, Bad Batch's riot racing in Season 2 was just awesome. Star Wars Resistance has got the Aces and low-altitude starfighter racing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Galactic Racer is set sometime after Return of the Jedi, so anyone could potentially put in an appearance. It seems unlikely we'll see Luke Skywalker, who was quite busy doing other things during this period, but who knows? He sure knows how to race a speeder bike across Endor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week brought our best look yet at Star Wars: Galactic Racer, though we delve much deeper into its clever two-tier boost system, environmental effects, and how the game will let you nuture rivalries and interact with characters on foot in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-star-wars-galactic-racer-interview-why-its-not-open-world-how-its-story-mode-works-and-when-its-set">big Star Wars: Galactic Racer interview that you can go read right now</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>The first thing I noticed about turn-based tactics game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dobbel-dungeon">Dobbel Dungeon</a> is that you can see fingerprints on the playdough character models. Even hard metallic objects such as swords are decked with faint, glimmering whorls. I’d have liked the game to let me leave my own prints on those playdough characters, care of the biometrics functionality I assume is secretly built into my work laptop. Perhaps they could have made this part of a proper degradation system, with high level characters looking all greasy and smooshed.</p>
<p>Alas, Dobbel Dungeon has no time for such <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crysis">Crysis</a>-grade simulation elements. Going by the demo, it is simply a cheerful and well-made, tabletop-style game of leisurely flanking and special ability usage with a gentle twist. The twist is that every time a character takes a turn, they fling a bunch of dice. These dice are then slotted into ability boxes to perform them. Some abilities deal effects proportionate to the dice score – stick a dice roll of 5 into a fireball and you’ll inflict 5 points of damage. The three starting characters also have the ability to reroll one die per turn. </p><!--more-->

<p>I’m not sure it’ll get too fiendish, going by the laidback presentation, but I can imagine scenarios where you’re umming and erring over whether to spend a 3 on a healing spell, or reroll in the hopes of that 6 you need to one-shot a boss boggo. </p><p>The Dobbel Dungeon feature rundown hints that “if you find yourself disagreeing with your dice, there are ways to ‘gently nudge’ them in the right direction via various manipulative actions gained through items and skills”. Hey, they’re trying to make us cheat! No <em>thank</em> you, Gamepie. You won’t find me trying to get one over Lady Luck. You won’t find me strolling down the Trickster's Highway. In the shorter term, the maps are pleasant to gaze down upon, the music is catchy in a Viva Pinata sort of way, and the controls and interface feel like second nature.</p>
<p>The story here is that a witch’s cottage has blown up and transformed local wildlife into slightly angrier, humanoid-looking wildlife. It's definitely not in the same bracket of atrocity as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mewgenics-review-a-roguelite-where-sacrificial-arse-maggots-and-frightful-defecation-are-the-keys-to-success">Mewgenics</a>.</p>
<p>You get a hub town with surrounding jetties that ship you out to islands full of individual mission-battles. You’ll also encounter merchants where you can buy gear for your clayfaced critter clubbers, and yes, there are the expected skill trees. All very genre-standard, but executed with enough bouyancy that I can see myself plugging on for another few hours.</p>
<p>Dobbel Dungeon is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622820/Dobbel_Dungeon/">out today on Steam</a>. There’s still a demo as of writing, but demos tend to vaporise fast, once the game is on sale. For a considerably less saccharine take on the ‘what if your characters were made of physical arts and crafts materials’ racket, try <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mashina-is-a-chill-stop-motion-adventure-with-friendly-robots-from-the-judero-team">Mashina</a>, which we really should have reviewed. Curse the limitations of my non-playdough body.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft has shared its Winter Roadmap for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<p>The roadmap includes a community parkour challenge, as well as full manual jump, a detailed stats page and critical hit visual improvements. These particular upcoming additions all arrive tomorrow, 17th February.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has said Shadows' upcoming detailed stats page will be ideal for "all the min-maxers out there". As for that manual jump being added to Parkour, players will need to enable Advanced Parkour Options in the gameplay settings to get this chap working.</p>
<p>If you are curious about that aforementioned community parkour challenge, here is what <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/535499747044098727">Ubisoft</a> has to say about it all:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>How to participate</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Create your perfect one-shot run</li>
<li>Think flow, style, momentum. Choose a unique location or craft the coolest combo you can imagine. Your clip must be: One unedited shot, 45 to 60 seconds long and set anywhere in the world of Assassin's Creed Shadows</li>
<li>Upload and share: Upload your run to YouTube before March 8th, then share it on X using #ACShadowsParkourChallenge.</li>
<li>Get noticed: You might become one of the lucky few that'll be showcased across Ubisoft social media or win cool prizes!</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Then looking ahead to next month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> players can expect the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-features-regular-new-story-missions-parkour-updates-new-game-plus">Assassin's Creed Shadows' Claws of Awaji expansion</a> on 10th March. This expansion introduces a new region, as well as a new weapon and abilities, new outfits and legendary gear, a new enemy faction and bosses, and a new chapter of Shadow's story. Ahead of its release elsewhere, Ubisoft said this expansion would add over 10 hours of content to the game.</p>
<p>Last up for this batch of winter events, all players can look forward to livestreams and giveaways to celebrate the game's first anniversary on 20th March.</p>

<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows had a strong debut on its release last year, and in July Ubisoft celebrated five million players (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">which also made up 2bn stealth kills and 38 million animals petted</a>). That number will of course be higher now, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-to-know-how-assassins-creed-shadows-works-on-switch-2-ubisoft-details-console-specific-features-and-more">Shadows' Switch 2 release in December</a>.</p><p>It hasn't all been good news for the Assassin's Creed franchise and Ubisoft, though. In October, then-Assassin's Creed leader Marc-Alexis Côté left the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-formation-of-tencent-subsidiary">following the formation of the new Tencent-backed subsidiary</a> Vantage Studios. It soon transpired that Côté "did not walk away" but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">asked to "step aside" by Ubisoft</a>. In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft">it was reported Côté was suing Ubisoft</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation is finally picking up some momentum, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">having been initially announced several years ago</a>. The show is set to star Toby Wallace, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-assassins-creed-adaptation-lands-first-lead-cast-member-in-euphoria-and-eden-actor">with the Eden actor said to play a co-lead in Netflix's Assassin's Creed series</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-is-considering-a-switch-2-price-hike-this-year-according-to-new-report</link>
            <guid>1437448</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="c2c025ed95807"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c2c025ed95807/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The rising demand for RAM for AI data centres and the associated rising costs are having a massive effect across the tech world, and with Sony reportedly pushing back the launch of its as-yet-unannounced PS5 successor, Nintendo is considering raising the price of Switch 2 in 2026, too, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis">a new Bloomberg report</a> (paywall).</p>
<p>Speaking to "people familiar with its plans", Bloomberg reports that Sony is now eyeing 2028/29 for its next console hardware, and that Nintendo is looking at how to approach what the article says is being coined "RAMmageddon":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Close rival Nintendo Co., which contributed to the surplus demand in 2025 after its new Switch 2 console drove storage card purchases, is also contemplating raising the price of that device in 2026, people familiar with its plans said. Sony and Nintendo representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/switch-2-predicted-to-follow-in-playstation-and-xboxs-footsteps-this-year-with-global-price-hike">Niko Partners predicted</a> that Nintendo would be forced to follow suit and raise hardware prices as its competitors have.</p>
<p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked about the possibility of a price increase in an interview with <a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendos-president-remains-coy-on-potential-price-increases">back in January</a>, but refused to be drawn on plans at the time, saying "I cannot comment on hypotheticals".</p>
<p>With most tech firms reliant on memory and microchips produced by other companies, this precarious situation around RAM manufacturing has been a concern for some time now, with the crisis growing as AI-invested firms such as Meta, Microsoft, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, purchase DRAM for data centres to drive chatbots and other AI-powered applications. Prices have been driven up at an alarming rate as demand outstrips component availability, with Bloomberg stating that the "cost of one type of DRAM soared 75% from December to January" alone.</p>
<p>Consequently, tech firms must choose between slimmer profit margins or raising prices in an already-fraught economic environment. The Switch 2's launch pricing and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s $80 price tag <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/drop-the-price-scream-nintendo-fans-during-nintendos-treehouse-live-broadcast">proved controversial</a> with gamers in June last year, and Nintendo raised the price of all its Switch 1 hardware in the US <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-switch-console-and-accessory-prices-are-going-up-in-the-us">last summer</a>. Sony and Microsoft both <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/features/xbox-series-xs-how-their-prices-have-changed-over-the-past-five-years">raised their hardware prices recently</a>, with PlayStation getting a $50 hike on all PS5 models in the US <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/08/ps5-price-increases-confirmed-for-usa-effective-21st-august">last August</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo may have gotten its latest console to market ahead of full-scale "RAMmageddon", but it still has to keep the ball rolling and keep up production numbers. With the tech sector's reliance on RAM for almost everything and the AI bubble yet to burst, one thing is for certain: Switch 2 certainly isn't getting <em>cheaper</em> anytime soon.</p>
<p><em>Are you tempted to push the boat out for a Switch 2 before it gets even more expensive? Happy you jumped in early? Let us know below.</em></p>

              <p>Roger Clark, who plays&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>‘s lead character Arthur Morgan, has a sideline in Cameo messages. The actor recently posted to his X account (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-us-all-send-this-poor-girl-positive-vibes-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-reveals-cameo-apology-request-from-man-who-deleted-fiances-red-dead-redemption-2-save-file">thanks&nbsp;<em>IGN</em></a>) to talk about an all-time favorite request he’d received, from a man who had just deleted his fiance’s&nbsp;<em>RDR2</em> save game and was looking for any hope of getting out of trouble.</p> <p>“I just deleted by fiance’s saved game in Red Dead Redemption II by accident,” began the anonymous buffoon’s message to Roger Clark. And as if that weren’t bad enough, he underlined the severity of the situation. “She was having so much fun and made every ethical decision, had about 2/3 completed.” Oh dude. There’s surely no coming back from this.</p>

 <p>Although reaching out to Arthur Morgan himself is likely an excellent first step. Posting <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/2022059161887137920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2022059161887137920%7Ctwgr%5E9637e6ec535fb2abda3e575092f1fa3e90fd65de%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Flet-us-all-send-this-poor-girl-positive-vibes-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-reveals-cameo-apology-request-from-man-who-deleted-fiances-red-dead-redemption-2-save-file">to his X account</a>, Clark told his followers how much he values their support on his Cameo, thanking them for “liking my shout outs.” He notes that he enjoys them all, but adds “it’s ones like these that I live for.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I really am blown away by the support you guys show me on cameo. Thank you for liking my shout outs. I enjoy them all but it’s ones like these below that I live for. Let us all send this poor girl positive vibes. At least her man knows what he did. <a href="https://twitter.com/cameo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cameo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cameo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cameo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rdr2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rdr2</a> <a href="https://t.co/U0nHM2pLVT">pic.twitter.com/U0nHM2pLVT</a></p> <p>— Roger Clark (@rclark98) <a href="https://twitter.com/rclark98/status/2022059161887137920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While we can’t see the Cameo itself, for obvious reasons, we do get to see the full text of the request. After explaining the situation, the requester added, “Can you say some words of support for this devastating loss and let her know I am sorry?”</p>

 <p>What a situation to be in. This is dozens of hours of impassioned playing, lost forever, somehow not stored in the cloud. And this is a fiance, remember—it’s not too late for her to walk away without any paperwork. Will a message from the game’s main character be enough, or will that just rub salt in the wound?</p>

 <p>The agonizing thing is, unless the perpetrator reveals himself, we’ll never know how this worked out! Did the message patch things up? Is she some sort of angel who can forgive an enormity of this scale? Please, anonymous person, find your way to Reddit.</p>

              <p>I hope Capcom doesn’t spoil<a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><em> Resident Evil Requiem</em></a>‘s momentum with an annualized release roadmap. Someone modded Goku into <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em></a>. And I bet you can’t guess how upset God of War’s creator is at the new 2D <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-war-sons-sparta-prequel-2d-retro-shadowdrop-2000668367"><i>God of War Sons of Sparta</i></a><em>&nbsp;</em>game. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. All the clipped drama that’s fit to print!</p> <p>Let’s remember some games. How about <a href="https://x.com/RagnarSan22/status/2022639748796588448"><em>Radiata Stories</em></a>? Now <em>that </em>was a great game. <a href="https://shmuplations.com/radiatastories/">Here’s an interview</a> with its development team, including its director, Naoki Akiyama, who, as far as I can tell, hasn’t worked on a new game since. It’s one of the only JRPGs that’s ever been brave enough to <a href="https://kotaku.com/revisiting-radiata-stories-my-favorite-video-game-as-a-1819006170">let you kick kids</a>. “Radiata Stories is supposed to feel like these characters are really living this world, and for that, kicking seemed like the perfect interaction,” he said.</p>

 <h2>A new <em>Resident Evil</em> game every year until 2030</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/2) RE"10" (though likely won't be called that) is a bit shorter than usual (presuming RE10 doesn't get delayed too, it's right now aiming for a 2029 release date, but could be delayed to 2030, 2031 at worst, up to the whims of game dev), &amp; DLC for RE9 has had time to cook.</p> <p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2022244942085832763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>That’s what a new leak from <em>RE</em> insider AestheticGamer, formerly known as Dusk Golem, <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2022244942085832763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2022244942085832763%7Ctwgr%5Ef221d152e261de65c9565b722ec4964e84884a3f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2000669435action%3Dedit">is claiming</a>. They suggest the horror franchise’s upcoming roadmap is as follows:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></strong> – February 27</li> <li><strong><em>Resident Evil Requiem DLC</em></strong> – TBA 2026</li> <li><strong><em>Resident Evil – Code: Veronica Remake</em></strong> – 2027</li> <li><em><strong>Resident Evil Zero Remake</strong></em> – 2028</li> <li><em><strong>Resident Evil 10</strong></em> – 2029</li> </ul> <p>That is a relentless amount of zombie knifing action. Some fans might think this unverified pipeline rumor sounds too good to be true. I think it sounds like way too much. Hype levels for Resident Evil Requiem are currently off the charts and it’s not just because Leon is back and the previews have all been very solid. It’s also because it’s been five years since the last mainline game, <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, and three years since the last remake, <em>Resident Evil 4</em>.</p>

 <p>In an era of way too many games, four remakes and sequels in four years might look great on an investor sheet but it feels like overkill for a franchise that’s currently at the top of its game. And we all know what happened the last time<em> Resident Evil</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-6-the-kotaku-review-5948171">got overexposed</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Apex Legends</em> has a new roadmap and it doesn’t include Cardi B skins</h2> <p>After a rough couple of years, Respawn Entertainment’s battle royale is <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/2026-roadmap">promising to double-down on rapid improvements</a> and new content, including two new characters joining in 2026. What this roadmap doesn’t include is a bunch of wild crossover skins.</p> <p>“When we’re designing skins, we try to keep in mind the personality of the Legend,” lead Legend designer Brett Marting <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/apex-legends/titanfall-legacy-change">told <em>PCGamesN</em></a>. “We haven’t always hit it perfectly, but most of the time we do try to keep that in mind when we’re picking a skin for a character, or a visual to match with them. We like to hit their personality, otherwise it’s going to feel off for the entire immersion of everybody playing the game.”</p>

 <h2>Who needs a <em>Dragon Ball</em> racing game when you’ve got Goku in <em>Sonic CrossWorlds</em>?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/0nFf5UKLJn">https://t.co/0nFf5UKLJn</a></p> <p>— Boost ☆ 🇵🇷🐵 (@Boos2fer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Boos2fer/status/2022173524384002530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The Sega go-kart game continues giving <em>Smash Bros.</em> a run for its money with all of the crossover characters getting added, but where licensing deals fail, modders will prevail. Someone recently replaced the Monkey Ball character in the game with Kid Goku riding on his Nimbus cloud and it looks really awesome (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-goku-fan-creation/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>). I hope Bandai Namco is paying attention.</p> <h2>No <em>Spider-Man</em> on Xbox, probably</h2> <p>Fans have been told over and over again that the game will never be ported to Xbox. Insomniac Games responded to the latest wave of speculation as more companies explore multiplatform releases to reiterate that its Spider-Man games coming to Xbox remains “<a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2022752405444505766">unlikely</a>.”</p> <h2><em>God of War</em>‘s creator loses his mind over the new pixel art prequel</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">David Jaffe absolutely  rips the new GoW game apart.

Jaffe, never one to flinch when it comes to exploring the full range of the King’s English, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liEszJCMW-k">unloaded on the game in a recent video</a>.</p>

 <p>“Every time you make a new game, you don’t have to go, ‘You know what? Let’s not go back to the great character that people love that built this franchise. Let’s see him as a little kid, some generic boring little fucking kid,'” he said. “It’s just insulting to the fans. It’s insulting to people who worked on the games that they would think this character right here is what people want. It’s crap. It’s dumb. It’s stupid. I would say avoid this fucking thing.”</p> <h2><em>Rayman 30th Anniversary</em> Edition bugs</h2> <p>In addition to being accused by some Steam reviewers of just being an overpriced collection of ROMs run in an emulator, players have also discovered that the Atari Jaguar and MS-DOS versions of the classic Ubisoft platformer <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2026/02/15/rayman-30th-anniversary-has-save-data-bug-and-ubisoft-support-says-post-launch-support-has-ended/">don’t save your progress</a>.

<p>It’s been a while since a new chapter brought the nightmare-inducing Huggy Wuggy to the fore, which is why you should check out Poppy Playtime Chapter 5’s release date and start times to let some new horrors fester.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime Chapter 5</a> is rumored to be the final part of the saga. Whether this ends up being the case remains to be seen, but one thing’s for sure: You shouldn’t miss out on Chapter 5. The Prototype is there to explore in its entirety, and it’s not long until you can do so.</p>

<p><strong>Mob Entertainment has issued a February 18 release date for Poppy Playtime Chapter 5.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been on this journey to this point, number one, you’re brave, and number two, this could be the culmination of a five-year journey that has seen hilariously evil-looking Poppy Playtime merch appear all over the world and capture the minds and haunt the dreams of everyone in that time.</p>

</ul>



<p>Huggy Wuggy has been anything but cute and adorable in that time (maybe the most misleading name in history), and it’s back to chase you around The Prototype.</p>



<p>The new chapter is scheduled for February 18, so prepare yourself.</p>

            <p>Some upcoming skins for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> which initially had edgy skull masks appear to have been drastically changed to look a bit more realistic, judging by community findings.</p>
<p>These skins, <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1x4zaBaEKK/?spm_id_from=333.1387.collection.video_card.click">which you can see in their original glory on Bilibili</a>, are a mix between standard military face paints donning stylised combat gear and straight up My Chemical Romance vibe skull masks over military headgear. Those latter skins drawing the ire of a portion of the Battlefield 6 playerbase, especially those who want the game to stay grounded.</p>
<p>"They're all garbage. I just want new playable content, new mechanics and equipment, more vehicle customization, and a customizable class ability system like in BF4," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r2slm0/comment/o4z2kj1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote user Kejdurapa on the Battlefield Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>However, luckily for those with a similar taste to the pro-realism Battlefield crowd, additional screenshots released in the following days <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/most_of_upcoming_skins_have_changed/">appear to show these same skins toned down in edginess drastically</a>. This either indicates an overhauled version of these same skins, or perhaps an alternative version for those same skins.</p><p>As you can imagine, those previously aggravated Battlefield enjoyers are now very pleased indeed. "That's more like it, not the clown show that was in season 1," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/comment/o5o0ewb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote Ali-S earlier today</a>. Their sentiment was shared by one eaeb4, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/comment/o5o1jg0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">who wrote</a>: "This is a big improvement across the board. Some people might like some of the skull mask designs but we don't need it on every other skin.</p>
<p>You may be thinking, who cares, right? A few skins look to have been changed in a live service shooter. Well, it's worth noting that Battlefield 6 was sold to players on the back of its realistic approach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">making direct comparisons to its major competitor Call of Duty and its wackier approach to modern military warfare</a>.</p>
<p>This was true even in pre-release interviews. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">Lead developers told Eurogamer the game would</a> "stray true to Battlefield" when asked about its approach to cosmetics, indicating a desire to keep things away from the wilder fantasies created elsewhere. These skull masks, as well as some prior DLC released in Battlefield 6, have strained such statements.</p>
<p>Whether things like these skull-faced cosmetics will be buried forever, or if a hint of the absurd will continue to creep into Battlefield 6, is a question for the future. What isn't a question is where the Eurogamer Battlefield 6 review is - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">it's right here</a>.</p>

			<p>Last month, developers <strong>RocketWerkz</strong> and <strong>GRIP Studios </strong>announced that the popular survival game, <strong>ICARUS</strong>, would be making its <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-console-edition-arrives-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-in-february-2026/">console debut on February 26, 2026</a><strong>.</strong> Now, less than three weeks after that announcement, the studio has confirmed that ICARUS: Console Edition has been delayed by <strong>one month</strong> and will now arrive on <strong>PS5</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series X/S</strong> consoles on <strong>March 26, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>In a statement sent to Wccftech, the studio says that while the game is "<em>in a strong and stable state</em>," the delay will add enough time for the team to add further polish, "<em>rather than launch with known issues</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>After careful consideration, we've decided to move the release date to Thursday, March 26,</em>" the studio begins in its statement. "<em>This additional month will allow us to polish the gameplay and ensure the best possible launch."</em></p>



<p>"<em>While the game is in a strong and stable state, we've identified a few areas that need further refinement. Rather than launch with known issues, we believe taking these extra weeks is the right decision for the game and players. Our team is fully focused on polishing the experience and game content to ensure it plays as intended across Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. Thank you for sticking with us, we're looking forward to welcoming you to Icarus soon</em>."</p>



<p>Alongside the announcement of the delay, RocketWerkz has also revealed that it will host an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivalGaming/">AMA session in the r/SurvivalGaming Reddit tomorrow</a>, Tuesday, February 17, beginning at <strong>2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BT</strong>, to give players a chance to ask any and all questions they have about the console edition, the delay, and anything else ICARUS-related.</p>



<p>The upcoming console edition will include the <strong>New Frontiers</strong> expansion, and if you pre-order the Console Edition, you'll also receive the <strong>Pet Companion Pack</strong>. On top of the base game, this gives those new to ICARUS plenty to dive into when it arrives on consoles next month. For more on ICARUS, <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-qa-dayz-creator-talks-console-edition-support-survival-genre-evolution/">check out our interview with <strong>Dean Hall</strong>, creator of <strong>DayZ</strong> and one of the leads behind ICARUS</a>, all about the survival genre and its evolution in recent years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> launched in October 2025, I couldn't help but be enamoured with it. I have years of memories in previous Battlefield games, and I was happy to see the series return with a very solid military shooter. It was, for the most part, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">exactly what I wanted</a> out of a modern Battlefield game.</p>



<p>I was one of the millions of players jumping into Battlefield 6 constantly during those opening weeks, especially with the arrival of <strong>Season 1</strong>, with three new maps, the new battle royale <strong>REDSEC</strong> mode, and new weapons, gadgets, and vehicles to earn. I was also one of the players who found the stretch between each phase, and the new content that came with it, to be coming at a slower pace than what I would've liked.</p>



<p>Which wouldn't have been too much of an issue if the progression system through the battle pass and unlocking new weapons and accessories wasn't also extremely slow. Thankfully, that's something EA has already been clear <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-looking-ahead-to-season-2">it'll look to address</a> in Season 2, but whether it'll actually be better tuned this time is something we won't know until we're into the full swing of Season 2 when it arrives on <strong>February 17, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>So while I can't talk about most of the retooling that EA and Battlefield Studios have done for Season 2, after spending two hours playing Conquest and Escalation on the new <strong>Contaminated</strong> map, I can talk a bit about what Season 2 has in store.</p>



<p><em><strong>For more on Battlefield 6 Season 2, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reveals-season-2-of-battlefield-6-packed-with-new-maps-weapons-vehicles-and-more/">check out my full breakdown</a> of everything coming from last week's full reveal.</strong></em></p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-2-hands-on-impressions">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Hands-On Impressions</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Impressions-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To reiterate, all I got to play from Season 2 was the new Contaminated map. We weren't given the chance to check out the new <strong>Hagental Base</strong> map, the new <strong>Nightfall</strong> mode, or <strong>Operation Augur</strong>, which are all set to arrive later in the season. So these impressions will just be focused on the Contaminated map and some of the weapons arriving in the Extreme Measures phase of Season 2. I specify just the weapons because I unfortunately didn't get a chance to check out Little Bird. Unlucky respawns meant I didn't get a chance to grab it before someone else, and with only a couple of rounds played across the two hours, I was grounded for the whole session. </p>



<p>For what I did get my hands on: starting with the Contaminated map, which honestly felt like a pretty bog-standard Battlefield map. It's got a couple of great interest points that make for good concentrated battles, but unlike my first impressions of Blackwell Fields and Eastwood, I didn't feel there was anything separating Contaminated from the rest of the pack of maps already available in Battlefield 6. It's a slightly different flavour of maps like Mirak Valley, which isn't the worst thing to be, but it also doesn't make for an exciting first new map since November 18, when Eastwood launched.</p>



<p>What's more exciting about the Contaminated map is something that doesn't directly relate to the map at all. The introduction of the <strong>VL-7 </strong>hallucinogenic smoke is probably my favourite new feature added with this new season. It's not a survival layer because the gas itself doesn't do damage to you if you're running in it without a gas mask, but it will make you see things that aren't there almost immediately if you don't have a gas mask on.</p>



<p>It makes for more interesting close-quarters combat and is another gameplay layer that I would welcome on every other map. It's a shame that, at least for now, it only features on Contaminated in multiplayer and on Fort Lyndon in Guantlet. I understand that it's only on those maps for narrative reasons at the moment, but I would love to see it used more liberally and add that layer to other game modes. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Impressions-2.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>I know some might find it annoying to deal with, but I think the VL-7 gas will make for more chaotic and engaging fights.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As for the new weapons arriving in Extreme Measures, the new DMR, the <strong>GRT-CPS</strong> is a solid addition and will probably be my new choice of DMR, but my appreciation for it was outweighed by my lack of appreciation for the new assault rifle, the <strong>VCR-2</strong>.</p>



<p>My hope would be that it gets tuned in an upcoming patch, because it felt absolutely useless in the few rounds I tried it. I should say again that I only had two hours to check everything out, which doesn't leave a lot of time to get stuck in menus trying out different attachments. I went with the default layout, swapping to a couple of its different pre-determined builds, but nothing seemed to help. I'll add one more caveat that, because I was playing a build that was flagged as a "<em>work-in-progress build</em>," there could be a bug causing the weapon to do less damage than it should. Again, I would hope that's the case, but as someone who enjoys playing as the Assault class and utilizing an array of assault rifles, it flat out sucks to see the newest one be as useless as this.</p>



<p>I did, however, quite enjoy using the new <strong>M121 A2</strong> belt-fed LMG for the reps I had with it. Again, you can only get so much experience with everything in just two hours. But as Meatloaf always reminds me, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5hWWe-ts2s">two out of three ain't bad</a>, so I'd still call the new weapons arriving in Extreme Measures to be an overall win.</p>



<h2 id="h-looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>Coming back to the question I asked in the title of this preview, could LTMs like the addition of VL-7 gas and the upcoming Nightfall mode and Operation Augur be enough to bring lapsed Battlefield 6 players like myself back to the game? It's possible, of course, but it'll depend on how quickly Battlefield Studios and EA are in responding to player feedback, especially if that feedback is similar to what I would offer, which is that the addition of features like the VL-7 gas should stick around and not be limited.</p>



<p>Regarding Nightfall, it'll also depend on whether the mode is executed in a similar fashion to the VL-7 gas, where it adds a fun layer of chaos or if it pushes further into the territory where it's frustrating to play through. And as for Operation Augur, frankly, that seems like it'll be the most fun by the time it comes around, which makes it even more disappointing for me that we didn't get a chance to try it out in this preview.</p>



<p>The reality is that Season 1 was always going to be a tough act to follow for Season 2. Besides the fact that it seems like we're getting one map fewer than we did before, it's not like Battlefield Studios was going to have something as big as REDSEC ready to try and hit the same highs as Season 1. And even if it did, that only passes the buck to Season 3 as the one that is set up to be more disappointing than the last.</p>



<p>When I look at the Season 2 roadmap, I can't help but feel it's counterproductive to have your biggest attractions also be LTMs, like you're trying to grab players' attention through FOMO. I can understand not wanting to commit to something that players might not love in the long run by automatically making them permanent, but it also doesn't present a strong pitch for why I should care about what's coming in Season 2 right now.</p>

Mark furtively donned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-hard-to-push-innovation-in-racing-games-compared-to-other-genres-reckons-star-wars-galactic-racer-creative-director">a pod-racing helmet</a>.

<p>“If you want something done, do it yourself, STAT,” I bellowed, swivelling on my heel while looking up the origins of the term “stat” on my phone. It turns out it’s something medical doctors say to convey urgency, and comes from the Latin “statim”, meaning “immediately”. “What a perfect way to introduce this video showing a hospital level from the aforesaid leaked Hardsuit Labs version of Bloodlines 2,” I roared to myself. “Why, I’ve accidentally written 177 words of the news post already.”</p><!--more-->

<p>The freshly disclosed Hardsuit Labs Bloodlines 2 footage comes care of Youtuber wesp5, author of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/vampirebloodlines/mods/80">this necessarily enormous unofficial patch</a> for the beloved first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a>, also known as Jank-pires: The Masqu-error-rade: Buglines. It’s the most we’ve seen of the Hardsuit Labs draft of the sequel since publishers Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">took Hardsuit off Bloodlines 2 in 2021</a>, kicking original Bloodlines head designer Brian Mitsoda to the curb, and transferring development to The Chinese Room.</p><p>Released last year, the Chinese Room’s take on Bloodlines 2 has its charms – RPS reviewer Dominic Tarason <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">called it</a> “an entertaining but flawed vampire brawler wrapped in a compelling mystery story” – but many World of Darkness enthusiasts pine nonetheless for what might have been. Now’s your chance to explore some direct comparisons, with the heavy caveat that this is footage of a work-in-progress game.</p>
<p>wesp5 has posted a few more videos of Hardsuit-era Bloodlines 2, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaQbUES1jnQ">this one of some locations</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He_xmY-uc0U">this one of some people</a>. Let me know what you think of them all. Belated disclosure that Cara Ellison, formerly of this parish, was Bloodlines 2’s senior writer before the change of development team.</p>
