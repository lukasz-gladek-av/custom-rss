<p>The store will appear on the ground floor of the Shepherd's Bush <a href="https://www.westfield.com/en/united-kingdom/london" rel="noopener">Westfield London Shopping Centre</a>, and will be sticking around from <strong>22nd October - 16th November</strong>.</p>
<p>Those hoping to attend between the 22nd and the 26th will need to register for a free ticket via the <a href="https://experience.nintendo.com/#/events/10540">Nintendo Events website</a> (all those going from 27th onwards will not need to book in advance). The site is now live, with hour-long time slots available on all five opening days.</p>
<p>You'll need to be signed into a Nintendo Account to register for a free ticket, and if previous Pokémon Center pop-ups are anything to go by, we'd recommend getting in there fast.</p>

<p>The London pop-up will stock an extensive range of merch, including some exclusive pieces that are only available in the permanent stores in Japan.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mina the Hollower, the next game from Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games is no longer launching on its <a href="https://wccftech.com/mina-the-hollower-release-date-announced-demo-now-available-on-steam/">previously announced Halloween 2025 release date</a>. Instead, we no longer know when it is coming out on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Yacht Club Games announced the delay with <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/">a blog post on its website</a>, where it held that this would not be "<em>a major delay</em>," and that the team just needs "<em>a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower. The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on Oct 31st, but we’re just not quite there yet.</p><p>Read the full announcement here➡️<a href="https://t.co/FsbHqoMlfs">https://t.co/FsbHqoMlfs</a> <a href="https://t.co/WXFqcbUl3x">pic.twitter.com/WXFqcbUl3x</a></p></div>— Yacht Club Games (@YachtClubGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/YachtClubGames/status/1975293906251296964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>We don't want to announce another release date until it's submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line</em>," Yacht Club continued. "<em>The game is so close to being done - we're playing it from start to finish every day.</em>"</p>



<p>Steam Next Fest for October 2025 is only days away from kicking off at the time of this writing, but in the most recent Steam Next Fest for the year this past June, Mina the Hollower was <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">one of Wccftech's call-outs for what people should spend their time playing while the festival is on</a>.</p>



<p>When we checked out the demo, we wrote, "<em>The burrowing is satisfying to execute, the layout of something more akin to old Zelda games is something I can easily get behind, and I love the pixel art on display here.</em>"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Game Pass Price Increase Reportedly Won’t Affect Every Existing Subscriber]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-won-t-affect-every-existing-user/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-reportedly-won%E2%80%99t-affect-every-existing-subscriber.1318786/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox Game Pass price hike announced on October 1, 2025, reportedly will not affect every existing subscriber when it goes into effect next month.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/">official Xbox Game Pass subreddit</a> earlier today, users shared recent emails informing them of the price increase, noting that some subscriptions will not be affected. Most exempt subscriptions exempt from the automatic increase are for users in European countries like Poland, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni7d85l/">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni7gokr/">Austria</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni83ymw/">Italy</a>, and Asian countries like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1o04yjs/comment/ni8url6/">Indonesia</a>. This is likely due to local laws preventing an automatic price increase without the user's consent, although Microsoft has yet to provide confirmation.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Xbox Game Pass subscription service has seen significant changes besides a price increase this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">rearranging subscription tiers into Essential, Premium, and Ultimate</a>. <span>While the Ultimate tier will offer considerable value with the addition of the Ubisoft + Classics library, the Fortnite Crew subscription, and day-one access to Xbox-published games, its steep price increase to $29.99/month wasn't well-received, so much so that the page to&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-business-good-creators/" target="_blank">cancel the subscription was briefly overwhelmed.</a></span></p>



<p>Although the Xbox Game Pass service has seen multiple price increases, it will remain a central pillar of Xbox's market strategy. According to Xbox president Sarah Bond, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-business-good-creators/">the service is a profitable business</a> that has reached a record high of $5 billion and is becoming more valuable for both users and creators.</p>

            <p>All is not well in the Warhammer world. All is seldom well in the Warhammer world, of course - get off my lawn, Chaos! - but in this case, all is specifically not well with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>'s non-player campaign factions. Creative Assembly are postponing more details of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-gets-the-best-bad-news-yet-about-future-updates">the delayed Tides of Torment pack</a> while they fix what the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>'s lead technical designer modestly calls "a catastrophic failure in many of our AI systems". 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These issues have apparently dogged Twarhammer 3 for weeks - they've been "highly visible" since <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/78-total-war-warhammer-iii-patch-notes-6-3">update 6.3 in late August</a>, though the underlying problems pre-date that patch. Creative Assembly have yet to release a hotfix, however. "The issues with Campaign AI are unfortunately complex to resolve," the developer's head of community Adam Freeman <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1142710/view/519725729918748466?l=english">wrote on Steam yesterday</a>. "We haven't been able to deliver an immediate fix as we needed to conduct some very thorough investigations into the root causes, but we are working as quickly as the complexity allows."
</p>
<p>So what's the big deal with the busted campaign AI, then? Briefly, non-player factions aren't recruiting units properly due to mistaken "assumptions" about resources, which is causing rival empires to seize up like my knees on chilly October mornings. "We have found that the AI was building lists of units to recruit without taking caps into consideration, resulting in recruitment failing to occur and stalling the AI decision making process," Freeman writes. The issue has apparently been "compounded" by changes to the specialised resources Lizardmen and Tomb Kings need to recruit units.
</p>
<p>The post includes a deeper dive from lead technical designer Radoslav Borisov, explaining the effects of the AI failing to keep track of unit caps, while fleshing out some wider problems with the game's handling of "pooled resources".</p>
<p>"Should the AI decide that its next task should be to attack a settlement, it's generating a recruitment action and then expecting an increase in force strength to a level where it feels the settlement garrison that it's targeted for attack can be defeated," Borisov writes. 
</p>
<p>"Without the unit recruitment task's successful resolution, it holds up the subsequent task and leaves the AI in a paralyzed state. It's a cascade of failures that result in certain factions failing to complete any aggressive actions whatsoever."
</p>
<p>Borisov goes on to detail a few of the "assumptions" or "beliefs around the current state of the game world" that AI players rely upon to make decisions when recruiting units. "Any mistakes when constructing these assumptions has been found to lead to a catastrophic failure in many of our AI systems," he notes. 
</p><p>Right now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 3's AI is having particular difficulty with the aforesaid <a href="https://tw-modding.com/wiki/Tutorial:Pooled_Resources_Updated">"pooled resources"</a> - broadly, a flexible type of in-game strategic resource that can be tethered to a "location" such as a region, faction or army. As Borisov goes on, "the AI's ability to understand, plan and budget pooled resources is not ideal. Lately, AI has not been factoring in pooled resource to its costs properly, leading to incorrect beliefs about what it can and cannot afford, resulting in action failure."
</p>
<p>According to Borisov, the past few weeks of investigation have shown Creative Assembly "that the majority of our internal systems were unprepared for actions that ostensibly could not fail, to fail." Difficulties with pooled resources have triggered an avalanche of other problems - "the AI couldn't change stances properly, attacking on the campaign failed, recruitment failed, laying siege failed, and so on".
</p>
<p>Creative Assembly have identified the "leading causes" of these issues, but Borislov says that "it's very likely there are other cases we are not yet aware of just yet". There are, he notes, "around 200 different pooled resources in the game and they are used in a large variety of ways". I have to confess, I'm not 100% clear on the link here between the pooled resource stuff and the unit cap issue, but the overall takeaway appears to be that now is a really great time to invade the Warhammer world, providing you're a human general capable of counting up spearmen without falling into a trance.
</p>
<p>Creative Assembly plan to begin addressing the problem with a hotfix next week. "It entered the first phases of our testing earlier today and is showing positive signs of providing an improved experience to the game," Freeman comments. The developers had originally planned to make fixes as part of the bulkier update 7.0, but they've decided that the issue needs to be addressed now. A glance at that canary in every Steam developer's coalmine, the user review box, reveals a Mostly Negative consensus over the past 30 days.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-wildest-49-inch-odyssey-oled-curved-gaming-monitor-is-going-for-45-less-with-this-deal-2000631874</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/whether-samsung-likes-it-or-not-amazon-just-slashed-the-49%E2%80%B3-odyssey-oled-gaming-monitor-by-almost-50-for-prime-day.1318777/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there anything better than getting fully immersed in your favorite titles, feeling like you’re part of the game? A standard 16:9 screen is sadly not made for that, and if you don’t want to get pulled out right when things get good, going ultrawide is the solution.</p>
<p>We know upgrades like this can feel overwhelming, since a good-sized ultrawide screen from a known brand can easily run you over $1,600, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4584/">but that changes today. Thanks to Prime Day, the Samsung 49-inch Odyssey OLED G93SC curved gaming monitor is 44% off on Amazon, dropping the price to $900.</a> That’s one of the lowest prices we’ve ever seen on this wild screen, and with a $700 discount, it’s not a deal that’s likely to last long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4584/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Screen With Lifelike Visuals</h2>
<p>It’s a beast at 49 inches, offering brilliant colors, deeper contrast, and richer tones for lifelike visuals. More pixels per inch give you better detail, so you’re not sacrificing sharpness for size. The screen is as wide as two QHD monitors side by side, minus the dual setup fuss, with the 1800R curve wrapping around your field of vision for a distraction-free gaming or streaming experience. Dark colors come through clearly as well, thanks to QD-OLED technology and DisplayHDR True Black 400 support. Translation: better visibility even in low-light scenes; perfect for spotting the bad guys hiding in the dark and keeping an eye on shadows.</p>
<p>You’re also getting a 240Hz refresh rate and a 0.03ms response time to keep things smooth. Plus, with both NVIDIA G-Sync compatibility and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, screen tearing and input lag won’t be an issue either. Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, and a built-in USB hub. There’s also an Auto Source Switch+ that can detect when the connected devices are turned on and switch over automatically.</p>



<p>For when you’re in the mood for some multitasking, the Picture-by-Picture mode splits the screen in half. Maybe use one for video calls, while having work documents and the browser open on the second. Or maybe stream your favorite content on one side while editing on the other? The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Even with all this, the overall design stays minimal. It’s just 4.5mm thick at its thinnest point, which makes it one of the slimmest OLED panels in this range.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4584/"> It’s still a bit of an investment at $900, but this deal brings it into a much more approachable range than we usually see.</a></p>

              <p>Losing your keys, wallet or luggage ranks among the most frustrating daily experiences. Apple’s AirTag solves this problem in a way no competitor can match, thanks to the <em>Find My</em> network powered by hundreds of millions of Apple devices worldwide. This massive network means your lost item can be located almost anywhere, even if it’s miles away from your own iPhone.</p>
<p>For Prime Big Deal Day, Amazon has dropped AirTag prices to record lows. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">4-pack now costs just $64, down from $99</a>: Since a single AirTag normally sells for $29, <strong>this deal essentially gives you almost two free AirTags</strong>. If you only need one, the single AirTag is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/">also at an all-time low of $19, down from $29</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Single AirTag at Amazon</a></p>

<p>AirTags function by using Apple’s Find My network, <strong>a group of all iPhones, iPads, and Macs with their location services running</strong>. When you flag an AirTag lost, other <strong>Apple devices running Bluetooth proximity</strong> to it can pick up its Bluetooth signal and report its location anonymously back to yours. It all occurs entirely behind the scenes without notification of the other device’s owner, and all of your location information stays encrypted and private. By virtue of its massive scale, your AirTag becomes locatable even in isolated regions, if someone running an Apple device wanders by.</p>
<h2>Precision Location Detection and Privacy-Aware Design</h2>
<p>Installing an AirTag is a matter of seconds. You just point it near your iPhone or iPad, tap to pair and tag it to an item like your keys or backpack. The U1 chip in newer iPhones powers Precision Finding employs ultra-wideband technology and walks you straight to your AirTag with onscreen arrows and haptic indicators. As you approach, your iPhone displays the exact distance and direction and turns a potentially frantic search into a mere follow-the-arrows endeavor.</p>



<p>Each AirTag uses a <strong>typical CR2032 replaceable battery</strong>, which runs for approximately a year with average use. You’ll receive a notification when it’s running low, and it’s a breeze to replace it by pressing down and twisting off the stainless steel back case. The <strong>AirTag is water- and dust-resistant IP67</strong> so it’s fine being submerged for 30 minutes for a distance of a meter of water.</p>
<p>Privacy features are built into the core design: If an unknown AirTag is traveling with you, your iPhone alerts you automatically. Android users can also detect nearby AirTags using Apple’s Tracker Detect app. The AirTag will also play a sound if it’s been separated from its owner for an extended period, preventing unwanted tracking. These safeguards address privacy concerns while maintaining the device’s usefulness for legitimate tracking.</p>



<p>The thin, lightweight design is just 1.26 inches across and 0.31 inches deep, tiny enough to slip into a wallet’s card slot or affix to a keychain. The shiny stainless steel face is customizable with free engraving if you order directly from Apple, but Amazon’s sale does not include it.</p>
<p>The 4-pack is nicely priced for families, couples, or individuals having several things they’d like to monitor. Put one on your keys, a second on your wallet, a third on your backpack, and maintain a fourth as a spare for your suitcase when traveling. For $64 for four during your Prime Big Deal Day sale, you’re really spending less money per AirTag than ever before.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has just released a mysterious animated short film with no explanation — leaving fans wondering whether it's a tease for the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, or a hint at a new Pikmin game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At just under four minutes in length, the dialogue-free animation titled "Close to You" sees a blonde toddler taking their first steps, as their pacifier is mysteriously picked up by an invisible force.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo fans will note several musical cues from the Pikmin series as the pacifier is picked up and seemingly carried away (though no Pikmin can actually be seen). At the same time, some Nintendo fans have said the child could be space princess Rosalina — who is surely set to debut in next year's Super Mario Galaxy Movie. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Without any explanation at all from Nintendo itself, this is clearly something fans are being left to ponder about by themselves — though IGN has contacted Nintendo for more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Certainly, the pacifier's movements really do look like they could be made by a band of Pikmin carrying the item aloft, and several Pikmin games have indeed tasked players with squirreling away household items. And indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pikmin-4">Pikmin 4</a> even tasked players with venturing inside a human house for the first time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pikmin series has always been set on Earth, with Pikmin themselves suggested as always just being out of sight. Is this Nintendo making it clear that, to human eyes, Pikmin are indeed invisible?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaving aside the Pikmin music and other clues, other fans have suggested the child here could be Rosalina, whose parentage — alongside that of Princess Peach's own — looks set to finally be explained in next year's big-screen Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Is this a scene from that film? We're not sure — the animation style doesn't look quite the same as Illumination's own — but it's also odd to see Nintendo launching its own, unconnected animated short just six months out from its next big animated movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever this is, we'll update with more when we have it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>While Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is adding wall-jumping to players' repertoire of advanced movement options, developer Treyarch isn't taking a page from its 2015 futuristic title Black Ops 3 by incorporating wall-running or Thrust Jumps for one simple reason: It's too early for that.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-say-that-you-can-blame-the-black-ops-timeline-for-the-wall-jump-not-being-a-wall-run-black-ops-2-really-gave-us-a-foundation-for-the-technology-available/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Treyarch associate creative director Miles Leslie reiterated that Black Ops 7, which takes place in the year 2035, is more of a direct follow-up to 2012's Black Ops 2, which took place in the then-far-fetched future of 2025.</p>

<p>"Since we knew we were going back into that timeline, Black Ops 2 really gave us a foundation for the technology available," Leslie said. Meanwhile, Black Ops 3 takes place further into the future in the year 2065, giving Treyarch some canonical limitations on where to take its Omnimovement systems. In other words, wall-running just isn't possible in the time Black Ops 7 takes place in.</p><p>"We are really precious to our own canon; we have to respect that. So that meant we couldn't have Thrust Jump, because the tech didn't exist in 2035," Leslie said. "Wall-running made sense when we were further in the future but, with our return to the Black Ops 2 era, that world just didn't have that sort of technology so it made sense not to do it."</p><p>You can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-wall-jumping-works-in-black-ops-7/1100-6534910/" data-ref-id="1100-6534910">wall-jump in Black Ops 7</a> on certain surfaces to get some additional vertical height. Each subsequent wall jump will reduce momentum, but you can chain three wall jumps together before hitting the ground.</p><p>The ability to wall-run first appeared in the Call of Duty franchise in Black Ops 3 and returned in Infinity Ward's space-faring 2016 game Infinite Warfare. Famously, removing wall-running and Thrust Jumps was one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-4-revamps-multiplayer-for-a/1100-6459058/" data-ref-id="1100-6459058">Treyarch's selling points for Black Ops 4</a>, which released in 2018 and was set in the year 2045, before Black Ops 3. Though, that implies that soldiers forgot how to wall-jump by the time Black Ops 4 happens.</p><p>To try the wall-jump yourself, you can jump into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-extended-now-wraps-up-right-before-battlefield-6-launch/1100-6535266/" data-ref-id="1100-6535266">Black Ops 6 open beta, which has just been extended</a> to end on Thursday, October 9, at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET.

		<p>FuturLab has announced that it will be releasing PowerWash Simulator 2 on October 23rd, making the announcement with a new trailer. The follow up to PowerWash Simulator is going to be available on &nbsp;Steam, Epic Games, Windows Store, Xbox Series X|S, PS5 &amp; Nintendo Switch 2 with a price of $24.99 / €24.99 / £19.99 / JP¥2970.</p>
<p><iframe title="PowerWash Simulator 2 | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RrFexXPbVuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 expands massively on the original game, with powerwashing just being one of the activities in the game. The town of Muckingham &nbsp;will have multi-stage jobs, home case customisation, and even some mysteries to uncover around Muckingham. There will be additional locations to explore too including &nbsp;Sponge Valley, Power Falls and Lubri City. You will have access to new tools including an abseiling rig and cherry picker to reach those hard to reach spots.</p>

<p>In our PowerWash Simulator 2 preview, Stefan said, <em>“There’s plenty more to PowerWash Simulator 2 that we didn’t really get to toy with, from the customisable home base, to designing van liveries, to playing co-op online or in split-screen, and the career story, though we did at least get to give Ulysses the cat and some random kittens a little tickle every now and then. What’s most important, though, is that this retains that soothing essence of the reverse colouring book gameplay, with a few new options and tools just adding a smidgeon more variety.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>developer FuturLab has revealed the upcoming cleaning sim's release date, and it's much closer than you might think, so it won't be long before you can load up your power washer once again.</p>

<p>As announced via a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will be launching on October 23rd. As far as we know, the game is due to launch on day one for Game Pass as well, although given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">recent developments</a>, that might not be quite such an enticing prospect anymore.</p>

<p>Announced back in March this year,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>is, as the name suggests, the sequel to 2022's relaxing cleaning sim&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>. Like its predecessor, this followup will let you loose on a variety of filthy environments, and it's up to you to make them clean once more.</p>

<p>Those locations will be part of a brand new campaign that will take you to such aptly-named locations as Sponge Valley, Power Falls, and Lubri City. I wouldn't think too hard about that last one if I were you.</p>

<p>New multi-stage jobs will test your cleaning prowess over several different stages, and naturally, you can expect a range of new tools to help you tackle those jobs, including a new abseiling rig, a cherry picker, and a surface cleaner for bigger areas.</p>

<p>You can check out the new&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>release date trailer, which shows off some of the game's satisfying-looking cleaning action (as well as its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-powerwash-simulator-2-gameplay-trailer" rel="nofollow">frankly criminally adorable cat</a>), right here.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-25-000mah-100w-laptop-power-bank-is-selling-for-peanuts-amazon-is-rushing-to-clear-its-inventory.1318726/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Small power banks that charge your phone are handy, but did you know power banks exist for laptops too? They’re less common but incredibly practical, especially since they can charge your phone and other devices at the same time. Running out of battery during a flight or during a long day away from outlets becomes a non-issue when you have serious charging capacity in your bag. For Prime Big Deal Day, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/">has dropped the price on the most popular Anker (25,000mAh, 100W) laptop power bank to $89, down from $134</a>. That’s a $45 discount and an all-time low for this Anker model, <strong>available exclusively to Prime members</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Anker power bank <strong>boasts an enormous capacity of 25,000mAh</strong> which equates to usable real-world powering of your devices. For context, it’s enough to give a full charge to a MacBook Air, enough to supply your iPhone several full charges or keep your tablet going for hours of continuous use. With a 90Wh rating, it also falls within airline requirements for personal protective devices for your carry-ons, so it’s permissible to bring it onboard your flights.</p>
<h2>Triple 100W USB-C Ports Upgrade Your Charging Experience</h2>
<p>The <strong>crown jewel here is the three USB-C ports</strong>, each of which is capable of dispensing a <strong>whopping 100W of power</strong>. That’s important because newer laptops require serious power to charge at a full speed. A MacBook Pro 16-inch, say, requires about 96W for best-in-class charging. With 100W per port, you’ll be able to charge your laptop at full speed, <strong>all while powering other devices simultaneously.</strong></p>



<p>The built-in cables rectify one of the greatest nuisances of power banks: forgetting or misplacing charging cables. <strong>Anker ships two USB-C cables embedded on the power bank itself</strong>. One of them reaches a distance of up to 2.3 feet and gives you a degree of mobility when outlets are centralized or when you want to access your device as it charges. This retractable cable is rated for more than 20,000 times of retraction so it should not readily fail due to wear and tear. The other cable is 0.98 feet long and also serves as a strap for carrying, designed to withstand over 20,000 bends. Such a dual purpose creates durability and portability.</p>
<p>Along with the built-in cabling, there are also other sources of charging <strong>available in the form of a USB-A port and a second USB-C port</strong>, for a<strong> total of four devices being charged simultaneously</strong>. This setup is best for traveling families or professionals who carry multiple devices along. You may charge your laptop off one built-in cabling, your cell phone off the other, your wireless headsets off the USB-A port and a smartwatch off the additional USB-C port.</p>



<p>Recharging of the power bank itself is incredibly quick due to a 100W ultra-fast recharging feature. It achieves a capacity of being at a 30% state by being plugged into a charger of 100W within a total of 22 minutes. <strong>Recharging takes a total of about 90 minutes</strong>&nbsp;so keep it topped off during your morning getting-ready process or lunchtime.</p>
<p>As a Prime member for $89 during this Prime Big Deal Day sale, you’re getting laptop-level powering capability at a budget-friendly cost.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will the jump button come back in the next <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>? Will<em> Battlefield 6</em> really work right out of the box? Can <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> prevent the further atomization of modern society? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I am still thinking about Xbox and how much Microsoft keeps fumbling the bag. And I’m <a href="https://x.com/JamiesAct/status/1975227593763999973">apparently not</a> <a href="https://x.com/JamiesAct/status/1975244040896716915">the only</a> <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1975556977536475617">one</a>. But for real: what’s going on <a href="https://x.com/Omnipotentgam0r/status/1974904157829321171">with those Walmart displays</a>?</p> <h2>The Saudi Arabia <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> DLC will let you manually jump</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia">Reportedly funded by</a> Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, the <em>Valley of Memory</em> DLC is a free major update for the 2023 game that takes Basim to the AlUla region in search of his long-lost father. It includes a new skill, tool customization, difficulty levels, and replaybale missions and challenges. The most important change to me, however, is the addition of a manual jump to add more depth to the parkour. The stealth action series hasn’t had a dedicated jump button since <em>Unity</em> as movement became more streamlined and automated. Hopefully, the experiment pays dividends in <em>Valley of Memory</em> and paves the way for more complex parkour in the next big <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> sequel.</p>

 <h2><em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is reportedly coming to PS Plus this month</h2> <p>That’s according <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ce-remake-sorti-en-excluvisite-console-sur-ps5-va-debarquer-sur-le-ps-plus-extra-60622">to billbil-kun at Dealabs</a>, who says last year’s PS5 exclusive will be arriving as part of the Extra and Premium tiers later this month. It arrives alongside <em>Alan Wake 2</em> on PS Plus Essential and <em>The </em><em>Last of Us Part 2</em> on Extra and Premium. Not a bad haul for this year’s Halloween.</p>

 <h2>Physical copies of <em>Battlefield 6</em> are out early and include at least part of the game on the actual disc</h2>   <p>Bucking recent trends, <em>Battlefield 6</em> apparently comes with the actual game on the disc, at least on PS5. A fan on Reddit claims the servers are live and the campaign and multiplayer both work. You can preview the game’s full day-one update and all of the over 200 changes it makes <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1975214752314937744">here</a>.</p>

 <h2>Funcom layoffs hit <em>Metal Hellsinger</em> studio</h2> <p>The Outsiders, a Funcom studio based in Stockholm, Sweden, is shutting down, founder and creative director David Goldfarb <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/locust9.bsky.social/post/3m2jumlqlmc2m">announced yesterday</a>. The team had previously produced the rhythm-based demonic FPS <em>Hellsinger</em> which sold one million copies. ” It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen,” he wrote. The veteran developer said the plan is to “continue on in some new form.”</p> <h2><em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> is out October 23</h2>  <p>The sequel to the hit <a href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-sim-2-trailer-release-campaign-splitscreen-1851769691">OCD management game</a> arrives with some upgraded visuals, split-screen co-op, and an increased focus on story beats which the original game kept mostly in the background.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Marathon</i>, Bungie’s upcoming hero extraction shooter, is getting another invite-only test soon. The test will run from October 22 to 27, and <a href="http://www.bungie.net/7/cen/News/Article/techtestapply">folks can sign up right here</a>. Things haven’t gone great for <i>Marathon</i> thus far, but following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775">disappointing reception</a> of the first alpha test, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">embarrassing accusations of plagiarism</a>, it’ll be interesting to see what tweaks Bungie has made and just what the game is shaping up to be.</p> <p>Revealed back in 2023 with a very impressive cinematic trailer, <i>Marathon</i> is a reboot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-marathon-halo-destiny-extraction-shooter-1850480259">Bungie’s classic <i>Doom</i>-like shooter</a> from the ‘90s. It’s also Bungie’s first new shooter since it made the pivot to <i>Destiny</i> in the early 2010s, following its departure from Microsoft and the <i>Halo</i> series.</p>

 <h2>There’s still no release date for <i>Marathon</i>, and the game has a lot to prove to fans</h2> <p><i>Marathon</i> was originally slated to release for current-gen consoles and PC on September 23, 2025. That date has come and gone. Unfortunately for Bungie, folks didn’t find the game terribly fun during the alpha earlier this year, and so the studio made the decision to indefinitely delay its release. The drab environments didn’t really speak to Bungie’s artistic strengths, and the hero shooter element (which I, a huge extraction shooter fan, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-runner-extraction-hardcore-1851775956">tried to be open-minded</a> about) still seems like an odd fit.</p>

Matches mostly consisted of fights with the same repetitive robots instead of incorporating the more alluring palette of creature designs the <i>Marathon</i> franchise has.</p>

 <p>We do know that the upcoming closed test will let players try out a new feature: Proximity chat, which allows you to hear other players’ voice chatter only when you’re near them. Bungie initially wanted to avoid using this, as the studio felt it was ripe for toxicity and abuse. While proximity chat can result in, well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/warzone-2-features-proximity-chat-gulag-contracts-mw2-1849793098">rather silly situations in a shooter</a>, it’s a pretty important feature in a PvPvE game; overhearing nearby players not only adds a bit of voyeuristic drama, but it can also help you avoid getting jumped sometimes.</p>

 <p>The closed test will also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-marathon-details-leak-from-latest-closed-test/">feature some tweaks to TTK (time-to-kill) as well</a>. We’ll see if this is enough to start rehabilitating <i>Marathon</i>’s image for folks.</p> <h2>It’s been a real cluster-f over at Bungie from the sounds of things</h2> <p>Conversations about the nuances of what does and doesn’t work in <i>Marathon</i> were all pushed to the side when it was revealed that Bungie had lifted designs from artist antire.al without permission or acknowledgement.</p>

 <p>Bungie had its explanations for how the artist’s work made it into its game, essentially saying that it was material used for inspiration and research that found its way into production pipelines, and thus made it into the game. The studio blamed this oversight on a former employee and promised a full review of all its assets to be sure this wouldn’t happen again.</p>

Here’s hoping the test later this month shows that it’s moving in the right direction.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Players have reported that Battlefield 6 physical copies include the entire game and do not require any additional downloads to play. </p>



<p>It’s less than 3 days until the highly anticipated Battlefield 6 releases on October 10, 2025. Interestingly, some players who had pre-ordered the physical copy of BF6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-physical-copies-reportedly-received-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received the game early</a> and have started providing reports on what is available on the disc, and it seems you can have the whole experience right off the bat. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-servers-seem-like-they-are-already-online">Battlefield 6 Servers Seem Like They Are Already Online</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-physical-copies-are-content-complete-and-require-no-initial-install-according-to-early-copy-holders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the original poster, who had received Battlefield 6’s physical copy early, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nzhg5l/comment/ni2p42z/?share_id=gftOQn-SiPIYz2EDMKSD6&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> some other details as well. A player asked the OP whether the game was playable without an internet connection and required no additional downloads, and the answer was “yes”. The OP also confirmed other points, such as being able to play the campaign through the Battlefield 6 disc, and the multiplayer servers seem to be online as well. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 developers have also contributed to the hype ahead of the game’s release recently. During a recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-teases-naval-warfare-is-coming-to-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a>, the developers stated that “requests for naval warfare have not gone unnoticed, nor have the calls for a certain fan-favorite little helicopter, platoons, and more.” These points are likely to make fans happy, as even more exciting content appears to be on the way. </p>



<p>In other news, early patch notes for Battlefield 6’s day one update have been shared by EA ahead of release, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-day-one-early-patch-notes-shared-by-ea-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 200 changes coming.</a> Additionally, here are the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exact release times</a> for BF6.

                <p>If you're looking for an epic adventure to get you through the cold months ahead, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WWFWRY6?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD</a> on Switch fits the bill. While it's not as sweeping in scale as Tears of the Kingdom or Breath of the Wild, it'll still take a solid 40 hours to complete (and much longer if you want to unlock all its secrets). Best of all, the hit game is <strong>down to just $40 (was $60)</strong> for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Big Deal Days</a>. This is by far the lowest price of the year, and it's close to its lowest price ever (the game hit $38.50 way back in 2023). Quantities are limited--at the time of writing, 24% had already been claimed.</p><div title="6535278 - Zelda: Skyward Sword HD Prime Big Deal Days" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4630" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535278 - Zelda: Skyward Sword HD Prime Big Deal Days" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WWFWRY6?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B08WWFWRY6?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WWFWRY6?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD (Nintendo Switch)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WWFWRY6?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B08WWFWRY6?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WWFWRY6?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$40 (was $60)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><span>Skyward Sword was originally released for the Nintendo Wii in 2011. A decade later, it would be re-released on Nintendo Switch as Skyward Sword HD. Benefiting from updated graphics, simplified controls, an autosave feature, and a streamlined introduction sequence, it's arguably the best way to experience the iconic adventure. This deal is for a physical copy of the Switch game, but the offer won't stick around forever. We're expecting it to disappear at the end of Big Deal Days, though quantities are limited, and it very well looks like it'll sell out sooner. Note that Skyward Sword HD will run on both Switch and Switch 2.</span></p></div>                      </div><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-review-link-to-the-past/1900-6417698/" data-ref-id="1900-6417698">Skyward Sword HD review</a> awarded the game a 7/10, thanks to its clever dungeons, excellent story, and heaps of quality of life improvements that make it more enjoyable than its predecessor.</p><p>"Skyward Sword is also filled with many genuinely magical moments," wrote critic Kevin Knezevic. "The soundtrack, notable for being Zelda's first fully orchestrated score, is still delightful, and the story is one of the most touching tales the series has ever woven, shedding light on the origins of Hyrule and other elements that have become hallmarks of the franchise. The game's dungeons are a highlight, as well, filled with clever puzzles that test your observation and lateral thinking. After Breath of the Wild excised classic-style dungeons, Skyward Sword's feel especially fresh and satisfying to explore, and the boss battles that await within are among the most fun encounters in the series."</p><p>This isn't the only great Switch game on sale during Amazon's shopping holiday.

		<p>Redemption Road Games has delayed Kingmakers just before its anticipated early access release date of October 8th, and the studio has not stated when the game is now expected to release. This is the second delay for Kingmakers, which was originally scheduled for early access in Q1 2025. If you need a refresher of what Kingmakers is, it is a game where you go 500 years back in time, fighting in a medieval battle to change the course of history using modern weapons and tech.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers - Early Access Release Date Trailer | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52u8LIuzA-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Redemption Road Games said, <em>“After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled Kingmakers launch of October 8 will no longer be possible. We want to apologize to all of the fans who are eagerly anticipating the game. We are sorry for letting you down. Why is Kingmakers being delayed? In short, it’s an incredibly ambitious, uncompromising game, and we don’t want to cut any planned features, for the sake of getting it out of the door earlier. Our goal, from the start, has been to create something that’s nothing like anything else on the market, in terms of gameplay, scale, scope, and interactivity.</em></p>
<p><em>With Kingmakers, we set out to push the Unreal Engine codebase to its absolute limits, while still providing true 60fps to midrange PCs, without the need for fake frames. We are an 80% engineering team, who got into this business to push technological barriers. We currently have tens of thousands of soldiers, each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you’d expect from a AAA third person shooter. When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6 story castles, where every room can be entered, and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a Lumbermill, it’s a real place that can be entered, or in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>When you drive a car into a tree, you’re ejected through the windshield, the tree breaks from its stump, and then rolls over whatever hapless soldiers are along its path. Every mission takes place in a massive map that each player on the server is free to explore- with or without their thousands of soldiers. We set out to do all of this, with full drop in/drop out 4 player multiplayer support, and we have. We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it. So this is what we’re doing now. We’re making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent. We want this to be the case whether you have a top of the line rig or a PC that’s seen better days. Thank you so much for all of your love and support. We hope we are doing everything we can to earn it. We will be presenting a half hour long deepdive on Kingmakers gameplay very soon, with a comprehensive overview of everything we’ve been working on.”</em></p>

The case 'entered default', granting NOA the right to take the full requested amount in damages as a result, though we didn't know what the final sum would be. Until now, that is (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3m2f3jyovbe2a">@OatmealDome</a>).</p>

<p>One section of the document reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>NOA has been, and continues to be, damaged as a direct and proximate result of Williams’ conduct. NOA has reason to believe that Williams has engaged in the infringing and unlawful reproduction and distribution of hundreds or thousands of copyrighted Nintendo Switch Games, and that through the various Pirate Shops, he has distributed or facilitated the distribution of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of unauthorized copies of such Nintendo Switch Games. NOA also has expended and continues to expend significant resources to halt or stem video game piracy, including through developing, implementing, and updating its TPMs and policing and investigating reports of piracy such as Williams’.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the document, Williams has remained silent on the matter. NOA states that it was contacted by a lawyer claiming to represent the defendant back in January 2025 with a message that read “Mr. Williams understands that Nintendo may have a right to obtain documents in support of its motion for default judgment”, though there has been no further communication in the months since.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether Williams will pay up to Nintendo's demands, but the Big N is showing no signs of backing down any time soon.</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> Back in July, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/nintendo-files-two-new-lawsuits-in-continued-clamp-down-on-switch-piracy">dished out a handful of lawsuits</a> in its continued clampdown on Switch piracy. Four months on, one of these legal claims has come back as another win for Nintendo after the defendant failed to plead or otherwise respond within the court's given time.</p>
<p>The case in question was against James 'Archbox' Williams, the lead moderator of the r/SwitchPirates subreddit, who Nintendo accused of offering "massive libraries of pirated Nintendo Switch games" via several "pirate shops".</p>
<p>According to the initial case, Williams was a self-confessed "pirate" who had previously publicly stated that he "[isn’t] going to give Nintendo $50 for a game”. The lawsuit (as shared by <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/nintendo-archbox.pdf">TorrentFreak</a>) saw Nintendo request "actual or maximum statutory damages" for several violations should he be found guilty.</p>
<p>However, no such ruling has had to take place. In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.18.0.pdf">new court document</a> filed by the Superior Court of the state of Washington on 8th November, it was revealed that the case has now 'entered default' after Williams "failed to plead or otherwise defend within the time prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil<br>
Procedure".</p>
<p>A default judgment can be reached early on in legal proceedings if the defendant fails to take the required actions. In this instance, the claim can be passed without a court hearing, usually granting the claimant the full requested amount plus interest and costs.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.15.0.pdf">accompanying more detailed document</a> from Washington's District Court explains that Williams responded to a Nintendo cease and desist letter in March 2024 stating that he would "'comply and cooperate with any demands or requests . . . within [his] control' but denying any infringement of Nintendo’s intellectual property".</p>
<p>Nintendo then sent a court order to the same address (and another possible abode that the document describes as the "Surprise Address"), to which Williams did not reply within the prescribed time. And so we arrive at the default judgement.</p>
<p>The court can set aside this decision if it transpires that Williams <em>did</em> reply to the proceedings or if it rules that Williams has a strong enough defence. But, for the time being, at least, this looks like another line in the 'win' column for Nintendo.</p>
<p>A Nintendo lawsuit submitted around the same time as the Williams case was against <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/pour-one-out-for-the-modchip-seller-facing-nintendo-in-court-alone">modchip seller Modded Hardware</a>. This claim is now progressing to the next stage, with the alleged owner of the store, Ryan Daly, standing self-represented in court.</p>

			<p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_Pb2cLqmk4">debuted a new animated short</a> titled "<em>Close to You</em>" with absolutely no explanation as to what it means. The short was simultaneously uploaded to the Nintendo Today app, the company's social media channels, and its YouTube channel, each with nothing more than its title to accompany it.</p>



<p>Of course, wild speculation online immediately followed the video's publishing, with fans going in a few directions based on the video's contents and what seem to be subtle hints regarding what it could mean.</p>



<p>The video itself is a nearly four-minute short of a baby following a magical soother around the room, accompanied by high-quality animation and visual fidelity, and some playful music which fans recognized as music from Pikmin 4. The music, along with the fact that a blurry Pikmin can be seen crossing the background of a shot at one point, has fans pointing to this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1o0f26r/new_pikmin_teaser/">being a Pikmin-related tease</a>. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Close to you" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C_Pb2cLqmk4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>But is it a tease for an upcoming Pikmin game? Or is it potentially a tease for a different Pikmin project, maybe even a Pikmin film or series? Or what if it's not a Pikmin project, and something else entirely?</p>



<p>It could be, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-posts-mysterious-close-to-you-animated-short-film/">VGC's deputy editor Chris Scullion speculates</a>, a tease at the origin story for Rosalina for the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">Super Mario Galaxy movie</a>. Or it's still something entirely different, like potentially a new project featuring baby versions of Nintendo characters, and this is Rosalina, followed by Baby Peach, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, and the rest of Nintendo's iconic characters all coming together in either a new game or a new Rugrats-style series featuring the various Nintendo babies.</p>



<p>Your guess is as good as mine or anyone else's at this point. Hopefully, we don't have to wait too long for Nintendo to explain more about "<em>Close to You</em>."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-crucial-p310-ssd-now-costs-only-cents-per-gb-a-steal-for-steam-deck-or-rog-ally-storage-upgrade.1318660/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re here in the thick of Prime Big Deals Day and there are some great opportunities to save on pretty much anything. Kitchen appliances, bedding, automotive tools, and, yes, even gaming hardware are on sale with huge discounts. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4568/">Right now, Amazon has the Crucial P310 internal SSD discounted by up to 49%</a>. The 1TB version — normally $135 — is now down to $80 while the 2TB version — normally $240 — is now down to just $122. That’s a savings of up to $188.</p>
<p>File sizes for AAA video games have been surpassing behemoth levels for some time now. Look at something like <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. It requires a whopping 150GB of your storage to install. And that’s a game from 2018. I can’t even begin to imagine what absurd size requirement Rockstar’s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will have.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4568/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This PCIe Gen4 2230 NVMe M.2 SSD is smaller than your standard internal SSDs and that’s because it is designed with PC gaming handhelds in mind to help you bring your whole game library with you when you hit the road.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck has three models, each with a different internal capacity. The LCD version of the Steam Deck only comes with 256GB while with the OLED, you have a choice of 512GB or 1TB. The ROG Ally and all new ROG Xbox Ally each come with 512GB. If those numbers aren’t enough for the gaming you want to do on the go, then you can upgrade with the Crucial P310 SSD.&nbsp;Installation is easy and should only take you about five minutes of your time to get you started gaming with way more storage.</p>
<p>While the Crucial P310 SSD is made with the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally in mind, it is additionally compatible with certain laptops such as the Microsoft Surface or select Dell models.</p>



<h2>Extreme Performance</h2>
<p>The Crucial gaming SSD is capable of read and write speeds of up to 7,100 MB/s. You can expect fast load times. Power efficiency is always good to have with PC hardware both for environmental reasons and to keep the electric bill down. Here, though, there is an added benefit. Game longer. Better power efficiency means easier on the battery means you can play for longer before it dies.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4568/">For a limited time, you can expand the storage on your PC gaming handheld to a large capacity of either 1TB or 2TB with the Crucial P310 internal SSD.</a> The 1TB is down 41% to $80 while the 2TB is down 49% to $122.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I finally broke the seal on </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>this past week because I am a mark for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-skins-rumi-mira-zoey-event-2000630221"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>and its trio of monster-slaying idols. Epic fast-tracked skins, cosmetics, and a reskinned mode themed around Netflix’s animated musical, and I paid for my first V-Bucks to play as Rumi and fight hordes of demons with shotguns and SMGs. Friends, it gave me the ick. I loathe </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s brand of artless, cross-promotional excess, and even a solid social hub and battle royale can’t wash that away for me. You know what can, though? Watching the singing voices of Huntr/x get into </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> now that their characters are in the game.</span></p> <p><span>Rei Ami, the singing voice of Huntr/x’s rapper Zoey, has been campaigning for a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>X </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>collaboration for months, and even </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rei.ami/video/7555327877944839455"><span>got to reveal her character’s skin ahead of the crossover’s launch</span></a><span>. Now that she’s finally got it, she’s been playing </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>on streams and TikTok Lives as Zoey, and I haven’t seen a pop-off as hype as the first time she got a Victory Royale in the skin in a minute. My girl is out here emoting in real life.</span></p>

   <p><span>Ejae and Audrey Nuna, the singing voices for Rumi and Mira, aren’t </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>players, but they did shoot a promo video reacting to the skins in which the group jokes about taking a class on how to play Epic’s game.</span></p>

   <p><span>Well, it looks like those lessons are happening. Rei Ami posted a video during their ongoing promotional tour for </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters,</span></i><span> showing them spending some of their spare time playing </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>. Ejae managed to get 36th place in her first battle royale match as Rumi, though she was killed by another player called WetPickle4996. I want to talk to that player. Do they know they just destroyed the Honmoon?</span></p>    <p><span>I’m obsessed with this, and I’m waiting for some talented animators and artists to draw Zoey teaching Rumi and Mira how to play </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> like a new fandom in-joke. Huntr/x probably doesn’t have that much time to game these days, though, as the group is about to make their live debut on </span><i><span>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</span></i><span> as the musical guest. The trio is </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzuUNSf0bCg"><span>performing “Golden” on tonight’s episode</span></a><span>.</span></p>

                <p dir="ltr">It's dangerous to go alone, so developer Poncle is adding online co-op to Vampire Survivors this fall. Up to four players can fight against the undead together in the roguelike game when version 1.14 drops later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Poncle revealed the new online co-op mode for Vampire Survivors <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTa_8nDjIo4">on YouTube</a>. The trailer--seen below--shows how players can either create or join a lobby, with an ID number seemingly utilized to group up. It's unclear whether there will be cross-play at this time. "Free roam the stages whilst your friend struggles to find their way through Astral Stair, or maybe see if you can all survive Room 1665 ... More players doesn't make it easier, or does it," Poncle wrote in the video's description.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Vampire Survivors Online Co-Op is Coming Soon | Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Vampire Survivors video also features five different cards for version 1.14, with online co-op being the first one unveiled. Poncle stated that another announcement will occur next week. The developer teased that "we might finally answer a burning question that has been asked thousands of times."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-survivors-adds-co-op-teases-adventures-mode-and-more/1100-6516980/">Vampire Survivors actually got local co-op</a> roughly two years with version 1.6. However, that requires sharing a single screen, while online co-op will let each player run off on their own if they want. In 2023, Poncle did <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-vampire-survivors-couch-co-op-details-revealed-and-online-co-op-could-be-coming/1100-6515861/">hint at online co-op</a>.</p><p>Earlier this year, Vampire Survivors got another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-vampire-survivors-update-is-out-now-adds-several-saga-frontier-characters/1100-6530763/">free update that introduced characters from Square Enix's fantasy-RPG series SaGa</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a> will be launching on 23rd October, 2025. It'll be coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>This was announced on the official PowerWash Simulator 2 X account, which posted a release date trailer. This not only introduces some of the grimey locations you'll be cleaning up, but also the home base you'll be hanging around in. This home base, obviously, has pet cats called Bubbles and Squeak.</p>
<p>The game is also coming to Game Pass, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">so for those who are still subscribed even with the recent price changes</a>, you'll be able to play it as part of your ongoing subscription.</p>

<p>We do know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-powerwash-simulator-2-is-bringing-back-the-ludicrous-brilliant-lore">PowerWash Simulator 2 will be continuing the original games' ridiculous and brilliant lore</a>, which should give avid cleaners something more to delve into other than muck. Those interested in getting their hands dirty can wishlist the game now on Steam, or try out the demo first if they're curious as to what the hype is all about.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-2-offers-more-of-the-same-relaxation-but-can-it-warrant-its-sequel-status">In Eurogamer's PowerWash Simulator 2 preview</a>, Ed Nightingale wrote: "With that in mind, this refined sequel provides FuturLab the perfect platform to continue tweaking and experimenting with its cleaning sim - as long as the dirt doesn't wear too thin. Perhaps we could even get some rug cleaning DLC to really get the ASMR tingles going - and monopolise my relaxation time for good."</p>
