<p>Hey! Look!</p>

<p>Nintendo has revealed a new batch of photos of the upcoming live-action Zelda movie, giving us our closest look yet at its central duo.</p>
<p>The pictures were shared on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app, and reveal Bo Bragason's Princess Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth's Link in full costume on location in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Now, it's true, there are only three photos to take in for now, but it looks... like Zelda! This is the first time that we have seen the lead cast in costume, and the game inspo is certainly strong with each actor's look.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2a572cfdbc1af"><a title="Zelda Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2a572cfdbc1af/zelda-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Movie Link appears to be sporting a darker green tunic and cream undershirt, vaguely reminiscent of his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess">Twilight Princess</a> styling, while Zelda's blue dress and plaits more closely resemble something out of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>.</p>

<p>Now remember, these images have only been shared on Nintendo Today! at the time of writing (where direct capture and screenshots are not available), so these are the best shots we can get for now — but be sure to head over to the app to see them in their full glory.</p>
<p>The latest pictures accompany the news that the live-action film has officially started shooting. We'll have to wait until <strong>7th May 2027</strong> to see it in its full glory, but we'd expect to see more updates like this as the run-up continues.</p>

			<p>To relax, sometimes you just need some nice food or a puzzle to concentrate on to keep the rest of the world at bay. Well, at least, I need that. Developer Mimmox has taken those two ways to relax and created a calming puzzler called Umami, in which you put together food puzzles made of blocks of wood. There is no fail state or timer to worry about, it’s just you, the pieces, a reference picture, and a colourful set up in which to craft a masterpiece.</p>
<p><iframe title="Umami - Official Release Date Trailer | The MIX Fall Game Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9iy67RnJssE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Each of the fifteen puzzles present in Umami has been crafted by Mimmox, with each one having an animal chef and decorative piece associated with it. The majority of levels have a collectible card hidden in the environment somewhere, which you can find by clicking on the items around you until you discover them. And when you complete a puzzle, you can touch the animal piece to set off some colourful sparks.</p>



<p>To get to that end point of completing a puzzle, you need to put it together. Much like in real life when you attempt a puzzle, you will find the pieces scattered in a completely random order with the only option being to try and get pieces to fit together while looking at the reference picture. Umami does have a reference picture for each puzzle, but it only shows the front and back full on, so not everything is given away for these 3D wooden food sculptures. Pieces can be rotated to be placed anywhere, but you want to find the right place. Once a piece is put in the right place in the correct way up it will shake and become unselectable. The bigger pieces are generally easier to place whereas the smaller pieces can look similar, and you may be trying to put those in a few different places before finally finding the correct slot.</p>

<p>Umami is a very colourful game and each puzzle looks fantastic with lots of details and great care taken to make sure the pieces fit properly. Each of the dishes has inspiration from real world recipes with a fanciful touch, and some of the puzzles reference different seasons and holidays, like Halloween and Christmas. Throughout, the soundtrack is smooth and calming adding to the relaxed atmosphere that the game is wanting to put across to you as the player.</p>

<p>I would say that Umami isn’t a game where you try to blast through all fifteen puzzles in one sitting. Instead, I recommend doing two or three puzzles at a time when you have a bit of free time, then go off and do something else. My overall playtime was approximately six hours, but spreading Umami’s puzzles out over a few days heightened the relaxation element of the game.</p>
<p>There was only one real issue I had while playing and that was puzzle pieces sometimes getting stuck in the wrong position until I could actually click them out, or a puzzle piece flying across the level if it definitely was not going to fit in a place. A gentle drop would have sufficed instead of seeing a piece fly off, breaking some of that relaxing immersion.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Umami is a very well crafted puzzle game that lets you take things at your own pace. Each of the puzzles is very well put together and look great, while the levels themselves provide a relaxing atmosphere. A couple of minor issues with the puzzle pieces do not totally detract from a game that lets you just sit and enjoy yourself.	</p></div>

			<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is Nintendo's next film up to bat, with a release date set for April 3, 2026, though it already has another film set up for 2027. The Legend of Zelda movie is due to release on May 7, 2027, and today on the Nintendo Today! app, Nintendo announced that the project had begun filming. It also revealed our first look at the film's two leads in character.</p>



<p>About a month after Nintendo announced that the Legend of Zelda movie <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-announces-the-live-action-zelda-movie-release-has-been-delayed-a-few-weeks-from-march-2027-to-may-2027/">would release in May 2027</a>, the company announced that 16-year-old Benjamin Evan Ainsworth would be stepping into the role of Link, and 21-year-old Bo Bragason would be playing Princess Zelda. Today, along with the announcement that filming has begun, we got our first look at Bragason and Ainsworth in their iconic roles.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you're wondering where the actors are in these shots, while the final film will have you believing they're in Hyrule, <a href="https://productionlist.com/production/the-legend-of-zelda/">they're actually in New Zealand</a>. A production listing indicates that filming will take place from November 4, 2025, to April 7, 2026, so it's likely that the whole film will be shot there.</p>



<p>As Nintendo delves deeper into adapting its properties into films and potentially even TV shows, out of the projects we know of now, this upcoming Legend of Zelda movie is arguably the most intriguing one. After the first Super Mario Bros. Movie, we have a pretty clear idea of where these films will sit: well-animated stories that bring a huge spotlight to Nintendo and its flagship franchise, suited for all ages.</p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda Movie could be the live-action version of that, but it could also lean into the darker, more mature elements of storytelling within the Zelda universe and try to be something with a more dramatic bent. We'll see where it lands on May 7, 2027.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>In October 2024, Bungie was sued for copyright infringement by a fantasy author called Kelsey Martineau. He alleged that&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s opening campaign had heavily lifted from his own work that he’d previously published on his blog, complete with a Red Legion embroiled in an “unending cycle of warfare.” The infringing storyline, however, had since been “vaulted” by Bungie, meaning it’s been entirely removed from the game. Now, as <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/"><em>The Game Post</em> points out today</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/bungie-and-sci-fi-author-settle-lawsuit-over-alleged-plagiarism-of-his-old-wordpress-stories-for-destiny-2s-launch-campaign/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>), Bungie and Martineau have settled the case and it will no longer go to trial.</p> <p>Martineau, who posted his stories under the name Caspar Cole, says that in 2013 and 2014 he wrote “an original work about a unique and captivating fantasy world,” as it was phrased in <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.laed.270889/gov.uscourts.laed.270889.1.0.pdf">the lawsuit</a>. This story featured a Red Legion, with a leader called Yinnerah who—he alleged—had a near-identical origin story and motivations as&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s Dominus Ghaul. They are both “urged, guided and assisted by outcast mentors (scholars) to overthrow their leaders to rise to power with the intentions of invading Earth,” both part of a Red Legion fought by rebels on Earth, and both seeking to focus on a hovering celestial entity “that houses strategic assets,” said the lawsuit. This last part refers to Martineau’s Tononob Station and <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s the Traveler hovering above the Last City.</p>

 <p>The lawsuit went on to list many other claims of direct similarities (some appearing more of a stretch than others), along with a claim that both narratives followed the same plot beats. Over the past year, Martineau has gone on to bring in further claims of infringement, including <em>D2</em>‘s <em>Curse of Osiris</em> expansion, and even the&nbsp;<em>Destiny Grimoire Anthology</em> books. Bungie, meanwhile, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-pushes-back-destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit/">tried to get the case dismissed</a> in December of last year with a filing that pretty much amounted to, “No we didn’t.”</p>

 <p>This ended up not working with the Judge, and was seemingly made even more spurious by Bungie’s attempt to sneer that Martineau had relied on fan-made content and YouTube videos to make his case. He had to do that, though, because Bungie had infamously <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-tossing-away-old-story-content-is-making-it-h-1848323271">vaulted the original storylines</a> in such a way that even Bungie was unable to go back and re-play it. It seemed that <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s code has moved on so much since its beginning was created, then destroyed, that it would be incompatible with the present version of the game even if it could be recovered.</p>

 <p>This ended up backfiring, given it also meant that <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-access-destiny-2-vaulted-red-war-internally/">Bungie was unable to offer any footage of the original game</a> to counter Martineau’s claims, and eventually had to rely on the very same fan-made content and YouTube videos to demonstrate it hadn’t plagiarized the blogger. Not only was this rather humiliating given the company’s own comments, but it meant Bungie ultimately failed to get the case dismissed as it had originally requested.</p>

 <p>Now, about a year since the original filing,&nbsp;<a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/"><em>The Game Post</em> has obtained court documents</a> that show a settlement conference took place last week, November 12, resulting in the matter being settled. “Negotiations were successful and resulted in the settlement of all claims,” said the paperwork. A further filing explained that the lawsuit was now dismissed without costs, which itself demonstrates a big climbdown from Bungie which had tried to seek legal costs from Martineau in its original attempt to dismiss.</p> <p>No details of the settlement are known, nor likely ever will be known, but it’s quite the remarkable result for a case like this. So many successful movies, books and games result in a lawsuit from someone claiming prior art, usually as a result of there being 8 billion people on the planet and so an extraordinary pool from which slightly overlapping coincidences can be found. These are usually either immediately settled just to make the complainant go away, or promptly dismissed by judges. The fact that Bungie tried to push back, but then relented, obviously doesn’t allow us to draw any solid conclusions, but it sure makes the whole ridiculous “vaulting” nonsense seem even more shortsighted.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-3-in-1-magsafe-charging-station-falls-to-almost-free-charge-all-your-apple-devices-for-pennies.1355680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Having multiple devices is convenient, but juggling separate chargers for each one? Not at all.</p>
<p>If you own a smartphone to stay connected, a smartwatch to track your fitness, and earbuds for listening to your favorite tracks on the go, you need a 3-in-1 charger that can juice all these essentials up in one go, and not make a mess while it’s at it. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5632/">The Anker MagGo 3-in-1 charging station does exactly that for Apple devices, and it’s now going for less on Amazon.</a></p>
<p>This compact, but powerful charger is currently sitting at $70, after a nice 37% discount. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but it’s only going to be around for a few more hours. If you’ve been wanting to grab a no-fuss charging solution, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5632/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultra-Fast Charging for All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>You’ll enjoy Qi2-certified, 15W ultra-fast wireless charging, which is twice as fast as the standard 7.5W chargers most people still use. For reference, it can juice an Apple Watch Series 9 to 48% in just 30 minutes. That means you can drop it on the stand while you’re getting ready, and by the time you’re about to head out, your watch will be charged and good to go. Powering your AirPods will be just as fast, and you can also use the anti-slip pad to charge other earbuds, regardless of the brand.</p>
<p>The stand is structured like a minimalist tech tree, meaning you don’t have to worry about overlapping or constantly repositioning devices. You can place your phone vertically or even flip it horizontally to use it as a clock or calendar while it charges.</p>



<p>As for compatibility, it works well with almost the entire Apple ecosystem. The charger supports MagSafe-equipped iPhones, including the iPhone 13, 14, and 15 series. Apple Watch Series 1 through Series 9, plus Apple Watch SE and the rugged Ultra 1 and 2 should work fine too. Audio-wise, the base charging pad is designed for AirPods Pro 1 and 2, as well as any wireless earbuds with a wireless charging case.</p>
<p>The box includes the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Charging Station, a 40W USB-C wall charger, and a 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cable. Just note that the discount is a limited-time one, so it’s best to grab it fast.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gopro-dumps-hero-13-black-bundle-with-2-batteries-and-hand-grip-now-goes-for-pocket-change-2000644771</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gopro-dumps-hero-13-black-bundle-with-2-batteries-and-hand-grip-now-goes-for-pocket-change.1355674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Action cameras require accessories to actually function in the real world, so purchasing a GoPro by itself leaves you with an expensive paperweight until you grab batteries, mounts, and storage. This <strong>Hero 13 Black bundle solves that with two Enduro batteries, a floating hand grip, adhesive mounts, a 64GB microSD card, and a carrying case all in one package</strong>.</p>
<p>The good news is that<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5633/"> the complete bundle just dropped to $369 on Amazon for Black Friday (down from $479)</a>, somehow coming in below the price of buying the Hero 13 Black camera alone at its regular $429. You’re <strong>getting $500 worth of gear for $110 less</strong> than it normally costs for the standalone camera.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5633/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best Action Cam</h2>
<p><strong>5.3K resolution provides 91% more detail than 4K</strong> and an incredible 665% more than 1080p which means your footage will maintain detail in post even if you crop in or zoom in. Additional resolution also allows for digital reframing of your shot, giving a variety of camera angles from a single recording.<strong> Capture 24.7MP photos from video via the GoPro Quik app</strong>, ensuring you don’t miss a single photo opportunity by switching between modes.</p>
<p>Burst Slo-Mo records action at 13x slower than normal speed, <strong>the slowest slow-motion GoPro has achieved in their lineup</strong>. You can capture details such as water droplets, bike tire treads gripping dirt, or facial expressions during those extreme moments that occur too fast to perceive in real time. The 4x slo-mo mode works at full 5.3K resolution and offers slow-motion footage with great clarity and detail. These are types of slow-motion shots that used to require specialized high-speed cameras that cost thousands of dollars.</p>



<p><strong>Rugged and waterproof construction to 33 feet</strong> means you can take this camera into environments that would destroy phones or traditional cameras immediately. Mud, snow, rain, and underwater environments become accessible filming locations without protective housings or concern for damage. The water-repelling lens cover also serves to actively prevent lens flare and artifacts that ruin shots in wet conditions. You can go from skiing powder to swimming in ocean waves without changing gear or stopping to protect it.</p>



<p>The <em>Handler</em> <strong>floating hand grip prevents the camera from sinking in case you drop it in water</strong> and saves many GoPros from resting forever at the bottom of lakes and oceans. Its bright orange color is visible underwater and makes it easy to spot when dropped. The ergonomic grip delivers stable handheld footage without the camera shake that makes unwatchable home videos. For overhead shots or selfie angles, the grip doubles as a buoyant extension pole.</p>
<p><strong>Two Enduro batteries</strong> extend the shooting time significantly beyond a single battery that comes with standalone cameras. Cold weather hastens the drainage of batteries, and having spares means not missing shots during winter activities. Changing batteries takes a couple of seconds, so you’re never waiting hours for charging on active days. The performance of Enduro batteries in cold conditions is better compared to standard GoPro batteries, which maintain performance in temperatures that could cripple regular lithium cells.</p>
<p>The<strong> 64GB SanDisk microSD card is sufficient for hours of 5.3K footage</strong> before needing to offload files. Curved adhesive mounts stick to helmets, surfboards, cars, or any curved surface for stable POV shots. This carrying case protects everything during transport and keeps accessories organized instead of loose in a backpack. In fact, these included items would cost $150-200 if purchased separately which makes the bundle pricing almost absurd.</p>
<p>For $369, you get a complete shooting kit featuring the latest Hero 13 Black, plus essential accessories that normally cost a total of $500, thus paying less than the camera alone costs at regular pricing. The bundle gets rid of the hidden costs that frustrate new action camera buyers because they come to realize their purchase is incomplete.</p>

<p>New images of Link and Zelda have been revealed for the upcoming The Legend of Zelda live-action movie. </p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda live-action movie has been in development for some time, and it appears that things are finally moving forward after the previous delay. Earlier this year, Shigeru Miyamoto had already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/link-and-zelda-actors-confirmed-nintendo-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> which actors would be playing the roles of Link and Zelda, and now new images have showcased how they look in these costumes. </p>



<h2 id="h-official-images-of-link-and-zelda-were-revealed-through-the-nintendo-today-app">Official Images of Link and Zelda were Revealed through the Nintendo Today App</h2>



<p>The new images of Link and Zelda in costume from the live-action adaptation of The Legend of Zelda were revealed by Nintendo itself through the Nintendo Today app (via <a href="https://www.vooks.net/first-photos-of-link-and-zelda-in-the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vooks</a>). Three official images were revealed: the first was a close-up of Bo Bragason, who is playing Zelda; the second image was a close shot of Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, who will be playing Link in the upcoming movie; the third image was of both of them looking over the horizon, with some of the movie’s world shown in the background. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Legend of Zelda live-action filming has already begun, and these images finally confirm that news. A couple of days ago, we saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-footage-has-reportedly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several videos circulating</a>, leaking images from the movie’s set, including actors, and other content. We already knew Link would be wearing a green tunic and Zelda would be wearing something blue, which is similar to her looks in BOTW and TOTK. The scene also seemingly included a horse with a patch featuring the classic Zelda logo. </p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zelda-movie-leak-impa-severance-actor-filming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Severance star</a> might be joining the upcoming live-action adaptation of The Legend of Zelda. Additionally, a new LEGO Zelda set is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to arrive in 2026</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">It's not every day that a billionaire gets a new superyacht and the chance to unveil a new video game console. But Valve co-founder Gabe Newell experienced just that last week. On November 12, Newell received his new luxury boat--a diesel-electric yacht that's over 360 feet long--<a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/oceanco-delivers-leviathan/" rel="nofollow ">from Oceanco</a>. It's named Leviathan and was delivered the same day that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/">the Steam Machine was revealed</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Leviathan has a hospital, science lab, dive center, hot tub, basketball court, and 15 "gaming stations." That's not all for video games, either, as there are two racing simulators to take for a spin on the superyacht. It's unknown if a Steam Machine is on board--or even some form of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-actor-stirs-up-half-life-3-rumors-with-cryptic-new-years-message/1100-6528613/">Half-Life 3</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yachts have great potential to serve as platforms for scientific research," said Newell. "It's about recognizing that you're part of a broader community and ensuring the yacht's presence adds value to the communities around it."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4603719-leviathan-delivery-12-1800x1348.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4603719" data-ratio="0.74888888888889" data-width="1800" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4603719-leviathan-delivery-12-1800x1348.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4603719"></a><figcaption>Valve cofounder took delivery of this superyacht named Leviathan last week.

Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gabe-newells-daily-routine-sounds-very-legit/1100-6533251/">Newell discussed his daily routine</a>, which included up to two daily sessions of scuba diving. Forbes estimates that he's worth up to $11 billion, and the Leviathan <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-luxury-yachts.php" rel="nofollow ">isn't his only yacht</a>. In August, <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/new-chapter-gabe-newell/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Newell actually bought Oceanco</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gabe-newell-explains-the-secret-to-his-success/1100-6533485/">asked about all of his success</a>, Newell has pointed to luck and "being surrounded by really great people." Last week, Valve announced more than just the Steam Machine. The company also pulled back the curtain on the new Steam Controller and Steam Frame, a VR headset. It's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/">unknown how much the Steam Machine will cost</a> when it arrives early next year.</p>

Reviewer Tamoor Hussain wrote, "Where the Steam Deck feels like it can be a dedicated, primary, and only gaming platform that you'll have a seamless and slick experience akin to a console, the Xbox Ally very much feels like it functions best as an extension of PC ecosystems, whether that's Steam, Xbox, or any other."</p>

                <p>Bungie has fully settled the copyright lawsuit over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s Red War campaign, closing a dispute that lasted more than a year. According to an entry cited by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/" data-target="true">The Game Post</a>, a settlement conference held on November 12 was successful. As the filing states, "Negotiations were successful and resulted in the settlement of all claims," and the court thanked both sides for reaching "an amicable resolution."</p><p>The case began in October 2024, when sci-fi writer Matthew Kelsey Martineau claimed the studio copied "major parts" of his 2013–2014 stories posted on his Wordpress site. He argued that elements such as the Red Legion faction, the Red War storyline, and several plot details were "taken directly" from his original work.</p><p>After Bungie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lawsuit-continues-as-judge-rejects-bungies-use-of-youtube-videos-and-wikis/1100-6531315/" data-ref-id="1100-6531315">failed to get the case dismissed</a>, both sides entered a long discovery process. Bungie repeatedly called the accusations "baseless," but because the original campaign is no longer in the game, the company had to rely on community videos and wiki entries instead of submitting the game itself as evidence. However, since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lawsuit-continues-as-judge-rejects-bungies-use-of-youtube-videos-and-wikis/1100-6531315/" data-ref-id="1100-6531315">those are third-party sources</a>, the judge dismissed them.</p><p>As the case progressed, Martineau expanded his claims.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-doesn%E2%80%99t-deny-black-ops-7-%E2%80%9Cai-slop%E2%80%9D-accusations.1355644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Activision has responded after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was broadly accused of using AI-generated artwork – colloquially branded as ‘AI Slop’ – for things like player calling cards, posters, Prestige icons and more. Crucially, Activision admitted to the use of AI tools and did nothing to refute any of the specific claims over where it has been used.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/11/14/activision-responds-on-genai-use-in-black-ops-7/">Xbox Era</a>, Activision said, “Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios.” They make a slight distinction to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/">Insider Gaming</a>, adding “Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios.”</p>


<p>This falls in line with the boilerplate disclosure on Steam that reads, “Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets.</p>
<p>So, basically, yes, Activision’s studios have been using AI to generate these incidental cosmetic items, and this goes hand-in-hand with some very generic, trend-following or art homages that the teams have made for many of these unlockables in the past.</p>
<p>One of the likeliest areas for AI slop that has been highlighted were the player calling cards that you can earn from completing certain mission goals and objective stats. A bunch of them have lifted a chunky cartoon art style that’s seemingly inspired by Studio Ghibli and anime art in general, completely at odds with the sci-fi war shooter that you’re earning them in. Death From Above shows a dragon burning the Icarus-like wings off someone’s back, while Reeled In shows villagers catching a fish that’s eaten a knight’s helmet.</p>


<p><em>(via <a href="https://xcancel.com/Kumesicles/status/1988982194916999619">@kumesicles</a>)</em></p>
<p>Another area is the icons that have been created for the various Prestige levels that you can work through by reseting online progress.</p>

<p><em>(via <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-littered-with-ai-art-slop-because-your-70-means-nothing-anymore/">FRVR</a>)</em></p>
<p>The whole saga really boils down to the use of AI generation in video game development to replace the work of people, and this has become one of the most controversial points that plague games in the last couple years as examples of AI-generated work seep through to finished games, whether intended or not. Anno 117: Pax Romana, for example, had a piece of AI-generated art in the full release, where the intended use was for a scene to be generated and then re-drawn or touched up by humans to correct weird looking hands, faces and other areas. This obviously means than an artist is able to produce more finished works, and by extension, then the studio maybe needs fewer artists for a project than they would have 5 or 10 years ago. Similarly, Embark Studios, the team behind ARC Raiders and The Finals, has been created AI voice banks by paying actors for their exclusive rights and uses, which seems ethical on the surface, but it’s not clear if the studio pays ongoing royalties for new lines that they need to generate – this is now the SAG-AFTRA union expectation in the US.</p>
<p>And this really blurs the lines between what is and isn’t AI-generated, to me. Are the calling cards and emblems in Black Ops 7 AI generated? Probably. Has a human hand then been used to touch up errors and oddities? Probably. Is the end product consistent with previous Call of Duty games? Definitely.</p>
<p>Skipping back to 2015’s Black Ops 3 (via <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Calling_Cards/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops_III#Multiplayer_">Fandom</a>), and the masses of calling cards in this game are, to be uncharitable, human artist slop. Where Black Ops 7 has Studio Ghibli (amongst many other themes), Black Ops 3 has steampunk toons, a whole riff on Conan the Barbarian, a whole bunch that could be colour-flipped panels from Watchmen (both the super hero stuff and the pirate side story).</p>
<p>That’s not to say that replacing human work with AI-generated work is acceptable in any case, but these do all feel pretty minimal effort. Activision and Microsoft make enough from Call of Duty that we should get the finest human artist slop in all the lands, but that’s not what it feels like we’re getting.</p>

			<p>Concord remains, for now, arguably the greatest commercial failure for Sony and PlayStation in the history of the PlayStation platform. <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/">After just ten days on the market</a> between the end of August and the beginning of September 2024, Sony pulled it from store shelves and confirmed servers would go offline, rendering the online-only game unplayable for the few players who bought it. Fast forward to the last few days, and Concord was playable to those with a legal copy of the game courtesy of fan-made custom servers, until Sony killed it once again.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/">The Game Post</a>, it began with Sony issuing DMCA takedowns of YouTube videos that were uploaded by the creators behind the project of them playing Concord on the custom servers they built. The takedowns were issued by a company listed as MarkScan, which is generally the face Sony uses to issue claims like this.</p>



<p>Though Sony wasn't directly targeting the project of building custom servers for Concord, just videos of gameplay on these custom servers, shortly after the takedowns came through, one of the lead developers behind the project stated in the Concord Delta Discord, "<em>Due to worrying legal action we've decided</em> <em>to pause invites for the time being</em>."</p>



<p>As previously stated, Sony hasn't attacked the actual project of building the custom servers. It's also worth noting that the developers were being extremely careful to remove and disallow any players from trying to share illegal copies of the game, and would only allow players who had legally obtained a copy of Concord. </p>



<p>"<em>I know this sucks for people who got forcefully refunded, but lawyers are most likely already watching everything we do and I want to ensure this project stays as legal as we realistically can do,</em>" the team wrote. "<em>We will be removing any posts containing links to copyrighted files</em>."</p>



<p>So while Sony hasn't directly issued a takedown to the project itself, the indirect action of taking down the videos seems to have been enough for Sony to show the development team that it knows about what they are doing, and it will take every path it can to strike it down. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Cities: Skylines franchise is getting a new developer. Publisher Paradox announced on Monday that it was moving long-time developer Colossal Order off of the franchise in what is said to be a “mutual decision.</p>



<p>In a joint statement on the Paradox forums, Colossal Order is moving on to build new projects and explore “new creative opportunities.”</p>







<p><strong>“For over fifteen years, the Cities Series and our partnership with Paradox have been a defining part of our journey at Colossal Order,”</strong> <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen said</a>. <strong>“When we set out to create Cities in Motion, we never imagined it would grow to become a cherished franchise with a passionate, loyal community of millions of players around the world. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“We’re confident that the franchise will continue to thrive under Paradox’s leadership. As we move forward, we’re excited to channel our experience, creativity, and passion into new projects that align with our long-term vision.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-meet-cities-skylines-new-developer">Meet Cities: Skylines New Developer</h2>



<p>Taking over the franchise will be another Finnish studio, Iceflake Studios. One of Paradox’s internal management studios, Iceflake will take over <strong>“all existing and future development for Cities: Skylines II, including free updates for the current version, continuous work on the Editor and console editions, as well as future expansions and content packs. This means that Cities players will be able to look forward to new updates and content drops for many years.”</strong></p>



<p>Colossal Order will continue on the game for a short time in order to implement in-progress updates like various bug fixes, the Bike Patch, Old Town buildings, and a Beta version of asset support for the game’s editor. After that, Iceflake will take over all development at the start of 2026.</p>







<p><strong>“Taking the reins on a genre-leading franchise like Cities is an immense honor and a great responsibility,”</strong> Iceflake studio manager Lasse Liljedahl said. <strong>“There’s a huge, loyal community out there and I want to say to every member of that community that we will humbly carry this legacy with respect, together with all of you.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Iceflake has the capacity and capability to get started. We have a decade worth of experience from making city building and management games. We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can’t wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game.”</strong></p>



<p>When making the announcement, there was no update on the console version of Cities: Skylines 2. The version has been delayed multiple times, and there’s been no update on when players can expect it. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to ask what this change means for the console version.</p>

                <p>Concord barely lasted two weeks before Sony pulled the plug on it, and it seems determined to keep the game offline as it just issued DMCA notices against a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-lives-again-as-fan-made-project-unveils-gameplay-test-videos/1100-6536235/">fan-made effort to revive the live-service shooter as Concord Delta</a>. Recently, several Concord fans had managed to resurrect the game with some technical wizardry, and although the project was in a buggy WIP state, it was still a playable build on a custom server.</p><p>The team of developers responsible for reviving Concord did take measures to protect themselves and kept the player circle small, but copyright infringement claims against videos filed by Marscan--a company that monitors online content for large clients such as Sony and has issued DMCA notices to multiple creators in the past for content like the Bloodborne demake--has the group fearing that legal repercussions might be on the way.</p><p>"Due to worrying legal action we've decided to pause invites for the time being," one of the devs behind the project said in the team's Discord group (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/" rel="nofollow ">The Games Post</a>). So far, the custom server for Concord Delta has not yet been targeted by Sony--only footage of it in action on YouTube or other social media platforms.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-has-sold-about-25000-copies-and-should-have-launched-as-a-free-game-analysts-say/1100-6526227/">Concord had a disastrous launch in 2024</a>, leading to the closure of its developer Firewalk Studios. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/">Sony still remains committed to live-service games</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-talks-concord-failure-and-the-hard-lessons-learned-from-it/1100-6527647/">and says that it has learned a few lessons along the way</a> after it fully refunded everyone who bought Concord--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uk-government-cites-concord-during-debate-about-consumer-protections-for-gamers/1100-6535897/">the game was cited as an example</a> by the United Kingdom's House of Commons about the importance of video game preservation.</p>

                <p>The Entertainment Software Association has released the results of its annual holiday shopping survey, and the data shows that kids really want video games, but not as much as they want cash.</p><p><a href="https://www.theesa.com/what-do-kids-want-for-holiday-gifts-video-games-of-course-they-also-want-their-parents-to-game-alongside-them/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The ESA's survey found</a> that video games are among the top three things that kids want this holiday, with 58% of kids saying they would like games as gifts this year. Money and gift cards (69%) was the most sought-after gift for kids, followed by clothes/accessories (63%), and then video games at 58%.</p><p>The survey also found that 58% of kids want to play more video games with their parents; the percentage increases to 73% for kids ages 5-7, 66% for ages 8-9, and 62% for ages 10-12.</p><p>The ESA's survey also found that the most likely generation to ask for video games as gifts this holiday was Gen Alpha (ages 5-12), at 62%. Beyond games themselves, kids also want in-game currency (43%), some kind of gaming console (39%), physical games (37%), video game accessories (37%), or a video game subscription (32%).</p><p>Finally, the ESA survey found that, among parents who said they are planning to buy their children video games as gifts this year, they plan to spend an average of $736.83. That figure may look high, but games are generally more and more expensive these days, and consoles are ticking up in price, too, due in part to tariffs and other factors.</p><p>"Our research this year shows that kids not only want games, they also want quality time with their families. In a world where people feel increasingly disconnected, playing video games remains one of the easiest--and most fun--ways to stay close to the people we love," ESA president and CEO Stan Pierre-Louis said in a statement.</p><p>This survey was conducted by YouGov and the ESA via a five-minute online survey from September 26-30 this year. More than 1,900 people aged 5-65 took part in the study, the data for which was "weighted to be representative of the overall US population in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, education and census region."</p>

            <p>Just this very moment, the first official photos from The Legend of Zelda live-action film were shown on the Nintendo today app.</p>
<p>These images show Bo Bragason as the titular Princess Zelda, complete with bow and arrow, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. We were treated to a shot of the duo looking out over Hyrule, as well as individual character images. </p>

<p>Ever since set footage from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-zelda-and-link-filming-the-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-in-new-zealand">upcoming live-action Legend of Zelda movie adaption first came to light over the weekend</a>, I have been trying to piece together clues to work out which game the crew is adapting. So, please allow me to take you through my thinking…</p><p>As you can see in the images below and above, our first look at Bo Bragason as Zelda show her in a blue tunic. In my mind, this put the film in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>'s timeline, where the Champions and the princess all largely wore a splash of blue in their day to day wear, be it tunics or sashes. The way Bragason's hair has been styled is also very Breath of the Wild. </p>

<p>However, after Zelda first appears in the footage, she then walks up to another character next to a horse. Many have surmised that this is Impa, a mainstay in the Zelda series. The thing is, Impa here is much younger than she appears in Breath of the Wild, even with the silver hair, and is wearing quite a knightly-looking garb. This in my mind then put the film into the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a> category, where Impa serves as a strong warrior.</p>

<p>Others online, meanwhile, have pointed out that the actress perhaps playing Impa in the film (the character has not been officially confirmed yet) looks a lot like the Impa seen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-skyward-sword">Skyward Sword</a>. This is canonically the game that started off the whole Zelda timeline. As for who the actress is, again we don't have official word yet but she appears to be Dichen Lachman. I first came across Lachman when she appeared in Neighbours as Katya Kinski, though she has since starred in the likes of Severance and Altered Carbon.</p>

<p>Then, finally, we come to the Legend of Zelda series' main man, Link. In the film, he is played by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, who can be seen in set footage wearing Link's iconic green tunic ensemble. Again, this pushes my initial Breath of the Wild thoughts towards the back burner as while Link can certainly get green clothing in the series' most recent timeline, this is not what he wears in any of the key art or promotional images.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Link does not yet appear to have the Master Sword in any of the set images. Will finding it be part of the film's story?</p>

</figure>
<p>So, what can we conclude then? Well, in all honesty, I am not exactly sure which game in the Legend of Zelda series the film will be adapting, despite my initial thought being Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>Perhaps the team will do something similar to what Sony tried to do with its Uncharted adaptation, and create a sort of melange of set pieces from across the Zelda series. Or, perhaps, we will be presented with an all new story for the Legend of Zelda…? What do you hope to see on the film's eventual release?</p>
<p>Filming for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-the-project-begins-production-it-looks-like-the-legend-of-zelda-film-is-following-in-lord-of-the-rings-esteemed-footsteps">Nintendo's Legend of Zelda adaptation began earlier this month in New Zealand</a>, and is expected to run until April next year. The film is due to release on 7th May, 2027.</p>
<p>I will be keeping my eyes open for any more set leaks and cast announcements, so stay tuned. Personally, I am most interested to hear who will play Ganondorf.</p>

<p>The 'So Strong It's Funny' event will get underway on <strong>25th November</strong> and will be hanging around until <strong>2nd December</strong>, so you have just one week to rack up a high score and pull in the bonus goodies.</p>
<p>And gosh, are there some goodies this time. As was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/two-classic-donkey-kong-icons-may-soon-join-bananza-as-unlockable-figures">previously rumoured</a>, the upcoming event's in-game statues are modelled on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">DK 64</a>'s Chunky and Lanky Kong. Finally, we can decorate DK Island with a small slice of the iconic duo... albeit only as inanimate objects.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4vqxtmh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>You'll find the precise times that the event gets underway in your region below:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 12am PST / 1am MST / 2am CST / 3am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 8am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 9am CET / 10am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 5pm JST / 4pm AWST / 7pm AEDT</li></ul>

<p>Much like the last Emerald Rush challenge, 'So Strong It's Funny' adds a tactical twist to the game mode's usually randomised elements, cutting the pool of possible upgrade perks and skills down to a pre-determined list. It looks like it'll only be 'Groove' upgrades up for grabs this time, so expect to be picking up Emeralds in style.</p>
<p>And for those wondering, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/e5d5c669-a123-408e-bbd1-1e8a390cbef8">Japanese Nintendo website</a> promises that there is <em>another</em> in-game event coming our way before 2025 is up. Hey, whatever it takes to beef up that DLC package a little.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/umami-review-puzzingly-delicious</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/umami-review-puzzingly-delicious.1355590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the last few years alone, players have been treated to gaming excellence that can be explored and completed in a single gaming session (or night, if preferred), and there's a new title to be added, but simply not ignored: <em>UMAMI</em>. While the word itself is commonly used to describe the savoriness of a dish, it's also the name given to developer Mimmox's debut release, and yes, food is most certainly involved!</p>

<p>The game's developer did not shy away from delivering us with extravagant yet mouth-watering... puzzles (and yes, you've read correctly). Puzzles that look like some popular real-world dishes. So, after a few hours of puzzle-solving and building quite the appetite, did the developer cook something delicious with <em>UMAMI</em> worthy of a five-star rating?</p>

<h2>First Puzzling Encounter For A Hungry Mind</h2>

<p><em>UMAMI</em> is the delectable debut game from developer&nbsp;Mimmox, in which it equally challenges and makes one quite hungry over its scrumptious food-centric dioramas. It doesn't overstay its welcome when it comes to solving the puzzles, which is a great thing, but it's also very streamlined in its gameplay design and mechanics, and it packs on the cozy vibes for a stress-free experience (no hair-pulling needed).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/umami-screenshot-1075.jpg?itok=rPGqyqzT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/umami-screenshot-1075.jpg?itok=HxcfLQ79 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We wonder just how puzzingly difficult it can be to assemble a hamburger?&nbsp;(Picture: Mimmox / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Each&nbsp;diorama featured in <em>UMAMI</em>&nbsp;has a unique theme and an associated master chef credited beside their tasty masterpieces, ranging from a purrfect hamburrrger to honey-drenched waffles, to towering stacks of sushi, and a spooky apple pie. Players must position every eye-watering piece to the diorama using a reference image of the completed&nbsp;puzzle by playing around with each puzzle piece, rotating and placing them.</p>

<p>There may not be an overarching story involved, other than the bite-sized descriptions of the themed dioramas to solve and the outstanding (and creative) chefs behind their creations. Nevertheless, players can bask in a delightful yet soothing gameplay environment while puzzle-solving, with no time limits and no added pressure, but all the time to spare in a single evening or over a weekend, relaxing over some appetizing puzzles.</p>

<h2>Let Us Cook!</h2>

<p>As alluded to, <em>UMAMI</em> is a 3D puzzle experience with warm and inviting, cozy vibes that remove the gloves and restrictions for a relaxing, puzzling solving experience. The best and adequate description of this 3D cozy puzzle game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/overcooked-review-culinary-triumph" rel="nofollow"><em>Overcooked</em></a>, with mechanics akin to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/fez-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Fez</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/little-to-left-review" rel="nofollow"><em>A Little to the Left</em></a> (and borrowing the latter's cozy vibes).</p>

<p>Like many 3D puzzle games, <em>UMAMI</em> features key elements and gameplay mechanics designed for a stress-free gaming experience as players move from one deliciously enticing puzzle to the next, cooked up by the talented animal chefs for us to behold. Movement-based mechanics is one such key element, as players are free to move or change their position to assist in solving each diorama, which extends to moving each puzzle piece by playing around with them and rotating them to discover the correct orientation.</p>

<p>Granted, it will take players some time to determine its correct orientation&nbsp;after playing around and rotating each puzzle piece, before they can place the piece onto a 3D diorama structure. Luckily, we didn't go into every puzzle blind, as the developer has kindly provided us with a reference image featuring the solved diorama, including the front and back positions, to further aid players in locating those key pieces and placing them in their correct position on the diorama structure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/umami-screenshot-1074.jpg?itok=rqzLjhPf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/umami-screenshot-1074.jpg?itok=yX7R_Je6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>If you need further help in solving this tasty diorama, click the puzzle piece in the top right corner for some clues or hints. (Picture: Mimmox / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>This added detail has certainly come in handy even after spending minutes staring point-blank at the puzzle pieces and the structure, especially on the levels where many pieces look all too familiar. After completing a diorama, the next one will immediately unlock, and it's pretty much "rinse and repeat" until all 15 beautifully hand-designed levels are completed.</p>

<p>A little delicious mention is that there are a few secrets to be discovered on every level, adding yet another unique touch to this cozy puzzle experience. As for what secrets exactly can be found, all we can say is that there are animal friends that appear in some levels and cards, so our lips are sealed.</p>

<h2>Is Fresh Or Rotten?</h2>

<p>There aren't many drawbacks regarding this 3D cozy puzzle game, aside from the lack of narrative and strong art, level, and gameplay design, so players and puzzle enthusiasts won't have much to complain about. However, if one were to be nitpicking, <em>UMAMI</em> is a short game overall, as players can expect to complete all the puzzles in rapid timing before dedicating extra time to find all the secrets, so one would be looking around the ballpark of four to eight hours for 100% completion.</p>

<p>Sure, there are conversations regarding gameplay length in general, but the developers prioritized delivering a complete and polished game, well-designed puzzles, and adorable yet cozy aesthetics for an experience that's well-paced without sacrificing or cutting out content or mechanics. But if the game's appetizing puzzles are too mind-boggling for one to solve, then players would be better off playing something easier or going elsewhere for a less challenging gameplay experience, but that would be too silly to do.</p>

<p>Additionally, the game's cozy aesthetics may not appeal to every player seeking their next puzzle experience, which in turn could lead to unwarranted and incorrect assumptions about the game. As such, we would counter that argument and recommend playing the demo to find out for yourselves, but this game is worth it for the engaging puzzle and level designs, cozy aesthetics, and time well spent that leaving a tip is required (because the developer certainly "cooked" with <em>UMAMI</em>)!</p>

<h2>UMAMI Review |&nbsp;Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/umami-screenshot-1072.jpg?itok=7ZY2P6St 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/umami-screenshot-1072.jpg?itok=l387n1t4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We're just leaving this here, but this should be a clue of what else players may find in-game. (Picture: Mimmox / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Our time with <em>UMAMI</em> may have been fleeting, but it was certainly tantalizing and utterly irresistible, largely thanks to gorgeous puzzles, ingenious gameplay design and mechanics, and inviting audio mixing and design. The developers made a stellar effort in exquisitely designing, hand-painting, and well-balancing all 15 puzzles featured, which is worth spending every minute solving them and replaying just for the cozy aesthetics alone.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, the game's cozy aesthetics and environment definitely made every minute spent less stressful and, instead, made us want more puzzles, but we were understandably satisfied with what we received. Without any guardrails or time restrictions, players are left to their devices, albeit with some assistance, to move from puzzle to puzzle at their desired pace.</p>

<p><em>UMAMI</em> may demand some brainpower, plenty of logic, and perspective to solve the five-star gourmet puzzles, but it doesn't demand too much of one's time to complete them. There is no such thing as the wrong or incorrect way to solve a puzzle, but that's the beauty and joy of them, and that's quite simply... <em>UMAMI!</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-just-slashed-350-off-this-asus-tuf-f16-gaming-laptop-dropping-a-1300-machine-to-its-lowest-price-yet-2000644446</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Handheld gaming PCs have had a <em data-start="168" data-end="176">moment</em> these past few years. The Steam Deck basically kicked the door open, and then devices like the Lenovo Legion Go and the Asus ROG Ally walked right in behind it. They’re convenient, sure, and there’s something very fun about flopping on the couch and playing full PC games without the weight of a whole laptop. But at the end of the day, those handhelds are still pretty focused on gaming and not a whole lot else. If you want something that can actually do all the normal “computer stuff” <em data-start="666" data-end="671">and</em> play the games you want, a good gaming laptop still just makes more sense. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5631/">And right now, Amazon has a solid deal running on the Asus TUF F16. It normally sits at around $1,300, but it’s marked down to $950 at the moment—a nice $350 off.</a></p>
<p>Let’s talk specs for a minute, because that’s what really makes or breaks a gaming laptop. The TUF F16 comes with a 16-inch display in a 16:10 aspect ratio, and it pushes a Full HD resolution. The refresh rate tops out at 165Hz, which is great if you play anything fast-paced or competitive, and the response time clocks in at 7ms. It also uses Adaptive-Sync, which basically helps keep your games looking smooth by cutting down on screen tearing and random stutters. The bezels are pretty slim too, so you get a surprising amount of screen without the whole machine feeling huge.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5631/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Subtle Styling</h2>
<p data-start="1493" data-end="1738">The keyboard is full-size with a number pad—which you don’t always get on laptops these days. Asus also gave the WASD keys a gold highlight, which is a small touch but a fun one if you like a little flair without going full RGB explosion.</p>
<p data-start="1493" data-end="1738">Under the hood, this particular model is running an Intel Core i5-13450HX paired with an NVIDIA GeForce 5050 laptop GPU. You get 16GB of RAM and a 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD for storage. It’s not a monster machine that will play every AAA title at ultra settings, but for the price, it’s more than capable. Indie games will be a breeze to run, and a lot of bigger-budget titles should run just fine at medium settings without you needing to sacrifice too much.</p>


<p data-start="2777" data-end="2997">Battery life is solid, too. The 90Wh battery supports fast charging, letting you go from dead to 50% in about half an hour. You also get a 100W USB-C port that can charge your phone or accessories, which is always handy.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-cuts-christmas-tree-set-price-twice-in-a-week-now-selling-for-pocket-change-2000644755</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This LEGO Christmas tree has become Amazon’s best-selling toy over the past week, and it received back-to-back price cuts in seven days. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/">set just dropped to $26 from its usual $44 price and marks a 40% discount and a new record low</a> for this holiday season icon. <strong>Amazon sold over 60,000 units already</strong>&nbsp;which shows how people are jumping on this early Black Friday deal before inventory disappears. The 2-in-1 building option <strong>lets you construct either one large tree or two smaller trees</strong>, which gives you flexibility for different display spaces.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Holiday Classic</h2>
<p>The larger tree configuration <strong>stands over 11 inches tall</strong> which makes it substantial enough to serve as a tabletop centerpiece without dominating your space. Each tree comes adorned with miniature ornaments, candles, and a yellow star on top that captures the classic Christmas tree aesthetic. The LEGO designers nailed the proportions and details that make this recognizable as a Christmas tree rather than just a generic green structure.</p>
<p>The 2-in-1 building option is what separates this from single-configuration sets that limit your creativity. You can build one tall tree at 11 inches for a dramatic display, or <strong>construct two smaller trees at 9 inches and 6 inches</strong> to spread holiday cheer across multiple rooms. Families can split the pieces and build together, creating matching trees for different spaces in the house.</p>



<p>Build quality matches what you’d expect from LEGO with tight brick connections and durable pieces that survive multiple rebuilds. The green pieces interlock firmly enough to create a solid structure that won’t fall apart when you move it around your house. The <strong>ornament details use clever brick combinations</strong> that add visual interest without requiring hundreds of tiny frustrating pieces. The<strong> color palette stays traditional with greens, reds, and touches of gold</strong> that fit any holiday decor style.</p>



<p>The timing makes this <strong>perfect for early holiday decorating or as a family activity during Thanksgiving weekend</strong>. You can build it together as a group project that gets everyone involved in holiday preparations without spending hours untangling light strings or arguing about ornament placement. The set arrives ready to build with all pieces included and no batteries or electronics required.</p>
<p>At $26 for a set that normally costs $44, you’re getting legitimate holiday decor. You’re investing in reusable decor that brings joy every year instead of disposable decorations that end up in landfills, all while paying pocket change during this record-low Black Friday pricing.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Dueling Grounds monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Coins, Gems and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dueling Grounds is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-skateboard-simulator-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> fighting game where players take part in one-on-one duels to find out who the ultimate fighter is. Players can utilise weapons such as swords and daggers, while also executing typical fighting game actions like blocks, parries, and punches. It’s essential for players to get a solid grasp of the controls, as simply button-jamming will only get them so far. Chaining combos is crucial, as it’s the best way to do the maximum amount of damage most efficiently.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Like most fighting games, Dueling Grounds also boasts an ability bar, which can be filled up by landing strikes and successfully blocking or parrying the opponent’s moves. Once filled, players can launch an ultimate attack that deals massive damage, increasing their chances for victory. Although simply progressing through the game will give players the resources they need to stay competitive, using redeem codes to gain an advantage is a common practice in most Roblox games.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-expired-dueling-grounds-codes-nbsp">Expired Dueling Grounds Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes in Dueling Grounds, as the game released quite recently. Considering just how much popularity it has gained over the last few weeks, the developers are likely working on new codes to be released. Once new codes release, older ones tend to expire, and when that happens, the expired codes will be moved to this section. In the meantime, we urge players to make use of the active codes at the earliest, as they could expire at any moment.&nbsp;</p>

Nintendo will pay tribute to a pair of classic N64 characters via an upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Emerald Rush DLC challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After years left in the wilderness, both Chunky Kong and Lanky Kong will return in the DLC as "exclusive in-game statues", Nintendo has today <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1990389457187455057" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed</a>, as part of the upcoming So Strong It's Funny in-game challenge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event, set to run from November 25 to December 2, will be set on the game's Hilltop Layer. As of yet, there's no word on exactly how may points players will need to rack up to earn these latest cosmetic items used to decorate DK Island.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/17/16x9-nswitch-donkeykongbananza-sostrongitsfunny-1920x1080-gb-en-image1280w-1763384530128.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">They're finally here! It's Lanky Kong and Chunky Kong.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, long-term Kong fans are simply celebrating the fact that Nintendo has referenced these long-lost characters at all, after only a handful of glimpses over the past few decades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Brawny but gentle Chunky Kong (cousin of Dixie Kong) has only made three video game appearances since his 1999 debut in Donkey Kong 64. He cameos in a Donkey Kong Country 3 mini-game on Game Boy Advance, then pops up as a sticker and spirit in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Ultimate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagle-eyed fans also spotted a split-second appearance by Chunky Kong in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-bros-movie">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, standing alongside an equally-brief appearance for Diddy and Dixie — though you'll need to pause the film to really know it's him. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans had hoped that this appearance, and the fact Nintendo had gone to the trouble of slightly tweaking his design, suggested more appearances for Chunky Kong in future. And indeed, Bananza's upcoming statue seems to feature this same slightly-tweaked look. Could we see more of him in the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, or perhaps even that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-has-filed-a-copyright-notice-for-an-untitled-donkey-kong-motion-picture">long-rumored upcoming Donkey Kong movie</a> spin-off? Time will tell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The long-armed Lanky Kong, meanwhile, is similarly little-seen. He didn't get a Super Mario Bros. Movie cameo, but did appear as an unlockable character in 2007 Wii racer Donkey Kong: Barrel Blast. Could we be seeing more of him in the future too?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you haven't picked it up already, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush-first-hands-on-impressions">Bananza's DLC</a> is stuffed full of references to Donkey Kong 64 and other past classics, with appearances from Diddy, Dixie, Cranky, Squawks the parrot from Donkey Kong Country and DK's house from Donkey Kong Country Returns. Other Kongs referenced (but not seen) include a poster for Candy Kong (don't ask) and a pair of Donkey Konga bongo drums to bounce around on top of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So now, who's next for a return?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>Valve is making a play for living rooms again with its new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/">Steam Machine hardware</a>, and the company believes that the compact gaming PC could be equal to or better than what "70%" of people have at home currently. In a new interview, Valve engineer Yazan Aldehayyat explained that the Steam Machine is designed to be both a powerful and entry-level gaming device, capable of running most of the games in your Steam library at high performance levels.</p><p>"As you know, we definitely learned a lot, from 10 years ago. We learned a lot from the Steam Deck. We really feel like we have all the hardware and the software bits to make that vision a reality," Aldehayyat said to <a href="https://youtu.be/VkW3wTHT-p8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tested</a>. "It needs to have enough performance to play all your Steam games; we wanted it to be a pretty simple experience. We also wanted to target more of an entry-level device. Affordability is really important, and definitely the price-point played a huge factor in what performance level we're trying to target. Another thing we looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey. It gives us a good benchmark of where people's home devices are at in terms of performance, and the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70% of what people have at home."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkW3wTHT-p8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VkW3wTHT-p8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Aldehayyat's comments might not be too far off the mark. Older gaming PCs are still capable of running a wide variety of games thanks to upscaling technologies, while in the console space, many games are still released for both current and last-gen machines, like the PS4 and the Switch. Valve has also said that the Steam Machine is over six times more powerful than the Steam Deck, and the official tech specs released for it do suggest that it'll be capable of comfortably playing modern PC games.</p><p>The biggest question so far about the Steam Deck isn't <em>how </em>it'll perform, but what it'll cost when it launches next year. Aldehayyat has mentioned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/">Valve wants to sell Steam Machine units at a "competitive" price</a>, with analysts predicting that it could cost $400 in a best-case scenario or as much as $1,000 if Valve is aiming to break even on every sale or make a slim profit. This is the second time that Valve is launching a Steam Machine, but Valve says it's determined to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-is-aiming-for-its-new-steam-machine-to-succeed-where-the-original-failed/1100-6536209/">not repeat the mistakes of the past</a>.</p>
