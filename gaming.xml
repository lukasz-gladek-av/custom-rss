            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We were recently invited to watch a presentation of Arkheron, the debut project of Irvine-based developer Bonfire Studios, ahead of its public unveiling, and it's safe to say the game looks very unique. Sure, it explicitly takes elements from other genres, but the final product appears quite unlike anything we've seen.</p>



<p>First things first. Bonfire Studios was founded nearly ten years ago by Rob Pardo, who worked at Blizzard Entertainment as a Designer and later Chief Creative Officer on games like Starcraft, Warcraft III, World of Warcraft, Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty, Hearthstone, and the ill-fated Project Titan (which was eventually repurposed into Overwatch). Pardo brought several former Blizzard veterans along to establish a core team that has now grown to around 70 employees, though Bonfire is still hiring in a few areas like Art, Engineering, and Publishing.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Arkheron has been worked on and iterated on for a long time with the help of a peculiar routine: the development team would play it literally every morning, collect feedback right after every session, and deliver some improvements by the afternoon. Bonfire even started private playtesting with a very small community last year to get more feedback. Now, they are ready to open the first public playtest, which will take place on Steam between Friday, September 19 and Sunday, September 21.</p>



<p>What is the game all about, then? Well, as mentioned in the headline, the elevator pitch is that it combines elements from Diablo, Dark Souls, and PUBG. Its ultimate goal is to create a thrilling team-based PvPvE gameplay experience that constantly keeps players on their toes. It is played from a top-down view like Diablo, but with the significant innovation of a shooter-like free-aim camera system that can be independently controlled and swung around the player's character, allowing for precise aiming, tracking, and split-second decision-making during the game's tense fights. This particular setup also ensures melee and ranged combatants are on equal footing, as the camera is close enough to make close-quarters engagements feel intense and personal without losing sight of ranged targets.</p>



<p>The PUBG part is factored into the main game mode, the so-called Ascension Royale. In Arkheron, fifteen teams of three players each (for a total of 45 players) fight to the death to ascend to the top level of a mysterious tower that, according to the game's lore, is made up of memories from the living world. The tower is effectively a reflection of those who reside in it and, just like any memory, it can change and shift over time. Player characters are indeed Echoes, souls who have died with unfinished business. They are anchored to the tower by the grip of a past they can’t quite remember and driven to do whatever it takes to escape this surreal Abyss.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In each match, Echoes start with bare fists and have to equip themselves by looting items from sources like treasure chests, monster drops, quests, and of course, executed player opponents. After gearing up for a few minutes, the Abyssal Storm begins to sweep across the entire tower level, leaving the beacons that appear on the map as the only safe zones. But there are always fewer beacons than there are remaining teams, making this a bit of a musical chairs type of game, for a team must always secure its own safe beacon to stay in the match. Needless to say, if another team contests your beacon, you will have to eliminate them to ascend to the next level, all the way toward victory, with the final showdown taking place on the tower's fourth floor.</p>



<p>Pardo explained that in Arkheron, items are the heroes. Each item carries a unique ability, such as a sword with a stun skill, a crossbow that can be charged to snipe foes from afar, a crown that can temporarily turn your entire team invisible, or a staff that can raise a wall blocking enemies outside for a few seconds. Since the items are dropped randomly and the characters themselves do not have any abilities, the game forces players to adapt in each match rather than sticking with their favorite build as they would in similar titles.</p>



<p>Each Echo has access to four item slots: two weapons, a crown, and an amulet. Most of the items that can be found in the game are called Eternal Relics and come in sets of four. Collecting two items in a set provides a set bonus, so players could gather up to two set bonuses at a time. Alternatively, when someone is lucky enough to collect all four items in the same set, they can either stay in Echo form and enjoy the 4-piece set bonus or transform into a so-called Eternal. These are the tower's inhabitants with the most lasting ties to the living world through memories they just cannot let go of. Bonfire plans to unfold the narrative of Arkheron over time through the perspective of the Eternals.</p>



<p>From a gameplay standpoint, transforming into an Eternal will grant you a fifth ability, but the flipside is that you won't be able to return to Echo form for the remainder of that match. During the press presentation, Pardo teased that the studio could rotate Eternals in and out of the active roster to shift the meta. By the way, Eternal Relics can also be upgraded up to Rank 3 by finding their duplicates (this includes items found by teammates). </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Matches in Arkheron last up to 25 minutes (if you make it to the tower's top level). Before starting, teams look at the map to choose their drop zone in yet another nod to PUBG and the Battle Royale genre. The map will also show beacons once they become active and outline which ones are already contested. Due to how the game mode is structured, unlike in regular Battle Royale games, there really is no way to avoid fighting and earning the win. It's even possible that the game finishes earlier than the fourth floor if all the remaining teams go to the same beacon; obviously, the last team standing gets the victory.</p>



<p>Besides regular monsters, the game also features a roaming, unkillable enemy called Fury that can show up and completely disrupt fights between player teams. The presentation showed how one player, with the other two downed (they respawn after a successful ascension to a higher floor), skillfully took advantage of Fury's appearance to defeat a full team of three.</p>



<p>Toward the end of the presentation, Rob Pardo noted that Bonfire decided to build game depth and mastery before focusing on approachability. Their reasoning was that a game designed from day one for depth can sustain thousands of hours of play for competitive audiences, and approachability can be layered on later. As such, despite the PvE elements, it's fair to say Arkheron will primarily be a competitive PvP experience. While the play test that kicks off today is only available on PC, the full game will eventually be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X, too. Moreover, according to Bonfire, both mouse and keyboard and game controllers are fully supported and on equal footing.</p>

The combat, for instance, was redesigned four different times before they got things right. It sounds a lot like the way Blizzard used to work. As Pardo writes:</p><div><blockquote><p>As we playtested Arkheron internally, something rare happened. The team fell in love with the game. That might sound obvious, but for experienced developers it isn’t. Many of us have been through projects where the work is meaningful, but the daily playtests feel like a chore. With Arkheron it was different. People didn’t want to miss a session. They got frustrated if servers went down on a holiday. They grumbled when a playtest was canceled.</p></blockquote></div><p>He notes that the alpha will be a little rough arounds the edges, but that that’s all part of the process. “Playtesting is how we make <em>Arkheron</em> better,” Pardo wrote. “It’s how we’ll continue to play the game to make the game, listen to our community and let the fun guide us toward launch.”</p><p>Whenever it does launch, the game will be coming to PC, Xbox, and PS5.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/779968/bonfire-studios-arkheron-trailer-alpha-date#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/779968/bonfire-studios-arkheron-trailer-alpha-date]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Earlier this year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">laid off a lot of people</a> and cancelled projects at various subsidiary game studios, as part of what company CEO Satya Nadella has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dear-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-please-prove-that-an-ai-didnt-write-your-insulting-vacuous-blog-about-why-youre-laying-off-thousands-during-a-time-of-huge-profits">whimsically called</a> the "enigma of success". Elder Scrolls Online developers ZeniMax Online Studios were among those making cuts - they buried an unannounced project codenamed Blackbird, which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-studios-canned-blackbird-game-was-a-nimble-high-flying-shooter-claims-report">reportedly a nimble MMO shooter of some kind</a>. In the process, studio head Matt Firor also left the company. Unionised staff members have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-staff-discuss-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-and-how-the-future-looks-for-the-carcass-of-workers-that-remains">described the reductions</a> as "inhumane", demoralising and counterproductive, with one worker commenting that "a lot of practical knowledge just disappeared overnight".
</p>
<p>
Now, studio game director Rich Lambert and game director Nick Giacomini have been chatting a little about where ZeniMax Online Studios is going next. They still have plenty of ideas for new game projects, apparently, but for the moment, the focus appears to be on streamlining the update process for ESO. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>

"It was super emotional, it was awful," Lambert reflected to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-elder-scrolls-online-heads-on-the-aftermath-of-microsofts-cuts-and-the-future-of-the-long-running-mmo">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, discussing the mass layoffs. "But then after, you pick yourself up off the floor and [...] you realize that we have this responsibility to our community, to the game, to everybody else that is still there to move forward. That's really hard, but that's the goal, to continue to move forward and keep ESO going."
</p>
<p>

The Elder Scrolls fantasy MMO is in "a bit of a transition year", Lambert continued. The development team are looking at switching from the existing bulkier, chapters-based format to a speedier, "bite-sized" updates approach, in line with latter-day seasonal content thinking. Instead of dedicating themselves to one huge expansion for around 18 months, where "most of the team's efforts are focused on building the chapter," they plan to get "smaller, more bite-sized things out quicker," as Lambert explained. 
</p><p>
It's hoped that they'll be able to turn around these dinkier additions in six to nine months on average, and act faster on player requests. "We're kind of too predictable, and we want to shake that up and be a little bit more reactive," Lambert said.
</p>
<p>
That said, game creation remains complex, and there's no guarantee ZeniMax Online Studios will be able to chop development times in half, just by shelving the concept of chapters. 
</p>
<p>
"It takes a long time to build art, because you've got to model it out and you've got to rig it and skin it, all these things," Lambert said. "It takes time to code things out. It takes time when we're building stories: you're writing words on a paper and then you put that in-engine, and then you have to send it out to be voiceovered and localized."
</p>
<p>
In his <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/">memo about this year's mass layoffs</a>, which come amid a time of seeming prosperity for Microsoft, Satya Nadella suggested that the overall idea was to transform Microsoft into more of a generative AI business. 
</p>
<p>
"The success we want to achieve will be defined by our ability to go through this difficult process of 'unlearning' and 'learning'," he wrote. "It requires us to meet changing customer needs, by continuing to maintain and scale our current business, while also creating new categories with new business models and a new production function."
</p>
<p>
Nadella added that Microsoft will "reimagine every layer of the tech stack for AI - infrastructure, to the app platform, to apps and agents". He encouraged his minions to maintain a "growth mindset".
</p>
<p>
With all that in mind, are the creators of Elder Scrolls Online making much use of generative AI, as they embark on what seems basically like a mission to pump out faster updates with fewer people? Not a whole lot, going by Lambert's commentary.
</p><p>
"I mean, obviously we've looked into it," he said. "Microsoft has got their big push for AI. But we don't really use a lot of it right now. I use a lot of it for meeting summaries and whatnot, because it just makes my life easier. It helps organise my inbox and stuff like that. But we don't have a ton of it right now."
</p>
<p>As for what ZeniMax Online Studios might do post-ESO-streamlining, Lambert had this to say: "I want to make more games. I'm not done yet, and the team continues to want to make more games as well. I have lots of ideas. Hopefully we'll be able to share those at some point."</p>

              <p>2022’s&nbsp;<em>Strange Horticulture</em> was a breakout indie hit for brother developers Bad Viking. The puzzle game about running an esoteric plant store hid so many depths beyond its species-identifying core, with rich lore, character stories to become invested in, and the rumbling sense of a sinister underbelly. Today arrives its sequel <em>Strange Antiquities</em>, which I’m delighted to report not only maintains everything that made the first game so adored, but also improves it in almost every possible way.</p> <p>Returning to the fantasy city of Undermere, we’re now working in an adorable little antiques shop that sells mystical obscura such as bejeweled statuettes, charm necklaces that vibrate with peculiar energies, and objets d’art that give you the heebie-jeebies when you hold them. The shop’s owner, your boss, has to head out of town for a few days, and you’re left in charge despite not knowing what <em>any</em> of the weird items on the shelves actually are. Thankfully the boss, a Thaumaturge named Eli White, also left behind his copy of <em>Strange Artefacts: A Guide To Occult Objects</em> by T.S. Gill, which contains descriptions of all manner of magical items. Sadly very few pictures of them, but enough information that, upon scouring the shelves and holding each object, you will be able to deduce which might be which, and as such supply them to your customers.</p>  <p>In this sense, things are much the same as in <em>Strange Horticulture</em> and your dealings with its otherworldly plant life. However, in <em>Strange Antiquities</em>, everything is a lot more detailed and involved. For instance, in the previous game you could pick up any plant and look at it, but that was about it. In&nbsp;<em>Horticulture</em>, every strange item in the collection can be investigated in four different ways. You can study its “Color and Composition,” use your “Sense of Touch,” seek out “Scent and Sound,” and apply your “Inner Perception.” The first three are self-explanatory, and each gives you a unique response for the object (unless they’re not applicable), while the fourth is a more psychic response to what you’re holding. For instance, a red bottle with a raised snake motif will tell you it’s made of red clay, while the snake’s eyes are “small green gemstones,” the bottle feeling smooth with the snake as “raised detailing,” and no particular special smell or noise. But you’ll also learn that to hold it is “unsettling,” and “the eyes seem to pierce my soul.” Such details are all essential to narrowing down exactly what this odd red bottle might be, and what it might contain.</p>

 <p>Not only do you consult the indexed pages of Occult Objects, but you also have a tome written by Eli himself called <em>Gemstones &amp; Their Thaumic Properties</em>, an ancient pamphlet entitled&nbsp;<em>On Curses &amp; their Effects</em>, and an ever-growing pile of papers and notes that will provide further information. And then, as if all this weren’t enough, you’ve also got a detailed map of Undermere with which you can interact, clicking on one of its 32 named and dozens more unnamed locations in an effort to discover new antiquities to add to the shelves. Locations are identified through solving puzzles either dreamt during the night, or on notes given to you by clients, and some of these locations then reveal their own detailed maps to explore, such as the two floors of Gleaston Castle, and the Catacombs beneath the city.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626497" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626497"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626497">© Bad Viking / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>That’s a lot! And yet it never feels unmanageable,&nbsp;<em>Strange Horticulture</em>‘s superb delivery ensures you gain all these elements at a steady pace, and the game is never in a rush. You can take as long as you need for every customer, without any antsy comments or nagging, meaning you can just relax and leaf through the pages of the books, or decide to solve a map puzzle for a break, never pressured. Also, the game comes with a hint system if you ever do get stuck, and it’s a super-smart one. Rather than just spoiling a puzzle, it begins with far more gentle nudges, like reminding you to check a note you received, or asking if you remember what a customer recently said about something. Prompts like these never feel like they’re taking away from your solving the puzzle, rather just turning your head to face the right direction before you start. Keeping asking for more help and things get more specific, of course.</p>

 <p>But even more than hints, the way the game is presented does wonders for clarity. Like <em>Horticulture</em>, the whole game is played in the single location of the store, but this time the shop is so much better arranged. Customers appear in the middle, with shelves stretching off-screen to the left and right, and cupboards and drawers down below. Open the map and it’s spread out beneath the counter, and the same table is also capable of…well, I’m not going to tell you. Hidden all around this are tiny details, little knobs that, if pulled, can reveal secret drawers, and even places just below the counter with room for three of the mystical objects. Place the correct three in the correct order (based on other clues you receive) and even more secrets are uncovered. It means everything feels so special, all that thrill of a beautiful puzzle box, in the cozy setting of a candle-lit magical store.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626498" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626498"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626498">© Bad Viking / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game’s puzzles, whether the core identification challenges that make up the bulk of what you do, or the extra elements that appear in the form of playing cards or furtively passed notes, are engagingly challenging without requiring Pentagon clearance to solve. Every character is an intriguing oddity, and the game’s overall storyline is much more involving than that of the previous game.

            <p>Casting details for Amazon's forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> TV series have leaked, with fans speculating on which characters from the games will be included.</p>
<p>As shared by entertainment insider <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/mass-effect-138895669">Daniel Richtman</a>, five casting calls have leaked. These are: a young Colin Farrell-type male (30-39) with open ethnicity; a female co-lead alien character requiring prosthetics (34-39); a female human providing a parallel narrative from Earth; a Doug Jones-type male villain (40-60); and a male wrestler-type soldier (30-49).</p>
<p>Amazon has provided no details on the show's story, so it's unclear if it will be based on BioWare's original Mass Effect trilogy or if it will focus on entirely new characters in the same universe.</p>

<figure>

<p>Still, these vague character descriptions have provided enough for fans to speculate on. In particular, the female co-lead alien seems primed to be fan-favourite blue alien Liara T'Soni.</p>
<p>However, the Colin Farrell-type male could prove the most controversial. Fans have guessed this could be a male Commander Shepard, protagonist of the original trilogy - but this would assume MaleShep is canon over the female option.</p>
<p>Many fans prefer FemShep due to the performance of voice actor Jennifer Hale, so Amazon needs to tread carefully with the TV show if it's following the games and intends to cement certain story decisions - Shepard's gender especially.</p>
<p>The female human on Earth is an interesting prospect, considering the only similar character in the games would be Captain Anderson in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a>. Some fans have suggested journalist Emily Wong could be an alternative, while one proposed FemShep could still exist in the same universe like the twins in Andromeda.</p><p>Saren from Mass Effect 1 would fit the bill for a Doug Jones-type villain (the actor is known for his non-human roles in The Shape of Water and Hellboy), while the male wrestler-type soldier certainly describes James Vega. But most importantly of all: in this scenario, who's playing Garrus?!</p>

</span></p><p>Of course, this could all be entirely incorrect if Amazon chooses a story separate to the games, though you'd surely anticipate the team leaning on familiarity with the games at least for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Back in July, it was revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-mass-effect-tv-series-shares-fallouts-successful-production-team">Mass Effect series would be helmed by many of the team behind Amazon's Fallout show</a>. That's proven particularly successful - and notably takes inspiration from the games without following them directly.</p>
<p>Amazon's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">Mass Effect TV adaptation was officially announced in November</a> last year. At the start of this year, Eurogamer spoke with Jennifer Hale who stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effects-original-cast-should-return-for-the-tv-series-shepard-voice-actor-jennifer-hale-says">game's original cast should return for the TV series</a>, even if just for cameos.</p><p>"I think they'd be really smart to pull as much of the original cast into the show in cameos and Easter eggs and recurring and regular [roles] as possible," she said. "I think that would be an absolutely genius move."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-digital-edition-revision-amazon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-digital-edition-cfi-2100-revision-appears-on-amazon-europe.1300485/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/">PlayStation 5</a> Digital Edition hardware revision, featuring a smaller SSD than the current models, is real and likely to launch very soon in Europe, judging from recent developments.</p>



<p>The CFI-2100 hardware revision leaked earlier this month, identical to the current Digital Edition save for the installed 825 GB SSD in place of the current 1 TB drive, is now listed on <a href="https://www.amazon.it/Playstation-CFI-2100-Playstation%C2%AE5-Edizione-Digitale/dp/B0FN7ZG39D">Amazon Italy</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0FN7ZG39D">France</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0FN7ZG39D">Germany</a>. While the system is out of stock on Amazon France, it can be purchased from Amazon Italy and Germany, although with a delivery date ranging from October 23 in Germany and between November 11 and March 31, 2026 in Italy, suggesting that it has yet to officially launch.</p>



<p>As already mentioned, a very reliable leaker revealed that the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-digital-edition-hardware-revision-smaller-ssd-price/">PlayStation 5 Digital Edition CFI-2100 hardware revision was close to release in Europe</a> earlier this month. However, the new system was initially discovered a few months earlier thanks to certification documents filed in Japan, which detailed how the latest revision had been created to optimize production costs, which is achieved by including an SSD with a smaller capacity than every other PS5 Digital Edition released to date, among other things. Considering the CFI-2100 is launching at the same price as the older versions of the systems sporting a 1TB SSD, it would be a good idea for anyone looking into purchasing a PlayStation 5 in the near future to get any of the older versions of the Digital Edition while they are still available.</p>



<p>Besides launching new Playstation 5 hardware revision, Sony is also continuing to improve the system's firmware. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/">A new update is rolling out today</a>, introducing new features such as a new DualSense pairing option which allows users to pair the controller with multiple devices at the same, and a Power Saver mode.</p>

The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762883/analogue-3d-delay-q4-2025">Analogue 3D</a>, a console made to display N64 games in 4K, has had its release window pushed multiple times. That frustrated me for a while because I wanted to get my hands on <strong>8BitDo’s slick 64 Bluetooth controller</strong> that was made to go along with the console. Its release was likely planned to coincide with the console, but the controller finally launched just a couple months ago. The white version is down to $27.69 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK6VCGBC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, which is a hefty 31 percent off its original $39.99 price.</p><p>The 8BitDo 64 can also be wirelessly connected to a Switch or Switch 2, coming in handy for Nintendo 64 games that you can play if you have a Nintendo Switch Online plus Expansion Pack subscription. It’s one of a few controllers out there that gives you the same set of buttons as the original N64 controller (A, B, and directional C buttons on the right-hand side), but with some modern tweaks to the layout and feature set. The sole analog stick has a Hall effect sensor and is located on the left-hand side, with a D-pad beneath it. Also, the Z button is on both sides of the trigger grips. The controller supports rumble and a turbo function.</p><p>The 8BitDo 64 is also compatible with Windows and Android via Bluetooth or via a USB-C wired connection. If you wind up eventually buying an Analogue 3D whenever it releases, you’ll need a controller like this one because the console doesn’t include one.</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Other Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>I’ve been seeing emails in my inbox every week about how RTX 50-series GPUs are in stock at many retailers, but the bigger news is that stock is apparently <em>so </em>plentiful that we’re seeing deals worth sharing.

This model debuted at $829.99, but for the past couple of weeks it has been available for $749.99 at <a href="http://amazon.com/ASUS-SFF-Ready-Graphics-2-5-Slot-Axial-tech/dp/B0DS6WFRBP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=http%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fasus-prime-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-16gb-gddr7-pci-express-5-0-graphics-card-black%2FJJGGLHJX5W" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.

It’s $15.19 for Prime members right now — a small discount from its original $15.99 price — but the code <strong>MFY2E8L7</strong> will knock the cost down to $8.96 before tax (a tip of the hat to <em><a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/18609412-prime-members-lisen-adjustable-360-degree-rotation-tablet-stand-holder-up-to-12-9-8-96-free-shipping?src=SDSearchv3&amp;attrsrc=Thread%3AExpired%3AFalse%7CSearch%3AType%3Anormal%7CSearch%3ASort%3Arelevance%7CSearch%3AHideExpired%3Afalse">Slickdeals</a> </em>for surfacing this deal). Beyond rotating 360 degrees, the stand portion can adjust to multiple angles as needed, going as low at 15 degrees that makes the tablet close to parallel with a flat surface, or up to 75 degrees, which seems good for entertainment purposes.</span></li><li><span>Those of us who have been patiently waiting for <em><strong>Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning</strong></em> to be available to rent can now pay just $6.99 to watch the film on services like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mission-Impossible-Reckoning-Christopher-McQuarrie/dp/B0DLTM683D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon Prime Video</a>, <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/mission-impossible---the-final-reckoning/umc.cmc.492oh9izvznxkfxk934zdz941">Apple TV</a>, and <a href="https://athome.fandango.com/content/browse/details/Mission-Impossible-The-Final-Reckoning/4224756">Fandango</a>.

It took longer than expected to be rentable, but now I know what I’m doing this weekend. If you’d rather buy it, the film got a $7 discount on platforms, dropping to $12.99.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/779829/8bitdo-n64-wireless-controller-mission-impossible-rent-deal-sale#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/779829/8bitdo-n64-wireless-controller-mission-impossible-rent-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Whether you’re gaming on an Xbox console, PC, or Android device, the first-party Xbox Core controller is still one of if not the very best gamepad out there. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4145/">Right now, it’s been discounted down from $65 to just $50 for the robot white version</a>. That’s a solid $15 discount. If you want something a bit funkier than that, colorways like the deep pink, shock blue, and pulse red are on sale too in the $50 to $55 range.</p>

<p>While Sony each generation has decided to push forward, adding on new bells and whistles to its DualShock controller design like a touchpad or haptic triggers, Microsoft had different plans. Xbox firmly planted its flag in the dirt back in 2013 with the release of the Xbox One controller and said “We’re done here.” 12 years later, the design is mostly unchanged with some slight adjustments to keep with modern times such as Bluetooth support and a change over to USB-C. Other than that and some slightly upgraded materials, you’re basically looking at the same controller that launched the same year<em> Grand Theft Auto V</em> came out the first time.</p>
<p>Nothing’s really changed within the form factor of the Xbox Core controller because it just works.</p>

<h2>Unbeatable Controller Design</h2>
<p>I played through <em>Hollow Knight</em> on my PlayStation 5 in the lead up to the release of&nbsp;<em>Silksong.</em> It’s fine, but I decided to gift myself a new Xbox controller for playing the new one on PC Game Pass. I haven’t updated my Xbox controllers since those first few years of the Xbox One. I’d been mostly using either PlayStation or some third-party stuff like 8BitDo’s selection of retro controllers, but unboxing my brand new Sky Cipher Xbox controller felt like returning home.</p>



<p>An underrated, less talked about, standout of the Xbox controller is its D-pad. Dashing and hopping around with Hornet through Pharloom with that just sings. Feels comfortable to grip onto for long game sessions.&nbsp;The textured grips on the triggers, bumpers and back-case are a nice touch which are very welcomed when my hands are dripping with sweat as I go up against the Splinter Sister for an eighth time.</p>
<p>Some new improvements that have actually come in this last decade is a whole suite of customization options. You can map out button layouts to your own personal preference with the Xbox Accessories app. Anything that adds accessibility for folks who need it is a win in my book, even if the person using it is just someone who grew up on Nintendo that keeps forgetting which one is the A button.</p>

Chaos Armor is also guaranteed to have at least one greater affix, making them on average stronger than a typical Unique.</p><p dir="ltr">Each class had a number of Chaos Armor Uniques to choose from during the PTR, but Blizzard has sweetened the deal, adding an additional Unique that can roll as Chaos Armor for each class. They are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Barbarian - Ramaladni's Magnum Opus</li><li dir="ltr">Druid - Dolmen Stone</li><li dir="ltr">Necromancer - Mutilator Plate</li><li dir="ltr">Rogue - Scoundrel's Kiss</li><li dir="ltr">Sorcerer - Esu's Heirloom</li><li dir="ltr">Spiritborn - Sunbird's Gorget</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Come the update, Chaos Armor will be visually distinct from normal Uniques, with a greenish hue, so players can better identify them. To earn a guaranteed piece of Chaos Armor, players will want to face down the new boss Bartuc as part of the game's revamped Infernal Hordes activity. Those who are able to bring down Bartuc on Torment IV difficulty will score even more Chaos Armor drops than before. In another change, Chaos Armor drops in the game's open world will no longer replace a Unique drop, and will instead be an additional reward.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard additionally outlined how Season 10 will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-10-finally-ditches-boss-immunity-phases/1100-6534787/" data-ref-id="1100-6534787">rework the game's frustrating boss-immunity phases</a>. Bosses will instead gain a shield at 2/3 and 1/3 life that, if players are strong enough to deplete in five seconds, will prevent the boss from becoming immune. The shield's value at 2/3 life will be equal to 1/3 of the boss' max life, while the shield at 1/3 life will be equal to 2/3 of the boss' max life.</p><p dir="ltr">The full Diablo 4 Season 10 patch notes, filled with various bug fixes and class-balance changes, can be found below. While Season 10 does bring some significant changes, some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">Diablo content creators have teased that even bigger changes</a> are in the works, though Blizzard has not yet discussed what those might be. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">Diablo 4's next expansion is slated to arrive sometime in 2026</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 10 Full Patch Notes</h2><h3>Updates from PTR</h3><h3>Season of Infernal Chaos</h3><h3>Chaos Rifts</h3><ul><li>Reduced the damage of the Chaos Wave projectiles.</li><li>Removed the stacking debuff system where getting hit by an attack from a Chaos Portal would increase the damage the player received.</li><li>The Chaos Rift Nightmare Dungeon Affix now gives more rewards.</li></ul><h3>Chaos Armor</h3><ul><li>Chaos Armor is now visually distinct from normal unique items.</li><li>Bartuc now has an increasing chance to drop Chaos Armor as players progress through Torment Tiers, granting more Chaos Armor at Torment IV than on the PTR.</li><li>Chaos Armor world drops are now an additional reward instead of replacing a Unique.</li><li>We’ve added New Chaos Armor to increase the heat for Season launch:  <ul><li>Barbarian - Ramaladni's Magnum Opus</li><li>Druid - Dolmen Stone</li><li>Necromancer - Mutilator Plate</li><li>Rogue - Scoundrel's Kiss</li><li>Sorcerer - Esu's Hierloom</li><li>Spiritborn - Sunbird's Gorget</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Chaos Perks</h3><h4>General</h4><p>Crazy Brew</p><ul><li>Cooldown increased from 10 to 15 seconds.

To preserve the novelty of Chaos Waves, and to ensure interesting and unique runs are possible, we've reduced the number of Chaos Waves that appear.</em></p><ul><li>Reduced the chance of Aether to spawn on kill while holding a Reliquary in the Reliquary Chaos Wave from 25% to 10%.</li><li>Chaos Wave types now have different rarities. For example, Aether Goblins will be more rare.</li><li>The player no longer drops the Reliquary if they are immune when Chaos Lightning impacts them during the Reliquary Chaos Wave.</li><li>The Number of Chaos Waves per Infernal Horde run has been reduced from 3/4/5 to 1/1-2/2.

Contrary to popular belief, it’s surprisingly ticklish.</li><li>Chaos Rifts inside the Lunatic Siege Chaos Wave now drop additional Aether.

Developer Arrowhead Game Studios has heard your concerns and, in an effort to alleviate that frustration, will temporarily disable the Rupture Strain subfaction later today.</p><p>In a post on the official Helldivers 2 Discord, community manager Katherine Baskin said the Rupture Strain--that subfaction of Terminids from The Gloom--started behaving in unintended ways as a result of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-patch-tackles-cave-crashes-and-audio-bugs/1100-6534782/" data-ref-id="1100-6534782">the September 16 patch</a> and "other issues" regarding their balance. As such, these insectoids will be pulled offline today so the developers can iron out any of the kinks.</p>

      </div>
<p>"No other units will be affected," Baskin said. "The improved Rupture Strain will be back online in 5 weeks."</p><p>Introduced on September 2, the Rupture Strain has been rupturing brains and straining fingers as divers of all stripes get demolished by the spider-like creatures. Since they've invaded Super Earth, the Helldivers 2 community has grown tired of trying to avoid dying in battle against these bugs. A popular post on the game's subreddit, titled "Done with the rupture strain..." and posted on September 7, lists all the ways they "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nao9qf/done_with_the_rupture_strain/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">aren't fun to play against</a>." Another one, posted a day before this news came out, simply sighed at the idea that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nick9t/rupture_strain_buff_sigh/" rel="nofollow ">the</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nick9t/rupture_strain_buff_sigh/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Rupture Strain was getting buffed</a>. While there are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nihzl2/i_love_the_rupture_strain/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">plenty of posts praising</a> the "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nj0uin/hot_take_rupture_strain_is_a_unique_challenge_and/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">unique challenge</a>" they present, most of the sentiment around the Rupture Strain has been pure exasperation.</p><p>Helldivers 2 is available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. While the Rupture Strain will no longer roam The Gloom for the next five weeks, that doesn't mean there aren't things for you to do around Super Earth. Arrowhead Game Studios recently dropped a substantial patch that addresses myriad crashes and issues, and earlier this month, the team released the latest premium Warbound, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405">Dust Devils</a>, which introduced new guns, skins, and other rewards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember the mimics from <em>Prey</em>, those creepy masses of tentacles that could disguise themselves as shoes and coffee cups so they could get the drop on you? <a href="https://henrygame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Henry Halfhead</em></a><em> </em>is kind of like that, except <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1524815670713765889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">instead</a> of using its everyday objects for jumpscares, it uses them to tell a story about the value of play.</p><p>It’s never explained why the game’s titular character is just the top half of a human head, or why they have the power to jump inside the objects around them. There’d be ample opportunity to do so–the game’s story and the player’s actions are charmingly narrated, which lends meaning to your actions and helps you know what to do in the various little sandboxes you find yourself in. You play as Henry from childhood to old age, possessing various items to solve puzzles or meet goals.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Henry Halfhead – Launch Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0mdJQWdc0D0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>As a baby and child, those goals are mostly mischief and creative play: coloring, making music, or stacking blocks. (I also couldn't resist the opportunity to recreate that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pDH66X3ClA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shapes-in-slots meme</a>.) You have to open presents before your parents catch you or rescue confiscated toys from a high shelf. Having to possess objects to move them is enjoyably clunky and lets you be creative with how you go about things, even if the game is ultimately pretty straightforward in its goals. In the scenes where Henry’s a young, it definitely encourages a kind of chaotic play that captures the childhood sensation of having a bunch of stuff and just smashing it all together. </p><p>For me, all of this faltered a bit in the back half of the game, which follows Henry as an adult. The narration tells you that Henry’s lost that childhood playfulness, living a routine, somewhat overwhelming life of going to work and coming home, and putting aside his enjoyment of creative hobbies like music and art. But given the game’s length (it took me about three hours) and the fact that the core mechanic remains the same throughout, I didn’t really <em>feel</em> a difference between the play the game idolizes and Henry’s adult life. Yeah, he has a boring job sorting packages, but you still move those packages by possessing them and hopping around. There’s plenty of trouble you can cause and creative stuff you can get up to, which <em>does </em>mesh with the game’s ultimate message about how play can be found anywhere, even when the narration insists it doesn’t. It also felt odd to me that a video game would be telling such a story–if you’re old enough to resonate with its warning not to lose sight of fun, you’re an adult playing a video game, who clearly already knows the lesson the story is trying to impart.</p><p>But even given this clash (I want to write “ludonarrative dissonance” here, but I will bravely abstain), the adult Henry scenes have their own kind of fun that’s distinct from the childhood ones. Cooking becomes a slapstick challenge when you have to be the knife <em>and</em> the food <em>and</em> the pan; plunging the toilet, checking the mail, or taking a bath are multi-step affairs. </p><p>Even when the story the game wants to tell through words didn’t quite feel like the story it was telling through play, I appreciated its message and found new things to enjoy in its mechanics. I liked the gentle, often funny narration, even when I disagreed with it or it felt a bit heavy-handed. I played solo, but there’s also a co-op mode, and it feels like a game an adult could play with a kid and they’d both get something out of it, which can be hard to find.</p><p><em>Henry Halfhead</em> is out now for PC, Switch, and PS5.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/samuel-deats-anime-animation-horses-kiss-scene"><h3>What’s Harder To Draw: Horses Or Kisses?

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/12de2ea9b2e6a/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since its launch in 2018, the Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) has been a lightning rod for debate among players. Fans have argued over whether its two-tier price structure constitutes good value, questioned the quality of emulation — sometimes patchy at first with certain N64 games but steadily improved — and grumbled about the erratic release schedule for retro titles.</p>
<p>Game drops often feel random, and major titles, particularly from third parties, are still missing in action, which has fueled frustration with Nintendo’s approach. The deal has been sweetened over time, with a handful of paid DLCs bundled in and retro libraries gradually expanded. Today, I reckon many would concede that, overall, there’s a fair amount of bang for buck on offer.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ivzmsh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Yet, there’s still a glaring shortcoming to NSO that’s too often unacknowledged: while access to Nintendo’s eShops and online services are region-free, many of the perks and benefits of an NSO subscription are effectively gated to players in a handful of major territories that Nintendo dubs "The Americas," "Europe," "Japan," and "Hong Kong/Taiwan/South Korea."</p>
<p>To access online play, gamers residing elsewhere have no option but to purchase an NSO subscription through another region's eShop, as there's no dedicated local eShop or online service. In Singapore, where I’m based, it’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/10879w4/accessing_eshop_from_singapore/">common for players</a> to set their Nintendo accounts to a different region, usually the United States, to access the eShop, which is what I do.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 eShop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fb9e8a336fb62/nintendo-switch-2-eshop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Crucially, you’ll need an NSO subscription to unlock certain exclusive perks, from physical rewards that can be redeemed with Platinum Points to hardware accessories like NES, SNES, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Nintendo 64, and GameCube controllers. The catch is that Nintendo won’t ship these items outside of the select territories where they are officially offered.</p>
<p>I’ve paid full price for NSO for nearly six years. I love having convenient access to an expanding library of Nintendo classics. But I’m getting <em>awfully salty</em> about being region-locked out of buying NSO-exclusive retro controllers directly from Nintendo’s site and not being able to access subscriber-exclusive apps like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a>, which aren’t on local app storefronts.</p>
<p>I’m embarrassed to admit that I’ve had to resort to eBay resellers to obtain NSO controllers, a punishing workaround for paying subscribers. It’s perplexing why Nintendo doesn’t offer these products through their official retail stores (for example, on Singapore’s major ecommerce platforms like <a href="https://shopee.sg/nintendo.officialstore">Shopee</a> and <a href="https://www.lazada.sg/shop/nintendo/">Lazada</a>) or at least allow for international shipping.</p>
<p>While part of me was tickled by Nintendo’s recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/icymi-if-you-want-to-play-virtual-boy-classics-youll-need-to-buy-one-of-nintendos-accessories">announcement</a> of bringing Virtual Boy to NSO, news that a subscriber-exclusive stereoscopic 3D peripheral (ranging from $99.99 / £66.99 for the replica, or $24.99 / £16.99 for the cheaper cardboard model) is <em>required</em> has my blood boiling, both for the paywalls and because Nintendo won’t sell <em>me</em> one outright.</p>
<figure><a title="Virtual Boy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db50cc05fa632/virtual-boy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other attempts to reap the rewards of my NSO subscription have been similarly vexing. On a recent trip to the United States, I attempted to redeem some goodies with my Platinum Points and have them mailed to a US address. But Nintendo wouldn't accept my foreign bank card to pay for local shipping. The same bank card is accepted on the US eShop, however.</p>
<p>As for smartphone apps, the Nintendo Switch App only recently went live in Singapore, but other offerings like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today</a> calendar and news app, as well as the aforementioned subscriber-exclusive Nintendo Music app, are missing in action. With a bit of tech skullduggery, though, it is possible to change regions and access those apps from foreign app stores.</p>
<p>It has to be acknowledged that Nintendo's policy regarding region-locking has shifted significantly for the better since the release of the Switch, the first time a primary console has been region-free. From the NES all the way through the Wii U, Nintendo's home consoles were region-locked, a policy also carried over to the entire Nintendo 3DS line of handhelds.</p>
<p>Still, as long as Nintendo is officially selling hardware and software outside of major territories while leaving online play tethered to a foreign NSO subscription, it should at least ensure that paying customers in those places receive equal access to the service’s touted ecosystem of physical rewards, smartphone apps, and hardware accessories.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/83d65460b2570/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are signs that Nintendo is beginning to address the issue by opening new eShops, with Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-to-officially-launch-eshop-in-taiwan">Taiwan reportedly</a> due to get local eShops and, in theory, online services.</p>
<p>NSO has proven its worth over the years, steadily growing into a more compelling package as more retro titles become available, new consoles join the fold, and online play improves with services like GameChat. But clearly, the experience is not equal for all, and that’s something that Nintendo has to grapple with for the sake of its most engaged players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We know that RGG Studio is working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-than-heaven-is-the-official-name-of-rgg-studios-project-century/">Stranger Than Heaven</a> and a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-gets-fresh-trailer/">Virtua Fighter</a> title, and it's a fair assumption that there's a new Like a Dragon game on the horizon. As far as what else the studio might be working on, we have an <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-rgg-studio-rgg-summit-september-2025/">RGG Summit </a>to look forward to next week, but it seems like someone at SEGA or RGG Studio jumped the gun, accidentally revealing the next Yakuza game, as the RGG website showed a brief mention of Yakuza Kiwami 3.</p>



<p>The mention was spotted on the <a href="https://ryu-ga-gotoku.com/">studio's official site</a> and posted to <a href="https://x.com/tdkumon/status/1968278220245176605">X (formerly Twitter)</a> before being shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1njba80/rgg_website_accidentally_leaked_kiwami_3/">Reddit</a>, and though it was quickly taken down, it remained cached in Google, and could be seen by searching "龍が如く 極 3" site:http://ryu-ga-gotoku.com."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2 are both remakes of Yakuza 1 and Yakuza 2, so it follows that Yakuza Kiwami 3 would be a remake of Yakuza 3. If this slip-up is indeed real, then on top of expecting more looks at Stranger Than Heaven, Virtua Fighter, and the next Like a Dragon game, we can add an official Kiwami 3 reveal to the list for next week's RGG Summit and Tokyo Game Show 2025.</p>



<p>Last year, RGG Studio's series director for Yakuza, Masayoshi Yokoyama, hinted that <a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-next-entry-auditions-kiwami-3-not-next-someday/">Yakuza Kiwami 3 might happen "<em>someday</em>."</a> It seems like 'someday' is coming sooner than we might've thought.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/dispatch-is-episodic-workplace-comedy-first-iterating-where-telltale-refused-to</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-is-an-episodic-workplace-comedy-first-iterating-where-telltale-refused-to-interview-with-adhoc-studios.1300422/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year at The Game Awards, we got to see the reveal of <em>Dispatch</em>, a new title from AdHoc Studio, a development company created by alumni of Telltale Games. This comedic adventure game has players take on the role of Robert Robertson, a former superhero, working at a Superhero Dispatch company with a team of villains to rehabilitate.</p>

<p>TechRaptor got to sit down last week to not only see a bit more of <em>Dispatch</em>, getting walked through an extended segment of the game, but we also had a chance to sit down with the team at AdHoc and learn more about <em>Dispatch's </em>story, episodic release, and what they learned when fans got their hands on the demo.</p>




<p>The gameplay I got to see encompassed a lot of what you'd know from your time playing the demo. Robert Robertson, as the superhero Mechaman, had his armor damaged beyond repair, forcing him to retire from superheroing. Just when he thought he was out of options, the Superhero Dispatch Network reached out with an offer: Mentor a group of villains on their road to rehabilitation by dispatching them to emergencies, and the agency will help rebuild the Mechaman armor so Robertson can return to being a hero.</p>

<p>Gameplay is a mix of the classic 'Telltale Games-style' choose your own dialogue adventure with logic puzzles in the form of assigning the right rehabilitated villains to rescue jobs that are best for them and hacking mini-games for when Robertson needs to provide additional support.</p>

<h2><em>Dispatch </em>Was Created From the Ashes of a Live-Action Project</h2>

<p>Learning more about the story of <em>Dispatch </em>and getting to see additional gameplay, it was clear that while set in the world of superheroes that the focus of the story is in the relationships that Robertson makes with those he works with, inside the dispatch office and out.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-mechaman.jpg?itok=1D2J3z2H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-mechaman.jpg?itok=Shvgc0yk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Talking on the origins of the story for <em>Dispatch</em>, it was explained that initially parts of the team that eventually became AdHoc took work with a company that was trying to make interactive live action.</p>

<p>"We were like 'Hey, we're writers and directors who have done this in the digital space, let's do it.' The goal was to make something universally appealing, so we grabbed superheroes and went with it. We worked on that for about a year and a half, and we were getting ready to shoot with actors and sets and all the real stuff you do in Hollywood, and that was March of 2020," said Nick Herman, Co-Founder at AdHoc Studios..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"All our dreams of being Hollywood directors and writers were dashed…" - Herman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These ideas continued to be worked on and were developed internally, becoming what we've seen now as <em>Dispatch</em>.</p>

<p>Another inspiration for <em>Dispatch </em>that was brought up was a series of ESPN commercials set in a regular office space where the Florida Dolphins mascot might be pouring itself a coffee or filing paperwork.</p>

<p>"The visual of that you immediately get, it's boring but then this bright-colored thing is weird and evocative and is a platform for a lot of jokes," said Herman</p>

<p>For the team developing the story, the theme of superheroes was treated in the same way as they used to handle IP. It was their job to take that concept and find the gold in it.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-villains.jpg?itok=zDappJOi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-villains.jpg?itok=fsnME-Tc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"There's a lot of people out here who have been doing superhero stories for a long time, a lot have great ideas, and we're not interested in competing in that realm of multiverses and universe-ending storylines," added Dennis Lenart, another Co-Founder.</p>

<p>Once the idea of <em>Dispatch </em>had been created, it was time to find the voices behind the characters. With a mix of movie stars, voice actors, and internet personalities, there's a unique blend of talent backing up these characters. AdHoc explained that it started with Aaron Paul.</p>

<p>"We knew we wanted a mixture of talent from different spheres. We started with the hardest role first: Robert, our lead. We had Aaron Paul at the top of our list. With the help and talent of our casting director Linda Lamontagne we were able to get him excited about the project," said Natalie Herman, Lead Producer.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, he connected with the material, and from there it was a lot easier to get other folks excited about the project. We looked for people who were going to bring themselves to the characters and really expand on that more than we could ever think of,"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-cast.jpg?itok=qg0kSXtr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-cast.jpg?itok=WUckPGvH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I got walked through how some of the characters evolved as they went from their early production state with table reads from the crew, to how an actor giving their take on a role allowed the character to grow and change. Robertson had originally been older, but after hearing Paul read for him they went back and not only changed the delivery of the lines but altered his look to match a younger approach.</p>

<h2><em>Dispatch </em>Is Learning From What Held Telltale Back</h2>

<p>An interesting aspect of my discussion with the AdHoc team was how honest they were about the approach to development highs and lows during their time with Telltale Games. There were strengths in the engine but that also came with a rigidity in where they didn't want to step outside a safe zone.</p>

<p>In asking how fans of Telltale Games might be surprised approaching <em>Dispatch</em>, Lenart said,, "definitely the animation, it was one of the core things from the very beginning. Working on some of the games we've worked in the past, there's sometimes you know a friend will enjoy a game and then they play it and they can't get past the graphics."</p>

<p>For <em>Dispatch </em>they wanted to create a game where they could remove that barrier to entry.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-hero-select.jpg?itok=ocAy4q1q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-hero-select.jpg?itok=sLLdu6pr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"The other shocking piece is that we tried to be deliberate with the gameplay. We wanted it to be tailored to the experience," said Nick Herman. "There are a lot of people who love Telltale Games when you can explore the world and the characters say jokes, but we wanted to switch up the formula and not have the same shackles that Telltale had. Mostly technical, but also some creative."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If you're a fan of Telltale Games you should like this if you're not averse to other kinds of gameplay"</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Fan Feedback Taught AdHoc the Internet Will Have a Crush on Everyone</h2>

<p>When asked about the fan reaction, it seemed like the whole team breathed a sigh of relief. Nick Herman confirmed, "We're definitely excited that other folks are excited because this has been a thing that we've had in our life for years and thought was funny but never knew."</p>

<p>Herman added in, "That's the problem with a comedy. You hear the line read and you're excited and then two weeks later you're like, 'If I ever hear that f**king line again I'm going to kill somebody, who thought that was funny?' and you need those fresh eyes to remember the vision is still good from so long ago."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Being able to watch people play and enjoy it was really the fuel the team needed at that point in development" - Nick Herman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The team was also surprised by how into the mechanics of the game people were getting. Watching players optimize the demo taught them things about the game that they didn't know themselves, where Robertson could fail early, to then be able to maximize potential later.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-mini-games.jpg?itok=bEhprO_D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-mini-games.jpg?itok=Y-_1H_cH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It wasn't just gameplay that was shocking the development team as Derek Stratton offered up that he was shocked by the characters that fans were developing crushes on. Sonarr was one that seemed to be high on the list.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"People can fall in love with anything" - Stratton</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><em>Dispatch </em>Will Be Released Episodically</h2>

<p>AdHoc Studios also announced that <em>Dispatch </em>will be releasing on October 22, 2025, for PC and PS5, or at least that's when the first two episodes will be released.</p>

<p>Starting from October 22, every week there will be two episodes released, with the <em>Dispatch </em>finale coming out with Episode 7 and 8 on November 12. Each episode is expected to take players an hour to complete, but the team at AdHoc was also surprised when the demo was released to see people exploring every possibility and taking four hours to complete it.</p>

<p>The standard edition of the game will be available for $29.99, with a Deluxe Edition also releasing for $39.99. The Deluxe Edition will come with a Digital Artbook with 100+ pages of content, and to fit with the superhero theme, this release will also come with four digital comics and six additional stories for players who want to learn more about the characters and the world of <em>Dispatch</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks as though&nbsp;one of the major announcements at next week's RGG Summit will be&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>, if a now-deleted bit of text on the official Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio website is to be believed.</p>

<p>As spotted by Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1njba80/rgg_website_accidentally_leaked_kiwami_3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blubiboy98</a>, a news listing for&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>(written in Japanese kanji, of course) appeared on the RGG website and was quickly deleted, but not before it was <a href="https://x.com/Z64Gaming/status/1968275359000142163" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">screenshotted</a> by several <a href="https://x.com/tdkumon/status/1968278220245176605" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">users</a> on social media platform X.</p>

<p>With the studio's annual developer presentation due to air next week, it's almost certain that&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>will be announced during that show, assuming that this listing wasn't some kind of elaborate mistake or prank.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-leaked-rumor-yakuza-3-remastered.jpg?itok=HUtYlV92 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-leaked-rumor-yakuza-3-remastered.jpg?itok=TiHZtjaQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</em>could be the next game to get the&nbsp;<em>Kiwami&nbsp;</em>remake treatment.</figcaption></figure><p>It would make sense for RGG to approach <i>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</i>for the next installment in its&nbsp;<em>Kiwami&nbsp;</em>remake series; the game is now the oldest mainline&nbsp;<em>Yakuza</em>-slash-<em>Like a Dragon</em>&nbsp;title not to have been remade.</p>

<p>It's not actually the oldest game in the franchise that hasn't been remade, though; that honor goes to&nbsp;<em>Ryu ga Gotoku Kenzan!</em>, a spinoff that recasts Kazuma Kiryu as legendary historical figure Miyamoto Musashi.</p>

<p>If 2023's&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon Ishin!&nbsp;</em>is anything to go by, though, that game may well get itself a reimagining for modern systems as well, and that would arguably be even more valuable than a&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</em>remake, since&nbsp;<em>Kenzan!&nbsp;</em>has never been released in the West.</p>

<p>Of course, it's worth bearing in mind that all of this should be taken with a pinch of salt; RGG hasn't officially confirmed the <i>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</i>remake yet, so there's still a chance (albeit a slim one) that the project will be absent from next week's summit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yakuza-3-remastered-kiryu-kick.jpg?itok=p-BfmWX7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yakuza-3-remastered-kiryu-kick.jpg?itok=Nt8t-1aV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</em>is now the oldest mainline title in the series not to have been remade.</figcaption></figure><p>If&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</em>does get remade, it may well debut as&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon Kiwami 3</em>, since the series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/three-new-like-dragon-games-announced-at-rgg-summit" rel="nofollow">officially changed its name</a> to&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>to match its Japanese moniker back in 2022. That's why more recent titles, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-yakuza-series-prime-video" rel="nofollow">the Prime Video TV series</a>, have sported that name.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll have to wait until next week's RGG Summit to find out whether&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>is happening, as well as what else the studio has in store for us. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p><span>We know </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, Netflix’s animated musical that has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>set the world on fire for the past few months</span></a><span>, is likely </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-theories-questions-netflix-2000620717"><span>getting a sequel</span></a><span> after the movie’s runaway success. However, it seems like we might not have to wait too much longer to see Huntr/x, the film’s demon-slaying K-pop group, again, as the Motion Picture Association has leaked that a short film follow-up has been rated.</span></p> <p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.filmratings.com/Content/Downloads/cara_rating_bulletin.pdf"><span>document on the MPA film ratings website</span></a><span> includes a listing for something called </span><i><span>Debut: A KPop Demon Hunters Story</span></i><span>, which is rated PG for “some action/violence and scary images.” Sony is listed as the distributor, and the listing says it is a “short subject,” which is a designation given to short films rather than the feature-length movies the ratings board usually handles. The fact that it’s already been rated means that its release is probably imminent, and the title suggests it could cover the early days of Huntr/x’s K-pop career. Maybe we’ll get to see the girls meet for the first time, learn the truth about the demons preying upon humanity, and establish themselves as a dominant force in the K-pop world. If so, we might also get some new songs?</span></p> <p><span>All of this is speculation right now, but it was established back in 2023 that Sony would produce a short film based on </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><a href="https://variety.com/2023/artisans/news/spider-verse-short-film-spider-within-sony-animation-1235567757/"><span>through its LENS mentorship program</span></a><span>, which was also responsible for </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcGPpwFdE1Y"><i><span>The Spider Within: A Spider-Verse Story</span></i></a><span>, a seven-minute-long short based on the </span><i><span>Spider-Verse </span></i><span>movies. It’s unclear if </span><i><span>Debut </span></i><span>will be streaming on Netflix like the full movie or if it will be on publicly available channels like YouTube.</span></p> <p><span>If there is new music, I’ll have to update our </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><span>ranking of the movie’s original songs</span></a><span>, though it will take something really special to dethrone the song in the number one spot.</span></p>
