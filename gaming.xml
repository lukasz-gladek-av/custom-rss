			<p>2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2025-weird-and-wondrous-tales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was a great year for adventure games</a>, but this year is <strong>perhaps even more promising when looking at the schedule</strong>. Some of the most talented developers in the genre are returning with innovative games that will offer a staggering amount of variety in gameplay experiences for those who prefer not to engage in action-focused games.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, all of them come from independent developers who correctly identified the genre as a niche that most triple-A developers are content to leave alone. There's also a strong presence of French-made titles. Without further ado, here's our shortlist for the <strong>most anticipated adventure games scheduled in 2026</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="h-cairn-january-29-2026-pc-playstation-5">Cairn (January 29, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5)</h2>



<p>French independent developer <strong>The Game Bakers</strong> returns after 2016's bossfight action game <strong>Furi</strong> and 2020's love-themed RPG <strong>Haven</strong>. Both of those were quite unique and garnered acclaim, although they did not achieve the same level of popularity as other indie titles. The upcoming <strong>Cairn</strong> might just pull that off, though, especially on the heels of <strong>Peak</strong> being one of the most successful games of 2025 with <strong>over 10 million units</strong> sold to date. </p>



<p>Suddenly, climbing games look a lot more appealing to many gamers. In this one, professional climber Aava stands at the base of Mount Kami and must reach its peak.​ The gameplay prioritizes realistic climbing simulation over cinematic spectacle. Piton placement, rope management, oxygen depletion, and falling mechanics create genuine survival stakes. There's even a riskier, optional Free Solo mode that cuts safety systems for particularly daring players.</p>



<p>The 15-hour campaign features approximately an hour of cinematic storytelling, voiced by a cast of 10 climbers, each representing psychological archetypes drawn to vertical terrain. Mathieu Bablet, the celebrated comic artist, directs visual language, while the sound design comes from the team behind Limbo, Inside, and Control.​</p>



<p>The Cairn Steam demo received extremely positive feedback, and with <strong>over 700K wishlists</strong> already secured, the game is not only the first title on this adventure games list to launch, it's also among the most likely to be successful.</p>

<h2 id="h-tides-of-tomorrow-february-24-2026-pc-ps5-xss-xsx">Tides of Tomorrow (February 24, 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS, XSX)</h2>



<p><strong>Tides of Tomorrow</strong> is another adventure game that comes from an indie studio based in France, more specifically in Montpellier: <strong>DigixArt</strong>. Founded by the creator of <strong>Valiant Hearts: The Great War</strong>, the studio has since released a rhythm game, <strong>Lost in Harmony</strong>, and three adventure games, <strong>11-11: Memories Retold</strong>, <strong>Road 96</strong>, and <strong>Road 96: Mile 0</strong>. This new game is quite different, to say the least, and incredibly ambitious.</p>



<p>Firstly, it operates in a permanent asynchronous multiplayer narrative-focused mode. Where most online games pursue real-time synchronization, Tides of Tomorrow focuses on the inverse: a cascade of choices where <strong>your decisions reshape another player's story, and theirs reshape yours</strong>. The asynchronous vision system works like this: you select another player to follow—a friend, a streamer, or even a stranger, and begin your journey in locations they previously visited. NPCs retain memories of their actions; they speak about decisions made by the prior player. Ghost echoes of their movements appear as visual guides helping you anticipate environmental hazards. But here's the crux: when you steal from an NPC the previous player befriended, that NPC's attitude shifts permanently for all future players who follow you.</p>



<p>This ties into the environmental narrative, where Plastemia's spread (the conversion of life into plastic) mirrors the ripple effects of player decisions propagating through asynchronous time. <strong>Each player inherits a wounded world shaped by predecessors</strong>; each player wounds it further for successors.​</p>



<p>The developers promise that <strong>the game's branching storylines will respond to the cumulative moral weight</strong>. Story sections can even drastically change based on the prior player's set of choices. Multiple endings, therefore, emerge from whether you preserved or sacrificed NPCs, resources, or your own sanity.  Needless to say, Tides of Tomorrow sounds like a game that will either reinvent the genre or be a total flop. Of course, we're crossing our fingers for the former outcome.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Cthulhu-The-Cosmic-Abyss_2025_03-06-25_006-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-cthulhu-the-cosmic-abyss-april-16-2026-pc-ps5-xss-xsx">Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss (April 16, 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS, XSX)</h2>



<p>The third entry in our adventure games list for 2026 is also the third project that originates from a French developer. They certainly like this genre, don't they? This time, it's <strong>Big Bad Wolf</strong>, the studio behind 2018's episodic mystery adventure game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-council-episode-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Council</a></strong> and 2022's roleplaying game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-swansong-vampires-make-for-excellent-investigators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong</a></strong>. </p>



<p>After VtM, they're moving to an even creepier setting: <strong>Lovecraft</strong>. In <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/robocop-styx-and-cthulhu-announcements-headline-nacon-connect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</a></strong>, <span>however, they're bringing Lovecraft's cosmic horror forward to the year&nbsp;<strong>2053</strong>, when Earth's surface has been nearly strip-mined and desperate corporations tunnel beneath the Pacific in search of</span> rare minerals. When one mining station goes silent, <strong>Noah</strong>, an <strong>Ancile</strong> investigator (an occult division of <strong>Interpol</strong>), descends into <strong>R'lyeh</strong>, the sunken city that the miners unwittingly awakened.</p>



<p>As in classic Lovecraft, <strong>the city's architecture violates Euclidean geometry</strong>, with angles that shouldn't work and paths that loop back on themselves. Corridors will feel simultaneously monumental and claustrophobic, ancient yet pulsating with malevolent consciousness. The city isn't just alien; <strong>it's aware and deeply hostile to Noah's presence</strong>.</p>



<p>There's a perfectly fitting <strong>sanity mechanic</strong>, although in this game, sanity degrades constantly merely by witnessing cosmic wrongness, such as impossible geometry, terrifying audio cues, and distortions that suggest reality itself is warped at R'lyeh's depths. Unlike other horror games where sanity can be restored, <strong>this will be a one-way descent</strong>, and the only choice presented to players is whether to ignore the mysteries to preserve sanity or sacrifice mental stability to uncover the truth. The player's final sanity state at the narrative climax determines which of multiple endings they're going to receive.</p>



<p>NPCs embody the <strong>golden Lovecraftian principle</strong>: true horror resists definition. The player rarely sees the Shoggoth directly. Instead, they'll catch glimpses: shadows, distortions, echoes of something passing nearby, thus increasing the tension already heightened by the first-person view.</p>

<h2 id="h-order-of-the-sinking-star-tba-2026-pc">Order of the Sinking Star (TBA 2026 - PC)</h2>



<p><strong>Jonathan Blow</strong>, the acclaimed game designer behind indie gems like <strong>Braid</strong> and <strong>The Witness</strong>, returns ten years after his latest project with <strong>Order of the Sinking Star</strong>. <a href="https://wccftech.com/braid-the-witness-developer-thekla-announce-order-of-the-sinking-star-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Announced less than a month ago</a> during The Game Awards 2025, this innovative puzzle adventure game is set in a realm filled with magic, monsters, and curious traps. </p>



<p>During this adventure, players will explore <strong>four different worlds</strong>, each with its own rules, characters, secrets, and dangers. Some of the playable characters include <strong>a queen, a thief, a warrior, a wizard, a bard, a druid, and a priestess</strong>, each with their own abilities and skills. For example, the warrior can push blocks forward without restrictions, whereas the thief cannot push anything; objects act as walls to her. On the other hand, pulling is compulsive and automatic for this character. If she moves backwards while adjacent to an object, she must grab it. The wizard's core ability, teleportation, is also involuntary: if a swappable object exists within range in his direction of movement, he must swap positions with it. ​ The Wizard can also generate multiple clones by entering different mirrors, creating simultaneous multi-position puzzle solutions. </p>



<p>It is through the combination of the characters' skills that the player can solve the puzzles featured in this game. And there's going to be a ton of them: Blow revealed there will be <strong>over a thousand handcrafted puzzles</strong>, for an estimated <strong>250-500 hours of gameplay</strong>, depending on your puzzle-solving expertise. If you're into this kind of challenge, Order of the Sinking Star looks like a must-have.</p>

<h2 id="h-into-the-fire-tba-2026-pc">Into the Fire (TBA 2026 - PC)</h2>



<p>The last pick in our 2026 adventure games shortlist is <strong>Into the Fire</strong>, the next project by Polish developer <strong>Starward Industries</strong>, which made 2023's sci-fi game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-invincible-exploring-the-unknown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Invincible</a></strong>, based on a novel by Stanisław Lem. </p>



<p>Into the Fire was actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/dantes-ring-is-a-so-called-anti-combat-action-rpg-from-the-makers-of-the-invincible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in late 2024</a> as an <strong>'anti-combat' game</strong> called <strong>Dante's Ring</strong>. Although the title has changed, the setting remains the same. You're a desperate explorer fighting a volcanic apocalypse on <strong>Dante's Archipelago</strong> and must <strong>rescue as many lives as possible</strong>, including yourself, before <strong>extracting from the danger zone</strong>. The game does incorporate some elements from extraction games, although it is single player-only. Whereas in traditional extraction games, you fight off other players and try to extract with new loot, here the main dilemma is: <strong>do you save one more survivor, knowing it risks your extraction</strong>? </p>



<p>You'll be able to discover the stories of those you saved and <strong>help locals by completing their quests</strong>. In the hub, which you'll return to between extraction, you'll get to <strong>craft and upgrade gear, thus customizing the playstyle, and even tend to rescued plants and animals</strong>.</p>



<p>Fire will be both a threat and a tool in this adventure. Expect to have to survive <strong>pyroclastic flows (superheated gas), volcanic bombs (ejecta projectiles), structural collapses, ash storms</strong>, and more. ​Just like in The Invincible, Starward Industries maintains a <strong>retro-aesthetic design</strong>. Here, it's a 1950s-inspired "golden age of scientific ambition" that collides with an apocalyptic reality. </p>



<p>Into the Fire will debut on early access first, though the developer reckons <strong>the full game will still launch in 2026</strong>, making it eligible for this list.</p>

<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>Beyond those five adventure games, there's plenty more that should rightfully catch your attention, including the following:</p>

<li><strong>Broken Sword 2: The Smoking Mirror—Reforged</strong></li>



<li><strong>Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mixtape</strong></li>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/mario-tennis-fever-overview-trailer-nintendo/</link>
            <guid>1400548</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo has debuted a new overview trailer for <strong>Mario Tennis Fever</strong>, the upcoming entry in the Mario Tennis series that Nintendo is calling the "<em>most jam-packed Mario Tennis yet</em>," and it's not just saying that. By playable characters alone, Mario Tennis Fever is the biggest game in the series' history as it'll feature a total of <strong>38 characters at launch</strong>.</p>



<p>The overview trailer showcased the new features being introduced in Mario Tennis Fever, chief among them being Fever Rackets. These are different kinds of rackets that you unlock in a match by keeping a rally going, and when you get the chance to use one, you can disadvantage your opponent by making their side of the court a sheet of ice, covering it with flames, electrocutting them; there's a whole swath of elemental damage and obstacles you can place in their path with a well-placed Fever Racket shot.</p>



<p>On top of the 38 playable characters, there are <strong>30 different kinds of Fever Rackets</strong>, each with their own special abilities and methods of changing the style of the match and making it as chaotic as possible.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Mario Tennis Fever – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSyoMsWRL9I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Perhaps more intriguing than the Fever Rackets are all the different game modes. Firstly, there's a much-appreciated classic mode that does away with Fever Rackets and brings the gameplay back to plain old tennis. If you don't want to lose a match because your character was on fire and couldn't return a shot, classic mode puts everything back on a more even playing field.</p>



<p>On the other side of that, there are several modes that make things even more chaotic than they already are with Fever Rackets, and pull inspiration from other Mario games, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-bros-wonder/">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>-inspired mode that changes the court in surprising ways when you aim for Wonder Flowers.</p>



<p>There's also an adventure mode that will take you through all the basics before you jump into playing multiplayer, either in casual matches online or in ranked matches. You'll also be able to change how you play by taking the Joy-Con 2 controller off the side of your Nintendo Switch 2 and play Mario Tennis Fever like you would if it were a Nintendo Wii game, swinging your controller as the racket.</p>



<p>Mario Tennis Fever will be a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive title when it launches next month on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-tennis-fever-launch-february-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">February 12, 2026.</a></strong> It was one of our picks for our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-racing-games-of-2026-from-japan-to-a-galaxy-far-far-away/">most anticipated sports and racing games of 2026</a>, and today's new overview trailer only validated that choice.  </p>

<p>The lead on Final Fantasy 9 has revealed that the PlayStation 2’s CPU was so powerful that it raised military concerns. </p>



<p>Talks about the Final Fantasy 9 Remake have completely fizzled out since a reliable insider revealed that the project “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-might-be-on-ice-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be on ice</a>“. However, as players wait for official confirmation, the lead has shared an insight from the PlayStation 2 era, revealing that the CPU’s power was no joke back then. </p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-2-s-cpu-was-so-overpowered-that-it-led-to-export-restrictions">PlayStation 2’s CPU Was ‘So Overpowered’ That It Led to Export Restrictions </h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/61817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> (translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-9-lead-says-the-ps2-was-so-so-overpowered-its-cpu-sparked-military-concerns-so-he-struggled-to-get-an-emergency-dev-kit-during-his-stay-in-hawaii-it-was-a-very-difficult-situation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Final Fantasy 9’s Kazuhiko Aoki revealed the difficulties he faced when trying to test the game on the PlayStation 2 due to its CPU. Aoki revealed that, towards the end of his stay in Hawaii, there were discussions about his receiving PlayStation 2 testing equipment to see whether Final Fantasy 9 could run on the console. However, the console’s CPU was “so overpowered” that there was a “possibility that it would be used for military purposes,” so there were restrictions on the console’s export. </p>



<p>But, after taking “quite some time” and the team facing a “very difficult situation,” the console was finally delivered to the Final Fantasy 9 dev team. </p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake director wants <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-should-be-led-by-someone-else-says-ff7-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">someone else to lead the Final Fantasy 6 Remake</a>. Additionally, the director of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 has stated that the game’s experience is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a>“.

While the video goes over various modes and special rackets, the most important revelation is Baby Waluigi. He's a real playable character, and he's spectacular.</p><p dir="ltr">Baby Waluigi isn't the only newcomer to Mario Tennis Fever, though. The game will feature Goomba, Nabbit, Piranha Plant, and Baby Wario for the first time as part of the playable cast, consisting of 38 characters overall. The sports title will also serve up 30 Fever Rackets. Nintendo showcased some of the special abilities tied to these frames, such as the Pokey Racket and Golden Dash Racket. The former spawns enemies on your opponent's court, while the latter can make your character super agile.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Nintendo also detailed how to counter Fever shots. If players can volley the ball back--meaning not allowing it to bounce off the court--the special effect can be sent back. For instance, the Ice Racket creates a frozen surface on the court. Instead of this slippery area appearing on your side, you can volley the Fever shot back to your opponent.</p><p dir="ltr">Other tidbits from the new Mario Tennis Fever video include the fact that Fever Rackets can be disabled for more straightforward matches. In addition, the Switch 2 title has GameShare capabilities, letting nearby players on Switch 2 and Switch join multiplayer matches locally without a copy of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Mario Tennis Fever is set to launch February 12, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-2026-game-preorder-buying-guide/1100-6534725/">preorders are live</a> for the Switch 2 exclusive.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After seven months on the market, the Nintendo Switch 2 is finally getting newly colored Joy Cons. Today, via the Nintendo Today app (<a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2009253320150425831?s=20">and later on other social media platforms</a>), Nintendo announced that two new Joy Con 2 colors would be hitting shelves on the same day as Mario Tennis Fever, February 12.&nbsp;</p><h2>You can take a look at the new Joy Con 2 colors below:</h2><p>Dubbed "Light Purple" and "Light Green," the new controllers follow the color pattern established by the original Joy Con 2s. Each controller's respective color accents the joystick and connection points, but the shell is still mostly dark gray.&nbsp;</p><p>Until now, the only Joy Con 2 colors available were red and blue: the option included with the console. Even this is fewer options than the original Switch, which launched with a Red/Blue model and a gray model. While it's a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things, if you live in a household with multiple Switch 2s or visit a friend with the console to play some multiplayer, it's hard to tell the handhelds apart. This provides the first official pathway to customization.</p><p>That said, the controllers, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-l-r-light-purple-light-green-127067/?utm_source=HW&amp;utm_campaign=S1001-01&amp;utm_id=S1001-01&amp;utm_content=100009464274542&amp;utm_medium=sofbnoa">which are currently available for pre-order on Nintendo's website</a>, are the same price as red and blue Joy Con 2s – a whopping $99.99. It's a reminder of Nintendo's recently high price tags, though <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/04/nintendo-switch-2-sales-surpass-10-million-units">it hasn't stopped the console itself from having a successful launch</a>. However, a recent report also shared last November <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/17/video-game-hardware-and-physical-software-sales-this-year-had-the-worst-november-since">had the lowest number of consoles sold in a long time</a>, so that aforementioned success depends on your perspective.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/08/new-joy-con-2-colors-will-launch-alongside-mario-tennis-fever-next-month]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft has announced another Developer Direct, set to take place on the 22nd January. It'll feature Fable, Forza, and Beast of Reincarnation.</p>
<p>As for exact timing, eager spectators can tune in to this Developer Direct at 10am Pacific / 1pm Eastern / 6pm UK on the official Xbox YouTube channel to watch it live.</p>
<p>What exactly will be shown off remains largely a mystery, though <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/08/xbox-developer-direct-2026/">the official Xbox Wire post</a> announcing the show states we'll be seeing the "first in-depth look" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-developer-game-freak-reveals-beast-of-reincarnation-at-xbox-games-showcase#:~:text=Beast%20of%20Reincarnation%20takes%20place,world's%20corruption%20to%20save%20humanity.">at Beast of Reincarnation since its reveal last June at the Xbox Showcase</a>.</p>

The game made a mostly cinematic appearance in 2024, with a few glimpses of gameplay sprinkled throughout. But a proper lenghty gameplay deep dive, with UI and all the trimmings, has been on the top of people's wants ever since. Those desires will seemingly be met on the 22nd.</p>

Both Fable and Forza Horizon 6 are pencilled in to launch this year, so we should get release dates for both at Developer Direct, and we may also get a release date for Beast of Reincarnation.</p>

<p>In the announcement post, Joe Skrebels, Xbox Wire Editor In Chief, said, <em>“2026 is going to be an incredible year for Xbox players – you might even call it a… fabled year. To celebrate, we’re kicking it off with the fourth installment of our Developer_Direct broadcast on January 22, bringing you news, new gameplay, and insights directly from the incredible teams working on titles coming this year. Presented by the game creators themselves, Developer_Direct will once again give you an inside look at not just the games, but the studios working to bring them to life. Fittingly for Xbox’s 25<sup data-sleek-node-id="Me9CxY">th</sup> anniversary year, that includes the return of some of our most legendary franchises, which rub shoulders with a brand new title from one of Japan’s most beloved studios.”</em></p>

<figure><a title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161409/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>The long-running <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-trails-kiseki-games-on-nintendo-switch">Trails</a></strong> series needs little introduction, as Falcom has been chipping away at this JRPG narrative for the better part of two decades across a variety of arcs and perspectives spread over more than a dozen interconnected games. While newcomers have traditionally been discouraged by the mountain of homework necessary to ‘get it’, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_through_daybreak">Trails Through Daybreak</a> offered a nice on-ramp for the series a couple of years ago, kicking off a fresh arc. After a somewhat disappointing sequel, many hoped Falcom would right the ship with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a> and start offering some payoffs for the many plot threads it’s set up. Luckily, Falcom <em>has</em> started to get things moving, and this entry overall feels like an improvement over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_through_daybreak_ii">Trails Through Daybreak II</a>, though it isn’t without its flaws.</p>
<p>Centred on the initiation of humanity’s first steps into space, this is narratively a continuation of the ‘Calvard arc’ that started with the first Daybreak game, but there’s also a good reason why this wasn’t simply called Trails Through Daybreak 3. While Van is (debatably) the primary character of this release, there are also two parallel story routes starring Kevin and Rean, two protagonists from previously concluded arcs who still have a role to play in the all-encompassing storyline now approaching a grand conclusion that the technological developments of Zemurian space exploration are bringing into focus.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161402/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This three-route narrative approach proves to be both a blessing and a curse. On the more positive side, it’s interesting checking in with these older characters to see how they've grown and changed ‘offscreen’ while the focus of the series shifted elsewhere. Plus, bringing some legacy characters into the fold demonstrates how Falcom has begun to unite the previously distinct casts in the run-up to a finale years in the making.</p>
<p>On the other hand, these additional cast members dilute the Calvard characters' story a bit and contribute to turning what is ostensibly a ‘payoff game’ into yet more table-setting for a later resolution. Given the mixed reception to Daybreak II's relatively inconsequential storyline, it feels like a rug-pull in some ways that we have to keep waiting for things to really kick into gear.</p>
<p>Not all players will consider this more indulgent pace a bad thing, but Trails Beyond the Horizon sometimes feels a little too comfortable in keeping the narrative in neutral, coasting towards a finale and making lots of promises that will hopefully be delivered on in the future.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161394/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat continues the hybrid battle system implemented in the last two Daybreak games, mixing simple action combat with a much more in-depth turn-based system. When you first encounter enemies in the field, batting at them with your weapon to chip their health down will also build a gauge for a more powerful stun attack which can combo nicely into the turn-based mode.</p>
<p>This action combat acts as a nice way to clean up trash mobs or to soften up foes before a proper battle starts, but it can fall apart the longer you engage in it and realise how surface-level it tends to be. Falcom has done a good job of making it more interesting over time with the addition of things like reaction attacks and quick arts, but the mechanics here are still relatively sparse, particularly when compared to the significantly more complex turn-based mode.</p>
<p>Once you transition into turn-based combat, things play out more akin to a typical Trails game. When it’s a party member’s turn, you have a variety of attacks and active skills at their disposal, most of which are affected by character positioning. Not only can you freely move characters around within a fixed area before taking an action, but casting arts or crafts usually requires you to ‘aim’ an attack or area of effect to <em>just</em> the right spot to maximise passive buffs and how many enemies get caught in the blast.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161387/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Amid all this, it’s important to also be cognisant of how your potential actions affect the ongoing battle timeline. Not only are there stat bonuses that you can use (or steal) if you’re careful about how you organise party actions in the turn order, but there are ways you can delay enemy actions to create more openings for your party. Though there’s a learning curve to its management, the timeline adds a fun and dynamic layer to combat proceedings that keeps you engaged not just in <em>what</em> you’re doing, but also <em>when</em> you’re doing it.</p>
<p>This hybrid battle system wasn’t just copy-and-pasted into this entry, however; Falcom has added even more mechanics in the form of ZOC, Awakening, and Shard Commands.</p>
<p>ZOC acts as a way of slowing down time, which either lets you get in a lot more hits on the field or gives you an immediate extra turn in turn-based combat, while Awakening acts as a ‘beast mode’ that can supercharge your damage. The most interesting of these are Shard Commands, which ultimately allow you to burn some boost points in turn-based fights to activate party-wide buffs that can massively turn the tide of battle if you time them properly.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161411/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The new mechanics don’t feel like revolutionary new ideas and ultimately result in a lot prettier effects and bigger numbers, but it’s nice to see Falcom continuing to iterate on the new combat. Yet when considering all the different features together, it can sometimes feel like there’s a bit too much going on, particularly for the majority of the average encounters you’ll find yourself in. All the same, there’s lots to sink your teeth into with the gameplay here, and the system really shows its potential in the occasional tough boss fight that demands you pull out all the stops.</p>
<p>When it comes to building your team, Trails Beyond the Horizon also borrows the Orbment system from previous games, wherein each character can be equipped with various elemental crystals that grant them new arts, passives, and stat bonuses depending on how you lay things out.</p>
<p>Though there’s no explicit class system here, how you choose to configure a character’s Orbment can significantly affect the sort of role they occupy in your party, and you’re encouraged to really get into the weeds with experimenting with party compositions as the narrative unfolds. It can feel a bit confusing at first, but fooling around with it reveals lots of depth for tailoring your party, and I think it manages to strike an elegant solution to offering deep party customisation without needlessly bogging you down in menus and comparisons.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161388/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While the expected mountain of side quests is still present and accounted for, the Marchen Garten makes a return as a significant portion of the optional content. Here, it’s been dubbed the ‘Grim Garten’ and gotten a creepy makeover to reflect a story event that led to its change. The structure largely follows its previous appearance, wherein you put together a party and delve into procedurally generated dungeons in pursuit of fresh rewards and unique story content.</p>
<p>Not only does this provide a convenient way to put together characters who otherwise have little to no interaction with each other in the main story, but it also has an interesting feature where you collect and view 'memories' that fill in some <em>really</em> critical pieces of plot information.</p>
<p>Grim Garten doesn’t necessarily offer much that you can’t find when playing through the rest of the game, but it's a fun side mode that strips away a lot of fat and just lets you get to the meat of the thrilling combat. Plus, it can be a nice distraction from the occasionally glacial pace of the main narrative, where you can kill some time and gather resources to power up your team in the main story quest.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161407/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as visuals are concerned, this is one of the most beautiful Trails games yet. The new engine that Falcom debuted with Trails into Daybreak really sings on the Switch 2 hardware, holding to a mostly stable 60fps while maintaining an impressively sharp image quality in both docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>Most notably, the text is <em>actually</em> readable on the Switch 2 screen this time around, clearing up an irksome issue from the last couple of games. Animation quality has also gotten a nice boost this time around, with many of the bigger attacks and arts having a nicely cinematic quality to them that hides some of the ‘Falcom jank’ that gives these games some of their charm.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Trails Beyond the Horizon is another solid new entry in the long-running series and feels like a firm step forward, even if it’s not quite as big a step as some may have hoped. Though the story can be uneven, it’s buoyed by a strong and diverse cast that keeps you invested and reminds you how all the work Falcom has been putting in over the years has ultimately been pushing towards something.</p>
<p>Couple its engaging (if sometimes slow) narrative with polished graphics, deep character customisation, and a dynamic combat system, and you’ve got a great and ambitious JRPG that especially stands out in these relatively early days of the Switch 2 library. I’d give this one a strong recommendation to series fans, as it really does feel like a step up from Daybreak II. Newcomers, though, will want to give this one a pass until they’ve played the previous two Daybreak games, at least.</p></section>

<p>As well as <em>Fable</em>, the Developer Direct will also be checking in with another Playground Games title in the form of <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-6-revealed-ps5" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7ede297d-3bdf-4de5-b00a-3479b4a33aab" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launching sometime this year</a> on PC and Xbox (and on PS5 later after that).</p><p>We already know the racer will be moving its open-world simcade action to Japan this time around, but Xbox is promising we'll get to see gameplay during the Developer Direct.

              <p>Shaky footage is frustrating and, well, headache-inducing, especially when it ends up ruining a perfectly beautiful moment. If you film with your phone and are looking to enjoy stable, steady results, you might want to invest in a gimbal stabilizer.</p>
<p>DJI makes some of the best filming accessories on the market, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6702/">we just spotted its Osmo Mobile 7P gimbal stabilizer going at a 20% discount on Amazon.</a> It’s now available for just $103, after the retailer took a sweet $26 off its usual $129 price. Placing your orders today can also help you enjoy free delivery with your purchase, which brings the overall cost down even further. Just be sure to act fast, as the offer is expected to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Steady, Hands-Free Footage</h2>
<p>This stabilizer works with both iPhones and Android smartphones. It’s powered by DJI’s seventh-generation stabilization technology to ensure cinema-quality high and low-angle footage at your fingertips, wherever you go. Getting started couldn’t be easier. Unfolding the gimbal turns it on, while the magnetic design makes mounting any paired phone a breeze. Once the phone is up, access the Mimo app with a single click and get to filming right away.</p>
<p>There’s support for native camera features like Apple ProRes and zoom tracking, plus the stabilizer plays nicely with different live streaming apps. Gesture control makes it easy to operate the thing from afar. For instance, the “palm” gesture starts/stops recording, the “Double L” gesture adjusts framing, and making a “V” takes a photo without you having to manually click any buttons. Additionally, you’re getting a built-in fill light which adjusts brightness and color temperature for better, Instagram-worthy results, even in low light conditions.</p>
<p>DJI Mimo offers dual-lens, active tracking. This allows the subject to move freely around while still staying in focus. Play basketball with your little ones, or just show off some dance moves without worrying about the camera focusing on the tree behind. And when there are more than one subjects in the frame, you can effortlessly switch between them by tapping on their selection boxes on your phone. This way, everyone gets to be in the spotlight!</p>



<p>The all-in-one design of the gimbal offers multiple use cases. You can hold it to take selfies or record on the go, as well as set it down as a tripod for solo creation and recording videos. Battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge gets you an operating time of around 10 hours, which is great for extended filming and those long live sessions. Even better, the gimbal is also capable of powering your phone, meaning you won’t have to worry about running out of your smartphone’s battery in the middle of filming an exciting adventure.</p>
<p>Note that you need the DJI Mimo app to get started with using the gimbal. It’s not available on Google Play due to some compatibility issues, but you can install it using the official DJI website.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, this gimbal makes filming a lot more fun, and convenient. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6702/">It typically retails for around $129, but the current discount lets you grab it for $103</a>. There are no delivery charges to worry about, either, so $103 is all you’ve got to pay. Just be sure to get your orders in before the offer expires or the stock runs out.</p>

<p>The Xbox Developer Direct is just weeks away, and Xbox has confirmed the first three games that will appear at the annual event.</p>



<p>Airing on January 22 at 1pm ET/10am/6pm UK, the Xbox Developer Direct gives players a look at upcoming first-party games from Xbox Game Studios as well as some third-party titles. Last year featured games liked Ninja Gaiden 4, Doom: The Dark Ages, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, among others. And with Xbox celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, Microsoft is promising fans a “incredible year”, starting with the Developer Direct.</p>



<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/08/xbox-developer-direct-2026/?ocid=Event_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_1.8.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox announced</a> that Fable, Forza Horizon 6, and Beast of Reincarnation would receive expended looks during the event.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-fans-will-see-at-xbox-s-developer-direct">What Fans Will See At Xbox’s Developer Direct</h2>



<p>For Fable, Playground Games is giving fans the first extended look at the game that’s scheduled to release this year. Forza Horizon 6, also from Playground Games, will receive its gameplay reveal after first being announced at Tokyo Game Show last year. </p>



<p>Lastly, Beast of Reincarnation comes from Pokémon developer Game Freak. The game is an Action RPG featuring “one person, one dog”. During the event, Game Freak will “reveal details of our protagonist Emma’s innovative plant manipulation actions and gameplay with her canine companion, Koo.”</p>



<p><strong>“Presented by the game creators themselves, Developer_Direct will once again give you an inside look at not just the games, but the studios working to bring them to life,”</strong> Joe Skrebels, Xbox Wire editor-in-chief, said. <strong>“Fittingly for Xbox’s 25<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary year, that includes the return of some of our most legendary franchises, which rub shoulders with a brand new title from one of Japan’s most beloved studios.</strong>“</p>







<p>It’s expected that at least one more game will be shown during the event, though what the game will be is still anyone’s guess. The Xbox Developer Direct takes place on Thursday, January 22. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the event as it airs.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-should-be-led-by-someone-else-says-ff7-director/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The director of Final Fantasy 7 Remake has stated that he would rather see someone else lead the Final Fantasy 6 Remake, with him taking the support role instead. </p>



<p>A lot of new details about Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 have been revealed recently, including that the game’s experience is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a> and that the devs consider it a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-devs-are-considering-a-full-title-after-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full title after this instalment</a>. However, a remake has now been mentioned, and it’s none other than 1994’s Final Fantasy 6. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-director-would-like-to-see-a-new-creator-come-in">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Director Would Like to See a New Creator Come In</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbrBjFZabUE&amp;t=3s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamerBraves</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/while-final-fantasy-6-remake-would-be-a-dream-project-final-fantasy-7-remake-director-thinks-hed-rather-someone-else-lead-it-should-i-be-the-one-to-undertake-remaking-another-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), FF7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi spoke about someone else leading Final Fantasy 6 Remake. Hamaguchi first spoke about how Final Fantasy 6 has been influential in his journey as a gamer, and that influence often comes through in his work. However, FF7 Remake didn’t include any elements of FF6 as they were following a set script. </p>



<p>Hamaguchi then went on to talk about how many fans have requested a remake of Final Fantasy 6. But, he has been leading the FF7 Remake for close to 10 years and is “now finally seeing basically the end of the tunnel.” He wonders whether he should be the one responsible for taking up another remake series after pouring so much time into remaking this project. </p>



<p>Hamaguchi then states that, rather than him being the lead, he wants to see a “new creator” take the lead position, and he can take a more supportive role, “sort of cheer them on”. </p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced two pastelly new Joy-Con 2 controller colours for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and said they'll release next month.</p>
<p>The colours - officially Light Purple and Light Green (though I'd have called them Lavender and Turquoise) - are due to arrive 12th February, alongside Mario Tennis Fever on Switch 2. As far as I'm aware, these are the first new Joy-Con 2 colour variants offered for Switch 2. I'm sure they won't be the last.</p>

Since then, Hello Games has worked tirelessly to improve their ground breaking title. Underwater exploration, fishing, multiplayer, haunted wrecks, and more were all added to the space exploration game to have it meet player expectations.</p><p>These improvements continued into, and throughout, 2025. Worlds Part II kicked off the year with a new star system, gas giants, and quality of life updates. It was followed up by more Expeditions and improvements to settlements. Voyagers finished out the year in regards to big updates and introduced completely customizable ships that can be used as flying bases. It was one of the biggest years for <em>No Man’s Sky</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>With 2026 marking the game’s 10th anniversary, who knows what the Hello Games team has in store for us next.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Marvel Rivals</h2><p>Developer: NetEase Games | Release Date: December 6th, 2024</p><p>Written by Samuel Guglielmo</p><p>Cards on the table: I am not a huge Marvel comics fan, and only really got into it with the movies. When <em>Marvel Rival</em>s came out at the very end of 2024, I suggested it to my friends as an alternative to <em>Overwatch 2</em> (and<em> League of Legends</em>, mostly because that game just made them worse people). I did not know I would be setting us up for a game that would keep us playing all year.</p><p>2025 was an amazing first year for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Hero shooters can expect maybe 3 or 4 new characters a year. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>added 12, and this was to an already massive roster of 35 at launch. Several of the new heroes, such as Emma Frost, Ultron, and Phoenix, have entered my rotation of regularly played characters. Others, such as Rogue and Mister Fantastic, have been picked up by my friends. There are already two characters announced for next year, and I can’t wait to get my hands on them.</p><p>But it’s not just new characters. New maps and gameplay modes have kept the game lively. There’s an all new 18v18 mode that is chaotic nonsense. There has been new experimental seasonal modes all year, ranging from really strange matches where everyone plays the same character, to “what if <em>Splatoon </em>but everyone is Jeff?” There’s even been an absurdly fun PVE zombie survival mode that mostly reminded me of <em>Left 4 Dead</em> but with a sort of a<em> Vampire Surviors</em>-styled upgrade element. I love it.</p><p>If <em>Marvel Rivals </em>sees even half the love it got in 2025 next year, it deserves all this praise again. I have a feeling we’re still going to see plenty of more for this game though.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Helldivers 2</h2><p>Developer: Arrowhead Game Studios | Release Date: February 8th, 2024</p><p>Written by Andrew Otton</p><p>Back to back wins for<em> Helldivers 2</em>, as the level of amazing support has continued throughout 2025. From how great the team is at engaging with its community with interesting events to the new content, it was a great year for Helldivers 2 fans.</p><p>One of the biggest things for<em> Helldivers 2</em> this year was releasing on Xbox, which came with a crossover event with <em>Halo ODST</em>-themed content in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>More than that, there were two major content updates this year with the first, Heart of Democracy, centered around repelling an invasion of Super Earth. New, dense cityscape maps, that come with its own challenges like civilians to save.&nbsp;</p><p>The next, Into the Unjust, added giant caves to explore with holes in the roof for stratagems, destructible walls, and a ton of bugs to wipe out of course.&nbsp;</p><p>There was even an ARG, Station-81, that tasked the community with cracking codes, aligning antennae a la Twitch Plays <em>Pokemon </em>style, and more to reveal the invasion of Super Earth, which led into Heart of Democracy.</p><p>All in all, <em>Helldivers 2</em> continues to be a masterclass in how to keep a community engaged.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
       
    <p>There's no I in TEAM!! We're all on the case, and this is how you know it :)</p>

<figcaption>Kinetic Games isn't just about <em>Phasmophobia </em>anymore.</figcaption>

<p><em>Phasmophobia </em>director and Kinetic CEO Daniel Knight says his studio's growth means the company is now in a position to "provide the support [he'd have] appreciated at the start of [his] journey", while marketing director Asim Tanvir says Kinetic Publishing hopes to "champion and encourage creativity" in indie development.</p><p>Knight and Tanvir will spearhead Kinetic Publishing alongside three other senior team members, but don't worry; work on <em>Phasmophobia </em>won't be slowing down. Developers at Kinetic will be "entirely focused" on the game, the studio says.</p><p>With regards to <em>Phasmophobia</em>, Kinetic says it will reveal the ghost-hunting game's 2026 roadmap "soon". We already know that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-1-0-coming-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="edc0a99d-8664-4093-82db-df3ab1a960ee" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the 1.0 release is scheduled for this year</a>, and that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-switch-2-version-on-way-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="159fca3c-8df3-41ad-98da-95af3a28123c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 release is also on the cards</a> for the game.</p><p>According to Kinetic, <em>Phasmophobia </em>enjoyed 16 million Steam page visits this year, as well as "an increase of over 700,000 in broader community growth" and 150,000 new Discord members. It's been a big year for <em>Phasmophobia</em>, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Kinetic Publishing doesn't seem to have signed its first game yet, but the studio says it's currently accepting pitches from indie developers.</p><p>If you want your game to be considered, Kinetic says you'll need to be "12-18 months from release" and to have a "clear vision" for your game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has unveiled the first new colors you'll be able to pick up for the Switch 2's Joy-Con 2 controllers, and they're launching in February, but there's a slight catch for the aesthetically-inclined.</p><p>As revealed via the Nintendo Today app, new purple and green Joy-Con 2s will be released on February 12th this year, and as you've probably surmised, the edges of the controllers will be light purple and light green, respectively.</p><p>The body of the Joy-Con 2 will remain black in both instances, however, and what's more, the colors won't correspond to the edges of the console, so you'll have to deal with a mismatch every time you attach your Joy-Con 2s to your Switch 2.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The Switch 2 is getting new Joy-Con 2 colors soon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Happily, however, it doesn't look like you'll be able to tell that the colors don't match when the controllers are docked on the console, so the clash shouldn't be too much of an eyesore.</p><p>Introducing new Joy-Con colors was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-pastel-joy-cons" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ba98a8b8-8ce9-4458-b4e9-813635a22d7e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a staple of the original Switch</a> for Nintendo, so it's nice to know that tradition will continue for the Switch 2, although I'm hoping for some slightly more interesting designs on the actual controllers themselves next time.</p><p>Of course, these controllers aren't any different to the original Joy-Con 2s you'll have received as part of your Switch 2, so they're just as susceptible to problems like controller drift as the originals (and, indeed, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/consumer-watchdog-urges-nintendo-to-get-grip-on-joy-con-drift" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="10da3ff4-d0cf-4623-9c10-63fda942fd3f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">as the Switch 1 controllers were</a>, seemingly).</p><p>Still, perhaps you'll be able to use <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-voice-command-software-hitachi" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6fddd4a-de7d-4262-8492-e73298196a0a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Hitachi's new voice control protocol</a> to interact with games if your controllers do start showing signs of drift, or maybe Nintendo will switch to Hall effect sticks at some point in the future (although that seems unlikely if you ask me).</p><figure role="group">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo has revealed the first variant Joy-Con controllers for the Switch 2 and they’re not as colorful as some might have hoped. Still mostly all graphite black, the new Joy-Con sport subtle lines of lily purple and mint green and arrive next month for $100.</p> <p>The new options ship on February 12, the same day as <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em>, though they don’t seem to have any obvious thematic overlap with the Switch 2 sports game or its colors. Like the existing orange and blue Joy-Con, the colors are limited to the inset around the thumbsticks and the sides where they connect magnetically to the console. For anyone playing in handheld mode, most of what’s “new” about these variants won’t even be visible most of the time.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">As you enjoy <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioTennisFever?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MarioTennisFever</a>, you’ll also have the opportunity to give your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch2</a> a new look! </p> <p>The first new colored Joy-Con 2 controllers—Light Purple and Light Green—also arrive Feb 12. </p> <p>Pre-purchase now: <a href="https://t.co/xoK6jsePMp">https://t.co/xoK6jsePMp</a> <a href="https://t.co/JoE8r4oOQl">pic.twitter.com/JoE8r4oOQl</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2009253320150425831?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Is it a big surprise that Nintendo is, at least for now, sticking with the more sophisticated, less whimsical sensibility of the existing Switch 2 Joy-Con? Not entirely. But it’s definitely a bit deflating for anyone who’s been waiting for something cool to come along before upgrading to a second pair of controllers. You’d get as much difference out of sticking different-colored nubs on the thumbsticks (which you should do anyway because the base ones are no good).</p>

 <p>The first year of the Switch 1 saw multiple new, full-color variants ship alongside games like <em>Arms</em> and <em>Splatoon 2</em>. They were bright, exciting, and fun. One of my favorite things from that console era is now having a drawer full of different colored Joy-Con that looks like someone dumped out a box of oversized crayons. Maybe we’ll get to those eventually. For now, fans will have to settle for “Joy-Con™ 2 (L)/(R) Light Purple / Light Green.”</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/">Amazon has – quite generously – dropped the price of the JBL Xtreme 3 speaker by 39%.</a> You can now pick it up for $200, after a whopping $130 discount. The offer applies to all three color options, including black, blue, and camo. The deal is open to all shoppers (both Prime and non-Prime members), but we’re expecting it to wrap up soon. If you’ve been looking for an option that lets you enjoy your favorite beats to the fullest, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keeps the Music Going All Night</h2>
<p>The JBL Xtreme 3 is a powerful, yet portable speaker. It comes with a detachable carrying strap that makes the speaker easy to take with you on the go, plus a built-in bottle opener for added convenience, especially when you’re partying in the great outdoors. The overall design is quite sturdy and can handle everyday wear and tear like a champ.</p>
<p>Sound-wise, it’s got four drivers and two JBL Bass Radiators that push deep, rich sound for all your tracks. You’ll also enjoy bold bass for energy-filled songs – the kind that makes everyone want to step on the dance floor and show off some cool moves. Whether you’re just using the speaker to listen to a podcast in your living room or for vibing to the latest Coldplay album, it delivers exceptionally well across all genres and audio types.</p>
<p>Additionally, Xtreme 3 is IP67 waterproof and dustproof, which means you can bring it anywhere without worry. Take it to the beach, by the pool, and even in the shower. Starting to rain in the backyard during a jamming session? That won’t be a problem, either. As for the battery life, it’s better than most options in this range. A single charge gets you up to 15 hours of playtime. That’s more than enough to keep the party going all night, and well into the next day! Plus, recharging doesn’t take forever, either, so even when you’re running low, the speaker should be back up in no time.</p>



<p>Connectivity-wise, the speaker can be paired with up to two smartphones or tablets at the same time. You can connect it to your phone and your friend’s, then easily take turns playing your favorite tracks. The PartyBoost feature deserves a mention, too, here. It allows you to pair two JBL PartyBoost-compatible speakers together for an even bigger, bolder sound when you want to entertain a larger crowd. Just ask a loved one to bring theirs, and have your own private concert with stereo sound at home!</p>
<p>Altogether, the JBL Xtreme 3 delivers powerful sound in a compact build. You will also enjoy a long battery life, plus incredible durability with its IP67 rating. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/">On a regular day, you’d pay around $330 to enjoy these features, but the current deal lets you pick the speaker up for just $200.</a> Discounts this good don’t last long, though. It’s best to get your orders in without wasting much time.</p>

                <p>The story of Max Caulfield and her best friend, Chloe Price, was a major part of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/life-is-strange-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-686438">Life is Strange</a>, and the pair are apparently about to reunite. The Pan-European Game Information has seemingly leaked the next game in the series, Life is Strange: Reunion, which looks to bring Max and Chloe back together for the first time in years.</p><p>In the original game, Max used her powers to rewind time to save Chloe's life, only to face a choice between saving her friend or saving their hometown. Chloe wasn't a featured character in the most recent game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure/" data-ref-id="5000-631969">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, but the PEGI rating for Reunion reveals that both of the game's heroines are facing some serious trials ahead.</p><p>"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield's partner in time," reads the game's description. "Losing her is Max's greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max's help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus."</p><p>The PEGI rating notes that most of the violence in the game is implied, and that there are some swear words. It also specifically notes a scene where the player's character has the option of accepting wine to drink before realizing that it was spiked with a hallucinogen.</p><p>Square Enix will release Life is Strange: Reunion on PS5 according to the rating, which doesn't mention PC or Xbox Series X|S. Presumably an official announcement of the game will be made soon.</p><p>Late last year, Prime Video ordered a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/life-is-strange-tv-series-officially-happening-after-9-years/1100-6534515/" data-ref-id="1100-6534515">Life is Strange TV series</a>.

<p>New balls, please</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has served up a five-minute <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> overview trailer, giving us our best look yet at the upcoming sports title.</p>
<p>The big focus right from the jump is the titular Fever Rackets, which grant special power-ups to your shots or movement. The trailer gives us another look at the Flame Shot and Ice Racket, but there's also the enemy-summoning Pokey Racket, the helping hand Shadow Racket, and the speedy Golden Dash Racket. Some of these can even deal damage to your opponent, because the one thing that tennis is really missing is <em>pain</em>.</p>
<p>But these Fever effects aren't the be-all and end-all. As explained in the new overview, if you can send the Fever ball back before it bounces, the effect will be sent back with it — gosh, <em>the tension</em>!</p>
<p>Those after something a little more standard can play in 'Classic Rules', removing the Fever Rackets and putting more focus on the new Slide and Leap shots.</p>
<p>We get a closer look at more of those teased 38 playable characters, too, with Goomba, Nabbit and Baby Waluigi getting some time in the spotlight, and those with a keen eye will also spot the likes of Dry Bones, Bowser Jr. and more.</p>
<p>As for game modes, there's Tournament, the challenge-based Trial Towers, and the Baby 'Adventure' mode that we saw in the initial reveal.</p>
<p>And yes, GameShare is also enabled in this one, so you can play with friends online even if they don't own a copy of the game.</p>
