			<p>Lords of the Fallen, the soulslike created by CI Games and Hexworks, is among the many hardcore action RPGs released in the past few years. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">Even with some critical flaws</a></strong>, the game managed to capture the attention of fans of the genre with a unique dual world setup and a <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"player first"</em> approach which became evident following the game's launch in September 2023. This approach led to the launch of multiple updates that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/"><strong>addressed many of the game's launch flaws and added a significant amount of new features.</strong></a></p>



<p>The development of <a href="https://www.lordsofthefallen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Lords of the Fallen II</strong></a> seems to be anchored to a similar respect. While adding new features on top of the foundation led by its predecessor, the new game will respect player's time by providing an overall better experience right from launch.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-gets-first-look-at-gameplay-in-new-trailer/">Following the gameplay reveal at this year's The Game Awards</a></strong>, we sat down with James Lowe, Game Director of Lords of the Fallen II, to discuss the sequel’s more brutal combat, the evolution of the Umbral realm, and the core philosophy guiding development this time around.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-brutality-of-dismemberment">The Brutality of Dismemberment</h3>



<p><strong>Q: The new feature that seems to define the game is the dismemberment system, which is a rare mechanic for a Soulslike. How did the idea for this system originally come about? </strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> The dismemberment system grew out of a desire to make combat feel more physical, more brutal, and more reactive to the player’s actions. We wanted enemies to visibly reflect the damage they’ve taken, rather than simply falling to the floor when dispatched. When we were exploring ways to push the game’s darker tone while also reinforcing combat viscerality, dismemberment felt like a natural extension. We want players to finish encounters, look back and see the limbs of their foes scattered across the landscape.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-more-invasive-umbral-realm"><strong>A More Invasive Umbral Realm</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Q: The new Umbral realm has been defined as "more sinister," and that it will "step into you." What does this thematically and mechanically mean for the player? </strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> Thematically, Umbral represents a much more invasive force this time around. It’s not simply a parallel world you observe, it’s something that actively intrudes on the player’s experience, reinforcing the sense that the world itself is hostile.</p>



<p>On the mechanical front, Umbral applies more constant pressure. It reacts more aggressively to player presence, influences combat and exploration more directly, and creates a heightened sense of tension the longer you remain within it. Visually, we’ve also pushed to ensure that Umbral feels distinct from Axiom in every region, with greater variation in mood, structure, and environmental storytelling.</p>



<h3 id="h-addressing-enemy-density-and-world-navigation"><strong>Addressing Enemy Density and World Navigation</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Q: One major piece of feedback from the original was that high enemy density often felt frustrating rather than challenging. How have you re-evaluated enemy placement and spawn logic? </strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> The feedback around enemy density was taken very seriously. Difficulty should come from intentional encounter design, not from overwhelming the player with sheer numbers or unavoidable ranged pressure. In <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lords of the Fallen II</em>, enemy placement and spawn logic have been reworked to emphasize clarity, spacing, and purpose. Encounters are designed around specific combat challenges... the result is difficulty that feels demanding but fair, and far less arbitrary.</p>



<p><strong>Q</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">: How has world design evolved to address concerns about confusing map layouts and navigation?</strong> </p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> World readability was a key focus for the sequel. Environmental landmarks, improved flow between areas, and more intuitive spatial logic all contribute to a world that still feels dense and mysterious, but far less confusing to navigate. And as a last resort if players are truly lost, we’re bringing back the Umbral Lamp guidance mechanic... which directs players to the next vestige.</p>

<h3 id="h-narrative-and-player-progression"><strong>Narrative and Player Progression</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Q: It has been said that the sequel will feature a "more accessible and character-driven" approach. How are you achieving this without sacrificing the deep lore the genre is known for? </strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> The narrative approach is more mission driven this time, which helps ground the story emotionally and provide clearer motivations for the player. However, we’ve been careful not to sacrifice the genre’s strengths. The aim is clarity without over-explanation, giving players stronger narrative anchors while still rewarding curiosity and interpretation.</p>



<p><strong>Q: The original was criticized for upgrade mechanics that disincentivized experimentation. How does the sequel tackle this? </strong></p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A</strong>: In the sequel, we’ve taken steps to reduce friction around upgrades and progression so that trying something new feels exciting rather than risky. The goal is to maintain meaningful choices while removing unnecessary barriers.</p>



<h3 id="h-technical-stability-and-post-launch-support"><strong>Technical Stability and Post-Launch Support</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Q</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">: Given the stuttering issues with some Unreal Engine 5 titles, what has been implemented to guarantee a smooth day one experience?</strong> </p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> Our experience launching one of the earliest UE5 titles gave us valuable insight... these learnings have informed how we approach optimisations in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lords of the Fallen II</em> from day one of production. We’re also working very closely with our partner, Epic, to proactively design around known constraints.</p>



<p><strong>Q: If you could distill all the learning from the community's feedback into one key principle that defines the development of Lords of the Fallen II, what would it be?</strong> </p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A:</strong> Respect the player’s time. That means clearer systems, stronger onboarding, great performance, and an overall experience that challenges as opposed to frustrates. Everything we’ve built in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lords of the Fallen II</em> is guided by that idea.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Thank yo</strong><strong>u</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> for your time!</strong></p>

              <p>Want a new pair of wireless headphones? One of our favorite picks by far is the Beats Solo 4. They have great sound, are extremely comfortable; and are easy to control and pair with your devices. Plus, since they’re on sale, they’re far more enticing right now at a lower price.</p>

<h2>Comfortable, stylish headphones with fantastic audio</h2>
<p>Immediately upon trying on the Beats Solo 4, you’ll recognize how comfortable they feel due to their lightweight design and soft padded ear cups.

The Bass is deep and punches, the Midrange is clear and defined and the Treble remains bright and crisp even when turned up high.

<p>The Beats Solo 4’s battery life is also quite good for wireless on-ear headphones and should give you plenty of time to listen to your favorite content for hours before needing a charge. In addition, once the battery is depleted, they recharge quickly, so you won’t need to spend too much time waiting for them to be ready again.</p>

They give you reliable connectivity if you’re on the iOS ecosystem, they fit well, and they’re comfortable to wear for long periods of time. If it matters to you, they’re also very stylish. Grab a pair while you still can now that the holidays are drawing to a close.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Virtual Reality Game]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/29/game-of-the-year-2025-best-virtual-reality-game/</link>
            <guid>1393639</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As we come up on a decade since virtual reality gaming launched to the masses, it’s hard to say that it’s really managed to burst out of its niche. Sure, there’s been hits like Beat Saber that have entered into the mainstream consciousness, and everybody know that Meta, PlayStation, Apple and others have headsets ready and waiting for them to buy, but VR gaming remains more of a passion project.</p>
<p>But passion projects are the ones that bring the greatest leaps ahead. It’s these games that continue to pioneer new ways to think about existing genres, where teams dedicate themselves to finding those little</p>



<p>On the surface, Reach looks like many other VR games with fairly generic visuals, but you really have to play it to appreciate what Dreams Elevation have done.&nbsp; A subset of nDreams, the team were set up to explore new ways of moving and interacting in VR, inventing subtle features and tricks that make traversing a VR world as smooth as butter.</p>
<p>“Reach raises the bar for VR gaming, and it’s a great reason to dust off your headset,” we said in our<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/12/reach-review-a-leap-ahead-for-vr-action-games/"> review&nbsp;</a>and that remains true, Reach is a VR game where you can parkour through vast caverns and fling yourself around like an acrobat without any motion sickness. Chaining together moves, including throwing your Captain America style shield,&nbsp; quickly becomes second nature and makes other VR games feel stilted and robotic.&nbsp; There were a few glitches at launch but these have been patched out, so you really should add Reach to your wishlist.</p>

<p><em>– Tuffcub</em></p>
<h3>The Midnight Walk – Runner Up</h3>
<p>The first and most immediately noticeable thing about The Midnight Walk is its beautifully terrifying art style. It’s hard not to be impressed by the artistry, using actual, real-life clay to make a stop-motion video game is already quite the achievement, but to have it look so damn good and work well in VR is remarkable. You might be a little too busy to marvel at how impressive things are though, as it’s absolutely bloody terrifying. From the dark, dingy environments to the truly horrifying monsters that are stalking you, it’s an incredibly creepy and unsettling aesthetic that the music and sound design matches, as well.</p>
<p>Whilst you’re desperately trying to stay away from unspeakable abominations, you’re also trying to bring warmth back into the world with the help of Potboy, an adorable – in a Tim Burton kind of way – lantern who can help light things up a little for you. It involves a lot of walking, but in VR and in this world that’s plenty to keep you entertained, especially since there are horrifying monsters stalking you. Some of the puzzles are particularly creative as well, sometimes even unique, as you’re wrapped up in a wordless narrative that builds up to its emotional conclusion. The Midnight Walk is&nbsp;a game that really demonstrates how much of a difference playing in VR can make.</p>
<p><em>– Gamoc</em></p>
<h3>Lumines Arise – Runner Up</h3>
<p>Tetsuya <span>Mizuguchi</span> has completed the circle of his synaesthetic gaming journey, reviving the block-dropping puzzle game of Lumines for a new generation. The PSP original was already an experimental blend of game, music and visuals, as your actions and progress fed new sounds and added layers to the ambient soundtrack, and Mizuguchi-san was able to explore them once more with Tetris Effect in 2018, able to take everything so much further thanks to the dawn of VR gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/11/lumines-arise-review-tick-follows-block-in-mizuguchis-latest-masterpiece/">Lumines Arise</a> takes the lessons learned from Tetris Effect and folds them back into Lumines’ framework, expanding on the series’ formula, bringing new life and energy with it, and in the process, crafting another genre-defining puzzle game. As with Tetris Effect, it’s a game that you really want to experience in VR if you possibly can.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Siege is back online, reports that this may not be a hack after all]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/29/rainbow-six-siege-hack-online-telegram-india/</link>
            <guid>1393636</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Rainbow Six Siege X is now back online after the servers were shut down for over two days while Ubisoft dealt with a massive security breach.&nbsp; In the evening of 26th December players began to notice billions of in-game currency being added to their accounts and super rare skins being dropping into their inventories. Other players were banned, and some were unbanned.</p>
<p>Ubisoft have now rolled back all the data so players should have the correct amount of in-game credit, known as Renown. They state that players may find themselves in a queue to get back in to the game.</p>


<p>The event has kicked off a war of words between various hacking groups who are claiming they are responsible, and also that one groups have stolen the source code for every Ubisoft game. These claims seem to be an exaggeration and probably not true.</p>
<p>However, there is evidence to suggest that Ubisoft were not hacked at all. It is reported that Ubisoft had outsourced helpdesk support to a company in India and that an employee there was bribed to give “Panel Access” to a third party. This then gave the third party access to user accounts, ban functions and other facilities. If this is true then Ubisoft were not hacked, it was bribery and human corruption that caused the issues.</p>
<p>It is also reported that another group is contacting people on Telegram claiming they have their personal details from hacking Ubisoft, and they are demanding money. This appears to be a scam and they have no connection to the group that breached the Rainbow Six servers. Ubisoft have, so far, not stated that any user data was breached.</p>

<p>Ubisoft overhauled the decade-old tactical shooter in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-going-free-to-play-and-brings-big-tech-improvements/">June of this year</a>, renaming it Rainbow Six Siege X, and added a whole host of technical improvements, as well as transitioning the game to a&nbsp;free-to-play model.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six is also one of three games<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/"> hived off to a separate Ubisoft company,</a> along with Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry.</p>

<p>We've had our eyes on this long-lost GBA-looking adventure ever since we first discovered it at Gamescom <a href="https://x.com/ZionDood/status/1826268852617126059">back in 2024</a>. The combat, movement, and visuals instantly reminded us of the handheld Zelda entries, but instead of a sword, the main protagonist uses a yoyo to dispatch foes and solve loads of puzzles. You've also got a spunky, blue bat protagonist that looks like they jumped straight out of the SNES era. What's not to love here?!</p>
<p>Pocket Trap's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a> comes to Switch this week, and to celebrate we linked up with the Game Director and Lead Programmer <strong>Henrique Lorenzi</strong> to ask some questions about his love for yoyos, Nintendo's games, and Yoko Shimomura.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:179410 @ 1767014037 -->

<p><strong>Nintendo Life: We played through the free demo you have on the Switch eShop, and we loved how</strong> <strong>versatile an item the yoyo is for Pippit! Do you remember when you had that lightbulb</strong> <strong>moment, when you knew you wanted to build a game around a yoyo?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Henrique Lorenzi:</strong> As game designers, we’ve found that one of the best ways to create enjoyable experiences is to take objects that the player is familiar with in the real world and transform them into gameplay mechanics. We’ve made it a habit to set up a board at the beginning of every project, where the entire team can participate by throwing in ideas. So we had a board full of images of ordinary objects like a hammer, a slingshot, a baseball bat, a hand saw, roller skates – you name it! The yoyo was special, though.</p>
<p>Not only could it be considered a 'cool kid’s' item, but the gameplay ideas involving it started pouring in non-stop! At that point, the lightbulb lit up, as you said – we realised this item would allow for a pretty extensive and deep game! We started sketching game screens, thinking about how the various challenges would play out – it was at this point that we also incorporated diagonals to the level design, which are places where the yoyo can bounce off of and help extend your range. Everything felt solid, and we were confident we had some great game-design possibilities in our hands!</p>

<p><strong>Did the yoyo start life as anything else originally, or did you always know you wanted the main weapon to be one?</strong></p>
<p>We knew we wanted to make some kind of a 'Zelda-like' game, but try to stray away from medieval fantasy themes. So we were looking for an item that could replace the sword in combat. After we stumbled upon the humble yoyo, we noticed a pretty strong point in its favour: differently to the usual approach of having the player juggle a wide range of items that each enable a certain action – like having weapons for combat, a boomerang for puzzle-solving, and special boots for wall-jumping and platforming –, the yoyo would be able to cover all of these use-cases on its own!</p>
<p>The player’s progression would be tied to the knowledge of particular yoyo tricks, so it perfectly translated the experience someone might have with the real thing. And regarding the game’s setting and themes, the yoyo provided a great opportunity to take everything into the contemporary era! So you’re a radical kid using your favourite toy in a modern-world city with modern-world problems. We had hit the perfect combo for the relatable experience we wanted to create!</p>
<p><strong>From the demo alone, we can see a lot of Nintendo’s DNA in Pipistrello. This really does look and feel like something that would have been released on the GBA! What games in particular do you feel the team drew inspiration from?</strong></p>
<p>I’m so glad you’ve noticed this! We’re longtime Nintendo fans, and everyone on the team has grown up playing Nintendo games. The Game Boy Advance really felt like peak handheld gaming back in the day, so we were excited at the possibility of bringing a nostalgic feeling to players familiar with it. We’ve even added an optional 3D Console mode to the game that simulates the experience of playing on a real GBA, including responsive buttons, an adjustable and rotatable camera, and – get this – even glare from the screen if you hold it at just the right position!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e5f334052a4bc"><a title="Pipistrello" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e5f334052a4bc/pipistrello.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Pocket Trap</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But of course, we didn’t want to just mimic the thing, but also modernise the gaming experience and make it appealing to new players as well: the physics engine has lots of quality-of-life improvements – such as coyote-time, corner-sliding, landing assist, and magnetic edges – and if you get a Game Over you can restart from the same screen without any downtime. One of our aspirations was perhaps to create a new source of joy that could be passed down through generations, just like Nintendo has.</p>
<p>Speaking of games that have inspired us, I’d say the most direct have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/legend_of_zelda_the_minish_cap">The Minish Cap</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/castlevania_aria_of_sorrow">Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</a>, but we also took a page from older and newer games alike – from the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> on the NES, to the latest entries like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the world map and exploration? Will there be interconnected areas like in a Metroidvania, or will there be sections that have a start and a finish, much like a Zelda dungeon?</strong></p>
<p>There’s a bit of everything in Pipistrello! The navigation around the city is completely interconnected, with branching and merging paths. The city map is fully filled in and massive, so you can bet there will be something interesting no matter what direction you go in, and on top of everything, it’s teeming with secrets! Did I mention we also have a second layer to the entire city? Players can drop below to the sewers level and explore even more sprawling environments – something akin to the Dark World or the Depths!</p>
<p>Beyond that, once you reach a dungeon or mini-dungeon, the experience becomes more like a classic Zelda – strongly thematic and narrative-driven experiences which emphasise one or more specific game mechanics. Remember we kept our themes contemporary, so our dungeons take place in a police department, a shopping mall, a skyscraper mid-construction, a pop-culture convention, a sports stadium, and more! I think players will have a blast unravelling each location’s lore and secrets.</p>

<p><strong>We had a blast with the demo, but we found the Don Mauretti boss fight particularly challenging! We liked how theoretically you could defeat him with simple yoyo strikes, but you could deal more damage by bouncing the yoyo off walls. Will the game have any sort of difficulty options, and on a scale of 1 to 10, how tough do you think he is in comparison to other bosses in the game?</strong></p>
<p>It does feel way more challenging in the demo! That fight has been tailored for players with many hours of experience in the game, and we didn’t want to nerf the boss for the demo and risk losing the interesting bits. We offer three scenarios in the demo so that players can have a taste of different parts of the game, but these scenarios aren’t consecutive in the full game at all. At the point you go against Don Mauretti in the full game, the player will have access to many Badges and Upgrades, not to mention Charged and Special Moves such as the Parry and the Flurry Attack – all things that the full game introduces at an appropriate pace, providing detailed explanations and training areas to practice – so we’re confident the player will have the ability and the tools necessary to overcome these fights! The game’s progression is not linear, so a player can even explore other city districts and fight other bosses before going into Don Mauretti’s turf.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the game also offers several difficulty settings, which allow the player to fine-tune the gameplay experience to suit their tastes, both to the easier side as well as the harder side. We’d say Don Mauretti is about a 7 or 8 on the difficulty scale, and the four main bosses have all been designed to display a similar level of challenge. These four main bosses serve as the final trial on the player’s mastery journey throughout each city district and dungeon, so each one offers something different in terms of required skills and fight dynamics. But don’t forget there are still other bosses and mini-bosses (and secret bosses!) for the player to track down and fight!</p>
<p><strong>We also noticed some issues with the frame rate dropping pretty substantially in the final section of the Don boss fight (we were playing in handheld mode.) Do you hope to have those issues worked out for the full launch on Switch?</strong></p>
<p>After the demo launched, we’ve gone through extensive optimisation passes on the Nintendo Switch. We’re so sorry about your previous experience! Now I can say that all areas of the game run perfectly smoothly, including the boss fight you mentioned, no matter if you’re playing it docked or handheld! The Nintendo Switch is a priority of ours, and we’ve put a lot of work into it, with things like HD Rumble support tailored for each action Pippit can take. We believe it’s one of the best platforms to enjoy the game on! The updated demo should be available shortly on the Nintendo eShop, so you don’t have to just take my word for it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c1e9959f1db1d"><a title="Pipistrello" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c1e9959f1db1d/pipistrello.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Pocket Trap</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>We took a look through the developer credits and we noticed you have Yoko Shimomura on the team composing the soundtrack! Whoa! Can you talk about the process of pitching the game to her and what it’s been like working with her?</strong></p>
<p>Having grown up with Nintendo games, we’ve naturally grown up attached to Yoko Shimomura’s work as well! With our idea to develop a GBA-inspired game, who else would be most suited to bring on board if not her? We felt that, taking into account her work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_rpg_legend_of_the_seven_stars">Super Mario RPG</a> and the <strong>Mario &amp; Luigi</strong> series, and especially <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mario_and_luigi_superstar_saga">Superstar Saga</a> on the GBA, she could bring unmatched authenticity to Pipistrello’s retro design aesthetic, and it could result in the game being elevated even more towards that Nintendo standard we were seeking. Naturally, it was kind of nerve-wracking contacting a world-class composer like her for the first time! We didn’t know if she’d even agree to working with us.</p>
<p>We knew she could have a very tight schedule, so we made sure to pitch this to her very early on – we sent out the first email one whole year before production actually started! (Maybe that was an excessively long time? But it pays to think in advance!) Much to our surprise, she was very open to the idea! We sent her full documents describing the game and the setting, along with screenshots and videos of the areas she’d be composing for, as well as some musical references (some of them her own songs!)</p>
<p>I imagine it must have been quite a surprise to her that we weren’t looking for a full orchestral sound, but we actually asked for the production to take a step back and embrace the GBA era! So she employed some of those vintage Roland Sound Canvas synthesisers used back in the day, for a real throwback. We were extremely happy with the experience, and will most definitely be looking to repeat this partnership in the future! I hope players will keep an ear out while playing the game!</p>
<p><strong>Finally, we have to know...does anyone on the development team know any rad, real-world yoyo tricks? Bonus points if they can prove it!</strong></p>
<p>As kids, we had a lot of contact with toy yoyos, and companies were even packaging them with snacks and soda. But that’s hardly anything that allows us to be considered enthusiasts, let alone professionals at the yoyo.</p>

<p>That said, we did actually go deep into research while developing Pipistrello, watching yoyo competition videos, learning the theory behind a multitude of tricks, and speaking with people who know this topic way better than us!</p>
<p>Some people on the team obtained professional yoyos during development to aid in the creative process (and played around with them for a bit), and one of us actually has more experience with the diabolo, a related apparatus. All in all, though, I think becoming a yoyo champion is a fantasy best left to Pippit at this point, haha!</p>

			<p>While opinions may vary on how Monster Hunter Wilds evolves the series' signature formula and gameplay, there's no denying that the game's performance on PC and consoles isn't where it should be. <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/" target="_blank"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Title Update 4 is a step in the right direction for sure</strong></a>, but more work is needed besides&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/" target="_blank"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the over 100 performance improvements introduced</strong></a>&nbsp;to finally address what is, sti</span>ll today, one of the game's biggest issues, if not the biggest.</p>



<p>Besides working on improving Monster Hunter Wilds' performance, however, some datamined information suggests that CAPCOM could be working on something else as well: <strong>a Nintendo Switch 2 port of the game.</strong></p>



<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/"><strong>Monster Hunter Leaks subreddit</strong></a>, some dedicated users took a good look at the aforementioned Title Update 4, discovering some information on the potential arrival of <strong>Tempered Gogmazios</strong> and additional content in the future. The most interesting discovery, however, is the addition of some platform information mentioning a <strong>"nsw2UpgradeEdition"</strong>, possibly referencing a Nintendo Switch 2 release for the game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Considering how Monster Hunter Wilds runs on PC and consoles, the community's reaction didn't disappoint. <span><em>"Game barely runs on PC properly, and they expect it to port to Switch 2?"</em>&nbsp;said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1pxx67z/comment/nwe8ta9/"><strong>Ayyzeee</strong></a> on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/"><strong>Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</strong></a>, echoing what most of the community thinks about this port, which looks more impossible than the solid <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/"><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</strong></a> Nintendo Switch 2 ports.</span> </p>



<p><em>"The Steam Deck can barely run this as is, and now we have a SW2 port? </em><span><em>Good luck,"</em>&nbsp;said <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149415472">Kindekuma on the ResetERA forums</a></strong>, further highlighting how the community doesn't think bringing Monster Hunter Wilds to Nintendo Switch 2 is the b</span>est idea.</p>



<p>Other users didn't miss the chance to joke on what could be expected out of this Nintendo Switch 2 port. <em>"Now at a blistering 480p/20fps"</em>, <em>"Are they going to upscale 160 × 144px to 1080p?"</em> said ResetERA users <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149414158">Mars People</a></strong> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149415184"><strong>Melhadf.</strong></a> <em>"Potato Mode"</em> is also a recurring joke, as highlighted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-tu4-datamine-has-references-to-switch-2.1393483/post-149419351"><strong>Dale Copper's image</strong></a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Monster-Hunter-Wilds-Nintendo-Switch-2-potato-mode.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>This is the level of visual fidelity the community expects in the potential Monster Hunter Wilds Nintendo Switch 2 port</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Jokes aside, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">how possible is a Monster Hunter Wilds Nintendo Switch 2 port?</strong> As the Nintendo console already proved to be a more than capable system with some <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">excellent multiplatform ports</a></strong>, there's no denying that getting the latest entry in the series to run properly on the system can be a challenge. </p>



<p>Currently, the Steam Deck struggles to run the game properly, even with aggressive upscaling, so the game would require significant optimization for the system to achieve a stable 30 FPS. Still, as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-impress-rog-ally-x-comparison/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 supports NVIDIA DLSS</strong></a>, this port could be surprisingly good, especially if performance continues to improve on other platforms as well.</p>



<p>Besides performance, which continues to remain a significant issue, Monster Hunter Wilds also suffered from a very low challenge level. This issue, thankfully, was addressed by the game's post-launch updates, <span>to the extent that the game's director, Yuya Takuda, hopes&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/" target="_blank"><strong>lapsed players will return to the game</strong></a>, which, in my opinion,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank"><strong>still deserves to be played</strong></a>, despite</span> its issues.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Year In Review: Was 2025 The Year of The Extraction Shooter?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/2025-year-of-the-extraction-shooter/</link>
            <guid>1393624</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the wide world of gaming, few genres embody the risk and reward loop as starkly as the extraction shooter. It’s a genre constructed around the concepts of triumph and devastation, with these games demanding mechanical skill and psychological resilience. In 2025, extraction shooters blew up all over again, but can we honestly say that the genre <strong>took over </strong>this year?</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the stock of extraction shooters released in 2025 and determine if this really was the year of the extraction genre.</p>











<p>Typically, extraction shooters are unwelcoming titles that thrive on punishing mechanics. The likes of Escape from Tarkov have kept the genre from entering the mainstream too much, boasting complex mechanics, no guidance systems, and combat that can see you gunned down by a single shot.</p>



<p>But in 2025, extraction shooters became <strong>much more accessible</strong>.</p>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite launched on Steam and allowed players to access a free Tarkov alternative with some more forgiving mechanics. Escape from Duckov emerged as a single-player, satirical take on Tarkov, and it was equal parts adorable and relatively easy.</p>



<p>And let’s not forget the breakout extraction adventure of 2025, ARC Raiders. Embark Studios’ second title was praised for its organic community-driven growth rather than corporate hype and punishing gameplay loops.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-surge-of-shooters">A Surge of Shooters</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>In 2025, a sheer surge of extraction titles was released or updated with fresh content and upgrades. Everything from Gray Zone Warfare to Zero Sievert, and from The Forever Winter to Escape from Tarkov had a limelight moment in 2025, allowing for untold exposure across the industry to these challenging titles.</p>



<p>And we’re not done yet, as there are more to hit the market, such as Bungie’s Marathon.</p>



<p>This abundance of extraction shooter goodness created something of a paradox. The slew of extraction shooters meant that fans had more than ever to enjoy, but the saturation came thick and fast, potentially running the risk of diluting what it means to be this tougher-than-average title feeding a niche market.</p>



<p>It seemed that every developer was at least <strong>considering </strong>the extraction shooter model in some way.</p>



<p>Extraction shooters in 2025 were so much bigger than just <strong>games</strong>. Titles like ARC Raiders proved to be monumental things that got everyone buzzing about something <strong>new</strong> and <strong>energetic</strong>. This year, streamers and content creators <strong>blew up </strong>alongside the biggest extraction titles, and it’s not every genre that can do that.</p>



<p>It was also the year that developers started playing with the concept of the extraction shooter, seeing how far they could push the envelope. That’s partly why Embark Studios made an extraction <strong>adventure </strong>game and not an extraction shooter specifically.</p>







<p>It depends on your perspective, but it’s easy to claim that 2025 <strong>was </strong>the year of the extraction shooter. From the sheer number of releases to the records set and broken by the most popular launches, the extraction vertical was a smash hit in 2025.</p>



<p>Many of the genre’s most capable purists have voiced their concerns about too many casual extraction shooters potentially tuning down the genre, but they’re shouting into the void mostly. If this isn’t the year of the extraction shooter, then it’s certainly the year that the genre evolved.</p>



<p>It’s a transformation that could either strengthen or weaken extraction shooters, depending on how you look at it.</p>



<p>This was a landmark year, either way. In 2025, extraction shooters became household names, and in terms of viewers, creators, and streamers, these games positively soared. </p>

<p>Could an upgrade be on the way?</p>

<figure data-uuid="669da210f13f6"><a title="Pikmin 3 Deluxe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/669da210f13f6/pikmin-3-deluxe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the Switch 2 generation got underway, many Nintendo fans have been hoping for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a> titles to receive a next-generation upgrade. Now, in an interesting development, a Switch 2 rating has surfaced on the European age rating board PEGI for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a>.</p>
<p>This rating was apparently filed by 'Nintendo of Europe SE' on 28th December 2025 (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/pikmin-3-deluxe-rated-for-switch-2-in-europe">thanks, Gematsu</a>). It's 'PEGI 3' (the same classification as the Switch game listed), contains "occasional, very mild violence in a comical or abstract context" and is suitable for all ages.</p>
<p>The same brief outline of the game is also attached to this rating, but no other significant details have been shared.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In Pikmin 3 Deluxe, players take command of three explorers and a legion of adorable Pikmin in a fight for survival. By employing the unique abilities of these tiny Pikmin creatures, players will solve puzzles, battle dangerous predators and recover food needed to save the explorers' depleted home planet."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a> made its debut in 2020 and follows the original Wii U entry from 2013. The Switch version of the game received a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/pikmin-3-deluxes-new-update-fixes-screen-flicker-issue-when-playing-on-switch-2">small update in June of this year</a>, improving the gameplay experience on Switch 2, but there has been no upgrade for the title so far. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> also received a free content update in November, adding new content and new modes.</p>
<p>Nintendo has previously released free and paid Switch 2 upgrades for existing Switch titles. This included <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/12-free-switch-2-game-upgrades-are-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">12 free Switch game updates</a> when the new hybrid system launched in June.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Konami want to release one Silent Hill game every year]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/28/konami-want-to-release-one-silent-hill-game-every-year/</link>
            <guid>1393495</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Konami’s Motoi Okamoto, producer of the Silent Hill franchise, has said that the company hopes to release a Silent Hill game every year.</p>
<p>“Following the release of&nbsp;Silent Hill 2&nbsp;in October 2024, we were able to deliverSilent Hill f &nbsp;​​in September 2025, and the Silent Hill series is now back on track,” said Okamoto (via Google Translate). “We aim to release about one title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles. We’re not sure how far we can achieve this, but we’ll do our best as the producer of the Silent Hill series. Ideally, we’d like to keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant. We’ll do our best to provide you with new updates, so we hope you’ll wait a little longer.”</p>


<p>The announced games are <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/19/silent-hill-townfall-is-in-development-by-no-code/">Silent Hill Townfall,</a> which is in development at No Code, and a remake of the original Silent Hill by Bloober Team is also in the works. There’s also the new Silent Hill film that was meant to be out in 2025, but that seems rather unlikely now.&nbsp; Bloober Team announced the remake of the first Silent Hill game in June 2025 and at the time said they had been working on for three years. Quite why Konami remade <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2</a> first is a bit odd, but they must have had their reasons.</p>
<p>It seems that Konami are going to farm out the Silent Hill IP to different development teams to create games, so they may not all be in the classic Silent Hill mould.</p>

<p>Nick loved Silent Hill f and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/22/silent-hill-f-review/">gave it 10/10 in his review.</a> “Silent Hill f isn’t just a return to form, it’s a landmark entry in the series. Konami. NeoBards and Ryukishi07 have knocked it out of the park. For me, this isn’t just Game of the Year material, it’s an integral piece of Silent Hill history.”</p>

		<p>This story has an update <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/29/rainbow-six-siege-hack-online-telegram-india/">which you can read here.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>…..</p>


<p>The servers for Rainbow Six Siege X have been offline for over twenty-four hours after hackers managed to get into the hardware, gifting billions of in-game currency and unbanning players.&nbsp; The<a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status"> official Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp; server status page</a> is rather coyly calling this an “unplanned outage”.</p>
<p>The issues began late on the 26th December when players started noticing billions of currency, known as Renown, dropping into their accounts. Ubisoft’s anti-cheat software then started suspending accounts. Others found strange messages appearing on the side of the screen, or super-rare skins in their inventory.</p>


<p>Ubisoft have shut down all servers for all platforms and have posted a couple of updates. Firstly they say that no one will be banned if they managed to spend any of the credits they received, but a rollback of accounts is in progress to remove the pirate treasure.&nbsp; They also say the ban ticker that was turned off in an old update had been reinstated, but will now be removed again, and “an official R6 ShieldGuard ban wave did occur, but it is not related to this incident.”</p>
<p>“A rollback is currently ongoing and afterwards, extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes,”&nbsp;posted Ubisoft on X&nbsp; “The team is focused on getting players back into the game as quickly as possible. Please know that this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed. We will provide another update as soon as we know more.”</p>
<p>Ubisoft overhauled the decade-old tactical shooter in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-going-free-to-play-and-brings-big-tech-improvements/">June of this year</a>, renaming it Rainbow Six Siege X, and added a whole host of technical improvements, as well as transitioning the game to a&nbsp;free-to-play model.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six is also one of three games<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/"> hived off to a separate Ubisoft company,</a> along with Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Hack is Reportedly ‘Blown Way Out of Proportion’, Say Sources]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-hack-false/</link>
            <guid>1393474</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A recent slew of claims about a series of hacks and breaches at Ubisoft have been blown way out of proportion, according to people familiar with the events that have unfolded over the past couple of days.</p>







<p>Various rumours and claims of a Ubisoft breach began after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-hack-servers-shut-down-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company shut down Rainbow Six Siege servers</a> following a hacker who gifted players a combined $339,960,000,000,000 in in-game currency. According to sources familiar with the breach, Ubisoft intends to perform a rollback to undo this change.</p>



<h2 id="h-multiple-breaches-at-ubisoft">Multiple Breaches at Ubisoft</h2>



<p>However, the Rainbow Six Siege breach wasn’t the only hack that Ubisoft suffered. According to other groups of hackers (and has subsequently been circulating online), Ubisoft suffered a massive breach with some 900GB of data compromised. Allegedly, the data included source code, internal tools, and development materials of Ubisoft’s upcoming and previous games.</p>



<p>It now seems that these claims were, in fact, untrue. The group with such claims haven’t been able to provide any evidence of the alleged breach.</p>



<p>Sources within Ubisoft have told Insider Gaming that the company’s security team have been made aware of some breaches earlier this year following leaks surrounding projects such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-multiplayer-shooter-project-scout-rumor-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Scout’</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since-cancelled Far Cry game</a> codenamed ‘Talisker’.</p>



<p>Another group that claimed to have breached user information has since backtracked, saying that it was false.</p>



<p>According to sources familiar with some of the groups who alleged such breaches, they say that the hacks were “blown way out of proportion” and some individuals “just wanted clout” from the hack that made headlines.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment, but has not received a response due to the holidays. Should we receive one, we will update this report.</p>

              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Epic has spent the past few years trying as hard as it can to will the Fortnite metaverse into being--and now, at the end of 2025, it's actually starting to look like it's getting there. Things are still very messy, but Epic's moves in that direction--which frequently seem to involve trying random things just to see what happens--may have finally borne fruit.</p><p dir="ltr">Back at the end of 2023, Fortnite attempted to usher in its metaverse in earnest by launching Fortnite Festival, Rocket Racing, and Lego Fortnite all at once. It didn't quite work, because all three were half-baked and missing key features. The only way to play Racing was in Ranked, Festival lacked instrument support and still doesn't have a practice mode, and Lego Fortnite had the feel of a generic early-access survival game wearing Lego clothing.</p><p dir="ltr">Two years later, we've got a much prettier picture, but not because Epic went all in on those modes. Instead, Epic has simply kept churning out new modes, some of which have done consistently. Likewise, Fortnite Creative has produced its first blockbuster map with any staying power. Thanks to some key legal victories, Fortnite is once again available on mobile devices in most places, which has dramatically increased the game's potential footprint. And the new cosmetic types added in the past year have proven a lot more popular than the cars and musical instruments that were introduced in Chapter 5.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot happened in Fortnite during the past year. To make it all a little easier to digest, let's go through the biggest developments one by one.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625135-brainrottttt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625135" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625135-brainrottttt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625135"></a><figcaption>Brainrot is taking over Fortnite.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625135-brainrottttt.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Rise of the Brainrots</h2><p dir="ltr">The Creative part of Fortnite got its first genuine blockbuster in 2025 with Steal the Brainrot, a licensed clone of one of Roblox's most popular modes. Steal the Brainrot was an instant success in Fortnite, and it consistently averages enough concurrent players that it can compete with Epic's battle royale modes. Now, Epic is planning to capitalize on Brainrot's success by allowing creators using the Unreal Editor for Fortnite to add <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-creative-may-be-going-pay-to-win-soon/1100-6536230/" data-ref-id="1100-6536230">V-Bucks transactions to their islands</a>, something the Roblox version of the Brainrot game has that Fortnite's currently does not.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the success of this mode means Epic has decided to use it as a focus in its marketing for Fortnite as a whole, as well as promoting it generally by placing it in the in-game news feed. That's proven to be incredibly off-putting for folks who aren't interested in that mode--which is pretty much everyone who doesn't already play it.</p><p dir="ltr">With the Brainrots apparently here to stay, there's reason to worry that Fortnite might soon be flooded with this sort of goofy nonsense aimed entirely at children. Epic has already made it unnecessarily difficult for folks who just want to play BR to sift through all the Creative islands and other modes they don't care about in Fortnite's messy Discover tab.</p><p dir="ltr">The problem is that Fortnite does not offer any way to tailor your Discover tab at all except favoriting modes and maps that you like. You can't, for example, tell it that you're not interested in Steal the Brainrot, so there's no way to escape the noise or pretend it doesn't exist because Epic is constantly promoting it to you. It's not fun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625136-fortniteogwherewedroppin.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625136" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625136-fortniteogwherewedroppin.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625136"></a><figcaption>Fortnite OG, Reload, Blitz, and Delulu are all here to stay, apparently.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625136-fortniteogwherewedroppin.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">The fracturing of battle royale</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortnite added several new battle royale spinoff modes in the past year, starting with the permanent OG mode that has been revisiting Chapter 1. In addition to more or less recreating the game as it existed seven years ago, this mode even got its own new battle pass, the OG pass, for each of its seasons.</p><p dir="ltr">Then we had Blitz Royale, which arrived during the summer with a focus on mobile players, thanks to its short matches on a small island. Epic has done tons of fine-tuning on Blitz Royale since it launched, trying all sorts of novel mechanics, like granting all players a super-powered medallion to start a match--though since the beginning of November, Blitz is more like a tiny version of standard Battle Royale, without as many gimmicks. But Blitz has changed so frequently that it's never had a real status quo--which is a great way to keep players' interest.</p><p dir="ltr">Epic followed that up with Delulu, a weekends-only mode with proximity voice chat that allows players to form impromptu teams--and then betray each other if they want to.</p><p dir="ltr">Somehow, these new modes--alongside Reload, OG, and regular Battle Royale--have all managed to maintain healthy populations at the same time. They absolutely do cannibalize each other a bit, but not so much that it affects matchmaking in any particular mode for most folks. It's tough to imagine that Epic could get away with any more new BR modes without a bump to Fortnite's overall population, but Epic clearly knows this too--that's probably why Delulu is only available on the weekends.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625137-fortnitedaftpunkkk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625137-fortnitedaftpunkkk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625137"></a><figcaption>Fortnite got really into releasing new music skins this year.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625137-fortnitedaftpunkkk.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Going all in on celebs</h2><p dir="ltr">Being a rhythm game, Fortnite Festival was never going to pull hundreds of thousands of concurrent users over the long term in the way Battle Royale does. These days, the mode has a small but dedicated playerbase, but the cosmetics associated with the mode--skins of pop stars in the item shop and the seasonal music passes--have clearly been a big success for Epic, because the company has been doing a lot more of those types of collabs in general this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Just in the past few months, Fortnite has introduced new collaborations with five musical artists (Deadmau5, Daft Punk, Doja Cat, Tyler the Creator, and Playboi Carti) that were not Festival headliners, and then Epic punctuated its newly ramped-up celeb obsession by adding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kim-kardashian-is-coming-to-fortnite-this-week/1100-6536858/" data-ref-id="1100-6536858">Kim Kardashian</a> in December. Considering how popular these celebrity and popstar skins have been lately--it feels like we've been battling Sabrina Carpenters nonstop in BR this year--you can probably expect even more crossovers of this type in 2026.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625140-fortniteptets2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625140" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625140-fortniteptets2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625140"></a><figcaption>Fortnite will sell you in-game pets now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625140-fortniteptets2.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">New virtual toys to spend money on</h2><p dir="ltr">Epic Games has been gradually introducing new types of cosmetics over the last couple of years. Back in Chapter 5, it added cars, musical instruments, and various Lego things. Kicks popped up just before the start of Chapter 6 a year ago, and in 2025, we got sidekicks--essentially pets who follow us around and get excited when we perform certain in-game actions. While the new Chapter 5 cosmetics struggled so much out of the gate that Epic had to lower some of their prices--it turned out that 4,000 V-Bucks was kind of a lot for a Fortnite car--kicks seem to have done well, and sidekicks are a definite hit.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, there's been plenty of grumbling about both of the most recently added new cosmetic types--folks who aren't sneakerheads tend to scoff at kicks, and there was a lot of frustration that you can only customize your sidekick's appearance once before it locks permanently. But folks are buying them nonetheless. It's rare that I have a teammate who doesn't have a pet dog or cat (or chicken) following them around.</p><p dir="ltr">And speaking personally, as somebody who's been playing for years and has tons of skins, I like being able to branch out with new stuff. I really don't need more skins at this point, but having Itchy from The Simpsons follow me around and celebrate my kills is delightful.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625141-darth-vader-fortnite-1920x1080-95ea0f1d91f3%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625141" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625141-darth-vader-fortnite-1920x1080-95ea0f1d91f3%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625141"></a><figcaption>Fortnite let us have some uncanny conversations with Darth Vader in May.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625141-darth-vader-fortnite-1920x1080-95ea0f1d91f3%281%29.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">The AI slop is coming?</h2><p dir="ltr">While Fortnite is not currently any sort of wasteland of AI nonsense, the first red flags popped up this year. Epic's most notable AI-driven creation was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-ai-darth-vader-in-fortnite/1100-6531612/" data-ref-id="1100-6531612">Darth Vader NPC in Battle Royale</a> during the Star Wars mini-season in May, who could respond dynamically, in the voice of the late James Earl Jones, to things players said to him. It was definitely weird, but at least it was something that might have been impractical to try <em>without</em> AI.</p><p dir="ltr">Other apparent AI things have begun popping up here and there within Fortnite since then. Epic gave out a free jam track in October that had <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=20816" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AI-generated cover art featuring Hatsune Miku</a>--even though the track had nothing to do with Miku. There are some pieces of art in the game in Chapter 7 that have commonly been accused of being AI-generated, like a poster of a Yeti in a hammock in which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1pahvnv/is_this_chapter_7_art_ai_generated/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one of his feet has five toes while the other has four</a>. And <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=20956" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an emote</a> on Lisa's music pass uses a licensed 2025 song so obscure that nobody even knows who made it--and it sounds very much like it's AI-generated. Oh, and those Brainrots? All of those are AI-generated meme designs from the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2025/09/19/robloxs-italian-brainrot-trend-explained/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Italian Brainrot trend</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">To be honest, all of that really doesn't add up to very much. But when you take those things alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-disclosures-make-no-sense-for-game-stores-tim-sweeney-says/1100-6536526/" data-ref-id="1100-6536526">recent comments from Epic CEO Tim Sweeney</a>--in which he said it's absurd for Steam to require disclosure if AI-generated content is used in a game's development because AI will soon be involved in all dev work--there's certainly some reason to worry that Epic might be planning to unleash the slop in its never-ending pursuit of the children who play Roblox.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch Online is the premium subscription service available for Switch and Switch 2 users to try. Unlike PlayStation’s PS Plus and Xbox’s Game Pass, which provide access to a library of current-gen and previous-gen games, NSO gives players access to a range of classic games from previous Nintendo platforms.</p>



<p>If you combine Nintendo Switch Online with the Expansion Pack, then players can get access to a library of games from almost all classic Nintendo consoles, including NES, SNES, Game Boy, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, SEGA Genesis, and Nintendo GameCube games. </p>



<p>In 2025, NSO members had access to some top-tier classic games through Nintendo Switch Online, including hits from popular franchises like Zelda, Mario, and more. Check out Insider Gaming’s top 10 picks of Nintendo Switch Online games that you need to try out in 2025:</p>



<h2 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are a Nintendo Switch Online user in 2025 and haven’t played The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, then you are missing out. What’s more, it is the highest-rated game of all time on Metacritic. Do you need any more convincing after that? It was the first 3D Legend of Zelda game, making Hyrule more alive than ever before thanks to environmental storytelling, a good mix of exploration, puzzles, and combat, and memorable characters. </p>



<h2 id="h-super-metroid">Super Metroid</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Super Metroid is a 1994 SNES game that was the third installment in the series. It saw Samus Aran face off against Space Pirates in her quest to recover the last Metroid. Super Metroid is a fantastic 2D side-scrolling action adventure, where you explore large areas while being able to run, jump, crouch, and fire in different directions. The game also features other types of power-ups that can enhance Samus’ arsenal or grant special abilities. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-windwaker">The Legend of Zelda: Windwaker</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion members received the original GameCube version of The Legend of Windwaker for the Switch 2 in 2025. Wind Waker was released in 2002 and brought a significant change to the series, with the developers exploring a brand-new art style. Additionally, the game also had Link visiting clusters of islands across the Great Sea, where he used a sailboat called King of Red Lions to navigate through</p>



<h2 id="h-super-mario-world">Super Mario World</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Super Mario World is another classic hit that Nintendo Switch Online players shouldn’t miss out on in 2025. The title was released in 1991 for the SNES and quickly became a fan favorite. Though most of it was similar to the series, the game came with a new gameplay feature that would become iconic to the series. The feature in question is Yoshi, the rideable dinosaur who could walk faster, eat enemies, and spit them like projectiles. Super Mario World is also the best-selling SNES game. </p>



<h2 id="h-f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>F-Zero is a classic racing game set in a futuristic world. The game is similar to previous titles in the F-Zero series; however, what makes it unique is the introduction of a story mode where players can complete 9 chapters as Captain Falcon. The game features a variety of tracks with tubes, jumps, and roller coaster-like paths. There are also a variety of machines in the game, each behaving differently. </p>



<h2 id="h-fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is an installment that is separate from the continuity of other games. It is set in the fictional continent of Magvel, where two royal siblings fight to keep hostile sources from invading their kingdom. The title is a tactical RPG featuring turn-based combat, with players battling allied, player-controlled, and enemy units. Each unit has the ability to evolve through experience points; however, it also features a perma-death system, where if a unit dies, it can’t return for the rest of the campaign unless the player restarts the game. </p>



<h2 id="h-goldeneye-007">GoldenEye 007</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you have ever been a fan of the James Bond series and wish to try a classic FPS title, then you can’t go wrong with GoldenEye 007. It is based on the 1995 film, in which you play the iconic MI6 agent James Bond, facing a criminal syndicate that plans to deploy a satellite weapon. The game was originally going to be a side-scroller for the SNES, but ended up becoming a first-person shooter inspired by games like Doom, released for the Nintendo 64, and became the third-best-selling game on the platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-rayman-2-the-great-escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Rayman 2: The Great Escape was a special installment in the series, as it marked the move from 2D to 3D. Just like others, it is a platformer released for the Nintendo 64 in 1999, where players run through linear sequences, battle robotic pirates, collect lums, and solve puzzles. The primary weapon in the game is Rayman’s fists, and as you progress, the game gives you more abilities with charged attacks, ranged attacks, and more traversal methods being added to the player’s arsenal.</p>



<h2 id="h-golden-sun">Golden Sun</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Golden Sun is a fantasy RPG that was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2001, and it eventually received two more installments over the years. The game has you playing four characters as you embark on a quest to protect the world from a destructive force called Alchemy. The title features several interesting characters to interact with, monsters to fight, and new abilities and equipment to acquire. </p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-64">Mario Kart 64</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mario Kart 64 is a cart-racing game and the second installment in the series. It was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 and eventually became the second-best-selling game on the platform. The gameplay is broadly similar to other games in the series, where you choose one of 8 Mario franchise characters to race across the game’s 20 courses inspired by areas in Super Mario games. Players also get special abilities and power-ups that are unique to the Super Mario series. </p>

The Power Glove was ambitious, impressive, even important — one of the very first mainstream devices that let you control a game using your body instead of just your thumbs — but it was not good. In some ways, its not-good-ness is a key part of the story.</p><p>The Power Glove showed up in the late 1980s, at a complicated time for the gaming industry, when Nintendo was a hugely powerful force for the future of fun. But the Power Glove wasn’t really even a Nintendo product. It started as a research lark, became a toy, and only wound up with Nintendo’s name on it after a particularly fateful pitch meeting. Thanks to a remarkable marketing campaign, and the feeling that VR often gives of simply being <em>the future</em>, the Power Glove wound up a reasonable (if brief) business success. And you can draw a line from the Glove to some other hugely successful Nintendo products — and maybe even to the whole VR industry as we know it.</p><p>On <a href="https://pod.link/1840983742">this episode of <em>Version History</em></a>, our chat show about old technology, we dig into the story of the Power Glove. It is, somehow, both very brief and very long. David Pierce, <em><a href="http://www.fandom.com/">Fandom’</a></em>s Chris Grant, and <em><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File</a></em>’s Stephen Totilo explore the projects that led to the Power Glove, the many (<em>many) </em>reasons it wasn’t a very good product, and the ways in which it changed the future anyway. They also attempt to set up a decades-old Glove and play games with it, which goes… poorly.</p><p>If you want to subscribe to <em>Version History, </em>there are two ways to get every episode as soon as it drops:</p><p>And if you want to know more about the Power Glove, whether you got to try it or not, here are some links to get you started:</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Mjc0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>David Pierce</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/podcast/850556/nintendo-power-glove-version-history]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="67052f9093ea2"><a title="The Hundred Line 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/67052f9093ea2/the-hundred-line-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Aniplex / XSEED Games</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Over the holiday season, we're republishing some of the best articles from Nintendo Life writers and contributors from</em> <em><a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025">2025</a></em><em>. This article was originally published in May. Enjoy!</em></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This article delves into spoiler territory for The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy. If you've yet to play the game and want to go in blind, we recommend you come back at another time...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not a fan of tactical RPGs… is what I would have told you before I played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>. Heck, I’m still not sure I would call myself a 'fan' of the genre, necessarily; one game perhaps isn’t enough to sway me <em>that</em> much. The Hundred Line, though..? Yeah, I’m a fan of The Hundred Line.</p>
<p>In fact, it's easily my Game of the Year so far, and even with the Switch 2 on the horizon, it’s going to take something truly special to usurp its throne. Mitch gave it an 'Excellent' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy">9/10 in our review</a>, but what he didn’t cover – what he <em>couldn’t</em> cover without spoiling anything – is just how ridiculously ambitious Too Kyo Games’ visual novel / tactical RPG hybrid really is.</p>
<p>So, if you’re sensitive about spoilers and want to go into this one completely fresh, consider this your last warning. We’re going in, folks.</p>

<p>Before I waltz headfirst into what is undoubtedly The Big Twist™, I want to first look at the wonderful cast of characters. Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danganronpa_decadence">Danganronpa</a> before it, the entire premise of The Hundred Line — survive and protect your school against invaders over the course of one hundred days — would have crashed and burned were it not for the likes of Takumi Sumino, Darumi Amemiya, Shouma Ginzaki, Nozomi Kirifuji, and the rest of those loveable goofballs.</p>
<p>Character work is truly where directors Kazutaka Kodaka and Kotaro Uchikoshi shine brightest. They managed to make every member of the 'Special Defense Unit' completely unique and special in their own way.</p>
<p>Take Tsubasa Kawana, for instance. Whenever she’s placed in a stressful situation, she immediately feels nauseous, and it makes for some wonderful comedic relief. I lost count of the number of times I giggled whenever the story took a dark turn, and the camera switched over to Tsubasa loudly dry heaving.</p>
<p>In addition to the comic relief, however, we also learn a lot about Tsubasa’s background, including her passion for machinery fostered by fixing cars with her grandfather as a child. We get similar deep dives into every character, to the point where we begin to understand the potential causes behind their various quirks. Even total prats like Ima Tsukumo, whose obsessive devotion to his ‘Dear Sister’ Kako proves deeply concerning, gets his own moment of redemption through both his backstory and the way the plot progresses.</p>
<p>By the time I reached the credits, I really didn’t want the game to end. I’d grown to love these characters, and a couple of significant losses actually brought a tear to my eye during the final stages; something that no game before it has accomplished. Couldn’t I just keep going? Just for a bit..?</p>
<p>Well, here’s the thing: it didn’t end.</p>
<p>When you reach the last couple of days in the basic hundred-day timeline, you learn that through powers gained via absorption of your enemies, protagonist Takumi can actually go back in time to day one and re-do the whole thing again. Only this time, you’re free to make significant changes to the story and work your way toward one of a potential hundred different endings. <em>Whoa</em> – hold my beer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">Nier Automata</a>!</p>
<figure data-uuid="c8e60d5045326"><a title="The Hundred Line 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8e60d5045326/the-hundred-line-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Aniplex / XSEED Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know what you’re probably thinking, and no, you don’t have to play through the <em>entire</em> game a hundred times. Effectively, the story can branch off into several different paths, each of which has a number of potential endings, and the game even gives you the ability to jump back to specific days in order to change your decisions and alter the story’s path.</p>
<p>Some endings may be exceedingly short, others a bit lengthier… some good, and some <em>very</em> bad. One might see you become the villain of the story, while another may conclude with the adorably loyal samurai Kyoshika Magadori being devoured by your zombified friends. The variety of avenues is simply absurd, and discovering each one is a joy.</p>
<p>These are just a couple of the more, shall we say, ‘insignificant’ possible endings. I won’t go into those which might actually spoil the overarching plot; even if you’re still with me at this point, I’d like you to enjoy The Hundred Line’s story on your own terms. It’s safe to say, however, that the run through those initial one hundred days could definitely be considered a ‘prologue’, even though it comfortably stands as a compelling story in its own right with a beginning, middle, and end.</p>

<p>So you can definitely stop there and have a grand ol’ time, but if you’re looking for something a bit more ambitious — something that throws the rulebook out of the window — I’d encourage you to keep going and see exactly what The Hundred Line has up its sleeve. It’s simply magnificent.</p>
<p>There are so many reasons why I love this game. I love figuring out what to do during ‘free time’ sessions in which you can either chat to your fellow students, venture out into the world in a board-game-inspired minigame of sorts, or dive straight into a few battle simulations to potentially upgrade your abilities.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise for me, however, was how much I loved the battle system itself. As I mentioned at the start, I’m normally not one for tactical RPGs, but The Hundred Line’s turn-based structure just works so well. I often get overwhelmed when it comes to deciding how to approach tactical gameplay: how do these characters function? Why can’t I move more than two spaces? Just what the heck do I <em>do</em>?</p>
<p>The Hundred Line made it easy, though, and it’s once again thanks to the remarkably unique and diverse cast. Their artistic design makes it easy to distinguish one from another, and it only took a couple of battles until I memorised their strengths and weaknesses, along with how their attacks play out on the field of battle. It got to the point where, after a handful of quiet days full of ‘free time’, the warbling alarm to signify an incoming battle filled me with excitement.</p>

<p>Most of the battles felt doable and I never felt completely helpless against the hordes of invaders, but there were still a few that I managed to botch straight away and lose within just a few minutes. In those instances, the game gives you the option to redo the battle with significant boosts to your manpower, instantly giving you 300% 'voltage' (which essentially gives you three uses of your extra-powerful special attacks) and refilling your squad's health. Is it cheating? Sure, I <em>guess</em>... But it also makes the game significantly more approachable for tactical newcomers like myself.</p>
<p>I adore the Danganronpa series. I think they’re wonderful games that remain just as compelling now as they were back when they first launched, and if it weren’t for Danganronpa, I don’t think The Hundred Line would even exist. I have to be honest with myself, though… The Hundred Line is better. It’s a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Co-director Kazutaka Kodaka has <a href="https://x.com/kazkodaka/status/1921370017678946504">recently confirmed</a> that the game is "selling well", but I still feel like not enough people are talking about it. I suspect, however, that as the years go by and more people play it through word of mouth, it’ll go down as one of the greatest visual novels of all time. There’s simply nothing else quite like it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The upcoming live-action adaptation of Sleeping Dogs has found its director. As of now, the film is set to star Shang-Chi actor Simu Liu as Wei Shen with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-film-script-simu-liu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a script complete</a>.</p>



<p>Released in 2012, Sleeping Dogs has become quite the cult classic. Following an undercover Hong Kong police officer, players explore an open world with parkour abilities and martial arts. Despite earning positive reviews, low sales led to the series being dead in the water. </p>



<p>However, Hollywood has gotten its hands on it, now reinvigorated by MCU’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-adaptation-and-sequel-mentioned-by-simu-liu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shang-Chi actor Simu Liu</a>, who’ll star as protagonist Wei Shen. A script was revealed to be complete for the project earlier in the year, but it was unknown where it would lead. Now, an up-and-coming action film director is about to take on the long-awaited adaptation.</p>

<p>In a post from <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/2005248803172135343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simu Liu</a> on Twitter, it has been confirmed that Timo Tjahjanto&nbsp;will direct Sleeping Dogs. The Indonesian director has&nbsp;done a few films but is just starting to get onto bigger projects. His latest movie, Nobody 2, was a worthy follow-up to the 2021 Bob Odenkirk action flick. He is also attached to direct the sequel to the Jason Statham-led project, The Beekeeper, and a possible Hollywood sequel to <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/new-lines-train-to-busan-timo-tjahjanto-1234696403/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Train to Busan</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, Timo Tjahjanto has been an advocate for Sleeping Dogs to hit the big screens for a while. In response to Simu Liu’s post on the game’s lack of movement anywhere, the director <a href="https://x.com/Timobros/status/1885391495785832519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explains its biggest problem</a> was a lack of understanding from executives. When asked about directing the film adaptation, he sent a smiling gif, which has aged incredibly well given today’s news.</p>



<p>The film has yet to acquire a studio or a release date. Still, with a director, writer, script, and Marvel actor at the forefront, it may not be long before one is revealed. Sleeping Dogs has been a work-in-progress in Hollywood, as previous attempts didn’t pan out. Legendary action star Donnie Yen (Rogue One, John Wick: Chapter 4), was attached to play Wei Shen, but it never came around. Hopefully, the film will see the light of day and Sleeping Dogs can get the love it deserves.</p>







<p>What do you think of the director of Sleeping Dogs? Think Timo Tjahjanto is a good pick? Seen any of his films? Do you think Sleeping Dogs will make for a good Hollywood film?
