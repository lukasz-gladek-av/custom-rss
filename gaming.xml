		<p>We’re coming to the end of this week’s heatwave in the UK, and there’s the blessed relief of cloud and wind compared to muggy, sunny heat. So much better!</p>
<p>Tempted as I have been to play PSVR 2 while sweating absolute buckets into an expensive bit of electronics, I have not done that. Instead I spooked it up with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/25/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review/">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a> – a handsome remaster, though one I felt could have been more ambitious – with the opening hours of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/26/steamworld-heist-2-preview-a-sequel-worth-diving-back-in-for/">SteamWorld Heist 2</a>, and a dash through classic Nintendo games with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/26/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-is-a-retro-speedrunning-paradise/">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</a>.</p>

<p>Also playing a SteamWorld game was <strong>Aran</strong>, who is approaching the end of SteamWorld Dig 2 and enjoying mining everything he can to power up. Alongside that, he’s also approaching the end of Assassin’s Creed Mirage, where he’s picked up most of the collectibles.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> and his partner have been hacking and slashing their way through Diablo 4 –&nbsp;“It’s surprisingly complex and menu filled for a game that is ostensibly about mashing the same few buttons again and again but we are getting the hang of it. Her Necromancer and my Druid are proving quite the dynamic duo, level 30 already!”</p>

<p>Incidentally, they are actually playing this as a romantic couple in their head-canon, though it’s more a great tragedy than a rom-com, because “they can never touch, the game insisting they pass through each other, like glitchy ghosts.”</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> wrapped up Death Stranding, but has mixed feelings on it: “Some really interesting and unique concepts at play with evocative visual design and world-building though the novelty gradually wore off, especially in those later chapters where Kojima insists on having you sit through lengthy cutscenes. Some of the more poignant moments were lost on me as certain plot details went over my head though – after sitting through multiple YouTube explainers – I ended up liking the story overall. Fascinated to see what’s planned for Death Stranding 2.”</p>
<p><strong>Dom</strong> handed in a pair of reviews for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/ea-sports-f1-24-review/">EA Sports F1 24</a> and for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review/">Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</a>, enjoying them both, while <strong>Steve</strong> stepped back two decades to play <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/25/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-review/">Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</a> remaster which was just as fun as he remembered it being. He also had a great time with Still Wakes the Deep, and finally finished the sweet Hauntii and the decent second tier Souls-like Morbid: Lords of Ire.</p>

<p>Now then, what have you played this past week? Did you dare strap stuff to your face?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-special-launch-program<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're just a week or so away from&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>'s release, and ahead of the game's launch, developer HoYoverse has revealed some exciting new details about what you can expect from this latest project.</p>
<p>In a special pre-release livestream, HoYoverse revealed new information about&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>'s story, as well as some of the areas you'll get to explore and the Agents you'll get to recruit to your team.</p>
<p>First up, the developer went into detail regarding the game's setting.&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>takes place in a world that has been destroyed by mysterious anomalies known as Hollows, and it's these dark spots that players, who take the role of Proxies, will have to explore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-new-details-hollows.jpg?itok=c75FHO1Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-new-details-hollows.jpg?itok=N8Q6BIKG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>'s Hollows are no laughing matter.</figcaption></figure><p>Inside Hollows, you'll find mutated monsters called Ethereals, as well as a resource called Ether, which corrupts any living creature found within a Hollow (but which is also a critical part of hub city New Eridu's ability to thrive).</p>
<p>We also got a look at the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-by-genshin-honkai-developer-shows-minigames-stylish-action-combat">satisfying-looking combat</a>, which, like other HoYoverse games, will revolve around building a team of Agents who complement each other's skills.</p>
<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>will feature a parrying system that allows you to switch Agents in response to an enemy's attack, triggering an assist that deals extra damage. If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review-die-twice-by-sword">Sekiro</a>&nbsp;</em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stellar-blade-review-mother-sphere-knows-best"><i>Stellar Blade</i></a>, you'll be familiar with the mechanics here.</p>
<p>The livestream also showed off some of the areas you can look forward to exploring in HoYoverse's latest game, including the urban district of Lumina Square and the forward operational base of Scott Outpost.</p>

<p>Two new Agents, Lucy and Piper, were revealed during the stream, and they'll serve alongside the game's other Agents as recruitable characters for your squad.</p>
<p>What's more, HoYoverse also revealed a special redemption code to thank fans for watching the livestream.</p>
<p>Once&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>goes live on July 4th, inputting the code "ZZZFREE100" will get you 300 Polychromes, 30,000 Dennies, 2 Senior Investigator Logs, and 3 W-Engine Energy Modules. The code is valid until July 11th, so make sure you've used it before then!</p>
<p>That, of course, is in addition to the bonuses you can already receive just by checking out the game at launch, which you can see over on the official&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em><a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, it's the newest project from&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>developer HoYoverse. It's an action RPG with combat inspired by character action games like&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry</em>, as well as a diverse <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-by-genshin-impact-developer-show-anbys-stylish-moves-in-spectacular">cast</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-by-genshin-impact-developer-showcases-catgirl-nekomata">characters</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-by-genshin-impact-developer-reveals-billy-kid-and-closed-beta-date">unlock and use</a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>for free when it launches across PC, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/zenless-zone-zero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and mobile devices on July 4th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warzone’s Original Map ‘Verdansk’ is Set to Return in 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-verdansk-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warzone%E2%80%99s-original-map-%E2%80%98verdansk%E2%80%99-is-set-to-return-in-2025.914238/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-verdansk-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Last night, several new rumors surfaced stating that Call of Duty Warzone’s original map ‘Verdansk’ has been delayed from its December 2024 target to “early 2025”.</p>



<p>The news came courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@BobNetworkUK</a> on Twitter, which Insider Gaming has been able to verify.</p>



<p>In December 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-map-verdansk-return-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> that Verdansk would return as the title’s main map during Black Ops 6. As reported, we couldn’t verify the exact release date of Verdansk but understood that the game was to follow Warzone’s traditional ‘main map’ release schedule and be released in December 2024 – a seemingly missed target. </p>



<p>Sources have since revealed that Verdansk was never actually intended to return to Warzone, despite the previous rumors. Instead, there was a massive pivot in late 2023 due to Fortnite OG. Fortnite OG saw the return of Fortnite’s original map, which saw the game have a gigantic resurgence of players and create the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-player-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest day ever in Fortnite history</a>, with 44.7 million players. Understandably, it’s a metric that Actviision wishes to replicate.</p>



<p>The pivot meant that Warzone’s 2024 mainline map, ‘Avalon’ (it’s unclear if that’s the final name), has been pushed back to 2025’s Call of Duty, codenamed ‘Saturn’. It’s understood that Avalon is nearly complete, but Activision is adamant to see a massive resurgence in players. In part, it could be because Call of Duty 2025 will already be leaning heavily into nostalgia with its multiplayer offering.</p>



<p>Officially, Activision has yet to comment on any of the rumors, but a few subtle remarks from marketing could suggest that information on Warzone could come at a much later date than usual. During the Black Ops 6 direct, it was announced that Call of Duty NEXT would feature the full reveal of Black Ops 6 multiplayer, whereas, in the past, they’ve also announced that the event will contain “the future of Warzone.” In addition, one developer during the direct asked production, “Am I allowed to talk about Warzone yet?”, in which a firm “no” can be heard from those behind the camera. Coincidence? I think not!</p>

            <link>https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-benefits-of-working-remotely-gi-sprint</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-benefits-of-working-remotely-gi-sprint.914232/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-benefits-of-working-remotely-gi-sprint<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>During the pandemic, studios quickly adapted to working remotely. This way of operating seems to have stuck, with many studios opting to stay fully remote rather than returning to the office.</p>
<p>Two developers that have adopted this way of work are Bossa Studios and FuturLab, both based in the UK with employees working remotely worldwide.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>for <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/events/gi-sprint-summer-2024">GI Sprint</a>, Bossa co-founder and CEO Henrique Olifiers and FuturLab head of production Toby Adam-Smith discuss the benefits of working remotely, and how teams can still maintain a creative and collaborative environment online rather than in an office.</p>
<section>
<ul>
<li><a href="#section-1">Adapting from office to remote working</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-2">Maintaining vision alignment</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-3">Efficiency of remote working</a></li>
<li><a href="#section-4">Importance of communicating clearly online</a></li>
</ul>
</section>
<h2 id="section-1">Adapting from office to remote working</h2>
<p>Adam-Smith notes that in an office setting, producers and managers would be able to notice small things during production such as "spotting something on a person's screen, or overhearing a conversation and being able to jump in [to] help or provide feedback."</p>
<blockquote>"So long as employees are empowered and understand shared visions and goals, they find the best way to work to achieve them"<p><cite>Toby Adam-Smith</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>"In this way, progress and issues would often be shared and raised organically regardless of your project or discipline," he says.</p>
<p>FuturLab has tried to find similar ways of implementing this sort of collaborative nature in remote work, and found that embracing an open environment online was the solution.</p>
<p>Adam-Smith suggested using communication channels such as Slack, and more recently Gather, to enable teams to share thoughts and ideas as they would've done in an office environment.</p>
<p>"Trust is so important with remote working, and we trust that our team shares our vision and goals, and make it everyone's responsibility to deliver on them," Adam-Smith explains.</p>
<p>"So long as employees are empowered and understand shared visions and goals, they find the best way to work to achieve them."</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Maintaining vision alignment</h2>
<p>Not being in one place to work as a team can affect vision alignment during development, which is something Olifiers has recognised since going fully remote. (Vision alignment is a challenge in itself that we <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/getting-your-game-vision-right-at-the-concept-stage-gi-sprint">tackled in a previous GI Sprint session with Graham McAllister</a>).</p>
<p>"If you're not careful, misalignment results in people working in silos and focusing on things that either aren't a priority, or not at the quality needed for release," he says, adding that it was easier to spot these issues in an office rather than a remote setting.</p>
<p>However, Olifiers says that Bossa has utilised a variety of different methods to combat this.</p>
<p>This includes workshopping ideas and features at the beginning of development which are revisited throughout, and asking player-centric questions such as, 'What is the feeling you want while playing this feature?' and 'What sense of accomplishment should the player have?'.</p>
<p>Bossa also breaks teams down into groups with differing skill sets, which it had in the office and has been transferred to Slack channels.</p>
<p>"It's improved communication, as the track record means things aren't missed if you've gone to make a coffee – It's more asynchronous and flexible," Olifiers explains.</p>
<p>"Work is actively encouraged to be shared in these channels. People can give feedback, calls can be started so several people can share screens and collaborate. Playtests take place in Discord with ease, which is simpler than gathering people in a meeting room and running the game."</p>
<p>Overall, workshopping and breaking teams down "reduces the chance of misalignment between people," Olifiers notes.</p>
<p>"This in turn reduces the likelihood of revisiting features, improves bug fixing time and ensures everyone rows in the same direction."</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Efficiency of remote working</h2>
<p>Working efficiently as a remote studio comes down to using the right tools. Olifiers highlights that workshops around a Miro board (or a similar virtual workspace app), play sessions via Discord, and using a project tracking app like Jira all helps streamline workload and keeps teams on top of what they're working on.</p>
<p>"It all collaborates to create a fairly seamless setup which unlocks efficiency if well managed and culturally aligned," he explains.</p>
<p>Olifiers says there are "natural advantages" to working remotely when it comes to productivity, such as being able to focus without distractions from an office environment. But that all depends on a "good set up at home, with separation from domestic life."</p>
<blockquote>"[Using the right tools can] create a fairly seamless setup which unlocks efficiency if well managed and culturally aligned"<p><cite>Henrique Olifiers</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>It's also worth acknowledging that it can be down to personal preferences, with some people finding remote working more difficult for their mental health, for instance.</p>
<p>Working remotely can also add benefits to life outside of work. Olifiers notes the removal of commute time, for instance.</p>
<p>"Family life improves, so does happiness and job satisfaction," he says. "All these contribute to a better balance, translating in more focus and efficiency."</p>
<p>For Olifiers, the key to unlocking this productivity is making communication the highest priority.</p>
<p>"When people understand the decisions that are made, and are pulling the right way, you build on a strong foundation," he explains. "Things unravel very quickly otherwise, and it's easier to happen when working remotely."</p>
<p>Adam-Smith agrees, adding that it's important to have collaborative meetings to maintain this efficiency. He uses art and design as an example, where people can draw over each other's work during meetings.</p>
<p>However, he does note that the focus that can come from working alone can lead to issues with the length of work days.</p>
<p>"It can be very isolating working alone and some people may not be able to stop themselves from working longer hours than they should be," he says. "Give people the benefit of the doubt, and if something goes wrong, try to stop yourself from thinking, 'This wouldn't have happened if we were all on-site."</p>
<h2 id="section-4">Importance of communicating clearly online</h2>
<p>For both studios, communication tools such as Slack, Discord, and Google Meet have become essential in conducting meetings online that are catered to the situation at hand.</p>
<p>Olifiers recommends keeping meetings short with clear agendas, with only relevant people in attendance. He advises that studio-wide meetings should involve the entire team to keep them up to date with what's going on during development.</p>
<p>Adam-Smith notes that it's essential for everyone to feel as though they have an opportunity to contribute.</p>
<p>"In larger meetings – virtual or otherwise – leads and senior leadership may spend more time in the spotlight, so try to keep the door open and encourage others to present work they're proud of or raise concerns," he says.</p>
<p>"While this is good practice for any studio, it's even more important when it's so easy for team members to go unnoticed outside of their immediate team."</p>
<p>Adam-Smith advises to ensure the team is working in an environment that "has the infrastructure and freedom for employees to talk to one another as often as they would like, then create as many opportunities to check in with one another as is reasonably appropriate."</p>
<p>Being open to new approaches and recommendations in communication from the team is equally as important, and FuturLab does this by running surveys.</p>
<blockquote>"Try to keep the door open [during larger meetings] and encourage others to present work they're proud of or raise concerns"<p><cite>Toby Adam-Smith</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>The studio also has a dedicated welfare manager to "drive social and wellbeing-focused communication" among the teams, and to help "break down barriers and connect members who historically may have only interacted while waiting for the kettle to boil."</p>
<p>Both Olifiers and Adam-Smith advocate for regular in-person meet-ups. Bossa has entire team meet-ups four to five times a year, alongside leadership meetings every six weeks, and individual teams getting together between bigger company meetings.</p>
<p>For Olifiers, in-person meetings are "key for strategic discussions, creative direction and overall creating bonds with people."</p>
<p>However, Adam-Smith says to be careful about making meet-ups mandatory, and to take travel time into account.</p>
<p>"If getting together is deemed essential, cover the costs of longer-distance travellers and enable them to commute during work hours," he says. "If you are getting together, the social element is as important as any meeting or discussion, so try to time it to have something to celebrate."</p>

<p>We knew a movie was coming - just a day after Legendary Entertainment announced it had secured the film and television rights to Capcom's Street Fighter series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-film-and-tv-rights-bought-by-legendary-entertainment">the company announced plans to create a new live-action movie</a> - but this is the first time production company Legendary, which is running the project alongside Capcom, has shared a release date.</p>
<p>Of course, this won't be the first time Street Fighter has been adapted for the big screen - the 1994 film Street Fighter attracted a star-studded cast with Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue, among others, but it bombed at the box office.</p>
<p>Then, in 2009, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li was released with Kirstin Kreuk in the title role, but that too flopped.</p>
<p>This won't be the only video game adaptation to grace the silver screen in 2026, by the way - the sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">The Super Mario Bros. Movie now has a firm 2026 release date</a>, too.</p>
<p>In a "this is Miyamoto" social post ahead of last week's Nintendo Direct, the Mario creator revealed the full release date for the animated film sequel will 3rd April 2026 in the US, 24th April 2026 in Japan, and "other countries and regions" during April 2026.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6 is out now across PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-devs-community-manager-apologises-says-fans-continuously-getting-fed-false-hope-of-sequel<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The community manager for Days Gone developer Bend Studio has apologised to fans. The reason for this apology? Because they are "getting fed false hope and poor information by people looking for likes".</p>
<p>In a post on social media platform X, Kevin McAllister said this kind of behaviour is "not fair" to fans of Days Gone, who are eager to hear more news about more games in the series. This is something that is not on the cards.</p>
<p>While McAllister did not name any names in his post, earlier this week former studio director <a href="https://x.com/John_Garvin/status/1805083382327718080">John Garvin</a> said he had written Days Gone with a cliffhanger "with the full intention of there being a trilogy (NOT just a sequel)". This comment was subsequently picked up by fans and outlets.</p>

<p>"All these type of headlines originate from previous developers, which puts us in a bad position," McAllister continued in reply to another user. "Like I said, people need likes. Time to move on."</p>
<p>Garvin has long shared his disappointment that Days Gone was not better received by Sony and critics. In 2022, Garvin controversially stated the reason the game didn't receive universal acclaim was because of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-wasnt-a-hit-because-reviewers-were-too-woke-director-claims">"woke reviewers" and reviewers who "couldn't be bothered to actually play the game"</a>. Garvin also criticised the game's programmers, blaming "tech issues" such as "bugs, streaming and frame rate" for Days Gone's middling reception.</p>
<p>That same year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-director-says-local-studio-management-always-made-us-feel-like-it-was-a-big-disappointment">fellow Days Gone director Jeff Ross</a> said "local studio management always made us feel like it was a big disappointment", and called Sony's decision not to greenlight a sequel "weird".</p>
<p>Both Garvin and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-director-joins-tomb-raider-studio-crystal-dynamics">Ross have since moved on from Bend Studio</a> to persue other projects, though both still regularly post about Days Gone on their socials.</p> <div>

            <p>The makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> host a podcast every once in a while, in which the studio's developers chat about what's going on in the company. In the latest episode, they're discussing their (relatively new) Boston studio and how it's spearheading the as-yet-enigmatic sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. There's a lot of middle-managey chit chat but one thing that stood out was one developer's earnest remarks about what he considers some of the sci-fi RPG's shortcomings. </p>
<p>"I see that we didn't push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance," said Paweł Sasko, Associate Game Director at CD Project RED.  "Like, let's say the homeless crisis... when I look at it, I'm like, we weren't far enough in '77. We thought that we were dystopian, but... we just touched the surface."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The general hope aired in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBpEDCZMvo">the podcast</a> is that, now that they have a studio in the US, the creators can make the sequel more true-to-life, and engage more deeply in some issues the first game didn't address. The planned sequel is internally called "Orion" and we don't know much about it yet, except that it has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-and-control-writer-joins-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">the lead writer of Control at its narrative helm</a>. </p>
<p>"I think the really cool thing about Cyberpunk - and the dystopian future that it has - is there's so much relevance to today, of megacorporations, of people on the fringes, you know, of people just being exploited resources, of the wealth gap, of all these things," said Dan Hernberg, Acting Executive Producer on the sequel.</p>
<p>"I think that Cyberpunk allows us to tell these stories in ways where... at the heart of it there's always relationships and people, but we're in a really broken world and that we can call out some of these things.</p>
<p>"I think for me that's what Cyberpunk is about, exploring those themes but in a very poignant way... and I think that's what we're going to try to do with project Orion. Really continue to lean into that..."</p>
<p>It isn't the only way in which the studio claims its new North American home will aid in creating a lifelike world for the sci-fi follow-up. They want to avoid another "manhole debacle".</p>
<p>"I mean, there's this interesting story after the release of Cyberpunk that blew up on Reddit at some point, and it's the manhole debacle," said Sasko. "I remember there was this post [with] the guy saying that there is this immersion-breaking bug in Cyberpunk... that the covers for manholes for a sewer were the manholes that you use normally in Europe, in Germany, for a pavement. Those are not manholes that you normally [use] in America on the streets."</p>
<p>It's a pretty minor fault, and it reminds me of recent comments by Dragon Age producer Mark Darrah, claiming that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blockbuster-games-are-in-the-grip-of-a-fidelity-death-cult-says-former-dragon-age-producer">blockbuster games are in the grip of a high-fidelity death cult</a> - an exhausting and unwinnable race to be more and more realistic. Personally, I like a broad range of art styles in the industry, and don't want to see games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review">opting for hyperrealism</a> disappearing. But we can forgive a manhole cover, surely.</p>
<p>As for homelessness in the US, that's a disaster visible to anyone who sets foot in the country, and won't be solved in an article about video games. It will likewise be a difficult issue to address within the context of an often ridiculous RPG world full of talking vending machines and routinely exploding heads. There's no reason to believe this issue will be a huge part of the sequel's storytelling, to be clear (Sasko doesn't mention it with that significant a tone). The intention may be as simple as including a greater number of homeless NPCs in the sequel. Whatever the case, it is at least something they are thinking about. And considering how closely everything about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lets-chat-about-the-cyberpunk-2077-demo">Cyberpunk 2077 was watched</a>, and how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trans-representation-in-cyberpunk-2077-matters-but-not-because-its-cyberpunk">fiercely it was interpreted</a>, it makes sense that the company may want to leverage the cultural sensibilities of its US employees in any way that may be helpful. </p>

  <p id="jfe1yl">Publisher Wizards of the Coast has spent the last few years targeting two very different segments of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mtg-magic-the-gathering"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a><em> </em>audience. On the one hand, you have the multiplayer style of play called <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/28/21266763/magic-the-gathering-commander-origins-elder-dragon-highlander-alaska-menery">Commander</a>, arguably the game’s most popular <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23643684/magic-gathering-oathbreaker-format-announced">format</a>. On the other hand, you have the ambitious <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24071837/mtg-universes-beyond-two-per-year-lotr-final-fantasy-fallout">Universes Beyond</a> products, designed to turn the heads of lapsed fans and non-players alike with products that support multiple styles of play. Now the trading card game is returning to its roots with a new set called <em>Foundations</em>, a collection of cards and a curated play experience custom-built for newcomers.</p>
<p id="AW1uJb"><em>Foundations</em> launches on Nov. 15, and will have all the trappings of a mainline set release — that includes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23915789/mtg-draft-boosters-set-boosters-discontinued-what-is-a-play-booster">Play boosters</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23771472/mtg-lotr-collector-booster-box-prices">Collector boosters</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/21/21147560/magic-the-gathering-new-format-jumpstart-boosters">Jumpstart boosters</a>, and Bundles as well as all the same pre-release pomp and circumstance as any other new set of cards. But it will also feature two new-to-<em>Magic</em> products: a <em>Beginner Box</em> and a <em>Starter Collection</em>.</p>

<p id="WHgOSK">Wizards’ game design director Bryan Hawley told Polygon that the <em>Beginner Box</em> will include 10 packets with 20 cards inside each one, with two packets for each of <em>Magic</em>’s five colors of mana. Using a mix-and-match system originally designed for the Jumpstart product line, players will be able to combine and recombine those 10 packets into many different kinds of decks. At least some of those packets will be pre-shuffled, with the intent that players will first open and explore them alongside a detailed, step-by-step written tutorial.</p>
<p id="H2D3Rr">“One of the things that <em>Foundations</em> is really trying to do differently than any of our past attempts at an onboarding experience,” said Hawley, “is to really focus on that full pathway, [taking a new player from] <em>I am interested in Magic, but I don’t know anything!</em> up through <em>Oh, I’ve identified what I like to do and I’m going to do more of that!</em> So the <em>Beginner Box</em> is a significantly more built-out experience that has a lot more content [than previous <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/23766947/magic-the-gathering-tales-of-middle-earth-lotr-deck-analysis-building-photos">starter sets</a>]. You can play dozens of games straight from the box.”</p>

<p id="sIhdQD">Once players have mastered the <em>Foundations Beginner Box </em>of 200 cards, then they can move on to the <em>Starter Collection</em>. That 350-card box will help them to expand on the themes and techniques they’ve already discovered, while also serving to keep them well within the warm embrace of a kind of estuary — a place of calm that should remain stable even as multiple new sets of cards are released year after year.</p>
<p id="hH2ytm">That long-term stability is a new feature for <em>Magic</em> as a whole. When a new set of cards is released it only remains viable — that is, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmagic.wizards.com%2Fen%2Fformats&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24187331%2Fmtg-foundations-announcement-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23951372__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24187331/mtg-foundations-announcement-release-date-price&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23951372__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24187331/mtg-foundations-announcement-release-date-price&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">“legal” to play in certain formats</a> — for about three years. Hawley said that cards from the <em>Foundations</em> set will be legal to play until at least 2029, or nearly twice the usual length of time.</p>
<p id="inK96J">“Our hope and intention is that as long as the set continues doing its job,” Hawley said, “helping new players learn the game, get acclimated to the game, and find what they like about the game — <em>and </em>being that foundation for Standard in general — it will continue to remain Standard-legal.”</p>
<p id="3T3hx2"><em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em>’ <em>Beginner Box</em> will retail for $29.99, while the larger <em>Starter Collection</em> will cost $59.99. Expect more information from Wizards in the lead-up to the release this fall. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-developer-of-tribes-3-has-ditched-the-game-just-3-months-after-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The developer of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/tribes-3-rivals">Tribes 3</a> has signaled plans to move on from the game after it failed to find an audience.</p><p>Tribes 3 launched in March on Steam <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tribes-3-rivals-early-access-review">billed as the triumphant return of the fast-paced multiplayer first-person shooter</a> series whose games were popular in the late 90s and early 2000s. But despite a ‘mostly positive’ Steam user review rating, player numbers were extremely low. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2687970/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, Tribes 3 hit a peak of 890 concurrent players on Valve’s platform upon launch, with just 26 concurrent players at the time of this article’s publication.</p><p>Developer Prophecy Games issued an <a href="https://www.tribes3rivals.com/news/tribes-3-player-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">update</a> to say neither Tribes 3 or its prior game, the already shuttered Starsiege Deadzone, saw enough success to justify the team’s continued focus. As a result, it’s giving those who’ve spent money in those games credits towards its upcoming fast-paced 3v3 sports shooter Ultra Strikers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“These credits are meant to give back to players who supported us in early development,” Prophecy Games said. “We’re doing our best to support Tribes 3 with limited updates (along with an upcoming discount sale to bring in more players), and plan to return to Starsiege Deadzone once the company has the resources, but unfortunately neither game had enough success yet to support the studio and can’t be our main development focus right now (as much as we love them).</p><p>“Thank you for your support. Going forward, we’ll continue to focus on updating existing games as much as we can, while creating new games players enjoy. We love making games, we love playing games, and thanks again for giving our games a shot and being part of the community!”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Unfortunately neither game had enough success yet to support the studio and can’t be our main development focus right now.</p></div><p>Over the last few weeks, even before the release of this latest statement, some Tribes 3 players had hit out at Prophecy Games for what they considered to be an "abandonment" of the game. Tribes 3, down to a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam for recent reviews, is not a free-to-play game, although it does feature various microtransactions.</p><p>One player with over 250 hours on Tribes 3 left a negative review that detailed a number of issues with the game and Prophecy’s management of it, hitting out at the lack of updates and various broken promises.</p><p>“Matches are largely against either extremely veteran players clinging to their last laughable hope that this game will somehow become something that the public cares about, or bots, so have fun either being completely stomped, or completely stomping the other team,” the Steam user said.</p><p>It’s a sad end to Tribes 3 after just three months of early access, and a potential death knell for the once-popular franchise. Prophecy Games will of course be pinning its hopes on Ultra Strikers, although after what happened to Tribes 3 it has work to do to win back player trust.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Don't Nod has pushed the launch of its upcoming new IP Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage in order to avoid clashing with the next instalment of Life Is Strange – which was originally developed by Don't Nod.</p>
<p>In a press release, the company said Lost Records had been delayed from a 'late 2024' window to 'early 2025' following "an in-depth assessment of recent trends and developments in the industry."</p>
<p>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, developed by Deck Nine and revisiting characters from the Don't Nod original, is currently set to release on October 29. Don't Nod said the delay to Lost Records should benefit both titles.</p>
<p>"We know that many of our fans are eagerly awaiting this game, just as they are the recently announced next installment of Life is Strange," said Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert. "Let's give both titles the space they need to be enjoyed by our players within the large community we have built.</p>
<p>"We firmly believe that the wait for Bloom &amp; Rage will be worth it. We look forward to sharing this new adventure, which we hope will become another memorable chapter in the Don't Nod universe."</p>
<p>Like Life Is Strange, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage is a narrative adventure that follows a group of teenagers caught up in a mystery involving supernatural elements.</p>

            <p>After half a decade in the wilderness, Alpha Protocol is back on Steam.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/34010/Alpha_Protocol/">Sega pulled Alpha Protocol from sale way back in 2019</a> due to the expiry of music rights, and whilst it returned to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidian-espionage-rpg-alpha-protocol-returns-to-pc-following-2019-licensing-drama">GOG back in March</a>, Obsidian's fan-favourite spy RPG was still curiously missing from Valve's storefront. Until now, that is.</p>

<p>Surprised? You're probably not alone. There doesn't seem to have been a formal announcement anywhere, and according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/34010/history/">SteamDB</a>, Alpha Protocol's Steam backend hadn't been touched for months until a flurry of changes in June signalled something was afoot.</p>
<p>Alpha Protocol sees you play as agent Michael Thorton, a "talented young agent cast out by his government". The only one with the information needed to prevent the obligatory international catastrophe, Thorton's forced to "cut himself off from the very people he is sworn to protect" – oo-er – and every choice and action you take will "ultimately transform the type of secret agent Micheal Thorton will become".</p>
<p>If that sounds intriguing, Alpha Protocol is currently available for 20 percent off the recommended retail Steam price.</p>
<p>"The legendary agent whose presence looms over Alpha Protocol's Michael Thornton isn't Bauer, Bourne or Bond - although the game is eager to invite all these comparisons," Donlan wrote in Eurogamers' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alpha-protocol-review">Alpha Protocol review</a> almost fifteen years ago.</p>
<p>"Obsidian has borrowed a lot from BioWare, a developer it's always had a close working relationship with, and at times Alpha Protocol can feel a little like a Mass Effect mod as much as an original game in its own right."</p>

            <p>I think I've written about it a bazillion times here on RPS, but I do think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> is a massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game that's a bit <em>too</em> large and in charge. I reached the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/n.com/i-have-reached-the-elden-ring-exhaustion-point">exhaustion point</a> once, and now the DLC's come out, I'm scared I'll reach it again despite the fact <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">I think it's very good</a>. It's interesting then, that FromSoftware's president Hidetaka Miyazaki sees Elden Ring as "the limit" for FromSoftware in terms of project scale (cheers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki">The Guardian</a> for the interview, and PCGamer for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/hidetaka-miyazaki-says-elden-ring-might-be-as-big-a-game-as-he-ever-wants-to-make-where-fromsoftware-is-right-now-in-terms-of-scale-i-would-say-elden-ring-is-really-the-limit/">the spot</a>). I think it's a great thing, personally.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In The Guardian's interview with Miyazaki, he says that Elden Ring is a "turning point" for FromSoftware, referencing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review">Armored Core VI</a> as an example of something a bit different from the company's Souls catalogue. "Where FromSoftware is right now, in terms of scale, I would say Elden Ring is really the limit," Miyazaki told the site. "We’ve tapped every resource and talent that we have access to… scaling it even bigger, I’d have my concerns." </p>
<p>What comes after Elden Ring then? Miyazaki says that he'd love to see up-and-coming developers within FromSoftware take the lead. "Perhaps having multiple projects is the next stage, where some of the other younger talent can have the opportunity to manage and direct game design for a smaller project."</p>
<p>I think Elden Ring and Shadow Of The Erdtree are brilliant, don't get me wrong. But I was worried that massive Soulsly open worlds were like, the <em>only</em> thing they'd do now since they've tasted so much critical and commercial success. It's a relief to know that they're actually thinking of scaling things back, and handing the reins to people with different ideas.</p>
<p>I doubt this is the end for Souls, which makes me happy! Gimme more games with bonfires and skeletons. But also, I'm glad they're looking to foster a culture of experimentation. Hey, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-me-hankering-hankering-for-a-tenchu">how about Tenchu</a>? I know that turned into Sekiro eventually, but we could revisit it? Please. PLEASE.</p>

Again, we’ve heard nothing since, but we do know this game is set in Middle-earth and features the stories of The Hobbit and more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Tomb Raider Review Ever</h3></div></output><p>Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/amazon-games-christoph-hartmann-tomb-raider-lord-of-the-rings-1236046995/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Amazon Games chief Christoph Hartmann said a reveal for either game is not imminent, but is not long away. “It’s not going to be tomorrow, but it’s not too far away,” Hartmann said, before insisting Amazon Games is now “getting into a much more regular cadence of shipping games.”</p><p>“That’s all I’m allowed to tell you right now,” Hartmann added. “It’s all about quality. You don’t want to just be rushed out. That doesn’t work. It has to be triple-A quality, because the bar is so high.”</p><p>Amazon will be keen to capitalize on other Tomb Raider and The Lord of the Rings projects it has in the works by lining up the TV shows with the video games. Prime Video has confirmed a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-confirms-tomb-raider-series-for-prime-video-with-phoebe-waller-bridge-as-writer-and-executive-producer">Tomb Raider live-action series</a> with Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge in place as writer and executive producer, although it has yet to say when it will launch.

While that’s worked out well for the Fallout TV show, which is set after all the Fallout video games, Hartmann suggested Amazon’s plan for Tomb Raider is closer to Sony’s with its hugely successful Marvel’s Spider-Man games, which are separate to the Spider-Man movies.</p><p>“You see it with Tomb Raider, where we’re gonna have a Tomb Raider game coming and they’re doing a show,” Hartmann said. “And some people say, ‘Oh, will they be linked together?’ And I give them the example, look at Spider-Man. There’s amazing, amazing games. There’s great animated content, there’s great live-action, and everyone seems to be very happy with that.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/even-hardcore-audiences-love-dlc-when-its-done-right-opinion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Bethesda's $2.50 horse armour DLC for Oblivion turns 18 this year – a realisation which made me feel like I was about to spontaneously crumble to dust and be blown away on a breeze.</p>
<p>There's an entire generation of gamers to whom it would be very challenging to explain why the launch of this seemingly innocuous add-on was such a pivotal moment for the industry's development; why for the best part of a decade afterwards, an eye-roll and a snorted exclamation of "horse armour!" was a devastating put-down to almost any DLC plans.</p>
<p>Attitudes have undoubtedly softened over time, especially in younger cohorts who have grown up with most major games having paid-for add-ons of various types, but there is still a conventional wisdom which says that more "hardcore" consumers, and older consumers, really don't like paid-for DLC in general.</p>
<p>That's an oversimplification of the attitudes involved, but it's not entirely unfounded – at least, it's certainly in line with what we see in online discourse around game announcements. If you listen closely you can hear an audible groan rise from the server farms of Discord and Reddit whenever a game is announced alongside details of its add-on content season pass, as has been common practice for the best part of a decade now.</p>
<blockquote>The horse armour won, in the end.

</blockquote>
<p>The assertion made by the loudest detractors – and clearly believed by a not insignificant chunk of the audience – is that complete games are having parts sliced off them and repackaged as DLC, with the true, full game that we "should" have been getting at launch only eventually being sold as some kind of Game of the Year edition further down the line.</p>
<p>It's a narrative that tickles the two foundational prejudices of the internet's self-styled angry and/or bitter gamers – that publishers are greedy, and developers are lazy.</p>
<p>The robust and generally well-founded pushback to this narrative from developers is straightforward – that while they generally have ideas for DLC in mind before a game launches, it's not the case that content which actually exists has been cut out.</p>
<p>There are storylines and scenarios and concept art, yes, but actually building those sections of the game is a task that doesn't get properly underway until after the launch. There's a plan for future expansion, not a chunk of finished content being locked away by greedy business bosses.</p>
<p>An unfortunate wrinkle in the otherwise robust fabric of that counter-argument is that while this scenario is usually the case, there have undoubtedly been situations where DLC planning has been rather less pure-hearted – and it only takes a couple of cases of the DLC model being abused to convince some consumers that a giant business conspiracy to defraud gamers is unfolding behind every launch.</p>
<blockquote>I'm not sure any developer other than FromSoftware could get away with this kind of thing; the fact that they do, and to rapturous praise, is worth looking at</blockquote>
<p>Some high-profile games have launched in pretty awful states – very obviously lacking large amounts of planned content or features, with huge technical issues, and so on – but nonetheless accompanied their launches with expensive season passes and high-profile promotion of DLC roadmaps.</p>
<p>A few bad apples can spoil the whole barrel, and it doesn't take too many of those cases to make a certain segment of the audience – the more hardcore audience that's more plugged into these online discourses – sour on DLC as a broader concept.</p>
<p>Yet even at that, saying that these audiences don't like DLC is a vast over-simplification of a much more nuanced set of views. Case in point: Elden Ring's DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, is arguably the most talked-about game of the month, having earned soaring review scores and fantastic word-of-mouth from exactly the kind of hardcore audience who supposedly don't like DLC and paid add-ons.</p>
<p>By the conventional wisdom, this is an add-on that shouldn't even exist, let alone be so popular. Instead, it appears to have been crafted as a love-letter to the hardcore fans of an already pretty hardcore game; you need to have defeated an optional boss in Elden Ring who is tough to find, let alone defeat, even to access the new content.</p>
<p>I'm not sure any developer other than FromSoftware could get away with this kind of thing; the fact that they do, and to rapturous praise, is worth looking at.</p>
<p>Context matters, of course. Some kind of plan did exist for Shadow of the Erdtree all the way back when Elden Ring launched – there are plenty of loose ends in the original game that are clearly meant to be tied up in a future expansion – but nobody could argue with a straight face that a game of the scope and scale of Elden Ring was incomplete or had seen content sliced off to create a DLC pack.</p>
<p>Moreover, it's taken almost two years for this expansion to arrive, and it's enormous in its own right, essentially the size of a whole new game by itself.</p>
<blockquote>It only takes a couple of cases of the DLC model being abused to convince some consumers that a giant business conspiracy to defraud gamers is unfolding</blockquote>
<p>Those old enough to remember game expansion packs will recognise the Shadow of the Erdtree formula as owing far more to that now-rare approach than to the more conventional modern 'season pass' approach of dropping three or four new pieces of content over the course of a year or so. Much of the positive reaction to this DLC likely owes to FromSoftware having planned it as a full expansion pack rather than as a slice of DLC.</p>
<p>FromSoftware isn't the only company taking this approach of launching large, high-quality DLC packs in the mould of expansion packs, of course. Cyberpunk 2077's equally rapturously received Phantom Liberty DLC is another great recent example. At a little more of a stretch you could point to the extremely positive reception around Final Fantasy XIV's major expansions (notably Shadowbringers and Endwalker), or even to the Miles Morales spin-off from Insomniac's Spider-Man game, as further examples.</p>
<p>The common point between all of these is that they genuinely offer what DLC always claims, but so infrequently delivers. Here is a significant (both in size and scope) and transformative addition to a game that's already thoroughly loved by its players, giving dozens of hours of extra playtime at a very reasonable price.</p>
<p>Given that the base game is a known quantity, and of very high quality, it's a no-brainer for many players to buy this kind of DLC; more of something you already know you enjoy is an easier purchasing decision than taking a punt on a game you haven't played yet.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Shadow-of-the-Erdtree-2_le0l91c.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is the gold standard for DLC, and ought to be what every developer planning an expansion roadmap tries to emulate – reaching high, even if many will fall short is likely.</p>
<p>Getting the base game right is absolutely central to this formula; trying to sell players DLC when the original game is still in need of extensive fixing is like trying to hand restaurant customers a dessert menu when the main course wasn't cooked properly and half the dishes never arrived.</p>
<p>Moreover, DLC of this kind needs to be meaty enough to be worth getting back into the game in the first place. By the time your DLC launches, most players have moved on to new games, so you need to be promising them a significant experience – and ideally one that transforms the original game in interesting ways – to convince them to come back and play again.</p>
<p>This is not not, however, the only approach to DLC and in-game purchases, nor is it the only approach players have come to accept. Which brings us back to Bethesda's horse armour, as it prepares to graduate high school and pack its bags for college.</p>
<p>For all the mockery and negativity around the horse armour – which admittedly was a bit daft in a game that had such an extensive range of free community-developed mods – the reality is that for most of the audience currently in their early thirties and below, charging $2.50 for a cosmetic in-game item seems perfectly natural and uncontroversial. If anything, they might be surprised at how cheap that is. The horse armour won, in the end.</p>
<blockquote><p>Trying to sell DLC when the original game is still in need of fixing is like trying to hand restaurant customers a dessert menu when the main course wasn't cooked properly and half the dishes never arrived</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cosmetic DLC – costumes and weapons and fripperies that do little but customise the game experience in various ways – is now an intrinsic part of the business model of many games, and can be surprisingly successful even in single-player titles where you might expect the instinct to peacock by dressing up characters to be minimal.</p>
<p>This kind of DLC approach is still mocked on occasion, especially when developers go overboard with it (and doubly so when the base game is notably barren in that department before you open the store page), but I'd argue that most consumers have come around to the reasoning that these are essentially the gaming equivalent of luxury items.</p>
<p>You don't need them to enjoy the game, but can blow some cash on them if they really tickle your fancy – yet just as the existence of a high-end Rolex doesn't change the fact that a digital Casio tells the time just as well, most cosmetic DLC doesn't detract from the game experience by its existence.</p>
<p>Where this can go wrong is with things like fighting games, where unlocking costumes for the character roster has traditionally been a core goal of progression in many franchises. Consequently, locking up too many costumes behind a paywall really is detracting from the game experience, and goes down like a lead balloon with players (see also: the industry's what-not-to-do whipping boy icon, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/will-players-tolerate-overwatch-2s-broken-promises-opinion">Overwatch 2</a>).</p>
<blockquote>The lesson from the success of expansions like Shadow of the Erdtree is that DLC really can resonate even with the audiences who supposedly resist it the most</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, this kind of DLC occupies the opposite end of the spectrum from the large, expansion-pack style offerings of Shadow of the Erdtree or Phantom Liberty, and it's at those extremes of the spectrum that DLC seems to find the most success and acceptance.</p>
<p>Developers working on post-launch content plans for their games would do well to consider the kind of audience they're working to attract, and pick a lane based on that assessment – either making big, meaningful expansions, or small cosmetic tchotchkes that serve as disposable luxuries.</p>
<p>It's in the middle ground that DLC tends to trip up and annoy people the most – slices of content that aren't sufficiently differentiated from the core game, don't justify either the price of entry, and aren't worth the mental effort of picking back up in a game players moved on from months ago.</p>
<p>The lesson from the success of expansions like Shadow of the Erdtree is that DLC really can resonate even with the audiences who supposedly resist it the most – but if a game doesn't justify an expansion on that scale, it's worth seriously considering whether adding a small zone and a handful of missions is worthwhile at all, or whether simply downscaling to cosmetics is going to be a far better allocation of resources.</p>

<p>If you decide you like it, any progress you make will transfer to the full game, which is currently on sale across all platforms. Like the demo itself, though, sale start and end times will vary depending on your platform of choice, as does the saving: PS5 and Xbox players can scoop it up for 30 percent off the full price, whereas Steam players are treated to a 20 percent discount.</p> <div>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-update-adds-options-to-change-console-graphics-settings">an update for Dragon's Dogma 2 was rolled out for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S</a>, including some specific changes for consoles, adding the option for those on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S to change graphics settings to high or low, as well as the option to turn 120Hz output on or off. Capcom said turning graphics settings down to low on consoles should improve Dragon's Dogma 2's frame rates, adding: "Further frame rate improvements are planned for future updates as well."</p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 has been a hit for Capcom, with the game selling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-sells-25m-as-fixed-frame-rate-arrives">2.5m copies in under two weeks after its release</a>. Back in April, the company actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-success-boosts-capcoms-expected-profits">revised its full-year earnings forecast</a> following this success, combined with the success of its other popular releases over the last year.</p>

            <p>More information has come to light regarding Twitch's 2020 ban of streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm.</p>
<p>Beahm began making headlines again last week, when Twitch's former account director of strategic partnerships Cody Conners stated an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform after they were caught sending sexually explicit messages to a minor. Subsequent reports confirmed the person Conners was referring to was indeed Beahm, something many had already suspected.</p>
<p>Now, a former Twitch employee - who has chosen to remain anonymous - has told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/dr-disrespect-inappropriate-messages-minor-twitch-1235048071/">Rolling Stone</a> that the minor had informed Beahm that they were underage, and Beahm continued to send "sexually graphic" messages to them regardless.</p>

<p>"I recall that Dr Disrespect was made aware by the individual that they were underage during the conversation, after which he indicated that this was no problem and continued on," the former employee told the publication, stating "there was no confusion".</p>
<p>"Messages sent after this was acknowledged were no less graphic and in sexually explicit nature than before, and I think more than the categorisation of 'leaning too much in the direction of being inappropriate' might indicate," they continued.</p>
<p>Later in the conversation, the former employee spoke further about Twitch's decision to ban Dr Disrespect. "After viewing the contents of the Whisper conversation, it quickly became clear the egregiousness of conduct and what actions Twitch must take," they said. "The decision to permanently terminate Beahm was relatively quick, due to the severity of the behaviour."</p>
<p>They also added that following a number of sexual misconduct allegations that arose in 2020, Twitch created an incident response team codenamed Gold Sparrow to address concerns. "We wanted to be able to process mounting investigations quicker and with more resources while providing as much support for the victims as possible," they said.</p>
<p>In the time since Conner's initial post last week (which Rolling Stone's source said "got the ball rolling" for others to come forward with information), Beahm has been dropped from Midnight Society, the game development studio he co-founded in 2021. Other partnerships have also ousted the streamer, including Turtle Beach, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186936/nba-2k24-will-remove-dr-disrespect-from-the-game">NBA 2K24, and the San Francisco 49ers</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/youtube-suspends-monetization-on-dr-disrespects-channel-following-serious-allegations">YouTube</a>, meanwhile, has suspended monetisation on Beahm's channel. Today's report noted Beahm was not offered a contract at YouTube due to the circumstances of his Twitch ban.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">Beahm released a statement on social media platform X</a>, admitting to sending messages to a minor which he tried to pass off as "casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate".</p>

Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-devs-lost-records-brings-hazy-summer-vibes-and-90s-nostalgia-in-new-trailer">next project from the creative team behind the original two Life is Strange games</a>, has been delayed into 2025.
</p>
<p>
Why? Well, the team behind it are keen to avoid the launch window of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-returns-with-its-original-protagonist-now-all-grown-up">Square Enix's own new Life is Strange game Double Exposure</a>, the latest to be made by the franchise's more recent development team Deck Nine Games. 
</p>
<p>
In a press release today, Lost Records developer Don't Nod said its game would now arrive "early 2025".

"We know that many of our fans are eagerly awaiting this game, just as they are the recently announced next installment of Life is Strange," Don't Nod boss Oskar Guilbert wrote. "Let's give both titles the space they need to be enjoyed by our players within the large community we have built. 
</p>
<p>
"We firmly believe that the wait for Bloom &amp; Rage will be worth it. We look forward to sharing this new adventure, which we hope will become another memorable chapter in the Don't Nod universe."
</p>
<p>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage had previously been set for a late 2024 launch. Life is Strange: Double Exposure, meanwhile, is set to arrive on 29th October for PC, PlayStation and Xbox.</p>
<p>While the existence of a new project from the original  Life is Strange team alongside a new entry in the actual Life is Strange series is potentially confusing, the matter is perhaps made even more complicated by the fact the upcoming Life is Strange game continues the story of Max Caulfield, the protagonist of the first Life is Strange game that the Lost Records team originally developed. Got all that?</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-discuss-leaving-their-hit-narrative-adventure-series-behind-building-on-it-with-lost-records">I spoke with Don't Nod about creating Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - and why the team had wanted to move on from Life is Strange</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed">Assassin’s Creed</a> fans “can be excited about some remakes” of the older games in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> series, permits generous soul Yves Guillemot, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed">via one of those odd promotional things</a> disguised as a conversation. They’d like to “revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them,” Ubisoft told Ubisoft about Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the blog, Guillemot repeatedly praises what he sees as the potential for generative AI and how it “can enrich NPCs to be more intelligent, more interactive,” saying this could “potentially extend to animals in the world.” So, look forward to remake Ezio putting glue in his pizza sauce I suppose?</p>

<p>When asked how he “ensure(s) evolution and innovation with each new game?” Guillemot responded: “Technology is evolving at such a pace that there are limitless possibilities for evolution. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, for example, we have a weather system that will affect its gameplay; ponds that were once swimmable might freeze, for instance.”</p>
<p>In terms of the series’ future, he says that “The goal is to have Assassin's Creed games come out more regularly, but not for it to be the same experience every year. There are a lot of good things to come, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-project-hexe">Assassin's Creed Hexe</a>.” More regularly, you say? Not the same experience every year, you say? To be fair <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-mirage-review">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> was quite the departure, I hear, at least from the creeping scale bloat that culminated in Valhalla’s exhaustingly massive world.</p>
<p>When asked what “dismays” and “excites” him most about the games industry right now, Guillemot says that he’s concerned about “the malicious and personal online attacks that have been directed at some of our team members and partners” - which might refer to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">inane backlash against AC: Shadows</a>. He continues that “We, at Ubisoft, condemn these hateful acts in the strongest possible terms, and I encourage the rest of the industry and players to denounce them, too,” which, you know, is fair enough. I mean, I suppose given the above remarks about "limitless" tech, he might have also said something about all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-makers-ubisoft-continue-2023s-gutting-of-the-games-industry-as-they-lay-off-over-100-staff">mass layoffs</a> corporations have carried out while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-huge-layoffs-last-week-microsoft-are-now-chucking-billions-of-dollars-into-openai">investing billions in generative AI</a>, but he’s not wrong!</p>
<p>“If, as game makers, we can adopt and master technological advancements like generative AI and the cloud more quickly, we will be much better positioned to create new, stand-out experiences for players". He says he'd "like it if hardware evolved even faster. The fact that games have, for a while now been compatible with both the current and previous generation of consoles is a fantastic thing for our back catalog and our players, but it's held the industry back a bit when it comes to developing truly new experiences.” Not stagnant, safe design meant to prop up thinly disguised vehicles for unlimited spending on magic purple super trousers then? Nope, it’s the slightly older console owners that are wrong. Fantastic.</p>
<p>This feels like a good moment to bump Mike Cook's article series about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares"> generative AI and its use in video games</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Capcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-update-graphic-modes-ps5-xsx-120hz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deployed a new update</a> for the game, packing various fixes, and adding new graphical modes and a 120Hz option on consoles.</p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is available worldwide now for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Be sure to read our review of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. We've included the conclusion of our review below for those who don't want to read it in full:</p>
<p><em>"This review may read quite negatively, but it's only because of the lofty expectations that surrounded Dragon's Dogma 2. The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering."</em></p>

        <p>Indie projects between $15 million to $30 million will now be covered by its Independent Interactive Media Agreement</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>SAG-AFTRA has announced a new tier in its Independent Interactive Media Agreement.</p>
<p>As part of this agreement, studios that have a project budget between $15 million and $30 million will benefit from union coverage, provisions against AI, and access to unionised voice actors and performers.</p>
<p>Actors will be provided with informed consent and compensation for the use of digital replicas, and will be provided with additional payments based on the number of units sold.</p>
<p>Unveiled in February, the Independent Interactive Media Agreement initially covered projects across three tiers, between $250,000 to $15 million.</p>
<p>"With this expanded scope of the agreement, even more projects will benefit from the skills and experience of union performers, and performers will have more opportunities to work with the benefits and protections of a union contract, including important AI guardrails," said Sarah Elmaleh, voice actor and chair of SAG-AFTRA's Interactive Media Agreement negotiating committee.</p>
<p>"As a union, we are committed to creating contracts and waivers that foster actor-developer collaboration across every budget and scope. Thousands of video games are released every year and each one deserves to benefit from union talent."</p>
<p>Last September, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-members-authorise-video-game-strike">SAG-AFTRA members voted in favour of strike authorisation</a> for video game actors and performers, but <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-talks-with-game-companies-fail-to-reach-an-agreement">failed to reach an agreement with game companies</a> including Activision, Electronic Arts, and Warner Bros about the Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-we-want-to-exhaust-every-option-without-having-to-pull-the-trigger-on-a-strike">spoke to Elmaleh and SAG-AFTRA executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland</a> about the ongoing bargaining, who said the delay in negotiations was a result of talks about AI protection.</p>
<p>"What needs to happen in order for this to move forward and us not to end up on strike against these companies is for them to revisit their resistance and their instance on splitting off our members and protecting some and not others," said Crabtree-Ireland. "That's how this ultimately gets resolved."</p>
