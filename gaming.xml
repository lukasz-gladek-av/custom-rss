<p>'Radiant Starlets' is targeting Switch 2</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you've ever played <strong>Mega Man</strong> and thought <em>"hmm, this is great, but what if I could hook up with the Robot Masters?"</em>, then you're in luck. <strong>Radiant Starlets</strong> is a new title from developer Buster X Buster, and it's looking to combine that classic side-scrolling action gameplay with some intriguing dating sim elements.</p>
<p>The game is targeting a release on the Switch 2, with a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/busterxbuster/radiant-starlets">Kickstarter campaign</a> now live with 28 days remaining at the time of writing. The developers are looking for a total of CA$ 100,000, which roughly converts to just under £50,000, but a whole bunch of stretch goals have also been detailed should funding surpass expectations. These include a Boss Rush Mode, hard difficulty setting, a secret extra date, and more.</p>
<p>So essentially, you'll be able to choose which 'Starlet' you want to pursue from eight main stages. When you eventually encounter a Starlet, you'll have the choice to either fight them or date them. If you choose the latter, you'll need to complete a minigame unique to each character. Successfully doing so will then essentially recruit the Starlet to accompany you on further playthroughs, introducing fresh power ups and unique endings.</p>
<p>With some beautiful HD2D-inspired visuals, this one is looking really cool. We'll definitely keep a close eye on the Kickstarter campaign over the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Traverse Challenging Environments:</strong> Play 8 main stages and face against <strong>Starlet Overdrive,</strong> a world-famous S-Pop group bent on obtaining Dream for themselves.<br>
- <strong>Per-Relationship Speed-runs:</strong> Each partner provides a separate speed run and endings. With Radiant Starlets, you're encouraged to try every boss order. Replay to experience each partner’s armor set, minigame, and story.<br>
- <strong>Partner Specific Mini Games:</strong> Each partner has a custom mini game, designed to unlock partner-specific power-ups and narrative.<br>
- <strong>Armor Designed by your Partner:</strong> Each partner playthrough will have a custom armor set with unique properties, creating variances in gameplay between runs.<br>
- <strong>Custom Partner Charge Shot:</strong> Each partner provides you with a <strong>custom charge shot that you blast!<br>
-</strong> <strong>Get power ups from each boss:</strong> The Starlets have all modified Dream's power source to power their equipment. When he retrieves them he will get a part of their powers.<br>
- <strong>Endings for Each Romantic Partner:</strong> Each Romantic partner provides narrative changes and their own distinct ending.</p></blockquote><blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Tomb Raider TV series based on Crystal Dynamics' iteration of Lara Croft from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios will officially start filming in 2026, with Sophie Turner confirmed to play Lara Croft, per a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/">Variety</a>.</p>



<p>This is the same series that was announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/">May 2024</a> with award-winning Phoebe Waller-Bridge signed on as a writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the series, which will also be part of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/">completely interconnected Tomb Raider universe </a>that Amazon is creating between Crystal Dynamics games, TV series, and films.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team,</em>" Waller-Bridge said on signing Turner. "<em>It’s not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out… Croft is coming…</em>"</p>



<p>For Turner's part, she added that she is "<em>thrilled beyond measure</em>" to be stepping into the role. "<em>She’s such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got. They’re massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can’t wait for you all to see what we have cooking.</em>"</p>



<p>It's good to have a positive update on the TV series, but the most recent news out of Crystal Dynamics is much less positive. The studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs-tomb-raider-unaffected/">confirmed layoffs last week</a>, and even though it stipulated that work on the next Tomb Raider game was "<em>unaffected</em>," it's difficult to take statements like that at face value, especially when layoffs impact the morale of everyone at any developer, no matter what team was impacted by them.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-spider-man-secret-lair-swings-by-providing-six-sensational-drops</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>True believers, the official <em>Spider-Man Secret Lair</em> has been announced. Alongside its upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/exclusive-mtg-spider-man-spoilers-card-reveals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>MTG Spider-Man</em></a> set, Wizards of the Coast have announced several drops of cards featuring the wisecracking wallcrawler.</p>

<h2>The <em>Spider-Man Secret Lair</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/secret-lair-spider-man-superdrop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast announced the Spider-Man Secret Lair will be a Superdrop containing six drops of cards. These drops will feature classic Magic cards reimagined in the style of Marvel's iconic superhero.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-secret-lair-daily-bugle-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=g4hRCsl8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-secret-lair-daily-bugle-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=SXukhCeR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But Wizards of the Coast are being secretive about the contents of these drops. The post contains an early scoop of one of those drops, titled <em>Secret Lair x Spider-Man: Daily Bugle Breaking News</em>. As for the other five drops, they are mum at this time.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the cards in the <em>Daily Bugle Breaking News</em> drop are visually striking. As the name implies, it reimagines the cards as front page stories from the Daily Bugle, complete with a front-page photo, headline, and mana cost where the newspaper cost should be. The artwork is striking, featuring Spidey and other iconic characters like Miles Morales, The Green Goblin, and the Rhino.</p>

<p>The <em>Daily Bugle Breaking News</em> drop will contain the following cards:</p>

<ul><li><em>Fact or Fiction</em></li>
	<li><em>Frantic Search</em></li>
	<li><em>Scheming Symmetry</em></li>
	<li><em>Blasphemous Act</em></li>
	<li><em>Impact Tremors</em></li>
</ul><p>This isn't the first time a Marvel character has arrived in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. Earlier this year, the fourth-wall-breaking merc with a mouth, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deadpool-secret-lair-brings-merc-with-mouth-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadpool</a>, got the Secret Lair treatment.</p>

<p>As for how much mileage Wizards of the Coast can get out of Spider-Man, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-spider-man-villains-bonus-sheet-and-infinity-stone-revealed" rel="nofollow">the previews</a> of the upcoming Magic set have shown that nothing is off the table. <em>Spider-Man</em> villains like Venom and Prowler. <em>Spider-Man</em> supporting characters like Black Cat. Spider-Man memes. It's all free game. The question is how well will it be done.</p>

<p>The Spider-Man Secret Lair Superdrop will be available September 22. The <em>Daily Bugle Breaking News</em> drop will be available in non-foil (MSRP $29.99) and foil (MSRP $39.99)</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-playstation-game-is-now-the-best-selling-game-on-xbox.1287924/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you ever doubted the “console wars” were over, here’s a new piece of data to consider: <em>Helldivers 2</em>, formerly console exclusive to Sony’s PS5, is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-ps5-console-exclusive-helldivers-2-now-tops-xbox-sales-chart-as-sony-continues-to-dabble-with-its-multi-platform-strategy">the best-selling title on Xbox</a>. In fact, it’s the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-first-third-xbox-best-selling-games-chart/">first <em>and third</em> best-selling game</a>, if you count its more premium edition, and it’s currently the ninth-most played game on the platform — mostly beaten by free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox </em>but also <em>Minecraft </em>and <em>GTA V</em>.</p><div><p>It doesn’t surprise me that <em>Helldivers 2</em> is popular on Xbox, because it was a huge hit on PS5 and PC. Last May, Sony revealed that <em>Helldivers 2</em> had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">become PlayStation’s fastest-selling game of all time</a> with 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, and it <a href="https://x.com/alineaanalytics/status/1961422671381504312">may have now crossed 18 million</a> after reportedly racking up <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/augusts-most-downloaded-games-across">nearly a million on Xbox</a> in its first week on sale.</p></div><p>No, what’s surprising is that we now live in an era where companies like Sony and Microsoft no longer entirely see their hit games as a way to get players to buy their own consoles, and instead just want to sell as many copies of these games as they can. Back in May, we wrote about how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661814/xbox-best-selling-games-ps5-oblivion-minecraft">the top three games on PlayStation came from Microsoft</a>, and now it’s reciprocal!</p><div><p>Sony has come around to this position slowly, but by 2022, it planned for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/26/23142569/sony-playstation-pc-mobile-game-releases-first-party-portfolio">roughly half of its games to come out on PC or mobile</a> instead of just console, and though PlayStation game boss Hermen Hulst suggested in 2024 that some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167560/sony-thinks-its-pc-games-will-tempt-you-to-buy-a-playstation-really">Sony’s big single-player games might be held in reserve</a>, the company revealed this August that it’s gradually <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1953483758667170146">“moving away from a hardware centric business model</a>.” It’s about selling games, not consoles.</p></div><p>Here’s where some of you will no doubt point out: is <em>Helldivers 2</em> actually a PlayStation game? Since PlayStation is merely the publisher and doesn’t own its developer Arrowhead Game Studios, is it really such a big deal?</p><p>I would say yes, because Sony has been the one in control, the one making the strategic decisions over when and where and how much PlayStation goodness to share. When players balked at how <em>Helldivers 2</em> originally required you to log in with a PlayStation account on PC, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150327/sony-helldivers-2-review-bombing-psn-login">it was out of Arrowhead’s hands</a>. When players wanted an Xbox version, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-helldivers-2-on-xbox-would-need-sony-and-phil-spencer-to-duke-it-out-arrowhead-community-lead-says">Arrowhead said it was entirely up to Sony</a>.</p><p>Microsoft doesn’t have to cut such publishing deals to bring Xbox’s biggest games to PlayStation, though. When it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date">chose to bring <em>Indiana Jones</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610793/hellblade-2-ps5-release-date-xbox-ninja-theory"><em>Hellblade 2</em> to PS5</a>, it could do so because it owns both giant publisher / developer Bethesda and developer Ninja Theory itself.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/693576/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-steam-notepad">What is an Xbox</a>, and what is a PlayStation, if not <em>the</em> place to play specific games? Is it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">a launcher and a set of familiar controls</a>? Is it a feeling? That’s the challenge facing Microsoft and Sony if they continue down this road.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770311/playstation-game-helldivers-2-best-selling-game-on-xbox#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/770311/playstation-game-helldivers-2-best-selling-game-on-xbox]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a> is launching soon on a new platform. No, the popular superhero online PVP shooter isn’t coming to Nintendo Switch 2. Instead, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-game-director-layoffs-season-2-1851765290">NetEase</a> has quietly announced that <em>Rivals</em> is getting a PS4 port. I can already imagine how loud an old PS4 will sound when Doctor Strange creates a portal.</p> <p>On September 3, <a href="https://youtu.be/67FVMNGMFXU">NetEase released a new trailer</a> for the upcoming fourth season of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, “Heart of the Dragon.” The new season arrives on September 12 and brings Daredevil to the game’s already large roster. However, at the very end of this slick, action-packed story trailer, NetEase included a bit of news.<a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1963275058534600760"> Seen briefly in the final moments of the trailer</a> is the logo for the PlayStation 4. It seems the online superhero game is getting a last-gen port.</p>  <p><a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1962496976731214040">Word of this PS4 port first appeared earlier this week</a>, with dataminers finding evidence on the PlayStation Store’s back end of a new PS4 version of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Today’s new teaser seems to confirm that, yes, NetEase is porting its blockbuster superhero game to the aging PS4. Sony’s old home console launched back in November 2013, nearly 12 years ago. And yet, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> will soon be playable on the old hardware. Some fans are confused as to why <em>Rivals</em> is making the backward leap to PS4 while it still lacks a Switch 2 port. It would seem logical that if <em>Rivals</em> can run on PS4, it can likely run on a Switch 2. <a href="https://gamerant.com/marvel-rivals-switch-2/#:~:text=Marvel%20Rivals%20game%20director%20Guangyun%20Chen%20stated%20that%20NetEase%20is%20still%20in%20the%20process%20of%20obtaining%20a%20Switch%202%20development%20kit%20from%20Nintendo">Perhaps a lack of</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-gamescom-digital-foundry-2000620055">dev kits is to blame</a>?</p> <p>Regardless of all that, it is extremely wild to me that <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is launching on PS4 in 2025. This is a console that launched during the tail end of the first phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is a machine that arrived when Barack Obama was still president of the United States. And soon you’ll be able to play <em>Marvel Rivals</em> on it. Sure, it’s not the first time we’ve seen a current-gen game go backwards with a PS4 port. But it is still odd.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Prime Video’s Tomb Raider series has finally confirmed it’s Lara Croft: Game of Thrones’ Sophie Turner. Even more so, the show now has a new co-showrunner and a shooting date of 2026.</p>



<p>The live-action adaptation of the iconic Tomb Raider series has been in the works at Prime Video since last year. Bringing on Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge as creator, writer, and executive producer, the show would continue on Fallout’s smashing success. Still, you can’t have Tomb Raider without Lara Croft and, luckily, we’ve got a good one.</p>



<h2 id="h-game-of-thrones-sophie-turner-cast-as-lara-croft-shooting-in-january-2026">Game of Thrones’ Sophie Turner Cast as Lara Croft, Shooting in January 2026</h2>

<p>First <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported by Variety</a>, Sophie Turner, famous for her portrayal of Sansa Stark in Game of Thrones, will spearhead Tomb Raider as protagonist Lara Croft. The 29-year-old English actress was rumored to be in the running last year, but had yet to be confirmed by Amazon MGM Studios until now. In a quote <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Variety</a>, Turner stated,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I am thrilled beyond measure, to be playing Lara Croft,” Turner said to Variety. “She’s such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got. They’re massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina [Jolie] and Alicia [Vikander] with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can’t wait for you all to see what we have cooking.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to Turner’s casting, Shogun’s Jonathan Van Tulleken, who’s also working with Prime Video on Blade Runner 2099, is set to direct and executive produce. Joining Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the writer’s room is The Darkest Minds’ Chad Hodge, who’ll showrun and executive produce. Fortunately, we won’t have to wait long for more news, as Prime Video’s Tomb Raider starts filming on January 19th, 2026. </p>



<p>Tomb Raider has had a long line of adaptations since 1997. Academy-winning Angelina Jolie took on the British adventurer in the 2000s, making her a household name. In 2016, another Academy-winning actress, Alicia Vikander, played Lara Croft in an adaptation of the 2013 reboot. While we don’t know what version Sophie Turner’s Lara Croft will be, it’s sure to be one to treasure.</p>

<p>Version 1.9.8 <a href="https://claphanz.com/en/news/nintendo_switch_easy_come_easy_golf_ver198_update.html">arrived earlier today</a> and includes a caddy's worth of improvements for load times, grid display, and 1080p support for the larger Switch 2 screen.</p>
<p>Plus the game, which ran at 30fps on the original Switch back when we reviewed it in 2022, will now let you choos between a 30 and 60fps mode.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vonwkl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The timing of this update is a little curious, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a>, a brand new game in the Everybody's Golf series, comes out on Switch on 5th September (4th in Japan). We've even got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/everybodys-golf-hot-shots">a review up for that today</a>. Is Clap Hanz taking a Hot Shot at Hot Shots...? (Please don't give us a Double Bogie).</p>
<p>Anyway, here are the patch notes straight from Clap Hanz's website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ver. 1.9.8 of "Easy Come Easy Golf" was released.<br>
The content of the latest update is listed below.<br>
- Improved load times<br>
- Improved grid display<br>
- Reorganized home screen menu into a single page<br>
- Adjusted Triple Tap spin input<br>
- Improved Triple Tap gauge UI<br>
- Frame rate selection (30fps/60fps)<br>
You can also play at 60fps on Switch 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you fancy a shot at Easy Come Easy Golf, then we rather enjoyed it back when it released on Switch, scoring it an 8/10. Now with smoother performance and an updated resolution for Switch 2, there's no better time to try it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-release-date-season-4/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Marvel Rivals is currently only available on the current-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, but as of next week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-has-marvel-go-ahead-to-make-original-marve-rivals-characters-director-says-stay-tuned/">NetEase</a> has announced that it'll drop onto last-gen consoles with its arrival on PS4 alongside the release of the game's Season 4: The Heart of the Dragon on September 12, 2025.</p>



<p>The confirmation comes with a new cinematic trailer for Season 4, which lists the PS4 alongside the rest of its platforms at the end of the trailer. Unfortunately for Xbox One players, they're currently left out of the fun, though that could change with a similarly surprising announcement in a future Marvel Rivals update. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Marvel Rivals has been one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">most popular games this year</a> after its arrival in December 2024, and its arrival on PS4 could potentially see another peak to its popularity that just wasn't possible on current-gen only consoles, especially when considering the fact that it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nearly-five-years-into-the-ps5-generation-there-are-more-players-on-ps5-monthly-than-ps4-sony-confirms/">only this past June</a> when Sony was able to confirm that there were more PS5 players active on a monthly basis than PS4 players. Even major games like Genshin Impact are <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-drops-playstation-4-support/">only starting to wind down their PS4 support now</a>.</p>



<p>The PS4 may be a last-gen console, but there are still millions of players who, for one reason or another, have not yet upgraded to a PS5 or Xbox Series console and jumped into the current-gen. </p>

As such, you'll want to make informed decisions throughout your journey to ensure your health, inventory, and weapons are all able to withstand what the game throws at you.</p><p>While you'll start to obtain more of both materials in the back half of the game, the opening hours can often feel restrictive, forcing you to make very tough decisions about what upgrades will improve your chances of success. Below, we'll list out the best early upgrades we think you should go with to feel confident in taking on the challenges ahead.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#What_to_know_about_upgrade_materials_in_Cronos__The_New_Dawn">What to know about upgrade materials in Cronos: The New Dawn</a></li><li><a href="#Best_upgrades_to_buy_first_in_Cronos__The_New_Dawn">Best upgrades to buy first in Cronos: The New Dawn</a><ul><li><a href="#Temporal_Shell___Inventory_Slots_and_Suit_Integrity">Temporal Shell - Inventory Slots and Suit Integrity</a></li><li><a href="#Sword_MK_1615__Handgun____Stability_and_Charge_Speed">Sword MK-1615 (Handgun) - Stability and Charge Speed</a></li><li><a href="#Hammer_PROV_2030__Shotgun____Firepower_and_Charge_Speed">Hammer PROV-2030 (Shotgun) - Firepower and Charge Speed</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="What_to_know_about_upgrade_materials_in_Cronos__The_New_Dawn">What to know about upgrade materials in Cronos: The New Dawn</h2><p>There are two types of upgrade materials: Energy and Cores.</p><p>Energy is used to upgrade your weapons. It's plentiful throughout the game, usually sitting on shelves or other places where you might find items, though it will also sometimes drop from defeated enemies.</p><p>Cores, meanwhile, are used to level up your suit (health and inventory space), as well as your Torch Fuel and Pyre items. These are rare and typically found by seeking out optional paths--such as through chainlocked doors--or by petting cats that are hiding in the world.</p><h2 id="Best_upgrades_to_buy_first_in_Cronos__The_New_Dawn">Best upgrades to buy first in Cronos: The New Dawn</h2><p>Here are the best upgrades to focus on first in Cronos: The New Dawn.</p><h3 id="Temporal_Shell___Inventory_Slots_and_Suit_Integrity">Temporal Shell - Inventory Slots and Suit Integrity</h3><p>Cronos: The New Dawn is very stingy with inventory space, so managing it properly can be a very stressful experience. Is it worth dropping some much-needed ammo to carry a vintage item you found that can be sold back in a safe room for a big chunk of Energy? Should you carry more healing items, or bring along the bolt cutters you found a bit ago that can help you open chainlocked doors?</p><p>It's a lot to think about, but it can be made much easier by investing in Inventory Slot upgrades early so that you can carry some extra items. However, you'll also need to worry about your health, especially in the opening hours when you're coming to grips with how the game plays and may be making more mistakes. As such, it's a good idea to use some Cores to upgrade your Suit Integrity early on, too.</p><p>So, how do you decide which to upgrade? Your best bet in the first half of the game is to switch between the two each time you have enough Cores for an upgrade. Once you fill in the fourth Suit Integrity slot and have your health to 200, you should probably go all-in on Inventory Slots until it's maxed out. The back half of the game is overflowing with stuff to pick up, as well as additional weapons that you'll want to bring with you, so you'll be thankful to have more space for them all.</p><h3 id="Sword_MK_1615__Handgun____Stability_and_Charge_Speed">Sword MK-1615 (Handgun) - Stability and Charge Speed</h3><p>You may be inclined to start with Firepower upgrades for the Sword MK-1615, but since most normal enemies will take between 1-3 headshots from this handgun either way, upgrading its damage is less important than with the shotgun (as we'll discuss below). Besides, more damage is irrelevant if your bullets don't hit their target, meaning your best bet is usually going to be to toss at least a few upgrades into Stability. This will reduce the wobbly aiming and make it easier to re-center after taking shots.</p><p>Speaking of taking shots with the handgun, you'll want to make sure you're charging each shot you take to do maximum damage. So, investing into Charge Speed can make a huge difference when enemies are closing in on you rapidly, allowing you to get your shots out quicker and reposition when needed.</p><h3 id="Hammer_PROV_2030__Shotgun____Firepower_and_Charge_Speed">Hammer PROV-2030 (Shotgun) - Firepower and Charge Speed</h3><p>The shotgun is your true heavy hitter throughout much of the game. Unlike the handgun, which benefits less from Firepower, you'll want to pump up the shotgun's Firepower stat as much as possible. This makes it an immensely deadly weapon against bosses, as well as well as a useful tool for herding enemies into a group and downing them all with a single blast.</p><p>Because you'll be using this against difficult bosses and hordes of foes, it's also imperative that you level up its Charge Speed as much as possible. Even with points invested, it can take quite a while to charge up, but every little bit of time saved is still time you're not vulnerable to enemy attacks.</p>

            <p>Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, we are just a mere matter of minutes away from IOI's 007: First Light presentation.</p>
<p>Things are set to kick off at 7pm UK time, and as a bit (a lot) of a Bond fan, I will be watching along. Please, join me here to chat about what we see (will there be a PPK on show? Oh, or a martini or two?). IOI previously teased car chases, stealth sequences, and some shootouts, which sounds promising.</p>
<p>What are you hoping to see during this evening's Bond showcase?</p>

      <div><p>Beadle &amp; Grimm have launched a new crowdfunding success. Their new project is <em>Skullduggery</em>, an urban fantasy supplement for the latest edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, and it reached its initial funding goal in just 17 minutes.</p>

<h2>The <em>Skullduggery</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the campaign page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beadleandgrimms/skullduggery-urban-adventures-5e/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Skullduggery</em></a> is the newest project by Beadle &amp; Grimm's Pandemonium Warehouse. As mentioned above, the supplement contains new city-themed character options. These include new subclasses, backgrounds, species, feats, spells and equipment, all designed for the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 ruleset.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skullduggery-city-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=TK8wFl4p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skullduggery-city-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=TmV8EEHC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Some of those subclasses reflect a grittier, darker tone from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. The Path of Metamorphosis Barbarian amplifies their body with experimental alchemy. The Grim Reaper Patron Warlock lets casters make a literal deal with Death. The Circle of Vermin Druid provides one command of creatures that scurry in a city's cracks. The list goes on.</p>

<p>As for the new species, <em>Skullduggery</em> leans into the macabre and strange. The new Forsaken species is a mortal tainted by necrotic energies, existing in a state between life and death. Alternatively, there is the Mycelium, fungal plant creatures drawn to the city, searching for their wayward god.</p>

<p><em>Skullduggery</em> also contains tools for DMs. It includes city establishment, organization rules, and a swath of prewritten locations, characters, and groups. These are vital for DMs wanting to run a campaign set in city streets and dubious alleyways. intrigue, deadly poison, and duplicitous guilds. In addition, the book contains a prewritten adventure, <em>The Oppression of Blood</em>, which will take players from levels 1-9.</p>

<p>This volume of content is not unexpected for Beadle &amp; Grimm. The company has a reputation for creating bespoke, premium boxed versions of different fantasy campaigns like <em>Curse of Strahd</em> or <em>Pathfinder's</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/absalom-city-of-omens-gold-edition-brings-premium-pathfinder-thrills" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Absalom, City of Omens</em></a>.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for <em>Skullduggery</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Burnt Haze for $25:</strong> A PDF copy of the main book and all stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>VTT Bundle for $40:</strong> The adventure module, tokens, maps, Compendiums, and add-ons, all on Roll20</li>
	<li><strong>Dagger for $45:</strong> A physical and digital copy of the main book and all stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Blade &amp; Book for $85:</strong> Everything in Dagger tier, your choice of a player or GM Journal, and an Eldritch Foundry Color Mini</li>
	<li><strong>Sweet Sting for $90:</strong> Physical and Digital copies, a GM Screen, physical in-world handouts, and annotated GM maps</li>
	<li><strong>Black Dragon for $190:</strong> Everything in Sweet Sting tier, a set of battle maps, NPC cards, item cards, a set of 3 Blade &amp; Book tokens, and a bonus adventure. All of the above are contained in a Premium Edition box</li>
	<li><strong>Night Market for $275:</strong> Everything in Black Dragon tier, an Eldritch Foundry color mini, a GM or Player Journal, sets of character dice, and a Beadle &amp; Grimm Coin of Completion</li>
	<li><strong>All In for $375:</strong> Everything in the Night Market Tier, all add-ons, all stretch goals, VTT bundle, and Founder Signatures</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Skullduggery</em> Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$163,225, more than six times its initial funding goal of $25,000. The campaign ends September 19th.</span></span></p>

The new ratings will appear thanks to Roblox’s new partnership with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC), which was announced today.</p><p>As part of the partnership, players in other countries will see age ratings from the ratings agency for their region. Right now, Roblox uses its own <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/8862768451604-Content-Maturity-Labels">“content maturity labels”</a> to indicate maturity level of experiences, but these will be replaced with ratings from the agencies in the future.</p><p>“With so many families engaging with Roblox, it is hugely beneficial to provide parents with trusted and familiar ratings no matter where they live,” Patricia Vance, president of the ESRB and chairperson of IARC, says in a statement. “The globally streamlined process will provide Roblox creators with an efficient and proven process for obtaining age and content ratings, while informing parents of what their kids may experience before they play.”</p><p>Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">also announced</a> a plan to, by the end of the year, require all users who use any of its communication features to have their age estimated by the platform. Right now, users older than 9 can communicate via Roblox’s in-game, filtered chat without going through the age estimation process. The age estimation will rely on “a combination of facial age estimation technology, ID age verification, and verified parental consent,” Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman says in a blog post.</p><p>The platform has come under significant scrutiny over its child safety practices, with the state of Louisiana suing Roblox <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760162/roblox-louisiana-lawsuit-child-predators-safety">in August</a> for allegedly creating an environment where “child predators thrive.” These new child safety features announced today build on other recent changes like Roblox <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760805/roblox-sexual-content-lawsuit-age-verification">locking down sexual content</a> and adding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641167/roblox-parental-controls-block-friends-experiences">improved parental controls</a>.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770305/roblox-esrb-age-ratings-iarc-age-estimation#comments">1<!-- --> <!-- -->Comment</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/770305/roblox-esrb-age-ratings-iarc-age-estimation]]></content:encoded>

<p>You've got a bit of time to do so as well, with that November 12th release still being a little while away. It's not like there are any other big  metroidvaniascoming out in the interim to scratch that itch for you. As far as what you're in for goes, here's Tombwater's story blurb:</p>
<blockquote>Enter Tombwater, where shadows lurk and whispers echo from the deep of abandoned silver mines. This is no longer a town where people live, but a town where people die. A once-thriving community, its people have now been gripped by the tendrils of madness. Step into the well-worn boots of a lone gunslinger, drawn to the eerie, decaying streets by the disappearance of Sheriff Elliott Flintwood — a long-lost friend who’s fought to save the town. Uncover the truth by facing unforgettable terrors and fighting through the madness.</blockquote>
<p>There you go, not-Clint-Eastwood's nowhere to be found, get your bum in some chaps and go fight some eldrich horrors. Those horrors, glimpsed from the game's top-down 2D perspective look pretty freaky too. The deputy's covered in red stuff and bones, and over 20 other boss battles are promised as you explore the likes of canyons and mines with some secrets tucked away.</p><p>I'm a bit bemused at a western being as proud to boast melee weapons, spells and tonic brewing as it is a bunch of pistols, shotguns and repeaters you can use to duel demonic dudes to death, but variety is the spice of life. Well, having someone spit chewing tobacco into your lunch was probably the spice of wild west life, but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>If you're so inclined, you can check out Tombwater's demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3308200/Tombwater/">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s unclear exactly how big the audience is for an exceedingly faithful remaster of an RPG spin-off that came out over 25 years ago, even if it does have <em>Final Fantasy</em> in the name and is one of the best games ever made. But those who fell in love with <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> once they discovered it and have been obsessing about it ever since care very much about the upcoming <em>Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster, especially what it will or won’t change about the original, and what it might mean for a potential sequel all these years later.</p> <p>You can find <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-ivalice-demo-hands-on-changes-2000622300">my thoughts on what I played</a> of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics – The Ivalice Chronicles</em> recently behind closed doors at PAX West 2025, but a recent barrage of interviews with the development team has provided some more clues about what fans can expect from the overhaul. The game isn’t out until September 30, but the director of the project has already been tipping his hand about some big questions I’ve had, including how the remaster approaches <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ most broken characters.</p> <h2>Orlandeau Thunder God Cid will still be OP</h2> <p>Every<em> Final Fantasy</em> has a Cid, and <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ is by far the most broken. He joins your party late into the game and comes with a full suite of magic sword abilities with no charge time that do incredible damage. He also arrives equipped with Excalibur, which auto-casts Haste on the user. He’s a wrecking ball that trivializes every fight, which is why I have a strict rule against ever using him.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">If we remaster it, what do you think about whether it is better to weaken " The Thunder God Cid", who was accused of destroying the balance&nbsp;?</p> <p>— 松野泰己🐈‍⬛ (@YasumiMatsuno) <a href="https://twitter.com/YasumiMatsuno/status/1664069034579759104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 1, 2023</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It sounds like he will still be that way. “We haven’t made any changes to characters that were powerful,” director Kazutoyo Maehiro <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-devs-havent-made-any-changes-to-characters-that-were-powerful-because-they-didnt-really-want-to-disappoint-og-fans-with-nerfs/">told <em>Gamesradar</em></a>. “And similarly, not just for the unique characters, but for jobs such as the arithmetician, we haven’t made any major changes.” While some classes like Archer have been buffed, the team wanted to avoid players experiencing any moments of “your favorite job got nerfed.”</p> <h2><em>FF7</em>‘s Cloud won’t suck so much when you first get him</h2> <p>The <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> protagonist has an unusual cameo in <em>Tactics,</em> where he not only appears in the world but can be recruited and used in battle. I won’t get into the story details that explain Cloud’s arrival, but in the original game he’s kind of a pain to use, at least until you finish his side quest. That’s changing for <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>.</p>

 <p>“We’ve made it so that his stats are adjusted a little bit. On top of that, he will come equipped with the Materia Blade when he joins your party initially,” Maehiro <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-maehiro-minagaintewa-interview-sequel-advance">told <em>Inverse</em></a>. “So in terms of usability of him as a character, it will be much more approachable than it was in the original.” Players will also be able to recruit him earlier in the remaster, starting in chapter 4. It remains to be seen if the charging time and attack power on his Limit command will get the buffs they deserve.</p> <h2>The Wiegraf boss fight isn’t easier, but it won’t break your save file</h2> <p>Wiegraf is one of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ most tragic characters and most difficult enemies. Most first-time players are completely unprepared for the unique one-on-one fight with the ex-revolutionary that the game throws them into without warning about halfway through. Worse still, in the original game, the encounter happens inside a castle, wedged between two other encounters with no opportunity to go grind on the world map if you’re having trouble. Without a backup save, a playthrough can grind to a complete halt this way.</p>

 <p><em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> doesn’t make Wiegraf easier, but it does offer a new option to back out of the fight if you’re having trouble. “We have the ability to retry battle, or when you’re doing consecutive battles, you can actually back out to the world map,” Maehiro <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-maehiro-minagaintewa-interview-sequel-advance">told <em>Inverse</em></a>. “We have those types of features for accessibility and ease of play.” Players can also switch to the easy mode if they’re having too much trouble, or they can exploit one of the many strategies fans have come up with over the years to make easy work of Wiegraf and his OP holy sword attacks (including a glitch <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/196bg6h/wiegraf_fight_yeah_you_know/">that’s still in the new version</a>).</p> <h2>Genji armor stealing is back in a day-one patch due to popular demand</h2> <p>Another big fight in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is against Marquis Elmdore in the Limberry Castle. One of the things that’s unique about it is that Elmdore has a full set of Genji samurai gear that appears nowhere else in the game. Diligent players can spend the entire battle trying to steal it from him but it’s very difficult because, among other things, Elmdore has an ability that reduces the success rate below 20 percent unless you spend a lot of time debuffing him.</p>

 <p>Stealing the armor was only possible in the U.S. version of the original game, not the Japanese version or the later <em>War of the Lions</em> port that was based on it. The option is coming back for <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>, though. “In interviews when the game was announced, we received a lot of feedback from fans both in Japan and overseas saying, ‘I wish we could steal Genji equipment,'” Maehiro <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/51058">told <em>Famitsu</em></a>. “Matsuno, the director of the original version, also mentioned the same thing, so we decided to make it possible to steal in the Enhanced Version. This will be reflected in a patch on the release date, so please connect online and apply the patch.”</p> <h2>The Time Mage’s all-powerful Teleport skill now costs 3,000 JP to unlock</h2> <p>This one cuts me to my core. Teleport is one of the best skills in the game, and you can have a character learn it very early as long as you grind for job points to unlock it in a couple of battles. It lets a character try to move anywhere on the battlefield, but the farther the square is from their current location, the lower the probability of success. On levels divided by castle walls or other difficult terrain, however, it makes it easy to dominate the battlefield.</p>

 <p>In the original game, the skill only costs 600 JP. It’s a steal. Not so in the remaster. <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/feature/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chronicles-kazutoyo-maehiro-interview/">As pointed out by <em>RPGFan</em></a>, the skill now costs 3,000 JP to unlock. That’s going to be a whole lot of characters standing around attacking one another before a battle ends to grind for points. At least this way, finally obtaining the skill will feel a little less easy-mode.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> could still get (another) sequel</h2> <p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is far from the only strategy RPG Square Enix has released, even in recent years. There were two spin-offs on Game Boy Advance back in the 2000s and more recently, the spiritual successor, <em>Triangle Strategy,</em> which is to <em>Tactics</em> what <em>Octopath Traveler</em> is to <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>. But for some fans, none of these games ever hit the way the original did and they’re still pining for some cosmic convergence that captures tactical-RPG lightning in a bottle a second time.</p> <p>“Our first and foremost goal here really was to recreate the original game,” Maehiro <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/final-fantasy-tactics-refresh/">told<em> Wired</em></a>. Though he can’t make any promises, there’s apparently a possibility <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> could get additional new content in a future update if the game sells well enough. “If [<em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>] were to become a success,” he continued, “I do feel that that would then lead to discussions around potentially bringing out sequels, for example, or newer tactical RPGs.”</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2's</a> massive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-path-of-exile-2-huge-third-edict-update-looks-to-deal-with-every-problem-upsetting-fans/1100-6534132/" data-ref-id="1100-6534132">The Third Edict update</a> is getting even better, as a patch scheduled for later this week will bring improvements not only to the game's first seasonal league but also to new mechanics like sprint.</p><p dir="ltr">The Third Edict launched August 29 and added Act IV of Path of Exile 2's campaign, two temporary "interlude" acts to help players reach the endgame, and the ARPG's first seasonal league, Rise of the Abyssal. Developer Grinding Gear Games says it's been keeping a close eye on player feedback since the update's launch, and now it's almost ready to release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2694490?emclan=103582791474292391&amp;emgid=521975626158047245" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch 0.3.0b</a> to address various issues.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXLzXS4I2ak" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zXLzXS4I2ak" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Many of the upcoming changes are to Rise of the Abyssal, making the abilities of certain enemies more manageable. That includes the Vessel of Kulemak boss. It will be easier to read and dodge its arena-wide cleave attack, and while its Teleport Slam ability can no longer be avoided, it will deal reduced damage. Other enemies, like Abyssal Stranglers and the Shepherd of the Pit, have had the damage dealt by certain abilities reduced.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of the overall game, there are tons of little improvements, including changes to many areas and enemies in Act IV. Certain bosses like The Scourge of the Skies, Kurtog, and the Great White One will have more abilities that can't be avoided. Other bosses will become a little more manageable thanks to improved telegraphing of Yama the White's Future Sight skill and increased cooldown between Torvian, Hand of the Saviour's skills. In the case of Torvian, the projectile speed of their bouncing axes will be reduced and they'll deal less freeze build-up. Another enemy, Quill Crabs, will additionally deal less damage.</p><p dir="ltr">One mechanic that is being slightly tweaked is the game's new sprint function, which allows players to come out of a roll in a run in order to more quickly navigate maps or flee from enemies. Players found they would still be locked on to enemies while sprinting, resulting in their character unintentionally turning around when casting an ability. With patch 0.3.0b, sprinting will make it so players are no longer locked onto enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">The update will also address a whole lot of bugs, including one that was causing the Warbringer's Answered Call Notable Passive to not summon Ancestral Spirit minions properly. It will also fix various instances that would cause the client to crash.</p><p dir="ltr">You can read the full Path of Exile 2 patch 0.3.0b patch notes below, with the patch expected to arrive by the end of the week. In a recent interview, Path of Exile 2 director Jonathan Rogers confirmed the ARPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-wont-leave-early-access-in-2025-dont-believe-thats-possible-anymore/1100-6534129/" data-ref-id="1100-6534129">won't be leaving early access in 2025</a>. He said "things have taken a bit longer than we'd hoped" but that he believed it wouldn't be "too much longer" before Grinding Gear Games is finished with the game's remaining two story acts. Rogers said The Third Edict update is Grinding Gear Games' attempt at "solving every problem people are currently unhappy about."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Path Of Exile 2 The Third Edict Update 0.3.0b Patch Notes</h2><h3>Rise of the Abyssal Changes</h3><ul><li>Abyssal Monsters can now be bound as Spectres.</li><li>The Vessel of Kulemak's Teleport Slam can no longer be avoided, and the damage it deals has been reduced.</li><li>Improved the telegraphing for the Vessel of Kulemak's arena-wide cleave.

<p>According to the eShop</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Did you know that Yuzo Koshiro, legendary video game composer, has made a Sega Mega Drive / Genesis shmup? It was released on Steam back in July, with our friends over at <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/reviews/steamdeck/earthion">Time Extension giving it a glowing review</a>. It was due to launch on consoles, including Switch, at the same time, but <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/the-console-versions-of-yuzo-koshiros-earthion-have-been-delayed">was pushed back to "mid-September"</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it looks like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earthion">Earthion</a> will be landing that mid-September date, as the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/earthion-switch/">eShop page</a> says the game is coming out on 18th September 2025. That's just over two weeks away!</p>
<p>Published by Limited Run Games and developed by Koshiro's company Ancient, Earthion is a gorgeous-looking shoot 'em up developed <em>for</em> the classic Sega console. That version is coming in 2026, but for anyone wanting it on modern consoles, you won't have long to wait.</p>
<p>Like many of the best shmups, the Earthion keeps things simple, giving your ship a main weapon and two sub-weapons and eight diverse stages to blast your way through.</p>

<p>We'll point you towards Time Extension's review for the low-down, but if you're not sold on Makoto "Karu_gamo" Wada (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gotta_protectors_cart_of_darkness">Gotta Protectors: Cart Of Darkness</a>) and Koshiro's yet, here's a little snippet from that review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Earthion is everything I'd hoped it would be when Yuzo Koshiro first announced it; a challenging shmup which pushes Sega's 16-bit hardware to its limits in terms of visuals and audio whilst combining a high level of polish with tight gameplay and plenty of longevity."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well now, that sounds pretty good, doesn't it? Let's hope that the 18th September date sticks — we've had no word from the publisher or developer on it yet, so keep your eyes peeled.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to Earthion in the comments</em>.</p>

It’s never too late to get mad about the untimely fate of Human Head Studios’ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2">Prey 2</a>. It helps that people keep leaking videos of the thing. The latest batch includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5vbwq7X3G8">an opening sequence</a>, a full mission playthrough from an open world, a flythrough of an undercity area, a prototype chase sequence, and scenes of combat. Watch the bulk of them below, and grieve. Alas for Killian Samuels, the beanie-wearing US marshal turned alien bounty-hunter. He looked so humdrum back in 2012, especially when compared to the original 2006 game’s Cherokee protagonist Domasi "Tommy" Tawodi. Still, he has a certain tragic charisma, in hindsight.

<p>
If you missed the original Prey, ‘twas an uneven, UFO-ransacking first-person shooter with fancy level-splicing portal technology that has now been almost totally eclipsed by comparable features in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal">Narbacular Drop 2</a>. A lot of people liked it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prey-2006-review">not including John Walker</a> (RPS in peace). Human Head started making a sequel shortly after the original’s release, but according to a few former studio members, they only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surprise-prey-2-confirmed">began developing Prey 2 in earnest</a> after the rights had passed to ZeniMax Media, parent company of Bethesda. 
</p>
<p>
Where the first game had been relatively linear, the second was to be an open world affair with a bounty-hunting theme. Bethesda announced it in 2011. But then something went wrong. Human Head quietly called time on the project near end of 2011, despite being “very close to an alpha state, with all major content pieces represented”, in the words of former project lead Chris Rhinehart. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ugh-prey-2-seems-to-have-been-cancelled">Rumours of Prey 2’s cancellation</a> swirled around over 2012, with Bethesda removing the game from their website.

<p>
Then, in 2013, it was reported that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/human-dead-dishonored-dev-rumored-to-be-on-prey-2">the project had been reassigned to Dishonored developers Arkane</a>, scrapping all previous work by Human Head in the process. Bethesda officially cancelled Prey 2 in 2014. In 2016, they announced that Arkane would develop a series reboot.
</p><p>
Released in 2017, Arkane’s Prey is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remembering-prey-arkane-austins-masterpiece">a dashedly fine game</a>, one of the swooniest and spaciest of immersive sims, but it's hard not to mourn for Human Head. The full story of Prey 2's cancellation has yet to be told, but according to reports at the time, Bethesda pushed tough deadlines and feature requests on an increasingly cash-strapped Human Head while simultaneously looking to acquire them. Human Head eventually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumor-prey-2-development-stricken-by-dev-strike">downed tools in protest</a>, and the two companies were unable to haggle it out before Human Head’s contract with Bethesda ran out in 2012. 
</p>
<p>
Accounts of events differ between the companies, as you’d expect. Bethesda have resisted the idea that they were conniving to acquire Human Head, arguing that the project simply didn’t meet their standards. Having watched these videos, I'm inclined to say that Human Head should have been allowed to go the distance.

The leaked videos show off a little of the game’s planned open world bounty action. The game would have let you travel around a teeming alien city that reminds me of Coruscant and G-Police. You’d have been able to boost-glide and ledge-grab to surprise opponents.

The video reveals a bustling population of aliens, all of whom sound like they have acute laryngitis, and some nightclubs featuring holographic erotic dancers, because no self-respecting blade runner’s local can do without a holodancer or two. You’d have been able to profile NPCs with a scanner, take them down with electric boladeros, and enlist the odd Klatoonian as a meatshield.

I’m more sold on the setting than the mechanics – there are passing hovercars, cargo trains, and distant flying billboards with a whole other FPS playing on them – but it looks, out of context, like a project that had legs. We will never know whether the studio could have seen it through: Human Head eventually closed doors in 2019. Beanieman RIP.
