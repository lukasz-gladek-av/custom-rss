		<p>Relic Entertainment has revealed their upcoming turn-based strategy game Earth vs Mars, an original IP that looks like a blend of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/19/advance-wars-1-2-reboot-review/">Advance Wars</a> and classic Martian war romps from Hollywood like Mars Attacks! The game is expected to release for PC in summer 2025, and could be ported to consoles after that.</p>
<p><iframe title="Earth vs Mars - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dh0Jabqmb90?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As mankind sets foot on Mars for the first time, the locals take that very, very personally, hijacking the airwaves to declare war on Earth. You’ll have to lead Earth’s military to fight back an overwhelming Martian invasion, battling against flying saucers, grav-tanks and the alien’s elite warriors with a blend of conventional military units and experimental hybrid supersoldiers courtesy of the Splice-O-Tron.</p>
<p>And we really mean experimental, as you mix pretty much any of Earth’s native species together: “Rain acid from the skies with the fast-moving cheetah-fly. Charge through enemy lines with devastating human-rhino hybrids. Or strike from the forests with your deadly squirrel-cow infantry.”</p>
<p>The game will feature a 30 mission single-player narrative campaign with hand-crafted levels, as well as online multiplayer, and AI vs mode, and map editor.</p>

<p>This is the first game in the new Relic Labs initiative from Relic Entertainment, who are looking to find their feet after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/sega-cuts-another-240-uk-jobs-relic-entertainment-goes-independent/">going independent from Sega in early 2024</a> – this followed the underperformance of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/company-of-heroes-3/">Company of Heroes 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/relic-entertainment-confirm-layoffs-affecting-121-employees/">significant layoffs across Sega</a>. Relic Labs games look to break away from the studio’s traditional stomping ground of real time strategy to explore new sub-genres and release more games more frequently.</p>
<p>The company will still, of course, continue to develop RTS games as their main output, and they have such a rich history that includes everything from Homeworld, Dawn of War, Company of Heroes and work for hire jobs, like Age of Empires IV.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nested-lands-preview-plague-centered-survival-builder.1114188/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/nested-lands-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="32d72e61-e11f-40d6-aadb-371cca8a505e" href="https://techraptor.net/games/nested-lands" rel="nofollow"><em>Nested Lands</em></a>&nbsp;is a new title from 1M Bits Horde that's heading to open alpha. Nested Lands is set during the medieval ages while a plague spreads across the world. As a survival game enthusiast, I was excited to try it out, especially with the focus on the plague adding a new challenge I've never had to face. After diving in, I can safely say that I'm going to be watching&nbsp;<em>Nested Lands</em>&nbsp;as it continues to develop and is one fans of the genre should keep an eye on.</p>

<p><em>Nested Lands</em> gameplay features a melding of village management and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e2fac55-7c08-4df9-8cd3-a855c0dff7df" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/survival-games-why-we-keep-on-coming-back-for-more" rel="nofollow">survival</a> genres set in the aftermath of the Death Plague, though you can still contract the disease if you're not careful. You crash land on the small island of&nbsp;Norovellir and are aided by the only survivor of a small village. Your goal, the one your parents dreamed of, is to establish a thriving village in your homeland. Bandits are rife in the area, as are Plague Sites, making the safety and longevity of a village questionable.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nested-lands-villager-management.jpg?itok=VK4arLB3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nested-lands-villager-management.jpg?itok=garXjFcP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Thankfully, there are many wanderers to be found on the island that are willing to work in exchange for a place to live, food, and water. One house can hold a single villager, and they can be assigned to specific tasks or crafting stations. This is where my biggest issue with&nbsp;<em>Nested Lands</em>&nbsp;currently lies. The autonomy, which is being tested in the next alpha phase, is quite limited. While you can make a villager a blacksmith, they won't make ingots on their own. They will make nails once there are ingots, but won't make armor for you, even if all the materials are available. There's no way to ask them to craft specific items, so they often end up idle due to lack of materials, or only craft one type of item endlessly. Compared with titles like&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8b2075a3-87f2-4c12-a3d9-5541d2d6d84b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/aska-villager-guide-how-to-grow-your-population" rel="nofollow"><em>Aska</em></a>, the villagers need some work.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I enjoyed exploring the island and discovering pieces of history. The first of these comes at the beginning of the alpha when you're shown the cemetery. There's an odd tree growing there, with some sort of skull placed in front of it, almost ceremoniously. Some other locations I discovered while exploring were deep mines and plague sites that needed to be cleared out.&nbsp;Most contain letters pertaining to the general story, or personal notes that were left behind.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nested-lands-cemetery-tree.jpg?itok=sWhTVp0U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nested-lands-cemetery-tree.jpg?itok=5z9wzwXk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Being an alpha test, the little tidbits of lore littered around the island give credence to the bigger story the team is developing. That's the part I'm most excited to watch get fleshed out. Who are the people that previously inhabited the area and what is their connection to the unusual trees you can stumble upon? What other secrets are hidden across the rest of&nbsp;Norovellir?</p>

<p>The available content is a little sparse, with only one residential house and under 10 crafting, wellness, and defense structures able to be built. However, you can build your village to its limits, adding as many of these buildings as you want. The alpha doesn't necessarily end when you reach the conclusion of the main questline. You can continue to explore, kill bandits, and avoid the plague for as long as you want.</p>

<p>More structures are going to be added in later stages of game development, as noted at the beginning of the game when you first load in. Specifically, a cookhouse is mentioned by one of the characters, though it's not shown as something you can construct. Official screenshots also show a medical building, different than the one you can build in game, so we can expect that to come in the future, as well.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nested-lands-official-screenshot-medical-building.jpg?itok=AL6Xq628 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nested-lands-official-screenshot-medical-building.jpg?itok=2ylMUyXM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Along with the village management aspects of&nbsp;<em>Nested Lands</em>, it has basic survival mechanics like needing to eat, drink water, stay warm, and sleep regularly. Additionally, you need to keep clean to help stave off the plague. Characters, including yours, will remark when you smell bad, even stating something smells like it's rotting. Swimming in any body of water or using the bathhouse are easy ways to remain bacteria free. This reduces the chance of you getting sick or your villagers spreading disease around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best thing about the experience is knowing that <i>Nested Lands</i>&nbsp;feedback is getting looked at, especially on how to improve crafting and skills. You can directly impact how the game advances, which skills need tweaking and what ones are good as is. The open alpha is specifically looking at autonomy of villagers and how expansive villages can become, so all feedback on how those work will be extremely important for this test. I know I already sent in my opinion on the village management aspect of the title.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The alpha phase of&nbsp;<em>Nested Lands</em>&nbsp;has intrigued me enough to keep an eye on its development and want to continue my journey in&nbsp;Norovellir when additions are introduced to the game. It has staple survival mechanics along with village building and management. The inclusion of the plague and specific actions necessary to keep it at bay add a unique twist without over complicating things. How does this plague further hinder your chances of survival as your village grows is something I can't wait to experience. I'm excited to see where 1M Bits Horde takes&nbsp;<em>Nested Lands&nbsp;</em>in the future.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Answering GDC's 2023 survey, 78% of respondents said they considered the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/91-of-game-developer-survey-respondents-say-abuse-from-players-is-a-problem/">harassment and toxicity </a>developers receive from the public to be a serious issue. A simple sentiment is often the most effective, and the title of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> veteran Mark Darrah's <a href="https://youtu.be/0mkVfdbVAZE">latest video</a> cuts right to the heart of it: "Your $70 doesn't buy you cruelty."</p>
<p>You don't have to like a game, and you don't have stay quiet if you have complaints, says Darrah. You're entitled to be angry, and you're entitled to express that anger. "If you are mad at that Ubisoft game, be mad at Ubisoft," he says. "Express your anger to Ubisoft or the studio that made the game. But you cross a line when you start being cruel about it." (Thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mass-effect/bioware-veteran-calls-out-the-cruelty-of-fans-celebrating-layoffs-you-are-crossing-a-line-and-youre-probably-attacking-the-wrong-person-anyway/">PC Gamer </a>and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-and-anthem-producer-says-stop-harassing-developers-because-you-dont-know-the-circumstances-that-resulted-in-the-thing-that-youre-mad-at/">GamesRadar</a>)</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"When you celebrate layoffs at a studio because the game that you don't like didn't do that well, you're crossing a line into being cruel, and fundamentally, you should have more grace for other human beings," Darrah says. "But if you're not buying that, let's go on to point two: you don't know what caused the results you don't like."</p>
<p>Mark Darrah! Are you suggesting to the internet that booting up a game doesn't instantly bestow you with a flawless grasp of development's every nuance like <a href="https://youtu.be/6vMO3XmNXe4">Neo learning Kung Fu</a>? I'd call it a dangerous play, but since you've already suggested commenters try a little basic empathy, I can only assume your tolerance for having bile slung at you is ironclad.</p>
<p>He gives an example of the sort of circumstances that might lead to issues. "Say you don't like the line delivery on a piece of dialogue. Is that the fault of the voice actor? It might be, but it could be a lot of other things". It might be the fault of the person directing them, he says. Maybe the writer gave specific stage directions, or the recording equipment went down and they were stuck with an imperfect take. Or maybe the writer themselves was under pressure from crunch.</p>
<p>"Maybe the direction of the game changed radically three months ago, and they had to rewrite this entire character in just three months," Darrah continues, which might well be an example plucked from experience. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, which Darrah consulted on and has attracted a wave of the sort of ire he's calling out here, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">began life as a live service game</a>.</p>
<p>He gives several other examples of the sort of circumstances that can lead to perceived or real issues with quality, but the message is both clear and rings true: game development is complicated, and problems can occur at every level and cause ripple effects. It's also true that more public facing professionals often suffer the worst harassment, and for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-square-enix-policy-will-clamp-down-on-harassers-bigots-and-unreasonable-compensation-requests">issues that are largely beyond their control</a>. None of which means that players should simply shut up about games that don't meet their hopes, but there's a line between proportionate feedback aimed at the company as a whole and just shitting on random designers over social media: especially when you're celebrating job losses.</p>
<p>"Express your opinion to the company that made your game. Tell them what you like, tell them what you don't like. Be specific. It will help you get games that are more like what you want. But when you are personally attacking individual devs, you are crossing a line, and you're probably attacking the wrong person anyway."</p>
<p>I'm concerned here that Darrah's words will not so much fall on deaf ears as ears deliberately chopped off by their owners. Call me cynical, but I don't think the sort of person who goes online to harass developers, writers, or actors is just one realisation away from stopping - whether that realisation is about the material or hierarchical realities of development, or simply the emotional toll the avalanche of abuse can take on their targets.</p>
<p>Still, if anything is likely to engender some empathy, developers speaking candidly about the realities of their work would be it, so hats off to Mark Darrah for speaking about this publicly. Just don't read the comments.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>NetEase revealed today that Marvel Rivals has surpassed 40 million players since its release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by Daniel Ahmad on <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1892494212127502565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), NetEase released its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results today, revealing a new milestone for its hero shooter. Marvel Rivals reached 10 million players within the first 72 hours, 20 million within the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-celebrates-20-million-players-with-a-free-reward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first two weeks</a>, and has amassed 40 million within three months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The results <a href="https://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-unaudited" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that their Season 1 update, which arrived in January 2025, provided them with a “surge” that helped Marvel Rivals cross the 40 million mark and become one of Steam’s top sellers and most-played games globally. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-patch-notes-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 </a>brought a host of new balancing changes to the game along with fresh content such as Fantastic 4 characters, new maps and more. </p>



<p>Moreover, NetEase’s Where Winds Meet has reached 15 million players across PC and mobile, and their Justice mobile game has topped iOS download charts for Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The financial results arrived right after an entire Marvel Rivals team in the United States was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-laid-off-as-netease-guts-entire-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suddenly laid off</a>. The developers revealed later that this decision was made to “adjust the Marvel Rivals’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game.” You can check out the complete statement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-releases-statement-on-marvel-rivals-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pga-tour-2k25-review.1114179/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pga-tour-2k25-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite my avid love for all things sports, I've given up on the idea that I'll ever be good at golf. Something about the way the body must contort to successfully crank a ball down the fairway just doesn't compute in my mind. But like few other games can, PGA Tour 2K25 takes everything I visualize myself doing in real life and executes it virtually, thanks to its in-depth simulation gameplay that lets my thumbs and brain do what my actual body simply refuses to do. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be honest, I went into PGA Tour 2K25 a bit hesitant. While 2K23 wasn’t the worst golf game I’ve ever played, it lacked any shine in its personality or gameplay, which came as a surprise considering HB Studios has been dutifully working on successful golf sims like The Golf Club for well over a decade. Couple this with the fact that, unlike most sports games, PGA Tour 2K took two full years to put out a new iteration, and it was safe to say my expectations were in check.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To my surprise and relief, that extra time paid off: it didn’t take long for PGA Tour 2K25 to impress me with its improvements, especially in terms of appearance. While it still can’t quite match EA Sports’ rival PGA Tour game head to head in their respective visual recreations of golf, the difference is nowhere near as stark as it had been. Player models look much closer to their real-life counterparts, courses are more detailed, and animations are crisper. I found myself pausing while playing multiple times to take in the water crashing against the rocks or comparing the cut of the fairway, fringe, and rough areas for each course. The putting and driving animations are also fluid, no longer stopping abruptly after contact or feeling too weighty. Performance is smoothed out as well, and the only time I ever ran into issues with dropped frames on my PlayStation 5 was due to internet connectivity issues. Even the single-player Career Mode is always online, so there were a few instances where my shot would stutter and even a couple of times where my round didn't save.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I found myself pausing while playing multiple times to take in the sights.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My biggest gripe with the look and feel of PGA Tour 2K25 is the low-energy commentary team of Luke Elvy and Rich Beem. While they are both very knowledgeable, describing approaches and conditions beautifully, their lines could not be more flatly delivered. I know golf isn’t the most exciting sport, but there is no need to sound like a robot when discussing it.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They also seem to have a vendetta against me. If I do any worse than getting on the green in two or birdie putting, Rich Beem will berate me like Bob Barker going at Happy Gilmore—the price is wrong, Richie! At least thanks to my experience dealing with FIFA commentary for years, tuning them out wasn't very difficult. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than that, it’s pretty much all good news. For example, it’s clear that HB Studios prioritized features that the community has been begging for. The most notable additions revolve around approaches, with the ability to change tee position and choose your hazard drop spot. It might seem like a small detail, but not being able to adjust position after a water hazard or move the ball at the tee for a better angle made for some of my most frustrating shots in PGA Tour 2K23. I love the amount of control that 2K25 gives me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another big change is that MyPlayer development has become an RPG system that allows you to unlock specific shots as you go, making your growth in the MyCareer campaign customizable to your specific strengths. Skills in the six trees vary from advanced shot types like the Stinger, which is ideal for dealing with high-wind situations, to proficiency boosts, which help buff each shot. I chose to build a Powerhouse archetype who focuses on driving down the fairway, getting my feet wet against other newbies in the Q-School. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was here that I got comfortable with the new EvoSwing mechanics. The new-and-improved golf swing technique focuses on proper posture, torque, and arc size, and after each swing it even breaks down how good your contact, rhythm, transition, and swing path are so you have detailed information on how to improve. You can even customize how it controls by choosing the classic Swing Stick or the 3-Click Swing, depending on your skill level. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As a veteran golf (gamer) I love 3-Click Swing for the control it gives you over your shot.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Swing Stick simply requires you to pull the right stick back and release to swing, which is easy to get the hang of but it still has to be lined up well to get a good shot. The 3-Click Swing is certainly harder to master, since you have to press, hold, and release before clicking to push or pull the shot and finally click again to hook or slice, but it is something I love as a veteran golf (game) for the control it gives you over your shot. After using it to blow my competition out of the water, shooting 30 under par across four days, I moved on to the PGA Tour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the real deal, the goal here is to compete for points in tournaments, finishing in the Top 70 to earn a spot competing for the FedExCup. But instead of thrusting you into each event blindly, PGA Tour 2K25 features training and scouting scenarios before each event as a way to earn stat buffs and get the lay of the land. Training scenarios are bite-sized minigames, such as target challenges or competing to land on the green quickest or to sink the most long putts. Completing these gives your character a temporary boost in specific attributes, which is applied to the coming tournament. At first, I shrugged these off as ways to pad playtime, but once I played on harder difficulties I realized how what seemed like a minor buff to my drive power could mean the difference between hitting the fair way instead of a bunker. Practice Rounds also give you an edge for the coming tournament in exactly the way you’d expect: being able to play and feel out the specific run and shape of every course just before competing there is a real difference-maker. It is so satisfying to strategize for a course just like the pros would. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PGA Tour 2K25 Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every new feature in MyCareer lands on the fairway, though – especially the new personality and popularity mechanics. We’ve seen all this before in other games like Madden and EA Sports FC: Your pro spends time off the course gaining influence with fans, developing a following, and forming a personality based on the answers they choose in conversations and interviews. While this is a well-meaning effort to give MyCareer a bit more flair and make you feel like the belle of the ball, the system feels just as pointless as it does in other games. All conversations are done through text and don't have an effect on the actual gameplay, so it feels unpolished and isn’t a good use of time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual way to get sponsorships and unlock questlines for XP is simply by doing well at playing golf. This was pretty easy to do at first because the default settings PGA Tour 2K25 feel like child's play: I was easily winning each tournament, destroying the likes of Viktor Hovland by -13 strokes a round. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Dynamic option is my favorite addition to MyCareer since 2K23.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At this point, I decided to experiment with the customizable sliders, which let you tune everything from CPU difficulty to green conditions to weather. The difficulty took the most time to experiment with, as it was hard to find the right percentages to match my own skills, and seemed uneven. In some games, one golfer would score 10 under the second-closest AI rival. However, once I adjusted weather and course conditions to random the playing field started to feel much more level, and scores were closer. Either everyone benefited from the smooth greens and shining sun, or everyone suffered the whipping winds and slick surfaces where the ball glides way too fast across them.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dynamic option, though, is my favorite addition to MyCareer since 2K23: With this, you can choose the number of holes you want to play within a course, and which specific ones, and any skipped holes will be simulated. I don't mind playing a full 18 most of the time, but having the option to shorten the time commitment for some rounds by simming dynamically is a nice touch. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Andrew's Best Golf Games</h3><p>These are the best golf games around!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Microtransactions are, unfortunately, still present in PGA Tour 2K25, but mercifully they are mostly cosmetic-based. Yes, you can dump real money into making your player a superstar stat-wise and decked out with flashy clothes right off the bat, but you'll also earn upgrade points and different outfits at a decent clip by completing tournaments, so they aren't entirely necessary and are less objectionable than what 2K has been doing in its casino-like approach to NBA 2K in recent years. So playing online with others is still enjoyable, since this isn’t a sport where you’re being dunked on by someone who can run faster and jump higher because they paid extra.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same seven online modes from 2K23 return, including my favorite: four-ball. I loved competing against my partner and the other team, as it simply felt more competitive, fast-paced, and interactive than going against AI. For my money, this mode is the next best thing to being out on the course with your buddies competing in real life. Ranked and Casual games also let you choose between Swing Stick and 3-Click lobbies and select which gameplay features and aides you want off and on to make sure everybody’s on the same page. It’s also notable that Societies mode now offers crossplay features, letting you and your friends schedule asynchronous events regardless of platform differences. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/616296/twitch-storage-cap-highlights-uploads-speedrunning<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Twitch is planning to cull some of the content archived by streamers to save on storage costs. On Wednesday <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand?language=en_US#storage">the streaming platform announced</a> that it will introduce a 100-hour storage cap for Highlights and Uploads starting April 19th, warning that users will have their content automatically deleted until it falls below the limit.</p><p>Twitch says it’s doing this because “Highlights haven’t been very effective in driving discovery or engagement,” and it isn’t worth the cost of storing thousands of hours of such content. Twitch is owned by Amazon, a market-leading cloud storage provider — a detail that hasn’t gone unnoticed by streamers criticizing the decision.</p><p>The update only applies to Highlights — specific snippets edited from recordings of live broadcasts (VODs) using the Highlighter tool to showcase the streamer’s best moments — and uploaded footage created using third-party services. Other kinds of on-demand content, including Clips and VODs (the latter of which are already automatically deleted) won’t be impacted by the new storage limit.</p><p>Twitch users who have already exceeded the cap can download Highlights and Uploads before the restrictions take effect, after which content will be deleted starting with Highlights with the least views. To make it easier to decide which videos to keep, Twitch is rolling out a new storage tracker on the Video Producer page, and the ability to filter Highlights and Uploads by length, view count, and creation date. It won’t be possible to go over 100 hours of Highlights and Uploads once all users have been brought below the limit.</p><p>“Introducing this 100-hour storage limit, which impacts less than 0.5 percent of active channels on Twitch and accounts for less than 0.1 percent of hours watched, helps us manage resources more efficiently, maintain support of Highlights and Uploads, and continue to invest in new features and improvements to more effective viewer engagement tools like Clips and the mobile feed,” Twitch said.</p><p>The automatic deletions and 100-hour cap will notably impact Twitch’s speedrunning community, whose history is largely archived through Highlights. While Highlights and Uploads can be exported and uploaded to other platforms, the process is laborious and may interfere with how speedrunning records have been documented on the web. </p><p>“Not just world records, but most every run submitted that was on Twitch is stored as a highlight on speedrun.com. That includes users who no longer run, no longer stream, no longer have an online presence, or may even not be alive anymore,” <a href="https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/928429-channel-page/suggestions/49496519-do-not-implement-100-hour-limit-for-highlights-and#:~:text=Probably%20the%20most,for%20speedrun%20history.">one Twitch forum user noted</a>. “Crippling the highlights feature is going to be an unmitigated disaster for speedrun history.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tripwire Interactive has finally blessed us with Killing Floor 3 and a release date nine years after KF2. The second title delighted in the decimation and deliberate dissection of Zeds. Now, they’re back, and we’re back too to deliver unto them a three-course meal of bravado, bullets, and brain splatters.</p>



<p>Killing Floor has always been no-nonsense in what it’s trying to accomplish. Waves of Zombies (Zeds) trying to kill you, and us trying to repel their unsubtle advances with extreme violence and explosions. I spent many hours in Killing Floor 2 eliminating Zeds, earning cash, upgrading my gear, and having a tense showdown with the final boss.</p>



<p>It would appear <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-announced-along-with-closed-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a> is more of the same, and that’s a good thing. So let’s dive into the latest entry in the series and check out its launch date, platforms, and much more.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-killing-floor-3-come-out">When Does Killing Floor 3 Come Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Take that! Credit to Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>March 25 is Killing Floor 3’s scheduled release date—unless something changes at the last minute.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, March 2025 is a busy month. But, if there’s one thing we need, it’s a ferocious first-person shooter in the mix. <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Killing Floor 3</a> looks to distance itself from the pack with an affordable entry point and unique selling attributes.</p>



<h2 id="h-killing-floor-3-platforms">Killing Floor 3 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC are the listed platforms for Killing Floor 3.</strong></p>



<p>I find most games releasing in 2025 are doing the same thing: Releasing on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It’s rare to see old-gen ports, and even rarer for a third-party title to get Nintendo Switch attention. The eventual <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> could change things of course, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.</p>



<h2 id="h-killing-floor-3-editions-amp-price">Killing Floor 3 Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>Killing Floor 3 has three different editions to consider: Standard Edition ($39.99/£34.99), Deluxe Edition ($59.99/£51.99), and Elite Nightfall Edition ($79.99/£69.99).</strong></p>



<p>There’s no ultra-deluxe-premium edition for Killing Floor 3. But there are physical copies if you want to go that route—although not all editions are available in physical form.</p>



<p>Check out each edition and its price here.</p>

<hr>



<p>March 2025 is shaping up to be a chaotic month for video game releases. Alongside Killing Floor 3, brace yourselves for the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://www.talesoftheshire.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>.</p>

            <p>Marvel Rivals has amassed over 40 million players since its launch, but Chinese publisher NetEase has denied abandoning western studios after it laid off a number of developers from the game's US development team.</p>
<p>In its latest financial report, the company also boasted the free-to-play hero shooter topped Steam's global sellers chart after launch and had over 10 million registered users within 72 hours.</p>
<p>However, earlier this week NetEase laid off an unspecified number of employees from Marvel Rivals' US development team, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">game director Thaddeus Sasser breaking the news first</a>. "This is such a weird industry," he wrote. "My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games... and were just laid off!"</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency">Netease stated afterwards</a> the layoffs were a "difficult decision" made to "optimise development efficiency". However, a new report from <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/netease-is-unloading-its-overseas-game-properties-hurting-u-s-gaming/">VentureBeat</a> suggests there's more to come.</p>
<p>Sources interviewed by VentureBeat said the company is losing its will to make games outside of China, in part due to the high cost of US developers. The success of games like Game Science's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> also prove the AAA capabilities of China's own development studios.</p>
<p>The report also highlights that recent layoffs have coincidentally occurred alongside the trade war between the US and China, which could have further repercussions in the global games industry.</p>
<p>NetEase has denied such allegations.</p>
<p>"As far as overseas business efforts are concerned, NetEase has not wavered in its global expansion plans," reads a statement from the company to VentureBeat.</p>
<p>"Our 'two-pronged' approach, proposed in 2022 (combining self-research and investments to explore overseas markets), is still actively progressing and yielding positive results. For titles developed by the self-owned studios, we successfully launched games like Once Human and Marvel Rivals in 2024. These projects demonstrate NetEase's ability, along with our talented development teams, to produce high-quality games loved by players worldwide. For 2025, we have an extensive pipeline of titles in development, featuring a variety of genres, including FragPunk, Ananta and more."</p>
<p>NetEase did, however, acknowledge a "scaling down" of studios - something that has led to shutdowns and layoffs at an array of studios including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">Mass Effect veteran Mac Walters' Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">Halo Infinite head of design Jerry Hook's Jar of Sparks</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Just Cause creator Christofer Sundberg's Liquid Swords</a>.</p>
<p>"As part of our investment strategy, we started scaling down two of our studios at the end of 2024," it said. "This decision was based purely on business evaluations and was not influenced by other factors. And this represents only a small portion of our overseas studio portfolio. Our studios in North America, UK, Spain, and Japan all continue to refine and develop their ongoing game projects."</p>
<p>It continued: "We are very open and aim to leverage our company's strengths and accumulated expertise to support all developers. In order to achieve this vision, we have implemented an evaluation process, which applies equally to all NetEase studios globally – both domestic and overseas."</p>
<p>As far as the trade war is concerned, NetEase responded: "Regarding the tariff trade war, yes of course we are mindful of any developments in international trade. However, our decisions have been based solely on business evaluations and not influenced by other factors. We highly respect our gaming community in the US and their love and enthusiasm for our games is valued and appreciated."</p>
<p>Could other Chinese games companies pull out of the US? All eyes are on Chinese conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, the biggest games company in the world, which the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-labels-tencent-as-a-chinese-military-company">US labelled as a military company</a> last month. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-threatens-legal-proceedings-if-us-doesnt-overturn-decision-to-label-it-as-a-chinese-military-company">Tencent threatened "legal proceedings"</a> in retaliation.</p>
<p>"While geopolitical concerns and cost pressures after two challenging years for the global video game industry are driving Chinese game companies to re-evaluate their US operations, this does not signal a withdrawal from operating and investing in studios overseas," gaming analyst firm <a href="https://nikopartners.com/chinese-video-game-companies-are-adapting-their-us-strategies/">Niko Partners wrote</a> yesterday. "It instead reflects a more selective and strategic approach to overseas investments, prioritizing projects with clear market potential - a business and fiscally driven strategy."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in its financial report, NetEase stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meet-brings-wuxia-to-the-west">wuxia action game Where Winds Meet</a> surpassed 3m downloads within four days of its PC launch in China - combined with the later mobile release, the game had 15 million players within two weeks. A release outside of China is expected this year.</p>
<p>"We boldly pushed the boundaries of innovation once again in 2024, delivering groundbreaking gaming experiences that captivated players worldwide," said CEO William Ding.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/theres-a-pokemon-day-pokemon-presents-stream-happening-next-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s Pokémon Day on 27th February, and to mark the annual celebration, The Pokémon Company will have a Pokémon Present video.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Presents video will go live at 2PM UK time – <span dir="auto">6:00AM PST / 10:00 PM SGT – on that date.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="February 27 is Pokémon Day!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8gkKHR512M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s as far as The Pokémon Company has gone in revealing what will be shown, but we can absolutely make some educated guesses.</p>
<p>Top billing will surely go to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/27/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-for-2025/">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, the next big console game in the series that was announced at Pokémon Day last year with a 2025 target. An offshoot to the main series, just like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> was, this game takes us to the high tech new city of Lumiose City, where the world is being reshaped as part of an “urban redevelopment plan” to accommodate people and Pokémon together. We’re keen to see some meaningful gameplay from this one, and perhaps get a release date?</p>

<p>Beyond that we can expect plenty of updates on mobile and live service games. That will surely include the perennial Pokémon Go, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/12/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion-launches-december-17th/">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, Pokémon Masters EX, Pokémon Unite, Pokémon Cafe ReMix and the slumbersome Pokémon Sleep.</p>
<p>But will there be any surprises? We’re in a bit of a lull for the franchise as a whole, as Arceus and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/17/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review/">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> both launched in 2022, the latter having DLC expansions through 2023. We know that Pokémon Legends: Z-A is coming this year, but they might see fit to tease the next mainline game for 2026, perhaps?</p>
<p>If they did do that, we could be sure that these games will be cross-gen at the least. There’s pretty much no chance of a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Switch 2</a> exclusive game coming within the first couple years of that console’s life – Sword and Shield was over two years after the Switch launched, to have a large enough audience, so expect the next mainline Pokémon game to want to tap into the huge playerbase that might not yet have upgraded. Additionally, there surely won’t be any Switch 2 chatter before the console’s big <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">Nintendo Direct presentation on 2nd April</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two-now-has-a-release-date-in-the-us-and-uk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content" data-component="article-header">
  

        <p>On HBO and Sky, respectively</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>We've known that HBO's Last Of Us adaptation was getting a second season <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-is-getting-a-second-season">since 2023</a>, but now it has a release date. The first episode will air in the US on April 13th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Season two is set five years after the first series, and is due to partially cover the events of the second game, The Last Of Us: Part Two. That's "partially" because the show's creators have suggested it will take several seasons to tell that story in full.
</p>
<p>UK viewers will be able to begin season two the day after its US broadcast when the first episode is shown on Sky and streaming service NOW on Monday, April 14th.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us: Part Two</a> is also due to arrive on PC in lightly remastered form on April 3rd. It'll be available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/">via Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>The first season of HBO's adaptation was critically acclaimed, and became the first video game adaptation to be nominated for several awards, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-makes-history-as-the-first-live-action-video-game-adaptation-nominated-for-major-awards">such as the Emmy's</a>. It stuck closely to the plot of the original game, with a few exceptions.
</p>
<p>I loved showrunner Craig Mazin's previous prestige series Chernobyl, but I confess I have very little appetite to watch The Last Of Us. It's a grim tale, and while that's arguably offset by the satisfaction of the interactions in the game, I can't imagine passively watching it without becoming deeply depressed. This is not a criticism of the show, mind you, merely an admission that I'm a softhearted babyman. I'll be watching old-fashioned cosy crime show <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26591110/">Elsbeth</a> instead.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The live-action Street Fighter film now has a new director: Kitao Sakurai.</p>
<p>Capcom is "deeply involved with the adaptation" reports <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-finds-its-director-1236140934/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, and it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-action-street-fighter-movie-gets-2026-release-date">still set to release on 20th March 2026</a>.</p>
<p>The Japanese-American filmmaker most recently directed Netflix film Bad Trip starring comedian Eric André. Sakurai also wrote, directed and exec produced The Eric André Show.</p>

<p>Sakurai also isn't a stranger to video game adaptations, having directed several episodes of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/twisted-metal">Twisted Metal</a> TV show. He was also exec producer on the second season of Netflix show Beef, and directed several episodes of forthcoming Amazon series Butterfly.</p>
<p>Legendary will co-develop and co-produce the film alongside Capcom.</p>
<p>A previous incarnation of the film was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-new-street-fighter-movie-gets-the-directors-behind-horror-film-talk-to-me">set to be helmed by Australian twin filmmakers and YouTubers Danny and Michael Philippou</a>, known for the horror film Talk to Me. Last June the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-loses-talk-to-me-filmmakers-1235924842/">pair left the project</a> with scheduling partly to blame.</p>
<p>Little else is known about the film, though Capcom's involvement will hopefully ensure its authenticity. I'm sure we can expect the likes of Ryu, Ken, and Chun-Li to feature.</p>
<p>Of course, it's by no means the first Street Fighter film adaptation, following the infamous 1994 film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue.</p>
<p>The Street Fighter film will be up against its traditional rival, Mortal Kombat.</p>

		<p>Indie psychological horror hit Mouthwashing is coming to PS5 and Nintendo Switch in 2025, developer Wrong Organ and publisher CR Channel have announced. The game will have both a digital and physical release.</p>
<p>Mouthwashing released in September last year for PC, the game immediately getting plenty of attention for its dark narrative, in which five crew members of The Pony Express deal with dwindling resources and extreme isolation, descending into madness that’s accentuated by the retro PSX visual style.</p>


<p>The game has just passed the 500,000 sales mark on PC, with the team writing that this “honestly feels more surreal than any bizzaro psychosis.” They continue, “Everyone, you truly are incredible and we’re extremely grateful to you for taking a part in this painful journey and on behalf of everyone here both at Wrong Organ and CR Channel we want to say thank you!”</p>
<p>The next port of call is the aforementioned console releases. They’ve teamed up with Fangamer for a run of the game in physical form, alongside a digital release on both platforms. You can <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/pages/mouthwashing-physical-edition">sign up to be notified</a> of the physical edition’s availability –&nbsp;it’s sure to be in high demand, like so many indie game physical prints.</p>

<p>The Fangamer partnership will go beyond just the physical game, with a bunch of Mouthwashing merch that will include apparel, plushies, vinyl and more.</p>

			<p>Today, in <a href="https://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-unaudited" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NetEase's Q4 earnings report</a>, we learned that Marvel Rivals has surpassed 40 million players to date across all platforms. Here's the relevant tidbit:</p>
<p><em>Marvel Rivals topped Steam's global top sellers chart shortly after its launch on December 6, amassing over 10 million registered users within 72 hours and over 40 million to date. Its Season 1 update in January 2025 sparked another surge, claiming the No. 1 spots on Steam's top sellers and most-played charts worldwide.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, the game had surpassed 20 million players just eleven days after its launch. In the first month, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> to have earned more than $135 million. That didn't stop NetEase from essentially <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firing the Western support team</a>, though, much to the disappointment of fans. Of course, that doesn't mean the publisher is putting less effort into supporting this highly successful game - but the workforce will be based in China, where development is obviously cheaper.</p>
<p>Anyway, Marvel Rivals will be updated tomorrow to introduce the final two members of the Fantastic Four: Human Torch and The Thing. The former is a Duelist type of character, while the latter is, predictably, a Vanguard. The update also adds a new Convergence map, Empire of Eternal Night: Central Park. There are several gameplay and online matchmaking tweaks, too:</p>
<ul>
<li>An extra 0.5 seconds of grace time will be added at the end of the overtime in all modes, optimizing situations where games may end abruptly (like when players cannot be detected due to certain hero abilities or when accidentally drift slightly outside the valid range).</li>
<li>In Quick Mode, matchmaking for substitutes will no longer occur when a quick match is about to end.</li>
<li>Optimization: Improved loading speed at the start of matches.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the technical side, this Marvel Rivals update adds NVIDIA DLSS 4 support, including DLSS Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU, on PC. We've tested this as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5090 review</a>, since NVIDIA provided advanced access to the feature.</p>
<p>There's good news for AMD users, too. The developers have improved frame pacing while using FSR 3 Frame Generation, so you should get a smoother experience. Additionally, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-anti-lag-2-game-integrated-tech-counter-strike-2-preview-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD Radeon Anti-Lag 2</a> is available now, reducing system latency. As a reminder, Anti-Lag 2 requires an AMD Radeon RX 5000 Series or newer GPU.</p>

<p>A new Lord of the Rings Game is coming—Tales of the Shire. It has a release date, and we know its available platforms. You can put the swords away and forget about cave trolls as Tales of the Shire is a different type of LOTR title.</p>



<p>The early months of 2025 are quite stacked. So much so <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tales-of-the-shire-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game</a> is going under the radar. This could be for two reasons: The reception to Gollum and Return to Moira and the attention being given to other releases. But Tales of the Shire is a new type of Lord of the Rings game likely appealing to a large demographic.</p>



<p>It’s a life sim where you get to experience the day-to-day life of a hobbit in the Shire. You don’t need to pack wellies for the Dead Marshes, and Isengard can stay where it is for now. Let’s find out the juicy details for Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Fishing for food. Credit to Wētā Workshop.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong><strong>Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game has a March 25 release date.</strong></strong></p>



<p>It arrives during a busy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-biggest-video-game-releases-of-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 2025</a> with the likes of Killing Floor 3, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>. <a href="https://www.talesoftheshire.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tales of the Shire</a> might be the one for you if you’re not into life sims instead of shooters, post-apocalyptic titles, and wrestling</p>



<h2 id="h-tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game-platforms">Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch are the peculiar choices of platform for Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game.</strong></p>



<p>I say peculiar because seldom do you see a title release for the Switch, and not old-gen PS4 and Xbox One consoles. This is the reality of the situation, so if you do own any of these formats, you can celebrate and get ready for elevenses.</p>



<p>If you are on old-gen, don’t rule out future ports if the game succeeds.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you picking this one up as a Lord of the Rings fan? Or because you enjoy life-sim games in the region of The Sims and Stardew Valley? Plus, can Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game break the recent jinx and deliver a solid LOTR title?</p>

            <p>Supergiant have released their third big update for slashy dashy roguelike <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, and it adds familiar murdergod Ares to the roster of deities helping you out. Like other immortals he'll offer boons 'n' blessings while smarming at you from afar. The update also adds a new animal familiar - a polecat named Gale who will please defensive players by boosting your dodge chance and movement speed. Which you might need if you travel the surface route towards mount Olympus - because the game now has a "final confrontation" that way. </p>

<p>For players deep into Greek mythology and Supergiant's retelling, the gurgling and scaly appendage teased at the end of the above trailer will be enough to guess the final final (final?) boss. For simpletons such as I, who haven't even defeated vanilla boss Chronos, you might have to look it up. I did, and yes, this foe is definitely large and perhaps even in charge. </p>
<p>Other highlights of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569349">the update detailed on Steam</a> include a bunch more story events, dialogue, and character interactions, such as a sing-song with leafy hunter Artemis. There's new tarot card artwork at the Altar of Ashes (the place you prep passive skills and such before a run). And there are two new enemy types to stab - a jellyfish foe in Oceanus and a hulkin' big lad in the Rift of Thessaly.</p>
<p>As usual with the game's major updates, there is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569404">a lengthy scroll of patchnotes</a> that details the new stuff and all changes big and small. "Various forms of wildlife now may appear throughout the Crossroads," it teases. "Melinoë will sometimes cover up the family portrait in her tent after brooding too much," we are told. And my personal favourite of the notes: "Fixed Icarus missing his targets unexpectedly (unless you're his father and expect disappointment)."</p>
<p>Supergiant are already working on the next big update, which'll look at mixing up boss battles to give repeat runs more variation, along with plans to expand on "various character relationships". But this won't arrive until "some months from now". They're giving no clues as to when a 1.0 release is coming but seem happy to have given some sense of a finale to players who dash off towards Olympus.</p>
<p>"With the core structure of both the Underworld and Surface routes now fully intact, we're excited to turn our attention to filling out more of the game's content categories, finishing more and more of what we started... until we're done!"</p>
<p>The first Hades was in early access for just under two years. Whereas this sequel hasn't been out even a year yet. So if you're waiting around for the final release, um, just wait longer?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At a glance, the footage seems to focus on a pre-Hulk Bruce Banner suspended in midair in what appears to be a testing room – but it’s more than that. Marvel fans will recognize this eight-armed version of the gamma-infused doctor as an unpolished, Marvel Rivals-inspired take on classic Spider-Man villain Doctor Octopus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's stiff and a touch goofy, but the likeness is unmistakable. Squint and you’ll see a well-thought-out concept of what Doc Ock could potentially look and move like should NetEase ever decide to send Otto Octavius crawling into Marvel Rivals. With his arms able to magnetize the player up and around obstacles, WickedCube’s idea come-to-life essentially allows the character to fly so long as he’s close enough to a stable structure – an important note in a game with destructible environments. This rough Doc Ock concept even comes with named abilities, including Havoc Claw for the standard melee attack and a ranged move called Wrecking Grip. At 16,000 upvotes at the time of publication, it’s impressive, playable, and made entirely by one person.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Doc Ock has always been one of the coolest villains in Spider-Man, and his tentacles would be a challenge to implement,” WickedCube tell us, describing where his inspiration stemmed from. “As far as I know, they haven't been fully implemented with playable 3D movement in a game before.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I thought, ‘Since I can't play right now, why not make it myself?’</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The India-based indie game developer previously worked with Space Engineers studio Keen Software House before resigning <a href="https://wickedcube.itch.io/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to focus on his own project</a> in January 2024. He's been looking for contract positions and prototyping mechanics since then, so character work usually isn’t a priority. Creating a controllable version of Doctor Octopus in Unity required clearing a few hurdles, but it’s this exact challenge that helped WickedCube pursue the idea. The rest of the push came from an unlikely source: the recent PSN outage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It all started when PSN was down and I couldn’t play Marvel Rivals,” WickedCube explains. “While browsing Twitter, I came across some <a href="https://x.com/LordDepis/status/1883639630404407479" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>really cool Doc Ock fan art</u></a>.

WickedCube calls the reception “incredibly rewarding,” adding that he’d be more than happy to see the Marvel Rivals studio lift some of his ideas should Doc Ock officially make his way into the game. Although he has no plans to polish the design further, the goal is to release a playable version of the character in the near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After seeing the response on Reddit, I want to share this and future concepts as a YouTube tutorial series,” WickedCube added. “I also plan to open-source the code on GitHub and make the playable versions available on Itch.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase will charge forward with its Marvel Rivals post-launch plans with two new official characters this Friday: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-sets-february-release-date-for-the-thing-and-human-torch">the Human Torch and The Thing</a>. Both heroes follow their Fantastic Four teammates, Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, who launched early last month. It’s a shockingly strong start that outpaces competitors in its field, but comic book fans can’t help but look to Marvel’s catalog of heroes and villains as a universe with limitless potential.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">WickedCube’s post says his viral project was born out of the community’s desire to see more Vanguard, or tank-like characters, added to its roster. Not even the strongest rumor has suggested we’ll see Otto show up in-game any time soon, but the Doc Ock designer says he’s already cooking up more ideas for other potential heroes. Two names on his mind are X-Men mainstays Nightcrawler and Professor Xavier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The character roster at launch is large enough to keep the game enjoyable for a long time, and the rate at which they’ve promised to release new characters is mind-blowing,” he added. “The designers clearly understand how to make a fun game, which, in my opinion, is the hardest thing to get right.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals is primed to deliver its Season 1 mid-season update tomorrow, February 21. In addition to those aforementioned character releases, the content update will add balance changes, gameplay tweaks, and more.

			<p>Earlier this year, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei</a> and developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/omega-force">Omega Force</a> achieved a landmark success with their reboot of the long-running <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> franchise. As we concluded in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-the-best-musuo-game-ever/">Dynasty Warriors: Origins review</a>, there’s no going back for the series now that it has established a strong new gameplay formula – then along comes Warriors: Abyss.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warriors: Abyss - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jn238X1UXoU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This wonderfully experimental spin on the Musou template offers up a Roguelite remix that apes the action-packed lunacy of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>. From a top-down perspective, you’ll descend into an underworld overrun by demonic nasties, playing as one of the many characters from the combined Dynasty Warriors and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/samurai-warriors">Samurai Warriors</a> rosters.</p>


<p>Despite the shift in perspective, Warriors: Abyss will feel instantly familiar to Koei fans. Each of the 100+ heroes have had their own unique movesets lifted from past games in the Warriors series to give them all a distinct flavour. You’ll be met with little resistance against the waves of rank and file grunts who may occasionally try and get a swing in as you clobber them by the dozen. However, as you advance between waves, these enemies will be flanked by an increasingly diverse menagerie of monsters – each run of Warriors: Abyss will inevitably climax with hundreds of foes writhing on-screen beneath a chaotic purple lattice of telegraphed attack indicators.</p>
<p>To help cleave through the madness, players have plenty of loadout options at their disposal. Between phases (in which you’re usually required to KO a set number of enemies or complete a specific mission) you’ll have the option to recruit other heroes into your Formation, each offering stat bonuses and abilities. For your first few runs you’ll likely ignore the finer details of these mechanics, but you’ll quickly find there’s plenty of options to tweak your playstyle, collecting specific heroes to find synergies and unlock powerful upgrades whether that’s an increased attack range/speed or imbuing your weapon with one of several element types.</p>


<p>Recruited heroes can also be assigned to the six attack combos each character comes equipped with. Once you pull off a combo you can hit the special attack button again to summon that designated hero and have them pull off their own flashy move. Naturally, Warriors Abyss also brings back Musou attacks with an additional gauge allowing you to assemble the heroes in your formation and have them wreak havoc on-screen until it depletes.</p>
<p>At its peak, Warriors Abyss conjures a whirlwind of total destruction that can barely be contained from both a gameplay and technical perspective with the PS5 version occasionally dropping frames. Even for seasoned Musou fans whose virtual body counts climb into the millions, this chaotic display will prove overwhelming yet it’s true to the genre. To help master the chaos, you can spend the in-game currency you acquire to unlock and upgrade heroes between each run while also tracking down each of their unique weapons while exploring the underworld.</p>

<p>Your end goal is to make it as far as you can through Gouma’s gauntlet, eventually going toe-to-toe with the game’s main antagonist. Instead of chucking ending waves of enemies in your path, you’ll advance between stages with each area/biome culminating in a boss fight. These are pretty damn tough with punishing attacks that will force you to think carefully, dodging with precise timing and planning your hero summons.</p>
<p>Due to the near unreadable number of effects popping off on-screen at any one time, visual artistry isn’t a primary focus. Each of the Warriors character models are excellently designed (with plenty of costume DLC up for grabs) yet you see very little of them amidst the swarm of demons and a never-ending onslaught of screen-filling attack animations. There’s very little appealing about the enemy or environment designs and though some fans will take an interest in the narrative that weaves together playthroughs, I opted to skip most of the dialogue.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-2%E2%80%99s-tower-raid-mode-is-now-permanently-in-the-game.1114101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-2-tower-raid-mode-permanent-feature/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dying Light 2: Stay Human has a new permanent game mode, but it’s one you’ve probably played before. The team at Techland has pushed ‘Tower Raid’ into the game permanently, bolstering the intense roguelite mode with fresh challenges and mechanics.</p>



<p>As a live-service title, Dying Light 2 is regularly updated with new content drops, bounties, limited-time events, and skin packs. Out of all those deliverables, Tower Raid is one of the most positively received add-ons since the game emerged in 2022, and fans are happy to see it made into a permanent fixture in the open-world, zombie-slaying title.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fail-get-tougher-repeat">‘Fail, Get Tougher, Repeat’</h2>



<p>Tower Raid is what it sounds like. Players – either solo or with friends – are tasked with ascending a tower packed with enemies that get increasingly difficult to defeat the higher you go. There are three difficulty tiers, with the topmost level, ‘Elite’, being nothing short of punishing – but it yields incredible rewards.</p>



<p>Players are invited to pick from four classes, each boasting a unique skill set and loadout. The inherent roguelite nature of the mode means that you can mix and match your playstyles to see what works best, as every time you enter the tower, you’ll never really know what to expect.</p>



<p>To welcome the permanent mode, Techland has added new rewards to the ‘Raid Hub’, fronted by a trader called Sola. If you play Tower Raid, you can unlock:</p>



<ul>
<li>Office Day Outfit</li>



<li>Kuai Dagger</li>



<li>Silenced Pistol</li>
</ul>



<p>Amongst other things, of course.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end here, though. Techland has stressed that, after a few weeks on the market, a survey will be posted for players to give their feedback about the upgraded Tower Raid mode. That means that things could get even better.</p>



<p>Recently, Techland laid out a roadmap of content in celebration of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/techland-dying-light-next-era-10th-anniversary/">10th anniversary of Dying Light</a>. I caught up with the team to learn about what happened to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-dying-light-my-apocalypse-edition/">$386,000 collector’s edition</a>, and at Gamescom, I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/">spoke to Roger Craig Smith</a> about the upcoming release of Dying Light: The Beast.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Dying Light 2: Stay Human? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
The Pokémon Company's annual Pokémon Presents broadcast has now been confirmed to air next week, on Thursday 27th February at 2pm UK time. That's 6am Pacific Time, or 9am Eastern.
</p>
<p>
Every year, Pokémon holds a presentation on this date to mark the anniversary of the original Pokémon Red and Green titles launching in Japan for Game Boy. This year is no different. 
</p>
<p>
So, what do we expect to see?

This year's biggest Pokémon launch will undoubtedly be Pokémon Legends Z-A, which was announced last year in a brief teaser that curiously did not show any gameplay. The title is a Switch 1 game, but will we see a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> version confirmed - or the game running on Nintendo's newly-announced hardware?
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Legends Z-A is set to take players back to the Kalos region</a>, the setting of Pokémon X and Y, and looks like it will once again feature the popular Mega Evolution mechanic.
</p>
<p>
As another Legends game, it will likely have more of an action-RPG focus, similar to the previous Pokémon Legends Arceus. But where that game was set in the distant past, Z-A appears to be set in the modern day or near future.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a big focus on Z-A, Presents will likely feature a look at the franchise's other various ongoing games - such as Pokémon Unite, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>.
</p>
<p>
This week, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">Pokémon Go is in talks to be sold to the Saudi-backed Savvy Games Group</a>, in a deal worth  $3.5bn. But don't expect to hear an update on that next week.
</p>
<p>
As ever, Eurogamer will be covering all the announcements from Pokémon Presents - join us then for more.

            <p>The second major update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> is now available, adding a new Olympian: the god of war.</p>
<p>Appropriately named the Warsong Update, Ares has now been added (but redesigned) along with all of his boons, which look to be similar to those in the first game.</p>
<p>Also added is The Final Confrontation, with a new discovery to make atop Mount Olympus. Say no more.</p>

<p>The update also includes a new animal familiar to aid in battle, new arcana arts, new enemies, new music, and new ways to relax in the Crossroads, all as per the trailer above.</p>
<p>And of course, the story expands with new events too.</p>
<p>Over on Steam, developer Supergiant Games has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569404">detailed all the additions</a> - along with quality of life tweaks and bug fixes, there are reworked boons and blessings, new upgrades and keepsakes, changes to level designs and more.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-new-region-weapon-familiars-and-more-in-first-major-early-access-update">first major update for Hades 2</a> (the Olympic Update) was back in October last year, which the Warsong Update follows along with other smaller patches.</p>
<p>The game remains in early access for now and, as noted in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350?emclan=103582791472836561&amp;emgid=503942841152569349">separate Steam blog</a>, a third major update is planned. There's still no release date for version 1.0.</p>
<p>"We're excited to have launched this Major Update, since it includes numerous ideas we've been eager to implement since we started working on Hades 2 years ago!" the post reads.</p>
<p>"But we're not finished yet, and have already made plans for our third Major Update, which we intend to deliver some months from now. Note it's still too early to share our plans beyond that, including when our v1.0 launch will be."</p>
<p>Last year creative director Greg Kasavin said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-in-early-access-at-least-through-the-end-of-this-year-says-creative-director">game would be in early access "at least through the end of this year"</a>. It seems that's set to extend for a while yet.</p>
<p>"Supergiant's first ever sequel may feel very comfortable and familiar, but Hades' best weapon remains the power of surprise," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2 early access review</a>. Clearly there are still plenty more surprises to come.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-asia-joins-forces-thailand-game-show/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Gamescom team has revealed a monumental partnership between Gamescom Asia and the Thailand Game Show, the fruits of which will be witnessed later this year. Gamescom is the leading name in gaming events and over the last four years, the Asian representation of that label has gone from strength to strength.</p>



<p>Now, Gamescom Asia will be relocated from Singapore to Bangkok, linking up with the Thailand Game Show to welcome more visitors than ever before.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-historic-collaboration">‘Historic Collaboration’</h2>



<p>In a press release published by the Gamescom PR team, the new partnership was celebrated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This partnership is a game-changer for the region’s games industry. gamescom asia’s success has been built on a solid foundation in Singapore, where it has flourished since its inception in 2021, positioning Southeast Asia as a hub for gaming innovation. </p>



<p>By joining forces with Thailand Game Show, we are unlocking unprecedented opportunities to connect global video game players with one of the world’s most vibrant and passionate gaming communities. With its rich culture and expanding gaming ecosystem, Bangkok is the ideal stage for this exciting next chapter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The President of Thailand’s Digital Economy Promotion Agency echoed that sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The collaboration between gamescom asia and Thailand Game Show marks a significant milestone for Thailand’s growing role in the global gaming industry. This partnership strengthens our commitment to advancing digital innovation and creativity. </p>



<p>DEPA and the local gaming industry are excited to be part of this unified event, creating new opportunities for global collaboration, investment, and talent development, and reinforcing Thailand’s position as a leading destination in the digital entertainment sector.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The 2024 edition of Gamescom Asia attracted more than 40,000 attendees from 78 countries, the press release explained. It’s not as gargantuan as the core version of Gamescom, which takes place annually in Cologne, Germany, but it’s growing – and that’s all that matters.</p>



<p>This kind of ‘combination activity’ isn’t a new concept. Last year in the United Kingdom, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/egx-mcm-comic-con-same-event/">MCM and EGX</a>, two of the biggest pop culture and gaming events in the nation, joined forces to produce one mega event.</p>

			<p>Netflix has recently laid off a number of employees at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio. The news was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by website Game Developer, with Netflix declining to comment on the story. Reportedly, the studio's upcoming projects lineup hasn't been impacted, so it might be a relatively small number. Still, it's yet another instance of game industry layoffs. Just over the last handful of months, we've had to cover layoffs at <a href="https://wccftech.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-lays-off-employees-focusing-on-smite-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hi-Rez</a> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/hi-rez-studios-lays-off-developers-from-smite-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twice</a>, actually), <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocksteady-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocksteady</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-lay-off-hundreds-of-california-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Activision Blizzard</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tequila-works-cancels-game-and-lays-off-a-few-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tequila Works</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-more-staff-making-it-the-second-round-of-layoffs-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riot Games</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-montreal-lays-off-99-staff-members-majority-were-subcontractors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warner Bros.

<p>Netflix <a href="https://wccftech.com/night-school-studio-is-the-first-game-developer-purchased-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> Night School Studio in September 2021 for an undisclosed sum to bolster its gaming output. Almost two years later, the California-based developer launched Oxenfree II: Lost Signals. On Wccftech, the game earned an 8 out of 10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-familiar-yet-distant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from reviewer Ule Lopez</a>:</p>
<p><em>Oxenfree 2 feels like it relies on its dialogue system a bit too much as its more exciting elements take a backseat. While the dialogue is still incredible, the appearance of these more unique sequences left me often asking where I would be able to find more of the unique time-altering puzzles and surreal visuals that also made it stand out over other games. The character writing is still as good as the first game, but it feels like more could have been done to make it stand above the first game.</em></p>
<p>Netflix made the news around three months ago because Mike Verdu, VP at GenAI for Netflix Games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-investing-in-generative-ai-for-games-after-closing-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> about a big push to use AI technologies:</p>
<p><em>I am working on driving a "once in a generation" inflection point for game development and player experiences using generative AI. This transformational technology will accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players.</em></p>
<p><em>I am focused on a creator-first vision for AI, one that puts creative talent at the center, with AI being a catalyst and an accelerant. AI will enable big game teams to move much faster, and will also put an almost unimaginable collection of new capabilities in the hands of developers in smaller game teams.</em></p>
<p>The controversy was that Netflix had just <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-closes-down-aaa-game-studio-that-was-working-on-a-third-person-arpg-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed down its only triple-A game studio</a>, which was working on a third-person action role-playing game for PC. This made it seem like the company was interested in 'replacing' workers with AI tech. Time will tell if that's truly the direction they are set on.</p>

And they would probably just ask themselves, why am I working all the time? I don’t do literally anything else.”</p><p>Making it harder for him to work, beyond the human need to sleep, is the fact that at age 15, MrBeast was diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease, he says. </p><p>“I just get sick all the time, like random rashes and things like that,” said the creator. “So it’s pretty, pretty brutal, to be honest, and then it randomly clears up sometimes and just makes you very sick, very tired. It hurts like crazy, because it gets very inflamed, and it feels like someone’s stabbing me in the gut with like a knife constantly.”</p><h2 id="h104352"><a id=""></a>MrBeast talks money, BeastGames, and being broke</h2><p>Still, despite the pain, mental health problems, and death threats, all this work has made <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-accidentally-ordered-burgers-from-a-youtuber-1845965201&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-accidentally-ordered-burgers-from-a-youtuber-1845965201">MrBeast a lot of money</a></span>, right?

Which, yeah, that’s less than I expected, though there are some really big numbers between 1 and 999,999. But while it’s clear that MrBeast has money and a lot of it, if you ask him about it, it seems like he doesn’t like being rich. </p><p>“It was like so much easier when you’re broke, if you don’t travel constantly,” said MrBeast. “Life is so easy when you just wake up in your own bed and work 15 hours compared with all this fucking bullshit where I’m like, ‘I don’t know the time zone I’m in, I don’t know what place on it’...some days I’m going to 10am, other days I’m going to 5pm.”</p><p>I’m not sure life is easier when you are poor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/duet-night-abyss-preview-all-the-boobs-in-the-world-cant-hide-its-shallow-grind<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Duet Night Abyss is a fantasy multiplayer game that’s hotly anticipated in the gacha gaming community. It’s all about cool-looking combat, grinding, and oh yeah – boobs. And based on what I’ve played so far, the busty barmaids and endless slog for incrementally better gear aren’t likely to capture your attention for very long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I played an early PC build of Duet Night Abyss ahead of its closed beta test, with the caveat that I wasn’t able to experience multiplayer functionality, so consider this preview to be more about Duet Night’s mechanics, world, and the grand narrative that underpins it all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your player character, a beautiful waif in bandages, awakens in a swirling snowfield. Mysterious voices speak to you. You are helpless and breathy. But out of the snow, someone reaches for you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s Berry, a major character who’ll see you through the basics of movement in this world: most notably, the Helix Jump – a slick way of vaulting yourself through the air. There’s no cooldown on that jump, and you’ll find quickly that it’s a fun and efficient way of getting around – and powerful in combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once separated from Berry, you’ll really begin to come into your own – both gameplay-wise and narratively speaking. Broke in a strange new city run by the ominously named Empire, you must become a “Phoxhunter,” picking up “commissions” at a rough-and-tumble tavern owned by the world’s least believable barmaaid. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But wait. That’s only half the story. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Double Take</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a second protagonist, a male version who looks strikingly similar to the girl you just met. The idea is that these two show different sides of the same narrative. In the city, the girl sees townsfolk experiencing discrimination, violence, and cruelty at the hands of the Empire. Meanwhile, the boy is a part of the Empire, commanding the same brutish soldiers who are now wounded and pitiful after battle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much has been made of these dual protagonists and plotlines, but frankly, I don’t think they’re as revolutionary as the developer seems to think they are. There were no surprises, no events in one character’s story that might make the other’s revelatory. Of course, this is early on, and I hope to be proven wrong as more story content becomes available.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, solid story or not, this game’s art is beautiful. I loved the linework, the colours, the fluid animation. I tend to approach the anime aesthetic with skepticism, so trust that my praise says something about how polished and breathtaking the aesthetic was. Unfortunately, I began to feel less enthusiastic the boobier Duet Night became (more on that later).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The English voiceover is absolutely fantastic, one of Duet Night’s highlights. As I progressed and met more characters, I found each one’s voice and dialogue distinct and full of individual personality. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’re through the initial story quests, you’ll be participating in a lot of combat. It’ll be familiar to anyone who has ever played any kind of hack-and-slash, but it’s fun for a while. All the shiny sword slashes and oversized guns look epic, especially paired with the Helix Jump ability.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Switching between melee and ranged weapons is seamless. And to really hone your killing skills, you can equip the ridiculously named Demon Wedges: equippable supplements to your weapons that bump up various stats. You can mix-and-match a few of these at any time, playing around with combinations to find synergies that could take your combat to the next level.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Daily Grind</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I still have an unclear sense of Duet Night’s intended monetization model. There are hints, of course, such as multiple currencies – I was overwhelmed trying to understand where to obtain each one, and what each one could buy. Though there didn’t yet appear to be an interface to spend IRL money, you can bet that’s coming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not going to mince words: Duet Night Abyss is a grindfest. Take the “Retrace” system, which is a dice roll to win a bunch of random new weapons to pick from. It’s literally “click a button and see what you get.” Your rewards may be epic, but are mostly not. Provided you have enough of the “Hourglass” currency, you can just hammer that Retrace button like a slot machine. It’s one of the least engaging things I have ever seen in my time as a gamer.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m not going to mince words: Duet Night Abyss is a grindfest.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also pick up “commissions” from the aforementioned tavern, which are instances where you’ll do most of your flashy combat. They may have different themes (a church overgrown with grass, for example, or a mine), but they all follow the same formula: a bunch of rooms that look exactly the same, where you can defeat increasingly difficult – and boring – waves of monsters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can grind for weapons to craft into better weapons. Grind for coins to buy cosmetic items, like a chicken for your head. Grind to obtain new playable avatars (most of them busty women). Or you can enter “Sandrealm Meditation,” which is a euphemism for practicing your combat skills via – you guessed it – grinding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But all the flashy abilities, gear, and flower hats you’re grinding for mean nothing without an audience to impress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, I did not experience any of Duet Night's social aspects. The instances can match you up with three other players – friends or randoms – but given that I was playing before the closed beta began, there was no one for me to match up with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Duet Night will feel like less of a grind as it opens up to players and a community grows, though I’m not sure at this stage what that would look like.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Alone in a Crowd</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I recognize that grindy games do have an audience, but as a game reviewer, I feel icky recommending them when there are so many more engaging, delightful, and dare I say interactive games out there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the beginning, I thought I might like Duet Night Abyss. In those first moments I felt like I was watching a beautifully animated film, and intrigued where the waif’s story might lead me – even if I did have to grind my way there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But then the, uh, curvaceous women began appearing. This isn’t uncommon in anime – but it immediately narrows the audience down to one of… specific tastes. I personally felt isolated: as slick as Duet Night Abyss was, I could never fully appreciate the better parts of it, such as the art or cute side quests, knowing that this game wasn’t looking for players like me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an audience out there for Duet Night Abyss. But it isn’t me. Maybe it’ll be you.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Strengthen the Main Character’s Abilities with Power-Up Items Called “Artifacts”</strong></p><p>By positioning the main character and supporting characters within a Magic Circle, the supporting characters’ power, known as “<a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>,” flows toward the main character. The main character’s abilities are enhanced by placing and activating magical items called “Artifacts,” which provide various enhancement effects on the spaces where Mana flows.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>—Use Artifacts to power-up the main character.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—By placing the Artifact “Stone Guard” on green space, the main character’s DEF will increase.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>Among the Artifacts are “Anywhere Artifacts,” which can be placed on any space, regardless of its type. They are useful as they can be conveniently placed anywhere.</p><p><em>—“Mana Plus” is a useful Artifact that can be placed on any space, regardless of type. It restores Mana when your Mana reaches zero.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Some Spaces Activate an Effect Even without Placing an Artifact</strong></p><p>Some spaces in a Magic Circle activate effects by simply having Mana following through them. These are called “Fixed Spaces.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>Fixed Spaces have various effects, such as always reviving dead supporting characters when passing through a dungeon gate, or switching the equipped weapon to the one placed on a space while active.</p><p><strong>Customize Skills and Magic with Magic Circles</strong></p><p>Magic Circles can also enhance the skills and magic assigned to the main character.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>By placing an Artifact on a space marked “Skill Magic 1” in a Magic Circle, you can enhance the skill or magic assigned to that slot.</p><p>Not only can you expand the range and increase the power of your skills, you can also increase their level.</p><p><em>—Double a skill’s level to increase its power and expand its range!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_008.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_009.jpg"></a></figure><p>High-level skills and magic consume a lot of SP, so they can’t be used frequently. In such cases, you can use Artifacts to “lower their level” or “increase their power,” combining them to create various effects. Explore and find the combination that best suits your gameplay style and the dungeon you’re trying to clear.</p><p><strong>“Titles” Further Enhance Artifacts</strong></p><p>Some Artifacts have special effects called “Titles.” These Titles enhance Artifacts further.</p><p><em>—The effects of Titles can be checked by pressing the “<a title="Platforms > Switch [16,675 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>” button on Artifacts list.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p>One notable Title is “Union.” When you place Artifacts with the same “Union” Title next to each other, they will “unite” and share each other’s effects. For example, if you place an Artifact that increases ATK by 1 next to one that increases DEF by 1, both ATK and DEF will increase by 2. “Union” is a powerful Title, as its effects stack with the number of connected “Union” Titles.</p><p><em>—The enhancement effects of “Union” Artifacts can be easily checked.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_011.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Many New Artifacts Appear, Including “Wide,” “Twin,” and “Zero”</strong></p><p>“Wide” is a powerful Artifact that doubles the effects of all spaces beyond where it is placed. If “Wide” is placed on a skill or magic space, it will turn the skill or magic into a wide-range (wide) version.</p><p><em>—Here is a look at the same magic before and after the placement of a “Wide” Artifact. After placement, the wall of flames effect has a wider range.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_012.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_013.jpg"></a></figure><p>“Twin” transforms into the Artifact placed on the next space, granting you twice the power. Additionally, Mana consumption is halved, allowing you to double the strength of powerful Artifacts at half the cost.</p><p><em>—After the placement of a “Twin” artifact next to an Artifact that requires 11 Mana and increases ATK by 3, Mana cost decreases to 5 while ATK now increases by 6.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_014.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_015.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_016.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_017.jpg"></a></figure><p>“Zero” is an Artifact that enables the Artifact placed on the next space to activate with zero Mana. If the next space is a Fixed Space, its effect will be nullified.</p><p><em>—With “Zero,” you can use Artifacts that consume a lot of Mana or activate Fixed Spaces with debuff effects without having to worry about the drawbacks.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_018.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_019.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Enhancement 2. Power-Up By Placing Supporting Characters in Your <a title="Genres > Party [86 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a>! They Will Shoulder the Main Character’s Burden!</strong></p><p>Supporting characters placed in a Magic Circle act as a shield for the main character, taking damage in their place when attacked. The main character will not take any damage unless the HP of all supporting characters reaches zero.</p><p><em>—Simply place three supporting characters to boost your HP by three characters’ worth and significantly power you up!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_020.jpg"></a></figure><p>However, if a supporting character’s HP drops to zero and they are defeated, the Artifact buffs provided by that supporting character will disappear, causing the main character to lose power. To prevent this, consider placing supporting characters with high HP, or position supporting characters with low HP inside a Magic Circle where they are less likely to be attacked.</p><p><em>—When all the supporting characters’ HP reaches zero, the main character can be directly attacked.

It is especially useful in boss battles.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_027.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_028.jpg"></a></figure><p>The Saint Magic Circle “Honor” is a highly effective Magic Circle for dungeons with many traps. On floors that are multiples of three (such as the third, sixth, and so on), it grants the “Flying” state, allowing you to bypass all ground traps. It is especially useful in dungeons with multiple floors that are multiples of three.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_029.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_030.jpg"></a></figure><p>In addition to these, there are over 20 types of Magic Circles that each class can learn. There are also special Magic Circles that can be obtained by clearing specific “Magic Maps” (Mapgeons) under certain conditions.</p><p><strong>Develop and Level Up Your Characters in Magic Circles</strong></p><p>Magic Circles not only enhance characters, they also serve as a party development system. Supporting characters placed in a Magic Circle and exploring dungeons with you will gain experience points and level up. By using Magic Circles that allow you to set more supporting characters, you can level up your party more efficiently.</p><p><em>—Somewhere in the world is a hidden Magic Circle that allows the placement of 16 supporting characters…!?</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Cladun-X3_2025_02-20-25_031.jpg"></a></figure><p>There are also Artifacts that can boost the stats that increase when a supporting character levels up.

            <p>
Sony has responded to former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> and Marathon reboot director Christopher Barrett's $200m USD wrongful dismissal lawsuit, detailing Barrett's alleged 'disturbing communications' with female subordinates - including "sexually charged games of 'Truth or Dare'".
</p>
<p>
Barrett's departure from Bungie was first reported last March, amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">word of a leadership shakeup</a> at the studio. However, it was later claimed Barrett was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-reportedly-ousted-following-inappropriate-behaviour">fired from his role following an internal investigation</a> into accusation of inappropriate behaviour filed by "at least eight" female employees. Things took further turn in December, when Barrett <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-marathon-reboot-director-sues-sony-and-bungie-for-200m-claiming-wrongful-dismissal">filed a lawsuit against Bungie and Sony</a>, claiming the companies had "deliberately destroyed [his] reputation by falsely, and publicly, insinuating...he had engaged in sexual misconduct."
</p>
<p>
Barrett's list of accusations was long, but core to his argument was the claim his firing was a "premeditated scheme" concocted so Bungie and Sony could avoid paying him "nearly $50m... owed under his employment agreement". He additionally claimed he "did not do anything remotely resembling gross misconduct or 'Cause' as defined in the Retention Agreements... and there could not have been any credible allegation he did because [he] had a spotless twenty-five year track record at Bungie."
</p>
<p>
And now (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-bungie-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-response">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>), Sony has <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/830250465/Christopher-Barrett-v-Sony-Interactive-Entertainment-LLC-and-Bungie-Inc-2024-1285-No-97653544-97653546-Del-Ch-Feb-12-2025-1">filed its first substantive response</a>, denying Barret's claims and detailing the events allegedly leading to his dismissal. "Multiple female, subordinate employees individually reported to Human Resources that Barrett engaged in inappropriate behaviour and disturbing written and verbal communications," it wrote, "which made them uncomfortable and fearful of retaliation if they failed to engage or reported Barrett."
</p>
<p>
"The investigation revealed that Barrett's misconduct with each employee was consistent: he targeted a lower-level, female employee he wasn't working with directly, initially engaged in friendly conversation, and progressively pushed boundaries with the employee by making subtle references to her physical appearance or expressing his interest romantically.
</p>
<p>
"Barrett attempted to create an unprofessional level of intimacy with his victims," Sony continued in its court submission. "He requested to follow personal Instagram accounts and would express anger to the women if they failed to respond to his messages. He would bring up inappropriate topics like their body, their relationships, his marriage, or his desire to date them. He would demand that they participate in sexually charged games of 'Truth or Dare' and 'Ask Me Anything'. He texted them at all hours of the day and night. He offered to buy them gifts. He often referenced his wealth and his ability to advance their careers."
</p>
<p>
Sony's filing also includes several examples of Barrett's alleged misconduct, including an incident where it's claimed he FaceTimed one female employee late at night while drunk despite requests to "recognise 'boundaries'", eventually moving to his bedroom and telling her, "I can't believe I am lying in bed while talking to [VICTIM 1]".
</p>
<p>
Barrett also allegedly contacted a second employee via Instagram direct message, telling her, "You are the holy grail. I hope you find a person worthy of your attention." After the employee responded saying she had a boyfriend who treated her very well, Barrett is said to have told her, "He better[.] Cuz I would hit on you if he wasn't." It's claimed he later made further contact, writing, "You want to be worshipped, I think? Why are you against that actually happening?".
</p>
<p>
Other incidents detailed in Sony's filing includes a "virtual game of 'Truth or Dare' initiated by Barrett", and a Microsoft Teams exchange in which he allegedly asked a female member of staff, "Are you still in PJs? [Is] it like a button down top and bottoms? Sweat pants? Lulu lemons?".
</p>
<p>
Sony adds, "Barrett’s predatory behaviour caused victims to seek guidance from other Bungie employees on how to manage Barrett’s constant boundary-pushing given that he was a long-standing, senior member of the company. Multiple victims reported to Human Resources during the investigation that they were afraid for their jobs during these encounters."
</p>
<p>
In response, Barrett's lawyers told Game File, "Sony continues to disingenuously cherry pick text messages and alleged conversations and make unsupported and conclusory statements to defame Christopher and justify terminating him to avoid paying him what he was owed under his employment agreements. It is telling that Sony does not include the full text messages as exhibits, or the full content of these conversations, and nothing in Sony’s response provides a legitimate legal or factual basis to terminate Christopher for cause.
</p>
<p>
"Christopher is confident that when all the evidence is presented, it will be clear that Sony engaged in a scheme to strip him of his role and the equity awards he earned for his 25 years of loyal service to the company."
</p>
<p>
As well as denying inappropriate behaviour during his time at Bungie, Barrett's original filing argued his former employers' actions had "irreparably harmed [him] financially, physically, and emotionally". As such, he is seeking $200m in damages - including $46K (plus interest) owed under his employment terms - and is requesting to be reinstated as game director on Marathon.

An old magazine with a single screenshot of a cancelled project is video game preservation. A dusty Sega Mega Drive sitting in storage alongside a copy of <em>Sonic 2</em> and <em>Jungle Strike</em> is video game preservation. A dodgy arcade cabinet with 1000 classic arcade games on it, all of them running their original code via emulation, is video game preservation.</p><p>A Frankenstein's monster of AI-generated slop, guessing and filling in holes to try to run a game without its "original engine", is <em>not </em>games preservation, and I'm frankly astonished to see such an important figure in the video games industry go on record saying it is.</p><p>But it simply wouldn't be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c15vxDHJ2lU&amp;t=16s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an AI hype exercise</a> if it wasn't built entirely on speculative horseshit and the vaguest of assertions, all in the service of trying to find <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/xbox-muse-generative-ai-developers-say-nobody-will-want-this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">someone, <em>anyone </em>out there</a> beyond investors and tech company executives who will think any of this is worth what it's costing, both in dollar terms and its environmental impact.</p><p>If you're reading this and are interested in supporting actual video game preservation, <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please donate to the Video Game History Foundation</a>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-twitch-stream-big-book"><h3>Contrary To Popular Belief, Streaming On Twitch Is Work</h3></a><p>"Streaming is more enjoyable in some ways, but work is work no matter what the job is that you’re doing"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-sad-trombone"><h3>How’s That AI Future Looking?</h3></a><p>The Humane AI pin died on the way back to its home planet</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fgeforce-graphics-cards%2F5%2F557712%2Fverified-priority-access-geforce-rtx-5090-and-rtx-%2F" rel="sponsored">just announced a way</a> for Nvidia fans to sign up for “Verified Priority Access” to buy the elusive two-slot <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349976/nvidia-rtx-5090-fe-small-form-factor-sff-hands-on">SFF-friendly</a> RTX 5090 and 5080 Founders Edition graphics cards.</p></div><p>Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/13/23402674/nvidia-rtx-4090-priority-access-founders-edition-test">a similar Verified Priority Access program for the RTX 4090</a>, the new program is invite-only, but this time you’ll apply for access by filling out <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Faccount%2Frtx-50-series-verified-priority-access%2F" rel="sponsored">this form</a> rather than being pre-selected. The site will check that you’ve already had an Nvidia account (accounts created after January 30th need not apply) and ask you whether you’d prefer a 5090 or a 5080. Then, it’ll apparently use an algorithm to figure out if you’re a real gamer (analyzing your Nvidia app / GeForce Experience use) before offering a card. Limit one per person.</p><p>“Invites will begin rolling out next week,” writes Nvidia. The company doesn’t say how many cards have been allocated to this program, so it’s difficult to tell if this is a meaningful way to get cards to gamers rather than scalpers.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
