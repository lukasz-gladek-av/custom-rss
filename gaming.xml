            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-round-up-switch-2-metacritic-2000635309"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> is coming to both new and old hardware, leaving fans with an important decision to make. Is it worth upgrading to play it on Switch 2, or will the old version handle well enough? According to one of the first comparison videos of the game running on both consoles, the differences are hardly noticeable outside of it running at 60fps on the newer hardware. That’s good for Switch 1 owners, but a bit underwhelming for those who’ve already bought a Switch 2.</p> <p>A new 15-minute video published on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H34ZUA-DD3M">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a> shows a deep-dive comparison between both versions of the game. On Switch 1, <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> is capped at a resolution of 1080p and goes down as far as 800p in handheld mode. On Switch 2, it displays up to 2160p, and down to 1080p in handheld. By far the most meaningful difference is the 60fps perk for Switch 2 owners. Every other side-by-side comparison, however, looks pretty similar.</p>

  <p>The Switch 2 version appears to sport better shadows, textures, object draw distance, and density of vegetation and other details, but at least when viewed through captured footage uploaded to YouTube, the differences are pretty minor. On the one hand, that’s good news for everyone who will be playing <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> on the old hardware. On the other hand, it makes it that much harder to stomach the $10 upgrade for the game on Switch 2. The Pokémon Company is essentially charging for a 60fps mode within the new console’s first six months.</p>

 <p>“Before vs before,” joked one YouTube commenter. “From Water to H²O,” quipped another.</p> <p>New <em>Pokémon</em> games always get dragged through the ringer for their lack of graphical prowess as some fans pine for a major visual upgrade on par with the ones some franchises got with the previous Switch hardware. As a cross-gen game, it’s clear <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> isn’t going to provide that “next-gen-feeling” leap. At the very least, it seems like the Switch 1 version of the game is in better shape than <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em> were at launch back in 2022. The video doesn’t show off any major glitches or framerate dips. Hopefully, that reflects the experience most players have when the game comes out on October 16.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Best Thing You Can Buy For Your Steam Deck Is A Kickstand]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-rog-ally-mini-pc-valve-asus-accessories-2000635411</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-thing-you-can-buy-for-your-steam-deck-is-a-kickstand.1324828/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Regular Steam Deck users (and those who enjoy gaming on the variety of mini-PCs out there) are likely familiar with a certain physical sensation: wrist pain, tingling, and numbness. It’s not fun, and typically cuts your gaming short long before the battery gives out. These devices are just heavier and bulkier than the handhelds of yore, and even outweigh the Switch by a significant margin. But there’s a way to enjoy hours of gaming on them without that extra weight taking a toll on your wrists. If you don’t already have a kickstand, either by way of <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-deckmate-valve-kickstand-portable-1849583263">something like a Deck Mate</a> or a case with a built-in stand, consider it one of the most essential investments you can make in your mini-PC gaming quality of life.</p> <p>It really doesn’t matter how strong you are. Muscling through signs of strain is a good way to give yourself pain and, even if you’re willing to grit your teeth and endure it, consider that powering through the pain is a great way to increase the likelihood that you’re going to accidentally drop your very expensive gaming device. As I’ve learned in Olympic weight training lately, doing unnecessary reps or spending too much time under tension decreases your potential to keep carrying something. That may seem obvious when we’re talking about carrying over a hundred pounds, but it’s not something that clicked so easily for me when it came to the Steam Deck.</p>

 <p>However, replaying <i>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</i> on Steam Deck recently made this glaringly obvious. As I sat there watching the game’s notoriously lengthy cutscenes, that familiar tingly sensation I often get in my wrists from prolonged Steam Deck sessions started kicking in, and I realized that given the length of the game, this would be a problem. That feeling is a prelude to pain and tens of minutes spent flexing out my wrists instead of gaming. It became obvious to me that, during these cutscenes, there was no good reason for me to be holding this device. I flipped out the stand on the JSAUX case that currently houses my Steam Deck (I have another one for the Ally X as well) and just put it down on the nearest table while I watched the remainder of the cutscene.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000635414" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635414"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635414">© Image: Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s become common practice now when I’m playing on either the Steam Deck or Ally X. If I don’t need to be pressing buttons, the machine is resting on its stand–provided there’s a table somewhere nearby. I only rarely experience wrist pain as a result and have a far greater experience with the devices, especially since the stands keep the screen facing me, as opposed to just laying them flat. This small practice has also dramatically increased how much time I spend on Steam Deck.</p> <p>So however you get one on the back of your device, please save your wrists and put your machine on its stand whenever you don’t have to be actually holding the thing. You’ll thank me later, after many hours of blissful portable gaming.</p>

              <p><span>I wasn’t at New York Comic Con this year, but I could feel a wave of awkwardness reverberating from the Javits Center in my Brooklyn apartment like a disturbance in the Force. It wasn’t until videos of one of the most uncomfortable convention panels I’ve ever seen started circulating online that I knew the source of this sudden secondhand embarrassment. Participants in the Blumhouse panel, also known as Blumfest, talked a bit about the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fnaf-2-five-nights-freddys-2-movie-trailer-teaser-foxy-1851786887"><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s </span></i><span>sequel</span></a><span> before revealing that Megan Fox, of </span><i><span>Transformers </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Jennifer’s Body</span></i><span> fame, would be voicing Toy Chica, the evil animatronic bird, in the live-action follow-up. This was met with an underwhelming response from the crowd, and oof, it is a brutal watch.</span></p> <p><span>I have no stake in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/five-nights-at-freddys-fnaf-2-movie-sequel-release-date-1851149677"><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</span></i></a><span> cast, but I do understand why Fox’s casting might not elicit an enthusiastic response from the crowd. Fox’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/megan-fox-mk1-voice-acting-nitara-mortal-kombat-1-1850853516"><span>voice acting in </span><i><span>Mortal Kombat 1 </span></i><span>was atrocious</span></a><span>, and it also wouldn’t surprise me if some of the </span><i><span>FNAF</span></i><span> fandom doesn’t have a strong association with her, given the series has a pretty young fanbase and the actor was most prominent in Hollywood well over a decade ago. But the crowd at the Comic Con panel could barely muster up a polite cheer. Instead, Fox’s announcement is met with some murmurs and a </span><i><span>few </span></i><span>claps, but mostly deafening silence.</span></p>   <p><span>The panelists try to hype up the announcement by saying her name, almost as if they fear people don’t recognize her from the photo alone, and then you can hear some people in the crowd laughing at how uncomfortable it is. Whether or not Fox actually pulls off the role remains to be seen, but the whole thing feels like a miscalculation of both the crowd’s enthusiasm and, perhaps, Fox’s cultural cache. </span><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s </span></i><span>fans are notoriously protective of its characters, so we’ll see how they react to her performance when the movie premieres on December 5.</span></p>

              <p>Odds are you’ve seen Drew Struzan’s work at some point. The artist and illustrator was responsible for some of the most iconic movie posters around. From <em>Star Wars</em> to <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>, he elevated the promotional marketing format into a pop art form few have been able to match. He passed away earlier this week at the age of 78.</p> <p>His career started with album art for groups like <em>The Beach Boys</em> and<em>&nbsp;Earth, Wind &amp; Fire</em>, before he moved on to creating the airbrushed one-sheets for movies that would make him famous in the late ’70s. His wife <a href="https://www.facebook.com/drewstruzan/posts/1193923778759477">revealed earlier this year</a> that he was suffering from&nbsp;Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

 <p>“Drew made event art,” Steven Spielberg said in a statement (via <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/drew-struzan-dead-star-wars-1236552587/"><em>Variety</em></a>). “His posters made many of our movies into destinations…and the memory of those movies and the age we were when we saw them always comes flashing back just by glancing at his iconic photorealistic imagery. In his own invented style, nobody drew like Drew.”</p>

His style collapsed photo-realistic portraiture into dense and dramatic compositions that married the deeply personal and the fantastical.</p>

 <p>His lasting influence on cover art of all types is immeasurable, including in video games. There are clear nods to his airbrush style and framing in the box art for the original <em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/d30a1m/image_death_stranding_new_key_art_visual_by_pablo/">Death</a></em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/d30a1m/image_death_stranding_new_key_art_visual_by_pablo/"> Stranding</a>, and <em>Judas</em> director Ken Levine said Struzan’s work <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/">was a direct inspiration</a> for the key art for the upcoming sci-fi immersive sim.</p>

 <p>“A giant among giants,” wrote DC’s Jim Lee in response to Struzan’s passing (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/drew-struzan-dies-movie-posters-1236400361/"><em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a>). “His work captured the humanity, power and emotion of his subjects in ways not seen since. Thank you for bringing to life all the tentpole moments of my childhood and beyond.”</p> <p>If you’ve visited a movie theater in the last decade, you can feel the shadow cast by Struzan’s absence on the lobby walls. Some of the posters are fine. Almost all of them are forgettable. Now with the rise of AI, Hollywood seems to have less of an appetite than ever for trying to treat its biggest releases with a human touch. Thanks to the streaming revolution, movies are no longer a destination, and Struzan’s art feels as much like a relic as the stuff in those crates at the end of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>.</p>

<p>Wreckreation is another spiritual successor to the beloved Burnout series, and now we know the full list of achievements and trophies.</p>



<p>With the game being one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-release-76-different-games-in-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">76 titles that Embracer Group is pushing</a>, you would hope that there would be quite a bit of substance to it. Luckily, it does appear that you will have plenty of runway to enjoy the different aspects of this game.</p>



<p>Here is the full list of Wreckreation achievements and trophies.</p>



<h2 id="h-wreckreation-achievement-and-trophy-list">Wreckreation Achievement and Trophy List</h2>

<p>Burnout fans will notice quite a few similarities with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wreckreation-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wreckreation</a> when they read the achievement list above. For example, Road Rage is a mode that originated in that series and involves you forcing the opposition to crash while speeding down the road.</p>



<p>Those similarities are not surprising, though, as the development team for Wreckreation, <a href="https://www.threefieldsentertainment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Three Fields Entertainment</a>, is made up of members from the original iteration of Criterion, who made the Burnout series that EA has completely forgotten about these days. They have developed Danger Zone and Dangerous Driving, which obviously have a lot of Burnout energy in them, and you see that even more now with Wreckreation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>If you are a fan of games like Fallout or The Elder Scrolls, you know it's in the lineage of those games to feature third-person and first-person viewpoints for gameplay. That's why fans were disappointed that The Outer Worlds didn't feature third-person gameplay when Obsidian Entertainment, which developed Fallout: New Vegas, a game that included a third-person camera, launched the game in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the studio has heard the fans, and you can expect not one, but two third-person viewpoints in The Outer Worlds 2 when it launches later this month. While that will be a fun way to see your customizable Earth Directorate hero in-game, this wasn't always planned to be a feature.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BoUNBA0sVbo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"We didn't intend to do third-person when we first started the game," game director Brandon Adler tells us. "We actually didn't start doing it until, really, maybe about two years ago or so."&nbsp;</p><p>Adler says he and The Outer Worlds 2 team at Obsidian were discussing a long list of things everyone wanted to add to the game. "You're like, 'It's too expensive for us to do some of these things; maybe on the next one," Adler says, noting the team isn't saying a third Outer Worlds game is in the works but rather, hypothetically, there's a list of things it might do in another crack at the series. "But again, about halfway through, we were like, 'I think people are really going to want this,' so we did an evaluation of how difficult it was going to be to implement it."&nbsp;</p><p>Obsidian ended up collaborating with a team called Disruptive to create a third-person camera system that integrates seamlessly within the gameplay and mechanical structure of The Outer Worlds 2. That includes animation, in-world interactions, FOV, and more. And you can see that third-person gameplay in action in the clip below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/false"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/false" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/09/30/the-outer-worlds-2-cover-story"><em>Game Informer's </em>cover story for The Outer Worlds 2</a> is available to read right now if you're a subscriber (and this issue is shipping to mailboxes as we speak).

<p>"It's closer to Call of Duty-tier numbers than any of EA's premium-shooter efforts so far. But the question now is whether or not EA can foster this successful launch into a platform that stands the test of time," Elliott said.</p><p>The report also had a breakdown of sales by platform, with Steam accounting for 65.7% of sales, driving 3.5 million copies sold and more than $220 million in revenue. Next behind was PS5, which accounted for 1.5 million copies and made up 23.7% of total sales, the report said. Xbox Series X|S ranked third overall, with 1.2 million units sold and a 19.6% share.</p><p>On Steam specifically, Battlefield 6 is putting up big numbers, reaching a peak concurrent player record of more than 747,000.

Season 1 will continue with Phase 2, Rogue Ops, on November 18, followed by Winter Offensive on December 9.

			<p>When Bethesda revealed and surprise-dropped The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered earlier this year, it was a cause of concern for at least two other game studios. One was Sandfall Interactive, which was understandably concerned about their debut game, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, being overshadowed by the Oblivion Remaster. The other, as we now know from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-inside-story-of-how-oblivion-remastered-caused-immense-worry-then-sublime-relief-for-the-industrious-devs-behind-mod-megaproject-skyblivion">a new mini-documentary courtesy of Eurogamer</a>, was, even more understandably, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">the Skyblivion mod development team</a>.</p>



<p>And in both cases, the concern quickly faded to relief. In the case of Sandfall Interactive, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-shadow-drop-actually-helped-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">the word-of-mouth around both games that week actually helped Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 commercially</a>. For Skyblivion, which is still in the works, it was a different kind of relief, the relief of knowing that Bethesda wasn't doing something that would actually get in their way.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>It was not set in stone whether it was a 'remake' or a 'remaster,' so we were concerned,</em>" said Dee Keyes, former world designer on Skyblivion and member of the development team. "<em>It was a huge relief because we realized, 'Oh, they're doing something completely different.</em>' <em>They're doing a faithful remaster, and we were going for something more remade from the ground up</em>."</p>



<p>Since the release of Oblivion Remastered, Bethesda has shown the Skyblivion team plenty of love and appreciation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-provided-game-codes-for-the-oblivion-remaster-to-the-entire-skyblivion-team/">not only giving each of them codes for Oblivion Remastered</a> when it released, but later <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-shows-even-more-support-to-the-skyblivion-mod-team-hosts-them-at-rockville-headquarters/">inviting the team to Bethesda's headquarters in Rockville</a>.</p>



<p>Recently, the Skyblivion team <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-now-on-its-final-stretch-release-still-planned-for-2025/">confirmed that it is in the "<em>final stretch</em>" on the mod's development</a>, and also <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-first-15-minutes-shared-new-video/">shared the first 15 minutes of gameplay</a> that players will get to experience when the mod is finally ready and in their hands.</p>

<p>Gregg Mayles, one of Rare’s longest-serving workers and co-creator of Banjo-Kazooie, is resigning from the company.</p>



<p>The legacy of Rare in the 1990s is beyond incredible. From massive hits like Battletoads and Banjo-Kazooie to Goldeneye and Donkey Kong Country, there was no studio quite like them. After being bought by Microsoft/Xbox in 2002, the company’s track record went a bit low, with success being less and less. Unfortunately, despite Sea of Thieves’ reputation, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rares-everwild-cancelled-amid-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent cancellation of Everwild</a> has left many dejected, with its director and former creative director now jumping ship.</p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today was my last day at <a href="https://twitter.com/RareLtd?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RareLtd</a>. Thanks to everyone who played and enjoyed any of the games I helped create while I was there. Also thanks to all the people that worked on the games alongside me. It seemed fitting that I should say farewell with one final rhyme! <a href="https://t.co/X54u8Bc2oI">pic.twitter.com/X54u8Bc2oI</a></p>— Gregg Mayles (@Ghoulyboy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1978112736270655778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ghoulyboy/status/1978112736270655778?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Twitter/X</a>, Gregg Mayles announced his retirement from Rare. True to his form, his message is done in rhymes and can be seen above. For many, he crafted people’s childhoods in more ways than one. Mayles, as previously mentioned, co-created Banjo-Kazooie with his brother Steve Mayles at Rare. In addition, Mayles was responsible for designing games like Viva Pinata, Donkey Kong Country, Sea of Thieves, and Kinect Sports. He had also been Rare’s longest-serving worker, starting as a designer, director, and later studio creative director.</p>



<p>Sadly, his final piece of work would’ve been Rare’s Everwild, which he directed and designed. The title was canceled alongside Project Blackbird and Perfect Dark. Just last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-cancelled-everwild-screenshots-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshots of the game</a> emerged, giving us a glimpse as to what could’ve been. With many of the original talents of Rare gone, the studio’s future is a bit uncertain, so hopefully, good will come. Though, with fans hungry for a new Banjo-Kazooie title, the news isn’t the most favorable.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>It's the Halloween season in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/"> Call of Duty </a>and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/"> Fortnite</a>, and naturally, that means familiar faces are turning up in each game like they do every spooky season. In a rare move, there's one villainous slasher who is actually making his debut in both games this October: Jason Voorhees.</p><p>As the star of Friday the 13th, Jason is currently "between jobs," you could say, after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/friday-the-13th-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-350279">Friday the 13th: The Game</a> was forced to end sooner than players or creators expected <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/friday-the-13th-the-game-being-delisted-and-shut-down/1100-6514944/" data-ref-id="1100-6514944">due to a legal snafu some years back</a>. Fans are clamoring for a new game starring Jason, and one is coming, Horror Inc. executive vice president Robbie Barsamian told GameSpot. Though the team doesn't have many specifics to share on that project as of now, I caught up with Barsamian to discuss the team's famous monster and his guest spots in other games this month.</p><p>With Fortnite's lighter tone and Call of Duty's emphasis on more mature themes, it's as though Jason were reimagined twice, with the towering killer giving fans two different sides of himself--and it's all wrapped up in the new Jason design helmed by Greg Nicotero of The Walking Dead fame.</p><p>Below you can read my interview with Barsamian on how the Jason Universe team worked with both teams to make Jason fit each world, how the new design came to be, and what's next for the slasher.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585043-fortnitemaresjason.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585043" data-ratio="0.52333333333333" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585043-fortnitemaresjason.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585043"></a><figcaption>Jason is pulling double duty, arriving in Fortnite and Call of Duty for Halloween 2025.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585043-fortnitemaresjason.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>With the Greg Nicotero-designed Jason, at first glance, he looks quite faithful to the Jason who has persisted as my mental image of him for decades. What were some of the creative decisions that steered his design, and are there any nuances we should look more closely for that maybe we miss at first glance?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We drew inspiration from more classic versions of Jason from the ‘80s movies when we started working with Greg Nicotero. Jason is a strong, towering (over 6’5”!), and terrifying human that is one of the most iconic villains of all time, and we wanted our new design to reflect those classic elements to honor the legacy, while simultaneously refreshing his look for a new era of stories.</p><p dir="ltr">We also reimagined the eyes on the mask to make Jason look even more menacing, while reducing the number of holes in the mask to 13 as a fun nod.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Debuting in Call of Duty and Fortnite makes sense given how massive and crossover-friendly those games are, but fans will notice two very different versions of the slasher, with Call of Duty's naturally being more violent and graphic and Fortnite's being a bit sillier (like his canoeing emote). How did the various people involved seek to capture Jason's essence in two similar but importantly different ways?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We are thrilled Jason is stepping into both the Call of Duty and Fortnite worlds for the first time ever this Halloween! Our fans have been asking for these collabs for quite some time, so we’re glad we could deliver during our 45th anniversary celebration year.</p><p dir="ltr">We wanted to give players the ultimate Jason experience in each world, so we worked with both teams to ensure he’s still Jason, with his classic physicality and movements—he’s towering and moves with intention--as well as his weapons like the machete and axe. But we also wanted him to be appropriately reimagined for these worlds, which means he uses a gun (which he never does in our movies) and has his exclusive tactical combat skin in Call of Duty, plus fun emotes, back bling, and an overall non-bloody design in Fortnite.</p><p dir="ltr">We hope players love playing as and against Jason in both games!</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Voorhees is a horror icon for most generations alive today, but I wonder how much younger people know him since he's been out of the spotlight for some time. Do you have any sense of how big Jason is with the--let's call it the TikTok generation? These collabs are naturally going to introduce him to </strong><em><strong>some</strong></em><strong> players. So what do you hope they see in him?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Jason is a pop culture icon 45 years later and is recognized and beloved by generations. There are 5.5 BILLION views on TikTok of #Fridaythe13th and #F13 UGC videos, and 3.7 BILLION views of #JasonVoorhees UGC videos. The TikTok generation has come to love the same hockey-mask-wearing killer, just in different ways. For example, the 2017 Friday the 13th game had nearly 15 million players, and many of them found Jason for the first time through the game without ever having seen any of the original movies.</p><p dir="ltr">We hope the TikTok generation loves playing with Jason through these new crossovers and getting to know him better whether it’s through gaming, TV with Crystal Lake premiering on Peacock in the near future, movies, or immersive experiences like Halloween Horror Nights.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Does it feel difficult or strange to hand over Jason's usual aura in these games, where he will inevitably be seen doing things like silly dances and emotes? Is this something where you have to swallow your pride and not be so precious about the character, or is it easier now that players and creators have gotten so used to crossovers like this? Are you mentally prepared to see Jason wearing Jordans and singing Chappell Roan? </strong></p><p dir="ltr">We’re excited to see how players in both collabs make Jason their own. In terms of the base Jason design, we made sure to stay true to classic Jason elements, but we know players want to have fun--especially since it’s the first time Jason has entered into this sort of gaming environment. When Jason is in his own world and projects, we are of course committed to giving fans and players a more authentic experience centered around his Camp Crystal Lake legacy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585044-callofduty_thehauntingkeyart.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585044" data-ratio="0.55886102847429" data-width="2353" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585044-callofduty_thehauntingkeyart.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585044"></a><figcaption>In both games, Jason is one of several famous horror faces joining the fray.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585044-callofduty_thehauntingkeyart.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>A good example of reimagining the character for the platform is Jason's tactical outfit in Call of Duty. What's the creative process look like when the Jason Universe team and Call of Duty team are going for such a specific crossover like that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We loved the tactical outfit from the initial sketch the COD team shared with us! We maintained Jason’s body and mask design and overlaid the tactical outfit along with the recolored mask. Adding the machete strapped to his back was a fun nod to classic Jason. Both teams were striving to keep Jason’s essence while considering what he would look like in a way that was more native to the COD world, and I think we nailed it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>When designing gameplay elements like the Slasher mode in Call of Duty or presenting Jason as a boss NPC in Fortnite, what specific moments or movies did you look to for inspiration?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We didn’t look to specific moments or movies as much as we aimed to make sure Jason’s core essence was fully realized. Jason is such a force in the movies, so it was important that he truly feels like one in the games too. Both Slasher Deathmatch and the Jason boss NPC in Fortnite really convey that Jason is a force of nature, in a way that feels distinct and natural to the gameplay of each title.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I was 14 when I excitedly went to the midnight showing of Freddy vs. Jason, and it was probably the coolest thing I'd ever seen to that point in my life as a huge horror fan. Nowadays, Fortnite and Call of Duty sort of offer a version of horror mashups in every match, with Jason joining so many other crossovers from Hollywood's slashers and monsters. What are your thoughts on seeing fans bring them together in this way?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">That’s awesome to hear! As you mention, Jason obviously has that history of crossing paths with a character like Freddy, but they do operate in the shared realm or genre of horror and slashers. These new collabs open things up so much more, allowing Jason to interact with characters in ways that would never happen in an official setting like a movie, giving fans of all backgrounds a way to live out their dreams. So, personally, I think it’s great!</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>A lot of Jason Voorhees fans are eager for him to get his own game again. Do you have any updates to provide there?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We want that, too. Jason will be back in his own game. Stay tuned!</p>

		<p>SpaceCraft will not be entering early access this year, Shiro Games has announced, pushing back the release to Q2 2026. However, Shiro Games has announced that there will be a playtest for SpaceCraft taking place and it will be starting at the end of October. However, there are some restrictions such as there only being EU servers, limited space, English translation only, and it will not represent the early access version of the game. However, the playtest will be continuous and new content will be added. The roadmap for SpaceCraft’s playtest can be seen below.</p>



<p>Shiro Games has confirmed it has been able to implement a much requested feature for SpaceCraft, and that feature is cockpit view when piloting ships. The studio did issue an apology for delaying SpaceCraft’s early access saying,<em>“In order to fit the playtest in our development schedule, the Early Access release window has been moved to Q2 2026. We understand this news might be disappointing to some of you, and for that we would like to apologise. The playtest is a crucial part in our process of developing a high quality experience and we could not prepare for a successful Early Access launch without incorporating player feedback beforehand.”</em></p>
<p>In SpaceCraft, players will have the option to forge their own path in the galaxy, but that does not seem to be the way for long term success. Shiro Games has stated that connections between players is the real key, building up organisations and factions called Corpos, to dominate the emerging economy and becoming new military powers too. Players will be able to build orbital and land based bases that will grow as more housing and resource centres are added. Searching and securing resources will be necessary to keep things running and growing.</p>

After a furious response to the move by the fighting game community, Capcom now says it will be taking the change into further consideration.</p><p dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-are-reviewing-pricing-capcom-responds-to-fan-backlash-after-decision-to-charge-40-to-watch-tournament-final-streams/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>, a new statement from Capcom regarding the events says that the company is "reviewing pricing and related details," with "updated information regarding the PPV broadcast, including final pricing and additional context" set to be shared "next month."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CapcomFighters/status/1976541576060158429" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Starting October 10th at 2:00 AM PDT, fans can enter the lottery to purchase tickets to attend CAPCOM CUP 12 and the Street Fighter League: World Championship 2025 in person, both taking place at Ryogoku Kokugikan in Tokyo.<br>Details: <a href="https://t.co/OGXwEWbCyz" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/OGXwEWbCyz</a></p><p> At Tokyo Game Show on…</p></div>  — Capcom Fighters (@CapcomFighters) <a href="https://twitter.com/CapcomFighters/status/1976541576060158429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The <a href="https://x.com/CapcomFighters/status/1972201157172089089" rel="nofollow ">Tokyo Game Show announcement</a> laid out Capcom's plans for the new PPV model, setting the price for both the Capcom Cup finals livestream on March 14, as well as the Street Fighter League finals the next day, at 4,000 yen each--or roughly $27 a pop.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>A year after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>the first one</span></a><span>, a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>new leak of documents and production concepts</span></a><span> has hit Game Freak and the contents are spreading across social media. The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>developer has several upcoming games in the works, including a Generation X game, a </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game set in Galar, and an MMO-style game that lets players explore multiple regions. But the leak isn’t just about the games that are on the way. We also learned a few interesting tidbits about older games and the inner workings of the company. While they may not be as exciting as “Generation X games will feature procedurally generated worlds,” here are a few takeaways.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b><i>Scarlet</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Violet</i></b><b>‘s DLC cost as much to make as a full game</b></h2> <p><span>I was pretty lukewarm on both of </span><i><span>Scarlet</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>‘s DLC expansions, but the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-indigo-disk-dlc-review-terapagos-1851100679"><i><span>Indigo Disk</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-teal-mask-dlc-review-ogerpon-1850839564"><i><span>Teal Mask</span></i></a><span> were such big projects that they ended up </span><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978000011733664139"><span>costing as much as </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>‘ entire budget</span></a><span>. According </span><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977994754085253581"><span>to the leaks</span></a><span>, the add-ons sold around 6.15 million copies in the first 10 months, compared to the base </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s 27 million in sales. </span><i><span>Arceus, </span></i><span>meanwhile, moved roughly twice what the DLC did (14 million copies) at a higher price point, so Game Freak is looking to scale back budgets for its DLC packs to make the business model more sustainable.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Development Budgets:</p> <p>– SV DLC: 500 million yen<br>– Legends 2/ZA: 2 billion yen<br>– Winds/Waves: 3 billion yen</p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977779651352133635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Another interesting fact about </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s DLC is that while the final product ended up taking place in Kitkami and the Blueberry Academy in Unova (</span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i><span>), the original plan was to set them in Kalos (</span><i><span>X</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>/</span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>) and Alola (</span><i><span>Sun</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>).</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Pokémon Scarlet/Violet DLC was originally planed to be set in Kalos and Alola.</p> <p>We ended up getting Kitakami and Unova. <a href="https://t.co/V0gWImY9kB">pic.twitter.com/V0gWImY9kB</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977779013339730404?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2><b>One of the original 151 nearly got a Gigantamax form</b></h2> <p><span>A big part of this leak was a swath of concept art for </span><i><span>Pokémon Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. The 2019 Switch games introduced a new battle gimmick called Dynamaxing that allows players to temporarily transform their monsters into powerful kaijus under certain conditions. Every Pokémon could use this technique, but a select few were able to take on new forms entirely, called Gigantamax forms, once they grew to the size of a skyscraper. One of the original 151 Pokémon, the poison-type monster Nidoking, was at some point in development going to have one of these forms. He would have sported a red crown and beard, as well as a cape on his back. It would have really leaned into the “king” part of the Pokémon’s name, but it was scrapped. It’s unknown if its female counterpart, Nidoqueen, would have also received a similar form.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/ygaYebF8Qw">pic.twitter.com/ygaYebF8Qw</a></p> <p>— (Not) Centro Leaks (@CentroLeaks_alt) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977816325335720063?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <h2><b>Team Star had a much different look</b></h2> <p><span>Team Star, the antagonistic team in </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, is a group of student outcasts who decided to turn all their anger on their fellow classmates. But it looks like the group was pretty different in the early concept stages. Leaked concept art shows several adult leaders in Team Star, rather than the school-aged crew we ended up facing in 2022. Some design motifs survived the iteration process, such as each member having a float/vehicle they pilot that caters to their different aesthetics, but overall, it seems like Team Star would have had a much different role if this version of the group had survived. One member has a biker/monster truck theme, another has a Wailmer-run boat, and there’s also a cunty-ass car being held up by several Togekiss. It looks like this would have been piloted by a dapper male character, and I wish I could have met this queen.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/P51564Mylu">pic.twitter.com/P51564Mylu</a></p> <p>— (Not) Centro Leaks (@CentroLeaks_alt) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977809307988324392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2><b>There’s no </b><b><i>Black </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>White </i></b><b>remake in development…yet</b></h2> <p><span>Game Freak has been putting out remakes of its old </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games in chronological order, and given that the </span><i><span>Brilliant Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shining Pearl </span></i><span>remakes brought the Generation IV games to the Switch in 2021, fans have been speculating for years that a remake of Gen V’s </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i><span> is imminent. Well, that doesn’t seem to be the case. At least, not yet. The documents in the leak make note of what the team wants for a future remake, but it’s not currently listed on any of Game Freak’s pipelines. Another developer could take on the project like ILCA did for </span><i><span>BDSP</span></i><span>, but for right now, I think we can safely assume that an eventual </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>remake is a ways down the line.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Game Freak nearly made a Pokéwalker mobile app</b></h2> <p><span>Game Freak had plans to create a PokéWalker app that would be compatible with </span><i><span>Sword</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. This would have allowed you to take your Pokémon with you on your phone, play minigames, and even catch new monsters to send to your copy of </span><i><span>Sword</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. The name “Pokéwalker” initially referred to a peripheral that was first introduced back in </span><i><span>HeartGold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>SoulSilver</span></i><span> as a pedometer you could clip onto your clothes or bag, and was essentially a virtual pet compatible with the DS games. It sounds like this would have served a lot of the same function, but without the manufacturing costs.</span></p>

The idea was to have two games, </span><i><span>Legends: Ho-Oh</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Legends: Lugia</span></i><span>, rather than just the lone game like </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>have been. Like </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>, these games would have been a period piece with a protagonist shot through time into historical Johto and seeing the beginnings of Pokémon trainers.

According to translations of Game Freak personnel documents, employees considered the period up to </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>to be largely dominated by Masuda and felt no one in the company could oppose him, leading to a “concentration of power” and disorganization within the studio. This eventually led to an argument between Masuda and character artist Ken Sugimori during the</span><i><span> X</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span> era, ultimately resulting in the company’s decision to remove Masuda from the director’s chair.

              <p>Of the many updates <i>No Man’s Sky</i> has received over the years, few have <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-corvette-steam-players-2000622428">transformed the game</a> in the same way as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-6-0-star-trek-mass-effect-2000620674">recently released Voyagers update</a>. Arriving toward the end of last summer, the update allows players to construct ships on a scale never seen before in the game, complete with fully traversable interiors. It led to some <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-ship-build-voyagers-update-star-wars-2000630689">wild original builds and recreations</a> of ships from legendary sci-fi franchises. Now, as spotted on Reddit recently, one player is looking to top them all with an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1o683xa/someone_built_a_deathstar/">intimidating Death Star</a>.</p>   <p>Reddit user Even-Ad648 caught sight of the ominous orb of planet-destroying death in a <i>NMS</i> multiplayer game. And though it technically looks a bit smaller than the “real” thing would be, it’s nonetheless an impressive and grim-looking spectacle.</p>

 <p>Though you can create some impressive flying machines with <i>NMS</i>’ corvettes, this Death Star clearly uses some glitching to scale to the size of an in-world space station. And, according to Even-Ad648, the game crashed once they got too close. So I guess that rules out any death-defying close runs to exploit a structural vulnerability.</p> <p>Folks have made attempts to build Death Stars before. Some have struggled a bit to perfectly match the <a href="https://x.com/tuyosi723_pilot/status/1977671635256971341">spherical dimensions of the original</a>, but <a href="https://x.com/NoMansZine/status/1976211868017676486">others have made some decent efforts</a>. Still, there’s something eerie about that one in the Reddit vid. Fly safe out there, ya’ll.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft's</a> next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-world-of-warcraft-midnight-whats-old-is-new-again/1100-6534043/">Midnight</a>, is taking the nuclear option when it comes to eliminating combat add-ons, after years of Blizzard discussing how they posed problems for the health of the game. It's a bold approach, but, unfortunately, one that has been communicated incredibly poorly and seems to be taking unnecessary risks that could potentially make the game worse, not better, in the short term.</p><p dir="ltr">Until the recent arrival of Midnight's alpha build, it wasn't exactly clear how far-reaching Blizzard's approach would be. While non-combat add-ons (WoW's version of player-made mods) aren't being touched, it was known some major changes would be coming to how combat add-ons work in Midnight. Those changes would come in conjunction with Blizzard introducing its own version of popular add-on functions, like boss timers and damage meters, alongside improvements to recently implemented features like the cooldown manager and combat assistant. Blizzard also said it's designing combat encounters going forward so that (hopefully) combat add-ons wouldn't be as necessary as before.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiIjThwKLaE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SiIjThwKLaE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That all sounded great on paper. Many assumed some of these changes would come over time, allowing for a period where both add-ons and Blizzard's own UI updates could work in conjunction or until certain parts of the base-game UI meant to replicate add-on functionality was ready. Blizzard has instead opted to rip off the proverbial band-aid.</p><p dir="ltr">In the Midnight alpha, nearly every piece of combat information is rendered invisible to add-ons and thus can't be computed or read to give players more information. That includes things as simple as how much health a player or enemy has, what abilities enemies are using, reading chat messages during combat, or whether there's a puddle of fire on the ground you should probably move out of. Combat add-ons may still work technically come Midnight, but they will require a ton of tweaks by creators and their functionality will likely be so much worse than the game's base UI (much of which still needs improvement) that there won't be much use for them.</p><p dir="ltr">The result has blindsided combat add-on developers and left them scrambling. The folks behind one of WoW's longest-running and most-popular add-ons, WeakAuras, have stated that unless Blizzard makes major changes to its approach, they won't be making a version for Midnight. In a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/weakauras-x-140349416?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link" rel="nofollow ">statement</a>, the WeakAuras team said Blizzard downplayed the scope and timing of its add-on approach in past statements, and that the current approach "does not leave us with much choice other than closing shop." Meanwhile, the creators of Deadly Boss Mods, WoW's most-popular add-on that has been downloaded more than 571 million times according to Curse Forge, have <a href="https://x.com/deadlybossmods?lang=en" rel="nofollow ">stated</a> the add-on isn't going anywhere but will be changing alongside WoW itself.</p><p dir="ltr">I'll just say it upfront: I don't like combat add-ons. I've played WoW for nearly two decades, and in that time I've always viewed them as a necessary evil. Whereas some players love spending hours making their own custom UIs and enabling WeakAuras to track their buffs and cooldowns, I've largely opted to instead stick with the default UI, finding the entire add-on process tedious.</p><p dir="ltr">A large part of this is because despite having played for the better part of 20 years, I have no real interest (or time) to participate in high-level Mythic+ dungeons or Mythic raiding, and thus have never viewed combat add-ons as essential as many top players do. I've also just never been a fan of the idea that I have to go to a third-party site and download something like Deadly Boss Mods, which up until this point has basically been viewed as mandatory for even casual WoW players, in order to play the game properly.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584912-wowmidnightsilvermoon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584912" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584912-wowmidnightsilvermoon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584912"></a><figcaption>Blizzard is overhauling WoW's old Blood Elf zones as part of Midnight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584912-wowmidnightsilvermoon.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Combat add-ons have always offered a major advantage to those who opted to use them compared to those who don't. This has always been a failure on Blizzard's part for allowing the add-on arms race between mod creators and the development team to go on for as long as it has. The same is true for designing WoW in a way that such add-ons felt like they had become necessary due to players not having all the information they needed to be successful.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard eliminating the need for combat add-ons is undoubtedly a good thing for WoW's long-term health, and something I'm not particularly upset about. I believe there are plenty of others who feel the same way. When combined with Blizzard's built-in UI updates and proposed changes to make combat more streamlined, WoW will soon be more approachable than ever before. It could also pave the way for WoW to be ported to consoles, exposing even more players to Blizzard's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-mmorpgs/2900-5436/">genre-defining MMORPG</a>. All of that is good.</p><p dir="ltr">There's only one issue: Blizzard's entire approach. By gutting combat add-ons immediately upon the start of Midnight, Blizzard is backing itself into an unnecessary corner. All of Blizzard's plans revolve around it actually being able to deliver all these features in time for the expansion's launch. If it can't replace all that add-on functionality on day-one, players are left with a worse version of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">While there are some features that are already ready from primetime, like the new nameplates, boss alerts, and the cooldown manager, there's plenty still missing. Damage meters and updated raid frames are huge pieces of the puzzle that aren't available for testing, and it's unclear when they will be. Raid frames in particular are huge for healers, who often use raid frame add-ons like VuhDo in order to be able to track their outgoing heals, priority debuffs, and more. Raid frame add-ons will still exist come Midnight, but they won't be able to track combat data as they currently do, a huge nerf to healers.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard does plan to offer some solutions here, but it's unlikely Blizzard's in-game versions will be as robust, customizable, or feature-rich as what many add-on users are accustomed to. That applies to just about every add-on Blizzard is looking to replace. Many of these add-ons have been updated and improved for over a decade. It's unreasonable to assume that Blizzard's versions will be at that same level right out the gate, assuming they are there at launch at all.</p><p dir="ltr">The success of Blizzard's plan also depends on its own encounter design. Until we see more of what Midnight's top-end raid boss encounters look like, it's impossible to say whether Blizzard has designed an endgame with no combat add-ons needed. WoW's Mythic difficulty encounters have been designed in a certain way for years, facilitating the need for combat add-ons in the first place. Having all that change in a single expansion requires a lot of trust in Blizzard to stick the landing, and I don't think players can be blamed for not entirely believing in its ability to execute.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584914-wowmidnightendgamedesign.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584914" data-ratio="0.56238244514107" data-width="1595" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584914-wowmidnightendgamedesign.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584914"></a><figcaption>Blizzard is aiming to design Midnight's endgame to not require combat add-ons in order to succeed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584914-wowmidnightendgamedesign.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for those unforeseen consequences I mentioned earlier, Blizzard's all-or-nothing approach is unfairly cruel to one particular portion of the WoW community: disabled players. These players can make extensive use of combat add-ons in order to play WoW, whether casually or at a high-level, as is the case with <a href="https://undauntedguild.com/about-us/" rel="nofollow ">Undaunted</a>, a well-known competitive WoW raiding guild for deaf and hard-of-hearing players. In a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1ny1lg7/accessibility_impact_of_the_recent_addon_changes/" rel="nofollow ">Reddit</a>, Undaunted guild leader Saormash wrote an extensive breakdown of just how damaging losing "20 years of accessibility" is to the game's disabled community. Saormash said WoW has long been a leader when it comes to gaming accessibility thanks to the game's community of add-on creators. If Blizzard doesn't walk back some of its approach, that's due to all be tossed out the window.</p><p dir="ltr">"We will be completely locked out of progression due to something that is completely beyond our control," Saormash said. "In the past, we could turn to add-on and WeakAura creators for help. Without that benefit, we may see less tolerance from the raiding community for disabled players. Nobody will want to have their raid progress stalled by one person's inability to successfully pass a mechanic check."</p><p dir="ltr">Without the extensive ability to customize and tweak combat add-ons to meet their needs, these players will be left in the dust come Midnight without many new features being added to the game. Blizzard's UI design team simply cannot compete with the thousands of add-on creators who have created tools and solutions for players of all sorts for decades. As Saormash explained, despite the game's disabled community being the most negatively affected by the combat add-on apocalypse, it feels "unseen and unheard" by not being given the opportunity to provide direct feedback to Blizzard. It's unclear how long it will take Blizzard to implement the kinds of changes and features currently filled by WeakAuras and other add-ons that make the game playable for WoW's disabled community. Any answer longer than "immediately at launch" just isn't acceptable and reason alone to pump the brakes on this entire combat add-on crusade.</p><p dir="ltr">There is, at least, some indication Blizzard is listening. It's already walked back some combat add-on restrictions based on feedback. In a recent <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-director-admits-its-too-hard-without-combat-mods-and-explains-how-bosses-will-change-in-midnight-were-not-looking-to-turn-all-our-raid-encounters-into-giant-puzzles-for-people-to-solve/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> interview, WoW senior game director Ion Hazzikostas said it has now invited members of Undaunted into the Midnight testing program to receive their feedback, and that "accessibility remains a top focus for the team." Midnight also won't be launching until sometime in early 2026, giving Blizzard, at minimum, three or so months to listen, respond, and iterate on its plans. I have no doubt bigger changes to what is and isn't allowed in terms of combat add-ons will be coming in the weeks and months ahead, as well as more details about what players can expect from the game's updated raid frames and other UI improvements.</p><p dir="ltr">None of that, however, changes the fact that these are all problems entirely of Blizzard's own making. Not only were Blizzard's intentions and plans poorly communicated, but its choice to take the all-or-nothing approach to combat add-ons, without more closely involving the game's community beforehand, has resulted in confusion and frustration from some players.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's overall goal here is admirable, and one that many players will likely agree with. Fast forward one, two, or five years and WoW might be the best it's ever been, with no need for combat add-ons, approachable endgame encounters, and all the accessibility features it needs to serve its community. But Blizzard is putting the cart before the horse. That future, idyllic version of WoW is not now, and given how Blizzard has handled this entire situation thus far, it might not be here in time for Midnight's launch either.</p>

                <p>One of the year's best indie games, Blue Prince, is getting an official <strong>physical PS5 release on November 21</strong>. Until now, it was only available digitally on consoles and PC, but fans can now preorder this new PS5-exclusive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blue Prince physical edition</a> for just $35 at Amazon. While the digital version of the game is also available on Xbox Series X and PC, PS5 is the only confirmed physical version--which isn't surprising, since that seems to be the case with most physical indie game releases these days. Along with the base game, physical copies will include an exclusive poster. Preordering also gets you a digital version of the game's soundtrack. It's probably wise to grab an early copy soon if you're interested--preorders for the Blue Prince PS5 edition initially went live about a month ago, and the first wave quickly sold out, so there's a chance this could disappear again soon.</p><h2>Blue Prince Physical Edition Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4584983-dayoneblueprincepreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584983" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4584983-dayoneblueprincepreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584983"></a><figcaption>Blue Prince preorder bonus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4584983-dayoneblueprincepreorders.jpg"></figure><p>Preordering Blue Prince physical edition gets you the Blue Prince: Day One Edition, which includes an exclusive download code for a digital copy of the game's official soundtrack.</p><div title="6535406 - Blue Prince Physical Edition" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4687" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535406 - Blue Prince Physical Edition" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Blue Prince (PS5)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$35 | Releases November 21</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Blue Prince PS5 release includes the full game on disc and an 18 x 12 inch fold-out poster featuring Mount Holly Manor, plus the digital soundtrack if you preorder the Day One Edition.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr4-int-8-xbox-series-x-simulation-shows-possible-advantage/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-fsr-4-int8-xbox-series-x-simulation-shows-possible-advantage-in-image-quality-and-frame-rate.1324690/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last month, following the accidental source code leak of AMD FSR 4 INT8 files, modders <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-amd-fsr-4-int8-files-helps-users-turn-on-fsr-4-on-rx-7000-on-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed to get a version of AMD FSR4 working on non-RDNA 4 GPUs</a> (the Radeon RX 9000 Series that launched earlier this year). The regular version of the latest AMD upscaler runs on FP8, that is, the 8-bit Floating-Point format, which is not supported by prior RDNA GPUs. However, this leaked version running on INT8 is compatible with a much wider range of hardware, since support for the 8-bit Integer Fixed-Point format is included in most modern GPUs. </p>



<p>Of course, there's a reason why AMD chose the FP8 format for the public release: it allows for a wider dynamic range than INT8, doing a better job in preserving model accuracy and stability. Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqDWJCW06Ks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has now tested this version</a> on several non-RDNA4 hardware to see how well it works in terms of both performance and quality.</p>



<p>First of all, he compared the quality of AMD FSR 4 FP8 and AMD FSR 4 INT8, the first running on RDNA 4 hardware and the leaked version running on RDNA 3 and RDNA 2 hardware. The result is obvious: the INT8 version introduces aliasing and temporal artifacts. These visual issues are even more pronounced on the latest Adrenalin driver (25.9.1), likely due to some bug, so if you're going to try running the INT8 version, reverting to driver 23.9.1 is advisable.</p>



<p>That said, AMD FSR 4 INT8 does still provide superior upscaling quality compared to AMD FSR 3. The problem is that it's also a lot slower. Now, the PlayStation 5 consoles do not support INT8, but the Xbox Series X does, having access to the full RDNA 2 feature set. For a simulation of how Microsoft's console could run this version of the upscaler, Digital Foundry used an RX 6700 GPU running the Horizon Forbidden West benchmark. </p>



<p>AMD FSR 4 INT8 is by far the slowest upscaler compared to AMD FSR 3 and Intel XeSS, providing only a 28% performance uplift when set in Performance mode compared to 4K native resolution. XeSS Balance mode is 15% faster, while FSR 3 Performance mode is 29% faster. However, in another benchmark scene from Alan Wake 2, DF tested Xbox Series X-like settings at 1440p with FSR 4 set to Performance mode and FSR 2 to Balance mode. In this comparison, FSR 4 Performance mode slightly beats FSR 2 Balance mode in frame rate (by around 4%) and, more importantly, it provides a cleaner image despite reconstructing from a lower base resolution. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Leaked FSR4 INT8 Test: RDNA 3, RDNA 2, Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, Nvidia + Xbox Series X Simulation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqDWJCW06Ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Therefore, it could potentially benefit the Xbox Series X in certain scenarios. However, most multiplatform games are unlikely to take advantage of this since the base PS5 console cannot run AMD FSR 4 INT8. </p>



<p>The video analysis also includes a look at how this version performs on Steam Deck, though that scenario was already tested by other YouTubers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showing significant image quality improvements</a> but also a heavy performance cost in games like Cyberpunk 2077. Notably, this might not be the final version of AMD FSR 4 INT8, and Digital Foundry got a teasing statement from AMD on that note:</p>



<p><em>We look forward to more updates to FSR4 this Fall that will continue to improve gamers' experiences.</em></p>



<p>It's not quite a confirmation, but this version of FSR 4 may receive some performance improvements that would make it more viable for RDNA 2 and RDNA 3 hardware. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 release is nearly here, bringing many people who loved the original game back into this universe where business executives overrule everyone.</p>



<p>With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-outer-worlds-2-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embargo date set to reveal review scores</a> for the upcoming game, you will want to have a good understanding of when the game is actually released so you can play it.</p>



<p>Here is everything we know about The Outer Worlds 2 release date and a possible start time.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-outer-worlds-2-release">When Does The Outer Worlds 2 Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Charging up for release. Image by Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Outer Worlds 2 full release date is on October 29, but anyone who </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-outer-worlds-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>pre-orders the Premium Edition</strong></a><strong> will be able to play the game five days early on October 24.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-outer-worlds-2-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers</a> will be able to download and play the game on that later date, but if they desire to play early and get all the rest of the content included in the Premium Edition, they can buy the $30 upgrade pack on the Xbox Store.</p>



<p>It might not be the perfect festive game for Halloween, but fans of the first game will hardly complain about being able to run around and mess with the various corporations and NPCs just before the holiday.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-exact-release-time-for-the-outer-worlds-2">Do We Know the Exact Release Time for The Outer Worlds 2?</h2>



<p><strong>According to the </strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6312-PPSA24588_00-0872768154966924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>PlayStation Store</strong></a><strong>, the standard edition of The Outer Worlds 2 will go live at 1 PM ET on October 29, so this version of the game will not have a midnight release. That is not the same for the early access players, who will be able to play starting at 12 AM ET on October 24.</strong></p>



<p>Here is a chart that will break down the starting times for the standard version of The Outer Worlds 2.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">The Outer Worlds 2 Standard Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">12 PM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT)</td><td data-align="center">4 AM—October 30</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The standard edition of The Outer Worlds 2 releasing at midday in the United States is definitely an odd time for the full game to release. Usually, even with games that have an early access period, they will become playable at either midnight Eastern Time or sometime in the morning. Having it set for the afternoon is definitely not the norm with big releases like this.</p>

                <p>Summer Game Fest 2026 has been announced, and there is one big change that we know about so far. The event takes place on Friday, June 5 in Los Angeles, and the show is moving to the Dolby Theatre.</p><p>The 2025 event, for comparison, was held at the YouTube Theater in Inglewood, California. The Dolby Theatre opened in Hollywood in 2001 and hosts the Oscars each year. It was previously known as the Kodak Theatre.</p><p>Geoff Keighley once again returns to produce Summer Game Fest 2026. Keighley runs SGF and The Game Awards, and Split Fiction writer-director Josef Fares once declared during TGA, <a href="https://google.com/search?q=josef+fares+fuck+the+oscars+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=josef+fares+fuck+the+oscars+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDQzMTJqMGo5qAIGsAIB8QU6HXKJFs428w&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"F**k the Oscars,"</a> a statement that carries a bit more resonance now with SGF changing venues to where the Oscars are held.</p><p>SGF 2026 promises a "spectacular, cross-platform showcase of what's next in video games." You can attend the event yourself by purchasing a ticket when they go on sale in Spring 2026.</p><p>As for TGA, the upcoming awards show run by Keighley will take place on Thursday, December 11 at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles.</p>

                <p>In 2003, Vince Zampella and his Infinity Ward co-founders unleashed the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty/" data-ref-id="5000-18165">Call of Duty</a> after previously shepherding EA's Medal of Honor franchise. The latter never reached the heights of the former, and according to Zampella, Call of Duty would have never come into being if EA hadn't come into conflict with his team.</p><p>"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks," said Zampella during a new interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GQ</a>. Zampella didn't elaborate on his team's fallout with EA, but they eventually formed a lucrative partnership with Activision, which purchased Infinity Ward. Zampella left Infinity Ward in 2010 and formed Respawn Entertainment before once again partnering with EA. Now, Zampella is overseeing the Battlefront franchise, which continues this month with the arrival of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p>Zampella worked closely with Steven Spielberg on the Metal of Honor games, and Spielberg reportedly wanted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spielberg-wanted-to-make-a-call-of-duty-movie-but-activision-passed-heres-the-reported-reason-why/1100-6534500/" data-ref-id="1100-6534500">direct a Call of Duty movie</a> years later. During the GQ interview, Zampella noted that Ridley Scott was also interested in bringing Call of Duty to the big screen.</p><p>"Ridley Scott came in one time--who's a hero of mine--but he's not connected to games," noted Zampella. "So he'd ask these questions like, 'How do you script what happens?' ... There was a bit of a talk around him doing a Call of Duty film, but we never really took it seriously. Video game movies at that point were never really that good."</p><p>Last month, Paramount signed a deal with Activision for <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-skydance-1236504600/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Call of Duty movie</a>, with a potential TV series to follow. It's unclear if Hollywood will show similar interest in Battlefield, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-already-doing-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535398/" data-ref-id="1100-6535398">Battlefield 6 is already doing huge numbers on Steam</a>. Battlefield 6 also has a largely clear path before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Black Ops 7</a> arrives on November 14.</p>

                <p>The creative lead steering the Assassin's Creed franchise for Ubisoft has departed the company. The exit comes not long after the French publisher unveiled its Tencent-backed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-announces-vantage-studios-a-creative-house-focused-on-three-major-franchises/1100-6535136/" data-ref-id="1100-6535136">spin-off division Vantage Studios,</a> which will take charge of development for Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six titles.</p><p>Vantage Studios said that Marc-Alexis Côté, who held the title of Vice President Executive Producer for Assassin's Creed since 2022, had been offered a leadership position at this new subsidiary, but he declined the role, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> reports. The formation of the then-unnamed Vantage Studios was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">announced back in March</a>.</p>

<p>In an internal email to Ubisoft staff, Vantage Studios co-CEO Christophe Derennes expressed disappointment with Côté's decision, adding that Côté "had his own expectations and priorities related to Vantage Studios' creation and future."</p><p>Côté began his two-decade-long tenure at Ubisoft in 2005 as a software engineer, accumulating credits including Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands and several Assassin's Creed games.</p><p>He led the mission design for Assassin's Creed Brotherhood before acting as a game director for Assassin's Creed 3. Côté was also the creative director for Assassin's Creed Syndicate, and he led the development of Assassin's Creed Odyssey.</p><p>As the franchise's head, starting in 2022, Côté led the initiative to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-infinity-gets-a-new-name/1100-6524281/" data-ref-id="1100-6524281">group future titles into the Animus Hub</a> for a more cohesive story experience. Assassin's Creed Shadows, which was released earlier this year, was the first game to be a part of this platform.</p><p>"We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin’s Creed brand into what it is today," an Ubisoft spokesperson told IGN. "His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors."</p><p>A recent leak suggests that the Assassin's Creed franchise will make its first foray to Nintendo Switch 2 with an Assassin's Creed Shadows port, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-release-date-reportedly-leaks/1100-6535405/" data-ref-id="1100-6535405">purportedly releasing in December</a>. In other franchise news, a report claimed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/" data-ref-id="1100-6535320">Ubisoft axed an American Civil War-set Assassin's Creed title</a> last year due to concerns involving the current political climate in the United States.</p>
