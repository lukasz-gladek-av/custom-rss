<p>The first details about possible preorders for Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter Marathon may have just been found. According to data miners, Marathon preorders could begin sometime in Q1 2025.</p>



<p>Bungie recently released an update for Destiny 2, and players immediately started to data mine the files from the update. Within that information (first reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/marathon-pre-order-destiny-2-files-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>) comes a text string that reads “v820.offers.entitlements.d2.marathon.preorder”.</p>



<p>The beginning of the string, v820, is where the suggestion comes. Bungie uses version numbers for its Destiny 2 expansions. With v810 representing the current Revenant episode, v820 would reference the next episode, Heresy. That episode is scheduled to release on February 4, 2025.</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning, that nothing about potential dates or releases for Marathon have been confirmed by Bungie. The latest news on the game came in September regarding when Bungie planned to hold its next major look at the game. According to those claims, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-significant-reveal-for-bungies-marathon-until-2025-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the next “significant reveal”</a> wasn’t going to happen until Spring 2025.</p>



<p>Last known, Bungie is still planning for a 2025 release for Marathon. The game has seen multiple changes during its development ranging <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from its direction</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-director-fired-at-bungie-over-inappropriate-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">management at the top</a>. There’s even concern from some inside that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-marathon-reaction-isnt-great-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t hit it’s current release deadline.</a></p>



<p>When do you think fans will hear something on Marathon from Bungie? Join the discussion below or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metaphor-refantazio/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> features a job system referred to as Archetypes, which allows you to swap any of your party members to any Archetype pretty freely. While there are some requirements to use the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-all-advanced-archetypes-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6526963/">advanced Archetypes</a>, you will want to swap out Archetypes frequently. In some cases, like certain side dungeons, there are specific Archetypes that will be recommended based on the enemy weaknesses found there, but you can also ignore that if you like your setup. One of the most important factors for determining your team composition is the synthesis abilities that become available when you have specific Archetypes present in your party.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Mage with Seeker, Healer, or Mage</h2><p dir="ltr">The Mage Archetype tree is incredibly powerful, especially early on, since it has access to fire, ice, and electric attacks, which allows you to target a variety of enemy weaknesses. However, the abilities the Mage and its advanced versions can use only targets a single enemy. If you want to use a version that can target all enemies at once, you will need to use the Synthesis version of these abilities, which only becomes available if you have another Mage, a Seeker, or a Healer present. Of those three options, the best to go with is the Healer since the Healer gets to use a light damage attack that targets all enemies if a Mage is present.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metaphor: ReFantazio Review</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Knight with back row damage dealers</h2><p dir="ltr">The Knight is an excellent class that can fit into many team compositions since the Knight is a great tank. If you need to bring along multiple back-row damage dealers, like the Mage, Gunner, Healer, or Summoner, the Knight can get the attention of enemies to keep your squishy party members safe from danger. Even if the Knight's pierce damage isn't effective against the enemies you are fighting, focusing purely on defense can keep your party alive against tough enemies.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Summoner and Masked Dancer</h2><p dir="ltr">Perhaps one of the best combinations in Metaphor: ReFantazio, the Summoner and Masked Dancer duo is incredibly powerful. The Masked Dancer gains access to abilities that inflict one-time elemental weaknesses to enemies<strong>,</strong> and the Summoner has access to the largest variety of elemental attacks in the game. That means you can make all of your enemies weak to a specific element, like ice, and immediately dish out a high-damage ice attack that hits all enemies, dealing big damage and letting you take more turns. <strong>An important part of this comp is making sure you have the correct Vessels and Masks to take advantage of this. </strong>Make sure to craft these items in Akademia whenever you have the materials.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Gunner with Gunner, Faker, or Summoner</h2><p dir="ltr">Pierce physical damage is the least common of the three physical attack types, so whenever you have to deal with a dungeon featuring a large number of monsters with a weakness to Pierce, the Gunner is your best fit. If you have another Gunner, a Faker, or a Summoner present, you can use the Synthesis ability Wild Barrage, which hits all enemies with Pierce damage multiple times.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Berserker with Knight</h2><p dir="ltr">The Berserker can access two Strike damage synthesis abilities that deal massive damage, as long as a Knight is present. These two abilities, Wanton Destruction and Battlecry Tackle, have one Archetype overlap, which is the Knight. Wanton Destruction, in particular, is great, because it deals extreme physical Strike damage and it inflicts a one-time weakness to Strike. After the first use, you can continually use it every turn without losing any turn icons thanks to the weakness, making it great for tough enemies with a large amount of health.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Trickster</h2><p dir="ltr">The Trickster, the advanced version of the Faker, has access to an extreme physical Almighty attack that doesn't consume MP. Almighty damage is a special kind of damage that enemies cannot have resistance to, but they also can't be weak to. This makes it useful for enemies without weaknesses, and this special move also doesn't use MP, making it great for conserving MP in a long dungeon. To use this synthesis ability you need to have two allies in with the correct Archetypes. The first ally needs to be a Knight, Healer, or Commander, with the second ally using Thief, Faker, or Merchant.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Brawler, Merchant, Healer</h2><p dir="ltr">The Brawler, Merchant, and Healer combination gives you access to a couple of powerful Almighty attacks from the Merchant and several light attacks, as well. The Almighty attacks from the Merchant do cost money to use, but this means that they don't cost MP, a trade-off you might be willing to make late into Metaphor: ReFantazio. The powerful light attacks are great to have, since your options for high damage light attacks are fairly limited.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Whatever the information says</h2><p dir="ltr">For the majority of main and side dungeons in Metaphor: ReFantazio, you can purchase information about the monsters in each dungeon from an informant. This information usually tells you what the enemies' weaknesses are, but if you go to your requests list, it will also add a recommended Archetypes section to the description. These are always the best possible setups, especially since it usually only recommends a couple Archetypes and not a full party of four, but you will have access to most of the enemy weaknesses, making it a nice play to start if you aren't sure what party setup to go with.</p>

Valve’s affordable and portable handheld PC launched in 2022 and has quickly inspired imitators while also making it easier than ever to play new and old PC games while chilling on your couch. I know plenty of people who didn’t play many PC games who now play a ton of stuff on their Steam Deck. It’s not a debate. The Steam Deck was a big hit and has changed the video game industry. That said, in 2024, it feels like more and more of this year’s biggest games are just not running well, or running at all, on the aging Steam Deck. </p><p>The recently released<em> Silent Hill 2</em> remaster—which is very good—is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1g0e6k3/silent_hill_2_is_officially_non_supported_on/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1g0e6k3/silent_hill_2_is_officially_non_supported_on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently marked by Valve as “Unsupported” on Steam Deck</a></span>. Though you can still install it and you’ll discover that you can play the new horror game, you’ll have to turn most settings down to low and put up with some wonky performance in certain areas. It’s pretty clear this game is pushing the Steam Deck. </p><p>And it’s not alone. Here are other games that, according to Valve’s testing, are either “Unsupported” or just “Playable” (as opposed to “Verified”) on Steam Deck:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Space Marine 2</em> - Unsupported</li><li><em>Hellblade 2 -</em> Unsupported</li><li><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2 </em>- Unsupported</li><li><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> - Unsupported</li><li><em>Frostpunk 2</em> - Unsupported</li><li><em>Final Fantasy 16</em> (PC Port) - Unsupported</li><li><em>Helldivers 2</em> - Playable</li><li><em>Tekken 8 </em>- Playable</li><li><em>WWE 2K24</em> - Playable</li><li><em>Suicide Squad </em>- Playable</li><li><em>Multiversus</em> - Playable </li></ul><p>Some of these games really struggle to run on Steam Deck. <em>Space Marine 2</em>, for example, can technically still be installed and played, but even with every setting turned down to its lowest option, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/X1uxvXEYgZc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/X1uxvXEYgZc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it struggles to reach 30 FPS</a></span>. <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II,</em> which is a very pretty game, can only <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Gl4iW-mhiSg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Gl4iW-mhiSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kind of run on the Steam Deck</a></span> after lowering the settings to the point where it looks awful. And then you have something like the massive open-world RPG that is <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>, which struggled on current-gen consoles, and unsurprisingly, plays quite poorly on Steam Deck. </p><p>Now, not all of the games above are completely unplayable. For example, with some tweaks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Op9CoNvRiVg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Op9CoNvRiVg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can get<em> Black Myth: Wukong </em>to run mostly fine at 30ish FPS</a></span> on Steam Deck. The same is true of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/A0xkICYpog0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/A0xkICYpog0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a></span><em>. </em>But one of the best qualities of the Steam Deck is that many games are “Verified,” and just work great right out of the box on Valve’s tiny PC. Having to dig into multiple menus, tweak Steam Deck and game settings, and check online for recommendations isn’t much fun, and I imagine that for a lot of Steam Deck owners, it’s not something they want to mess with just to play a new game. </p><p>The reality is that the Steam Deck is getting old. It wasn’t the hottest or most powerful device around when it launched in 2022, so it’s not shocking that more and more games are struggling to run on the device. Sure, there are plenty of games that run perfectly on Steam Deck, so it’s still worth buying if you want to play indie games, older titles, or less demanding single-player experiences. </p><p>But the era of being able to run “most games” on Steam Deck, an early pitch Valve made with the device, has come to an end. And now the question is: When will Valve release a more powerful version of the Steam Deck that can play these bigger games without melting your battery or having to lower every setting?  </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nuketown-black-ops-6-confirmed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Treyarch has confirmed that Nuketown will arrive in Black Ops 6 one week after the game has hit the market. The legendary map, which has found a place in every Black Ops game in one way or another, will appear on November 1, 2024. The return of this fan-favourite map was confirmed with a brief teaser trailer showcasing the instantly recognisable environment.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-timeless">Timeless</h2>



<p>Nuketown has existed since 2010’s Black Ops, and since then, it has popped up in every successful game in the Black Ops series. It’s returning in Black Ops 6, but it won’t be added to the game until one week after the title has been released. That means users will have seven days to bolster their loadouts before jumping into what will assumedly be a 24/7 rotation of Nuketown.</p>



<p>From the teaser that was posted on social media, Nuketown looks similar to past iterations, which isn’t the most typical way that the map has been handled in previous games. Traditionally, each game will offer a unique spin on the map, fitting it into their part of the timeline or setting, but Black Ops 6’s Nuketown doesn’t look too ‘special’ at first blush:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>When Black Ops 6 is released, every map will be original, and the only maps that players will have any familiarity with will be the ones that cropped up in the beta that unravelled several weeks ago. It’s nice that Nuketown is making an appearance, as it’ll give players something comfortable to gravitate to.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Nuketown confirmed for Black Ops 6? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It's beloved for being a small and chaotic map, and it's returned several times over the years with different variations.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Black Ops Story So Far Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The podcast includes an interview with Treyarch's associate creative director, Miles Leslie, who confirms Nuketown's return in Black Ops 6. The game's campaign takes place in the Gulf War, but when asked if Black Ops 6 would feature a '90s-themed variant of Nuketown, the developer was unable to confirm the map's setting.</p><p dir="ltr">However, shortly after the podcast was released, Treyarch confirmed the map is arriving on November 1 with a teaser clip that shows a small portion of the map. The design is definitely a classic 1950s-style Nuketown, but not enough of the map is shown to determine what changes could be expected.</p><p dir="ltr">The interview also discusses Black Ops 6 Zombies, revealing that another round-based map will arrive before the end of the year. The game will launch with Terminus and Liberty Falls as the first two round-based Zombies maps.</p><p dir="ltr">Liberty Falls received criticism after the map's reveal at Call of Duty: Next, with some of the community expressing that the map's design looked and felt too casual, lacking a darker, more-traditional Zombies atmosphere.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision confirms that Liberty Falls has undergone changes since the map's reveal, explaining the map shown at that time was still a work-in-progress. Liberty Falls has since received changes to visual tone for a "moodier feel." HUD elements are also being touched for the mode. However, Activision also expressed that Liberty Falls is still supposed to be a smaller and more casual map, while Terminus is a much larger map with a more traditional Zombies feel.</p><p dir="ltr">The podcast confirms more Zombies details will arrive closer to the game's launch. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/" data-ref-id="1100-6524072">Black Ops 6</a> releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">The game will have a campaign, multiplayer, and Zombies.

			<p>Just a few days ago,<a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o3314a19koo147/red-dead-redemption-and-undead-nightmare-coming-to-pc-october-29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Rockstar announced</a> that the Red Dead Redemption Remaster will be arriving on <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-leaks-gta-6-pc-folders-and-red-dead-redemption-pc-port/">PC as of October 29</a>. In this announcement, the system requirements were mentioned, but the price of the game was not revealed. The game is set to be released on the Epic Games Store, Steam, and the RockStar Store, depending on what launcher you want to use. Today, the Epic Games Store seems to have leaked the price of the game, with it set to cost $49.99. This was shown in a <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/red-dead-redemption-remaster-will-be-priced-at-4999-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screenshot by John Papadopoulos over at DSOGaming</a>.&nbsp; At the moment, the game is starkly cheaper on console, with Red Dead Redemption costing $29.99 on every other platform, not including when the game goes on sale. However, it's possible that the game is set to cost more on PC, as Red Dead Redemption is set to have PC-specific enhancements, such as native 4K resolution up to 144hz on compatible hardware.</p>
<p>The list of PC-specific features doesn't end there, though. This remaster being ported to PC was done in collaboration with Double Eleven to add monitor support for Ultrawide and Super Ultrawide monitors, as well as full keyboard and mouse functionality for those who prefer a more tactile experience rather than using a controller.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game will have NVIDIA DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.0 upscaling, as well as NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation and many graphic settings that can be tweaked, such as draw distances and shadow quality settings. Luckily, the system requirements are pretty reasonable, and most people will be able to play it on their PC, as the game requires a RTX 2070 as a recommendation, with the game being playable on even older graphics cards.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's not known whether the game will be compatible on Steam Deck, as Red Dead Redemption 2 is just about playable on a Steam Deck. Despite that, Red Dead Redemption 2 remains one of the top games played on a Steam Deck.&nbsp; Recently, Grand Theft Auto V became unsupported on a Steam Deck after being one of the top games played on the handheld console. However, due to Rockstar Games adding anti-cheat features to the game, people will only be able to play the story mode of the game on the Steam Deck, with no access to the online servers whatsoever. Compared to the second game, Red Dead Redemption is more story-focused, but the game will be released with the zombie-horror story, Undead Nightmare, allowing players to team up and fight back against the zombie horde.</p>

A lot of the fun in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is hitting some buttons and seeing your character do some flashy hype stuff. You might think that’s enough after the quick tutorial and the first four fights in Goku’s Episode Battle story. As it turns out, this game has quite a lot of mechanics and techniques under the hood, and you’re going to want to get involved.<br></p><p><strong>If you’re having issues with this cocky ape, I highly recommend that you go through Battle Training, which is listed under the Super Training menu.</strong> This breaks down every mechanic in the game against Piccolo. I’ll be the first to admit that it’s not the most well-made training mode, and getting through it isn’t particularly enjoyable. However, <strong>you’ll be missing out on a large chunk of gameplay mechanics when you’re only going off of the tutorial</strong>. Knowing these will help you against Great Ape Vegeta and later fights as well.</p><p>High-movement mechanics will be the main focus of this fight. Avoiding his attacks and getting behind him will help a ton. These are the mechanics to nail down along with their respective inputs for PlayStation and Xbox:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Dragon Dash</strong> - The flying dash you should be aware of from the tutorial. What’s important to recognize is how much Ki it drains while in use. Performed with R2 + Cross or RT + A. Automatically rushes forward, but moving the left stick will dictate its direction.</li><li><strong>Z-Burst Dash</strong> - This is an extension of Dragon Dash that rushes you directly behind the opponent. It uses one bar of Ki and is an important move for this boss. Performed with the same inputs, R2 + Cross or RT + A. The left stick needs to be left in a neutral position.</li><li><strong>Vanishing Assault (Close-Range)</strong> - Teleports you directly behind your opponent. It uses one bar of Ki and requires you to be in close range. Performed with Square + Cross or X + A.</li><li><strong>Rush High-Speed Movement</strong> - This is an extension from Rush Attacks, allowing you to teleport around the enemy mid-way through your Rush combo. Uses a half-bar of Ki and is dependent on what direction the left stick is pushing towards. Press up will teleport you behind them, pressing left will teleport you to their left side, etc. Performed with the left stick pushed in a direction + R1 or RB.</li><li><strong>High-Speed Evasion</strong> - A counter-like evasion that teleports you directly behind the opponent when they’re attacking. The timing is strict, but it’s a great option that doesn’t use Ki. Performed with R1 or RB right before an attack hits.</li></ul><p>As tempting as it is, using an actual counter can provide mixed results in this fight. The size of this monster makes it hard to knock him off balance in one hit. Most counters will boop him away a bit, without giving you much advantage. Prioritizing hits and dodges will be more effective.</p><h2 id="h2800"><a id=""></a><strong>SLIDE #2How to Beat Great Ape Vegeta</strong><br></h2><figure id="" data-id="f11c5392fa4c56bc105b19ed94ffe408" data-recommend-id="image://f11c5392fa4c56bc105b19ed94ffe408" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku flies in the air and punches Great Ape Vegeta in his giant arm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Goku flies in the air and punches Great Ape Vegeta in his giant arm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f11c5392fa4c56bc105b19ed94ffe408" data-recommend-id="image://f11c5392fa4c56bc105b19ed94ffe408" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku flies in the air and punches Great Ape Vegeta in his giant arm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It already seemed like <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> deserved some recognition based on people’s feelings in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746">previews and reviews</a></span>. I believe it also deserves recognition for how often it can catch you off guard. Quite a few of the Episode Battles involve fights where the opponent immediately goes on the offensive. Great Ape Vegeta here is one of the more frustrating examples, as he’ll use his Super Attacks as soon as possible. Sometimes that’s right as the match starts, and sometimes he’ll give you a second or two of leeway.<br></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-previews-roundup-goku-1851652746"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> Previews Suggest That We Are So Back, Y’all</a></span></p><p><strong>You want to respond to the startup of his Super with a Z-Burst Dash.</strong> Using a Dragon Dash to the side and then following up with a Z-Burst Dash will typically get you in the clear. Alternatively, you can leave the stick alone and double-tap the Dragon Dash buttons to instantly get the Z-Burst Dash out. This works well when he starts the match with a super, but sometimes can rush you in front of him due to how he moves. This is the best you can do against an honestly pretty busted start from this jackass space ape.</p><p>Either way, the goal is to get close to him (preferably from behind) and start pummeling him with Rush attacks. You’re free to mash those Rush attacks when hitting him from behind. He can be slow to move around and only has one counter move to brush you away.</p><p><strong>If you’re attacking him in the front, I suggest going with a four-hit combo and then stepping or dashing to the side before trying again.</strong> His throw has great vertical range and can’t be countered, but it’s slow enough that a dash to the side will leave him open. I feel more comfortable using Rush High-Speed Movement because the attacks will build up the spent Ki pretty quickly. Use a Vanishing Assault instead if you’re not confident enough with those close-range side dashes. He’ll enter a hit stun state after enough hits and allow you to launch him.</p><p>Once you’ve slapped him around a couple of times and sent him flying to the ground below, it’s time to start charging your Ki. There’s a solid chance he’ll do the same until he has enough to use his supers. From this point, you have two options: keep whittling him down with close-range attacks, or try to bait out a particular super attack for big damage. Let’s go over the former first.</p><p>Using a Z-Burst dash to rush back to him is arguably the safer place to be. It’s relatively easy to dodge his supers at this range and respond with more Rush attacks or even a Kamehameha to chip more of his health away. You can also use a Kaioken skill once you have enough skill points built up. The Solar Flare skill never worked on him in my experience, while the Kaioken’s buffs were always appreciated. Keep up this routine of weaving past his attacks, hitting him until you get a launch combo, and then charging Ki before you dash in again. It will take a while, but he’ll fall sooner than later.</p><h2 id="h2801"><a id=""></a><strong>SLIDE #3How to Beat Great Ape Vegeta Quickly</strong><br></h2><figure id="" data-id="a91e28bec840b421149693965df62972" data-recommend-id="image://a91e28bec840b421149693965df62972" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku shoots off a Kamehameha in a large beam clash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Goku shoots off a Kamehameha in a large beam clash." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a91e28bec840b421149693965df62972" data-recommend-id="image://a91e28bec840b421149693965df62972" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku shoots off a Kamehameha in a large beam clash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I don’t like keeping distance in this fight, because Great Ape Vegeta has a deceptively quick dash that he can use to combo into his supers. Be ready to block or counter if the big guy suddenly zooms into your face. That being said, you can take his health bar down quite a bit if he attacks from afar. <strong>This other strategy is to bait out his Chou Makouhou Super and respond with your Kamehameha Super for a beam clash.</strong> You’ll know it’s the right one when he says “I’ll break you!” before firing a mouth beam.<br></p><p>A cinematic of two beams heading into each other will start to play. Then you just need to beat the minigame to win the struggle. The AI is pretty lenient here, so you should be able to do this with no problem. Winning the beam clash will take off two entire bars of his health. This is one of the most damaging things you can do, but it’s risky and left up to chance. There’s no telling which super he’ll use, or whether he’ll decide to close the gap quickly with a dash. If it works out, you’ll be a lot closer to finishing this fight.</p><p>Remember to charge up your Ki again after the beam clash concludes. You can then decide to try to bait him again with a beam clash or to mix it up with some close-range attacks. I prefer to not tempt fate twice, but he’ll be nearly finished if you can win two beam clashes.</p><hr><p>Great Ape Vegeta isn’t the toughest boss in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, but he is a major knowledge check for the game’s mechanics. Brush up on that knowledge and you’ll be fine. I don’t believe it’s outwardly said, but you shouldn’t think you can skirt around with Ability Item buffs either. Those won’t work in Episode Battles. You’ll need to solely rely on what you learn from training, which to be fair, is the Goku way.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That puts Yajirobe in the same lane as Saibaman, Frieza Soldiers, and Guldo. However, the “bean daddy” is punching way above his weight. </p><p>“Bean daddy,” which I’m going to write as many times as my editor will allow, refers to Yajirobe’s penchant for always saving the day with Korin’s magical Senzu beans. In <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, the series’ number one medic can heal himself repeatedly in matches using a renewable Senzu bean skill for three skill stocks. Combined with his ultimate, it can make him surprisingly effective despite being a back-bencher. </p><p>But the “bean daddy” is even more deadly due to the match timer. Whoever has the most health at the end of the time limit automatically wins. This means that Yajirobe players can simply land some hits and then keep running away and chowing down in order to eke out wins. It’s a cheap strategy that is also completely in keeping with the spirit of the character. And plenty of people are pissed about it. </p><p>The <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> subreddit, Discord, YouTube, and Tiktok are full of players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1g00fat/criticism_for_ranked_so_far_from_top_ranked/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tenkaichi4/comments/1g00fat/criticism_for_ranked_so_far_from_top_ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confessing to getting wrecked in online matches</a></span> by aspiring “bean daddies.” “Those that play bean daddy and spam senzus have super size dragon balls if you think I’m not gonna find you after that match...” lamented one player on the game’s unofficial Discord. “My only loss was to a Yajirobe dude who had like 5 low dp characters,” wrote another. “He spammed senzu bean and RAN AWAY until time ran out.”</p><p>And the “bean daddy” takeover <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/439864-dragon-ball-sparking-zero/80862609&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/439864-dragon-ball-sparking-zero/80862609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">may just be beginning</a></span>. “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sCXCrqI4xg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sCXCrqI4xg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yajirobe is totally cracked</a></span>,” according to one YouTuber.

He just has to wait it out and knock you away once and boom he’s back to full health again.”</p><p>But calls for “Bean Daddy” nerfs are already getting some pushback. Unlike a lot of fighting games, the <em>Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi </em>series upon which <em>Sparking Zero </em>is based was never aimed at pursuing perfect competitive fairness. They were supposed to be a celebration of the anime and the manga that it’s based on, inclusive of all its goofy absurdities and nonsensical plot developments. Some characters have more health and more powerful attacks in <em>Sparking Zero</em>, and to compensate, they take up more points on online rosters. </p><p>The new game focuses on online play and ranked leaderboards (sadly, local matches are limited to a single map), so there will be more pressure to balance characters than in the past. Even so, some want to preserve the series’ unhinged ethos. “Unpopular opinion, I want no character nerfed in<em> Sparking Zero</em>,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Rhymestyle/status/1844157348258181291&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Rhymestyle/status/1844157348258181291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> Twitch streamer rhymstyle. “Let the chaos be as it is designed to be.  this is the<em> Tenkaichi</em> law since 2007.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Throughout the game industry's short history, there's been ample debate about how much piracy actually impacts a game's legitimate sales. On one side, some publishers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/09/software-piracy-and-job-growth-a-zero-sum-game/">try to argue</a> that every single pirated download should count as a "lost sale" that they would have logged in a theoretical piracy-free world. On the other side, some wiseacres argue that most pirates would never consider paying for a legitimate version of the game in the first place or that piracy can actually <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/eu-study-finds-piracy-doesnt-hurt-game-sales-may-actually-help/">be useful</a> as a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/how-one-game-developer-is-making-the-pirate-bay-work-for-him/">word-of-mouth promotional tool</a>.</p>
<p>While the true effect of piracy on sales revenue is likely somewhere between those two extremes, piracy's precise financial impact on a game has always been hard to nail down. Now, though, a recently published study uses <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/denuvos-drm-ins-now-being-cracked-within-hours-of-release/">post-release cracks</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/denuvo-wants-to-convince-you-its-drm-isnt-evil/">Denuvo's DRM protections</a> as a sort of natural experiment on games sales in pre- and post-piracy worlds. The results "imply an average proportionate loss of revenue of around 19 percent in each week of release if a crack is available," according to the study, suggesting that effective DRM can actually have a significant impact on a publisher's bottom line.</p>
<h2>The data dance</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875952124002532?dgcid=author#fn9">"The Revenue Effects of Denuvo Digital Rights Management on PC Video Games,"</a>&nbsp;published in the peer-reviewed journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/entertainment-computing">Entertainment Computing</a>, UNC research associate <a href="https://uncipc.org/index.php/people/william-volckmann/">William Volckmann</a> examines 86 different Denuvo-protected games initially released on Steam between September 2014 and the end of 2022. That sample includes many games where Denuvo protection endured for at least 12 weeks (when new sales tend to drop off to "negligible" amounts for most games) and many others where earlier cracks allowed for widespread piracy at some point.</p>

<p>Crucially, the presence and/or specific timing of a crack's availability couldn't be effectively predicted by characteristics like pricing or critical review scores. That makes the existence of a crack "a practically exogenous event" that can be used to effectively segregate a game's revenues in a no-piracy world (i.e., before the Denuvo crack is available) and a piracy-filled world (i.e., after the crack's release). The variable timing of different crack releases also helps the relative analysis, since "revenue is highest close to the release date, and therefore a crack that appears close to the release date has a disproportionately large effect on revenue," Volckmann writes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/steam-gauge/">lack of good publicly available sales data</a> for most games makes it difficult to measure these revenue effects directly. To estimate a Steam game's relative sales decline in each week after release, Volckmann uses a proxy that combines the number of new Steam user reviews and, for single-player narrative games, the game's average active player count. While Volckmann acknowledges that these imperfect estimates represent "the biggest limitation of this study," any estimated biases away from actual sales data seem likely to cancel out across the various games in the sample.</p>

<h2>“The no-crack counterfactual”</h2>
<p>After applying some complex statistical models to the underlying data, Volckmann finds that, unsurprisingly, relative revenues in the weeks following a crack's release are lower than the baseline expectation for uncracked games in the same time period. These negative effects of a crack on revenues—which are highly statistically significant (p&lt;0.01)—"impl[ies] that the appearance of a crack reduces revenue relative to the no-crack counterfactual," Volckmann writes.</p>

<p>Just how much money a publisher can expect to lose from a Denuvo crack, though, depends heavily on how quickly the game is cracked, Volckmann finds. A Denuvo-protected game cracked in the first week after release can expect to make about 20 percent less revenue than if the DRM had remained in place, according to the study, while a crack six weeks after a game's release only costs an estimated 5 percent of theoretical total revenue. After 12 weeks, new sales are so negligible that "developers could eventually remove unpopular DRM schemes with minimal losses (and possible gains from strongly DRM-averse consumers)," Volckmann suggests (and some publishers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/12/after-cracks-developers-remove-denuvo-drm-from-their-games/">have done just that</a> after Denuvo is no longer effectively protecting new sales).</p>
<p>Volckmann's data lines up with public statements that Denuvo-maker Irdeto has made regarding the need for DRM to protect a game's crucial post-launch window. "We don't position Denuvo Anti Tamper as being uncrackable—no anti piracy solution is," Denuvo VP of Sales Robert Hernandez <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/02/denuvo-our-cracked-re7-protection-is-still-better-than-nothing/">told Ars in 2017</a>. "However, our goal is to keep each title safe from piracy during the crucial initial sales window when most of the sales are made."</p>

<p>Overall, according to Volckmann's data, Denuvo is doing just that. The median Denuvo-protected games lose almost no sales to piracy, Volckmann suggests, because the protection "more often than not" goes uncracked in that initial 12-week window. In a world with no DRM, on the other hand, Volckmann projects those games could expect 20 percent less revenue at the median.</p>
<p>Whatever you think of DRM schemes like Denuvo, the potential to protect against that kind of revenue hit is something that major publishers might find hard to ignore. And there are signs that Denuvo's protection is becoming more crack-resistant in recent months; the CrackWatch subreddit <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/p9ak4n/crack_watch_games/">lists 28 Denuvo-protected games released so far in 2024</a>, 26 of which remain uncracked and two of which were cracked well outside the 12-week release window. As we see in this study, that kind of robust protection can be worth a significant amount to a piracy-wary game publisher.</p>

(The "right" side presumably being whichever one doesn't have a green shell lurking nearby for users to slip on.) Alarmo also features motion-sensing technology that allows users to silence its sounds with a single handwave.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/66379/p/1094/c/898" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo's official website</a>, the Alarmo v.2.0.0 update features the following tweaks, additions, and changes:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Added “Moderate Mode” as a new Mode option.</li><li dir="ltr">Added “Movement Record” as a new Records feature.  <ul><li dir="ltr">This will automatically display in Records if you go to bed during “Bedtime.”</li><li dir="ltr">You can set this to On or Off in the “Records” menu on the device.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">“Distance from bed” can now be set to 20in/50cm max for Queen and King size beds.</li><li dir="ltr">When “Check Sensor Zone” is run, an estimated “position of movement” will now be displayed.</li><li dir="ltr">General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In addition to the inclusion of nostalgic Nintendo sounds and a motion-sensor, Alarmo also features scenes from various Nintendo Switch titles that can be used as a background in place of the standard clock face. The following games are included in Alarmo's collection of backgrounds:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/">The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pikmin-4/">Pikmin 4</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ring-fit-adventure/">Ring Fit Adventure</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splatoon-3/">Splatoon 3</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-odyssey/">Super Mario Odyssey</a></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Users who connect Alarmo to their Nintendo Online account will gain access to two more unique clock face background scenes: one from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons/">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, and one from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-8/">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>. But despite so many Switch games being featured in the clock's design, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/66618/kw/alarmo" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo has confirmed that the Alarmo is a "standalone device"</a> that does not interact with other Nintendo hardware, including the Nintendo Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Alarmo clock is available for preorder now via <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's official online store</a>, and retails for $100 USD. Currently, only customers with an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription can place an order. The Alarmo is scheduled to begin shipping to customers sometime in early 2025.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Red Dead Redemption - Official PC Release Date Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Red Dead Redemption for PC includes the base game and the Undead Nightmare expansion, which challenges players to fight against zombies in the wild West. The package also comes with bonus content from Red Dead Redemption's Game of the Year Edition.</p><p>Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption tells the story of the cowboy John Marston as he sets out to seek revenge in 1911. Marston is tracking down members of the Van der Linde gang, and unfortunately for him, it's a long, difficult, and painful journey.</p><p>The game earned rave reviews upon launch in May 2010 for PS3 and Xbox 360. A sequel, Red Dead Redemption II, came out in 2018 for PS4 and Xbox One, followed by a PC launch in 2019.</p><p>The PC edition of Red Dead Redemption is developed by port studio Double Eleven in collaboration with Rockstar. Fans will no doubt hope the PC launch goes smoother than the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-the-trilogy-definitive-edition-patches-are-coming-original-games-being-reinstated-on-pc/1100-6498205/" data-ref-id="1100-6498205">rollout of the GTA Trilogy in 2021, which was marred with technical problems.</a></p><p>There will be a number of PC-specific features, including native 4K visuals at up to 144hz, along with support for ultrawide and super ultrawide monitors. The game also includes support for HDR10 and Nvidia DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.0 upscaling. Nvidia DLSS frame generation is also supported, while players can adjust draw distances and shadow quality settings, among other things.</p><p>The minimum and recommended PC system requirements for Red Dead Redemption were <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668510/Red_Dead_Redemption/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on Steam.</a> These may be subject to change.</p><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-4670 / AMD FX-9590</li><li>Memory: 8 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 / AMD Radeon R7 360</li><li>DirectX: Version 12</li><li>Storage: 12 GB available space</li><li>Sound Card: Direct X Compatible</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li><li>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500X</li><li>Memory: 8 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 2070 / AMD RX 5700 XT</li><li>DirectX: Version 12</li><li>Storage: 12 GB available space</li><li>Sound Card: Direct X Compatible</li><li>Additional Notes: SSD recommended</li></ul><p>As for Rockstar Games, the studio is now developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, which is set for release in Fall 2025.</p>

If there’s a game you’ve been looking for, chances are that it’s currently on sale on one of the various console or PC storefronts right now. Such is the case with PlayStation, which just kicked off its massive seasonal sale that features thousands of discounted games, DLCs, in-game currencies, and more. Luckily, y’all have got me to help you sift through all those available deals for the best ones, and here’s what I’ve managed to wrangle up.<br></p></div><div><p>2024 marked the long-awaited return of<em> EA Sports College Football</em> series, which took an 11-year hiatus after legal troubles surrounding the NCAA’s willingness to pay college players for their likenesses. <em>College Football 25</em>, which launched earlier this year, was heavily anticipated as a result of that, and boy did it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-ncaa-14-biggest-game-playercount-1851595253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-ncaa-14-biggest-game-playercount-1851595253">sell like hot cakes</a></span>. I’ve never seen a football video game drive people nuts the way that this one did when it came out, and honestly, I’m really happy for the folks who’ve been clamoring for another one of these titles for so long.</p><p>Football fans in general are thriving since both <em>College Football 25 </em>and <em>Madden NFL 25 </em>released right around the same time, and EA went right ahead and even bundled the deluxe edition of both games together. <strong>The bundle with both games typically goes for $150, but it’s actually pretty significantly discounted to $112.49 at the moment.</strong> Still a hefty asking price, but considering the fact that sports game enjoyers typically pick up one or two games a year, you can’t beat that price for two of the biggest games in the genre.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-xbox-game-pass-steam-goat-clean-1849200259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-xbox-game-pass-steam-goat-clean-1849200259"><em>PowerWash Simulator </em>is my happy place</a></span>. I cannot stress enough how relaxing it is to turn to it when I need a low-stakes game to drop several hours into while I’m listening to a podcast, watching a show in the background, or even just casually chatting with some friends. Cycling through different nozzles to best clean a filthy bathroom or a theme park attraction is so soothing and comforting, and I’ve been relying on <em>PowerWash Simulator </em>again more recently to relax me in times of great stress. Ever since it was released, its developers have also supported it with various DLCs, including a slew of crossovers with series like <em>Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy</em>, and most recently, <em>Spongebob Squarepants</em>, as well as <em>Shrek</em>. It’s a good time, and you can even bring some friends along to help on the really deep cleans if you so desire. <strong>The point is, for $17.49, you can grab </strong><em><strong>PowerWash Simulator </strong></em><strong>and clean to your heart’s content.</strong></p></div><div><p>I’ve yet to finish <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pacific-drive-steam-ps5-survival-crafting-sim-1851282916&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pacific-drive-steam-ps5-survival-crafting-sim-1851282916"><em>Pacific Drive</em></a></span>, but it’s still one of the most special games of 2024, and I desperately need to get back around to it. A survival game set in the Pacific Northwest, <em>Pacific Drive </em>centers around a station wagon that’s been retrofitted with the necessary technology and tools to weather the supernatural phenomena of the Olympic Exclusion Zone, which you are attempting to get to the center of. As you plot a course through the Exclusion Zone, you’ll make pit stops to scrounge for materials to survive and upgrade the car, which is the real star of the show.</p><p>Not only is the car fully customizable, but it’s simply <em>everything</em>. It is the quickest way to get around the map, it’s the safest spot to be when weird shit starts happening, and it is where you will store 90 percent of the materials you find. Its maintenance is one of the most tactile experiences I’ve had in a game, and the way that the game encourages players to be hands-on with the car immediately fosters a strong connection as you embark on the world’s strangest and most dangerous road trip. <em><strong>Pacific Drive </strong></em><strong>is an offbeat good time, and you can pick it up for $18 right now.</strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-makes-the-first-game-requ-1846899558&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-makes-the-first-game-requ-1846899558"><em>Mass Effect</em></a></span><em> </em>is one of gaming’s most legendary series by this point. Most people have probably heard of Bioware’s epic sci-fi RPG series, but I’m sure many haven’t actually played them since they’re a huge investment. It’s a pretty big undertaking, all things told, but that shouldn’t stop any of you from picking up this collection of remasters for the primary trilogy of the franchise. You’ll <em>eventually</em> play them, and you’ll thank me for this recommendation when you do. <em>Mass Effect</em>’s a pretty solid series of third-person shooters, but you’ll likely find that you’re more drawn to its magnetic and charming cast of characters, who you’ll befriend and even fall in love with as you fight to save the galaxy from forces beyond your wildest dreams. <strong>These titles are a saga quite unlike anything else in gaming’s history, and you </strong><em><strong>should</strong></em><strong> grab </strong><em><strong>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</strong></em><strong> while it’s only $9.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>There are, at this point, several ways to get into the <em>Like A Dragon</em>/<em>Yakuza </em>series. Many, including myself, would probably <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-friction-new-game-features-mechanics-1851602899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-friction-new-game-features-mechanics-1851602899">scream at you to pick up <em>Yakuza 0</em></a></span>, a prequel to the entire series that sets up two of its major characters in extraordinary fashion, but that’s assuming that you will then play all of the rest of the games, which is <em>a lot</em>. A few years ago though, the series phased out its longtime protagonist Kazuma Kiryu for a fresh face and entirely different gameplay system, and the game that came from it has now served as a new entry point into the series. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-the-kotaku-review-1845822473&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-the-kotaku-review-1845822473"><em>Yakuza: Like A Dragon</em></a></span><em> </em>follows <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-s-latest-protagonist-is-the-hero-i-need-right-no-1845755843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-s-latest-protagonist-is-the-hero-i-need-right-no-1845755843">Ichiban Kasuga, Japan’s foremost himbo</a></span>, who sees the world through the lens of his favorite video game, the original <em>Dragon Quest</em>. That means that instead of brawling with dudes on the street in gruesome melee combat, he instead sees himself as the hero of a party of characters with jobs and classes who fight in turn-based combat.</p><p>Kasuga is such an effortlessly charming lead, and carries the game with aplomb, but he is aided by an equally lovable cast of allies, including a homeless doctor named Nanba, an ex-cop named Adachi, and a hostess manager named Saeko, among so many other wonderful faces. Most importantly, you don’t really need to understand much of the previous games to know about any of them or their motivations, which are all spelled out over the course of the lengthy RPG. There are characters from the larger series whose actions echo throughout the game, but this installment <em>mostly </em>kicks off its own story while carrying forward the tenets of <em>Like A Dragon </em>that have made the series such a smashing success over the last decade. <em><strong>Yakuza: Like A Dragon </strong></em><strong>is a wonderful starting point for anyone curious about the franchise, and it’s only $10 right now.</strong></p></div><div><p>To make a long story remarkably short<em>, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/titanfall-2-the-kotaku-review-1788374693&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/titanfall-2-the-kotaku-review-1788374693"><em>Titanfall 2</em></a></span><em> </em>is simply one of the most essential shooters of the last decade. The way that people speak about <em>Half-Life </em>and its sequel is the way that we should and will talk about <em>Titanfall 2 </em>in the years to come, and it’s already begun. The criminally overlooked shooter sees Respawn Entertainment firing on all cylinders in ways I didn’t even think possible. Its campaign is bursting at the seams with an energy I haven’t found in many other first-person shooters, and nearly every one of its missions defies the bog-standard conventions of the genre. It’s a live wire of a game, and you owe it to yourself to play what should be one of the most influential FPS games of our time. <strong>Luckily, </strong><em><strong>Titanfall 2 </strong></em><strong>is regularly on sale, and when it is it’s always dirt cheap, so consider this your reminder to pick up one of the best shooters ever while it’s $5 right now.</strong><br></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/control-the-kotaku-review-1837569523&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/control-the-kotaku-review-1837569523"><em>Control</em></a></span><em> </em>is another one of the all-timers of the last several years. It’s creepy as hell, but also deeply silly, which is a tightrope act that the developer Remedy Entertainment has been honing for quite some time now. Jesse Faden, the game’s protagonist, is one of the most commanding and assured heroines I’ve ever come across, and is gaming’s best redhead by a mile. I love <em>Control</em>’s constantly shifting walls, the unease that permeates every one of its hallways, and how I never quite feel welcome or in charge in the Oldest House. I love that <em>Control </em>is one big ode to the era of creepypasta fiction that I grew up on, and how it treats that subject material with reverence. <strong>I could list near endless highlights from </strong><em><strong>Control</strong></em><strong>, a damn-near perfect video game if there ever were such a thing, but in order to </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mysteries-are-the-heart-of-control-1844900378&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mysteries-are-the-heart-of-control-1844900378"><strong>preserve its mysteries</strong></a></span><strong>, I will simply urge you to pick it up while it’s discounted to $8.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>By my estimation, I’m in the third act of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/arranger-role-puzzling-adventure-review-puzzle-game-1851600269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/arranger-role-puzzling-adventure-review-puzzle-game-1851600269"><em>Arranger</em></a></span><em> </em>at the moment and absolutely loving it. It’s been a great year for <em>Zelda</em>-like games, and this is pretty high up there. Developed by Furniture &amp; Mattress, <em>Arranger </em>follows Jemma who leaves behind the only life she’s known to explore the world outside their village’s walls. Only, Jemma’s excuse for living is that she’s never quite fit in, and for good reason: whenever she moves, the entire axis that she ambles along shifts with her. She quite literally exercises control over the world around her with every step she takes, much to the detriment of everyone around her. However, <em>Arranger </em>tracks her journey and how she comes to accept this confounding ability as a boon to be shared with others rather than the curse she believes it to be. It’s a sweet and short puzzler that adds a charming wrinkle to the tried-and-true formula of isometric action-adventure games like it, and it goes a long way to making <em>Arranger </em>stand apart in an otherwise crowded genre. <em><strong>Arranger </strong></em><strong>can be all yours for $15, and I can’t recommend it enough.</strong><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/realmwalker-event-in-diablo-4/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>As part of Season 6, Diablo 4 introduces us to a host of new mechanics, a total overhaul of countless game systems, and the introduction of the Realmwalker event. It’s an entirely new world event that appears regularly across Sanctuary, and if you’re brave enough to beat the forces of Hell, then you’ll earn sweet rewards for your—likely—Spiritborn. Here’s what you should know about the Realmwalker event in Diablo 4!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-new-realmwalker-event">What is the New Realmwalker Event?</h2>



<p>As the rage of Mephisto spreads across Sanctuary, so too do his forces of Hell. One of the most formidable enemies in his legion is the Realmwalker—a lumbering colossi that resembles an armored, demonic turtle with a portal to Oblivion on its back. They’re not as powerful as a World Boss, but still potent enough to cause problems.</p>



<p>If you can slay a Realmwalker, its corpse spawns a portal to the Seething Realm—a dungeon unique to this season that drops Seething Opal Elixiers.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-beat-the-realmwalker">How to Beat the Realmwalker</h2>



<p>The Realmwalker fight occurs across three stages, with the first stage proving the most annoying. To start with, the Realmwalker is utterly invulnerable to damage. You must defeat the Bloodhound Guardians protecting the Realmwalker to deal any damage. Then, the monster spawns Hatred Spires that power up its abilities. Defeat those promptly to squash its Kamehameha-like powers.</p>



<p>With the pillars eradicated, turn your attention on the demon spawn and start wailing on it with an axe or two until it falls.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-the-realmwalker-spawn">When Does the Realmwalker Spawn?</h2>



<p>These walking monstrosities spawn every 15 minutes in a random zone across Sanctuary. A second one appears in Nahantu every hour, giving players to the south a shot at defeating the beast. Check your map! There’s a brand-new green icon that indicates “Hatred Rising,” which is where you’ll find the Realmwalker.</p>



<p>Did you take down the Realmwalker yet? Let us know in the comments below, or share some tips for other players in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forums</a>!</p>

<p>Concord may be offline, but it doesn’t appear fully dead just yet. If you haven’t checked the Concord’s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> page in weeks, you’ve likely missed that it has continued to see various updates on Steam. </p>



<p>Over the last few weeks, there have been multiple daily updates to the game on Steam. Since October 6, the game has seen 20 updates on Steam by various users such as “pmtest”, “sonyqae_shipping”, and “sonyqae”. It’s unknown what the updates are exactly, but there are rumors that the game could be looking to re-release as a free-to-play title.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Concord launched at the end of August to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concords-launch-is-worse-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than 700 players</a> on Steam while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-sales-25000-analysts-estimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly selling just 25,000 copies</a> across PC and PlayStation 5. Just two weeks after its launch, the game was shut down by Sony and developer Firewalk Studios. After that, game director Ryan Ellis <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-director-steps-down-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down from his position</a>.</p>



<p>With the game reportedly taking eight years to develop and costing $400 million, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the game relaunched as a free-to-play title. The last time the game was available for players to play for free, however, the game saw a peak of just 2,388 players during an open beta.</p>







<p>There’s been no comment from PlayStation or Firewalk about what these updates could be for.</p>

			<p>In a completely new round of speculations, it's rumored that Concord is still continuing to be updated on Steam, with Sony updating Concord's game files via Steam's back-end, leading to rumors swirling that Concord will be making a return. Concord will go down in PlayStation's history, but not in a positive light like they were hoping. Instead, the game completely flopped and was <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/">removed from the store</a> within weeks, and refunds were given to all who purchased the title. The rumor comes from Reddit, which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1g0gxi7/concord_files_are_still_being_updated_via_steamdb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shows the exact files</a> that have been changed in the SteamDB for Concord, with the files being updated on October 8. Multiple industry professionals have commented on the Concord debacle, with many saying that going F2P is the only thing that could possibly save this game. However, there are also professionals who say that Concord is just completely dead in the water, with no chance of redemption.</p>
<p>Considering that Concord was a huge project for Sony, reportedly sinking millions of dollars into Concord, it makes sense that they would try their hardest to redeem this game, even if it seems that the general gaming audience also doesn't care much about whether it ends up saved or not. To be able to salvage a game as big as Concord, Sony would have to invest more money into the project, which, after how the game performed, is just not an option at this point.</p>
<p>In a genre that is already heavily saturated, it makes sense that a premium hero shooter didn't quite hit the mark. When games like Overwatch, Apex Legends, and Valorant exist, there are already plenty of options on the market for players, which begs the question of why would anyone pay for a premium hero shooter when there are free ones that could perform better and are more accessible for a larger audience?</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if Concord will resurface as a free-to-play hero shooter in an attempt to scrape together some of the money that they funneled into the project, but it's uncertain territory right now, especially for Firewalk Studios, who were the developers of the game. It's said that they are bracing for mass layoffs, as Firewalk is one of the more expensive studios owned by Sony. Already, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/concords-director-has-reportedly-stepped-down/">Game Director of Concord</a> has stepped down, so it's possible that more are to follow. With how badly the launch of Concord went, some of the team are even expecting Firewalk to be closed down entirely.</p>
<p>If it goes free to play on Steam and PlayStation, it may just save the game by the skin of its teeth, but no one knows for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monomyth-preview-dungeon-full-of-opportunity<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monomyth</em> is said to be inspired by the likes of old-school dungeon-crawler RPGs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a>'s <em>King's Field</em>, along with classic immersive sims such as <em>Arx Fatalis</em>. Those games are a bit before my time, but if they invoke the same feelings of exploration and mystery as <em>Monomyth</em>, I have a couple more items to add to the gaming backlog.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-character.jpg?itok=y4niyLiA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-character.jpg?itok=RgIvnVVo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Choices, choices.</figcaption></figure><h2>Who Will You Be in <em>Monomyth</em>?</h2>
<p>Indeed, if there ever was a game that captured the spirit of exploring an unknown, unfathomable dungeon, <em>Monomyth </em>is a crowning example. If I had to draw an even closer comparison, <em>Monomyth</em> feels like one giant<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/elder-scrolls">Elder Scrolls</a></em> dungeon, though this game is much more robust and open-ended.</p>
<p>This is precisely the reason why I'm excited to see how <em>Monomyth </em>develops throughout its Early Access duration. Strange obelisks, forgotten ruins, and decrepit crypts are the tip of the iceberg in <em>Monomyth</em>, and you'll explore all of these areas with your very own classless character.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-church.jpg?itok=_NADI1yQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-church.jpg?itok=e1bAS-7V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't mind the dagger, Mr. Priest.</figcaption></figure><p>I emphasize classless, as the main character is not necessarily bound to a single archetype. You'll start this adventure by crafting your character, and this is primarily through the allocation of stats. You have RPG standards like strength, dexterity, and intelligence as attributes, but also a selection of skill points to further enhance your build.</p>
<p>Attributes are generally useful all around, but to fine-tune your character as you create them and after each level up, you'll want to allocate points into skill points such as athletics, stealth, speech, archery, types of magic, and more. It's almost a bit overwhelming since you're not entirely sure how effective said points are, but for the sake of the playthrough, I went for a more stealthy character.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-douse.jpg?itok=GBnpg423 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-douse.jpg?itok=W5qBaaxh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even basic magic is possible, like Douse, which will put out open flames. Useful for stealthy types!</figcaption></figure><h2>Diving into the Dungeon of <em>Monomyth</em></h2>
<p>After a brief tutorial segment -- which sees our character get captured, thrown in jail, and escape from said jail in <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fashion-- we're thrown headfirst into <em>Monomyth</em>'s world. So far, at least, it's entirely underground, though this cave system comprises various fortresses, settlements, temples, and more.</p>
<p>There's a plot and objective that propels the player forward, but there's no urgency, and exploration is what <em>Monomyth</em> is all about. Since this is an immersive sim, many elements are interactable. It behooves the player to thoroughly search the area for items. Since I'm the stealthy type, I also specialized in lock picking, allowing me to find even more treasure.</p>
<p>Other immersive sim elements come into play as well; for example, wooden doors can be set on fire with a torch. Even if it's locked, you don't have to waste a lockpick. Just set fire to the door, and it'll fall apart (or just bash it with a weapon). Weapons, however, dull over time, so you'd then have to heat it up at a forge and use a hammer to hone its edge.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-dungeon.jpg?itok=6A_HG_iX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-dungeon.jpg?itok=DQH5iJEi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This area seemed vastly different from the rest, and that's very intriguing to me.</figcaption></figure><p>Certain areas have hidden entrances that are accessible through player ingenuity, so it benefits the player to use a bit of observation and thinking to find various ways into buildings and areas that may seem otherwise inaccessible.</p>
<p>Adding even more to the immersive sim elements, you can even cook your own food. Eating food raw makes you sick, so any fish or raw meat needs to be placed near a fire. I found a bakery in a fortress with raw pies and dough, and seeing them actually cook over time was satisfying.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-combat.jpg?itok=iUmTCRjM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-combat.jpg?itok=np9wXfJT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Genuinely, what did I do to deserve this?</figcaption></figure><h2>Fighting For My Life</h2>
<p>This cave is not without peril, however, as enemies and traps wait as I path my way through uncharted territory. Giant rats, Wastelanders (which are these orc-like enemies), and even human thugs are among the enemies you'll fight.</p>
<p>Combat is where <em>Monomyth</em> could use a lot of work. Combat is dull, plain and simple. It amounts to swinging your weapon and dodging and blocking attacks. Since I went for a stealthy build, I had hoped for a stealth attack bonus or something. Getting one free attack unnoticed is all well and good, but some of these enemies are quite tanky and deal an insane amount of damage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-explosive.jpg?itok=xrvMqJKZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-explosive.jpg?itok=SgfhmDif 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I've had enough of dying -- time to break out the explosive barrel.</figcaption></figure><p>Things worked out a bit better once I found a rapier to replace my dagger, but as a game that advertises itself as classless, it should feel like any build is viable. Had I gone for a more magic-focused build, perhaps I would have found more success. By the time I found offensive magic, I was pretty deep into my melee build and it wasn't really viable to restart.</p>
<p>God forbid you come across multiple enemies. You might be lucky and find an explosive on the ground or something, but there's not much a player can do when you're hounded by a bunch of bandits. You could quite easily sneak past tougher enemies with a build like mine, but then there's less experience to be gained since I'm not slaying said enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monomyth-town.jpg?itok=g-oUBFUT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monomyth-town.jpg?itok=nG4s3fIf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A town full of future possibilities?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Monomyth </em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I eventually found my way into a bigger area in what seemed like <em>Monomyth</em>'s first town. There doesn't seem to be a great deal to do here, and interacting with NPCs mostly leads nowhere. I can't help but think the developer, being a one-man operation, bit off more than they can chew in some areas. But when <em>Monomyth</em> works, like in its overall dungeon design, solving various puzzles and finding a powerful piece of loot, it's fantastic.</p>
<p>Throughout its Early Access period, it's my hope that combat is refined to be a bit more exciting and intricate, and that there's more life to its various NPCs and the towns they inhabit. There's already the foundation for a super intriguing, fun adventure with the various hidden areas and puzzles, so if the rest of the game is just as good, I'll be back for more <em>Monomyth</em> soon enough.</p>

<p>The next generation of Nvidia graphics cards are coming in January. According to a new report from <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32-gb-rtx-5080-16-gb-rtx-5070-12-gb-ces-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wccftech</a>, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs will be announced at CES 2025 from Las Vegas. </p>



<p>This reveal will include the Nvidia RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070.</p>



<p>In addition to the report of a launch at CES, Wccftech also has information on expected specs for each card. All of the details come from the outlet’s sources, and should be taken with a grain of salt until Insider Gaming can confirm or an official announcement is made.</p>



<p>One of the biggest bits of information from the report is that the RTX 5070 will have fewer cores and SMs than the RTX 4070 Ti. The RTX 4070 Ti has 7,680 CUDA Cores with 60 SMs. If the chip reportedly being used on the RTX 5070 is fully enabled, it can support a max of 6,400 CUDA Cores and 50 SMs. That said, it’s worth noting that they are different generation graphics cards. Until we can actual test out they perform, it’s unknown how much of a difference there will be in performance.</p>
