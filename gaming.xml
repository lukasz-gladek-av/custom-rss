The inverted camera option is the most notable new addition in the update. Konami notes that version 1.1.3 fixes minor bugs and updates textures and models "in certain scenes." The update also addresses game crashes and a bug where players weren't getting their rewards for collecting GA-KO.</p><p>According to Konami, the following issues are being investigated for future fixes:</p><ul><li>(Steam) Support for 21:9 aspect ratio displays (excluding demo scenes).</li><li>(Steam) In-game feature to check system specifications.</li><li>(PlayStation 5) Option to select a preferred rendering mode when playing on PlayStation 5 Pro.</li><li>(All Platforms) Improvements to overall performance stability.</li></ul><p>The "21:9 aspect ratio" is another way of saying ultrawide display support.

Last week, a Washington District Court judge <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26086297-nintendo-v-modded-hardware/">ordered Ryan Daley</a> to pay Nintendo $2 million and stop selling modded Switch consoles online, as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-wins-a-2-million-lawsuit-against-popular-switch-modding-webstore-174528989.html">reported earlier by <em>Engadget</em></a>.</p><p>In a copyright lawsuit filed last year, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/modded-hardware-defendant-denies-nintendos-copyright-claims-in-court-241006/">Nintendo accused</a> Daley of operating the website Modded Hardware, which sold modded Switch consoles, modchips used to hack into Switch devices, and Mig flash cartridges that allow people to play pirated copies of games.</p><p>Nintendo claimed Daley caused the company “significant and irreparable harm” — and the judge agreed. “The MIG Devices, Mod Chips, Hacked Consoles, and Circumvention Services allow members of the public to create, distribute, and play pirated Nintendo games on a massive scale,” the ruling states. Daley denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>Piracy lawsuits from Nintendo have become increasingly common, with the company winning its case <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/624618/nintendo-piracy-lawsuit-1fichier">against a file-sharing site</a> accused of hosting pirated games earlier this year. Nintendo’s legal actions have led to the shutdown of Switch emulators, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24098640/nintendo-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-switch-aftermath">including Yuzu</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259791/nintendo-ryujinx-switch-emulator-gdkchan-removed-downloads-github">Ryujinx</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-split-screen-coop-switch-2-amon-skill-tree-2000618064"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> is almost here. The next installment in Gearbox and 2K’s fan-favorite co-op looter shooter series is launching on September 12 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. (The Switch 2 port arrives next month.) Ahead of its launch, we’ve compiled a list of useful information about <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pax-west-rage-room-gearbox-2000621767"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> to help quickly answer your questions ahead of its release. Does it support cross-save? When will it be playable? Do I need to beat the other games? All that and more is answered below!</p> <h2><strong>When does <em>Borderlands 4</em> launch?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><em>Borderlands 4</em> launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 12. Sort of. It depends on where you live and what platform you are planning to play the looter shooter on. Here’s the full breakdown courtesy of <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/global-launch-times/">2K Games and Gearbox</a>.</p> <blockquote><p><em><strong>Xbox and PlayStation launch times</strong></em></p></blockquote> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>Wellington, New Zealand – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM NZST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Sydney, Australia – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM AEST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Tokyo, Japan – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM JST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Singapore – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM SGT</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>London, UK – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM BST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>New York, NY, USA – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM ET</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>San Francisco, CA, USA – Sept 11 at 9:00 PM PT</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <p>Meanwhile, on Steam and Epic’s PC store, you’ll be able to play earlier than on consoles. Here are those dates and times:</p> <blockquote><p><strong><em>Steam &amp; Epic Store launch times</em></strong></p></blockquote> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>Wellington, New Zealand – Sept 12 at 4:00 AM NZST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Sydney, Australia – Sept 12 at 2:00 AM AEST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Tokyo, Japan – Sept 12 at 1:00 AM JST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Singapore – Sept 12 at 12:00 AM SGT</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>London, UK – Sept 11 at 5:00 PM BST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>New York, NY, USA – Sept 11 at 12:00 PM ET</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>San Francisco, CA, USA – Sept 11 at 9:00 AM PT</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <h2><strong>Wait, isn’t this coming out on Switch 2?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Yes!<em> Borderlands 4</em> is coming to Switch 2, but not until next month. Gearbox and 2K are bringing the looter shooter to Nintendo’s new console on October 3.</p>

 <blockquote><p><em><strong>Switch 2 launch times</strong></em></p></blockquote> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>Wellington, New Zealand – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM NZST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Sydney, Australia – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM AEST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Tokyo, Japan – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM JST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Singapore – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM SGT</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>London, UK – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM BST</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>New York, NY, USA – Oct 3 at 12:00 AM ET</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>San Francisco, CA, USA – Oct 2 at 9:00 PM PT</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <h2><strong>What versions of <em>Borderlands 4</em> are available to buy?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/buy/">The are three versions of <em>Borderlands 4</em> being sold by 2K</a>. The standard edition is $70 and comes with the game and…that’s it.</p> <p>Then there’s the Deluxe Edition, which costs $100 and comes with the Bounty Pack bundle and Firehawk’s Fury Weapon Skin bundle. (The Bounty Pack includes a few smaller narrative DLC missions that will be added post-launch via various updates.)</p> <p>Finally, the $130 Super Deluxe Edition comes with everything previously mentioned, and grants access to new upcoming expansions, two new Vault Hunters, and a new cosmetic bundle.</p>

 <p>Regardless of which version you buy, if you pre-order before <em>Borderlands 4</em> launches on your platform,<a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/global-launch-times/#:~:text=For%20a%20quick,Daedalus%20Assault%20Rifle"> you’ll <em>also</em> get a bonus “Gilded Glory” pack</a> that includes:</p> <ul> <li>1 Vault Hunter Head usable by all Vault Hunters</li> <li>1 Vault Hunter Skin usable by all Vault Hunters</li> <li>1 Weapon Skin</li> <li>1 ECHO-4 Drone Skin</li> <li>4 pieces of Legendary Gear:</li> <li>1 Lvl 1 Legendary Maliwan SMG</li> <li>1 Lvl 30 Legendary Ripper Grenade</li> <li>1 Lvl 30 Legendary Torgue Ordnance</li> <li>1 Max Lvl Legendary Daedalus Assault Rifle</li> </ul> <h2><strong>Does <em>Borderlands 4</em> support crossplay and cross-save?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Yes and no.<em> Borderlands 4</em> on all platforms will support crossplay at launch. So if you are on PC and your friend is on Xbox, you can play together easily, assuming you both have free Gearbox Shift accounts.</p> <p>Sadly, neither cross-save nor cross-progression will be available on day one. But, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/543366456574738739">Gearbox has confirmed in a Steam post</a> that it is looking to add the features later, letting players hop from one console to another and keep all their progress. Just don’t expect that on September 12.</p>

 <h2><strong>Is there a day-one patch?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Yes! Gearbox CEO and co-founder Randy Pitchford has confirmed that, like most big AAA video games these days, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1964424122861064640"><em>Borderlands 4</em> will have a day-one patch.</a> According to Pitchford, the update should help improve the game’s performance on PC, but did warn that <em>Borderlands 4</em> is a big open-world game that might not run well on older hardware even after the update.</p> <h2><strong>What are <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s recommended and minimum PC specs?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <div data-os="win"> <div> <p><strong>Minimum:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <ul> <li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li> <li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10 / Windows 11</li> <li><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</li> <li><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</li> <li><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT / Intel Arc A580</li> <li><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;100 GB available space</li> <li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong>&nbsp;Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system.

Meanwhile, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-will-run-mostly-30-fps/"><em>Borderlands 4</em> on Switch 2 seems to be targeting 30FPS,</a> which isn’t surprising.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Target 60fps.</p> <p>Also, F’ balance.

But you don’t have to. <em>Borderlands 4 </em>is set on a new planet, featuring new characters, and is a more self-contained story than the last few games. Sure, super fans will pick up on clues to the larger universe and past titles, but don’t feel like you need to play everything before starting up <em>Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2><strong>Should I watch the movie?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-review-rotten-tomatoes-cast-release-1851616912">lol. Don’t do that. Come on now. Be kind to yourself.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a teenager I raided my older brother’s CD collection. When he found me out, I was terrified he’d be angry, but instead he handed me a stack of records. He noticed I was checking out Nine Inch Nails, and told me I could have his albums. As a moody teenager, I couldn’t have received a better gift—a musical refuge from the stress of school and my burgeoning issues with depression. Watching the recent remaster of the movie <em>Linda Linda Linda</em> this weekend brought me back to that experience of my teenage years, when music could really save your life.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="LINDA LINDA LINDA 4K Restoration | Official Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YIIkWjdiF0U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Linda Linda Linda</em> is about four Japanese girls putting a band together to play at their school’s festival. After deciding to cover a bunch of songs by the legendary Japanese punk band The Blue Hearts, they select their vocalist at random. It turns out Son, played by the wonderful Bae Doona in an early role, is a Korean exchange student who barely speaks Japanese. That’s just the most visible piece of drama going on within the band: Kyoko, the drummer, has a crush on her classmate and isn’t courageous enough to tell him; bass player Nozomi, part of the real life band Base Ball Bear, keeps falling asleep in school because of their late night practice sessions; Kei has been fighting with her friend Rinko and they both refuse to make up with each other.</p><p>None of these conflicts are the main thrust of the film, which is mostly concerned with whether or not the girls will be ready to perform in three days. The scenes flow along lazily, like the last couple days of school before summer as we get brief glimpses into the lives of the band members. The one thing that aligns this group of misfits is the music they’re making together—especially for Son, who doesn’t have any other friends. As they sing “Linda Linda” by The Blue Hearts over and over, the lyrics from the intro of the song take on new meaning: “like a rat, I want to be beautiful, because there’s a kind of beauty that can’t be photographed.”</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://gkids.com/films/linda-linda-linda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GKids</a></figcaption></figure><p>Watching this movie made me feel an intense but pleasant nostalgia, emphasized by the guitar-based score for the movie, composed by The Smashing Pumpkins’ James Iha. It brought me back to a time when the most important thing in my life was whether or not my friends were mad at me, and sneaking into my brother’s room to steal his CDs. Music, and the friendships I’ve made through music, is all of that version of my life that remains.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Linda Linda Linda</em> opens with students from the high school making a documentary about their festival. “Don’t let anyone tell you that when you grow up, you stop being kids,” one of the students says into the camera. “We’ve only got a little more time to be the real us.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-silksong-launch-gta-vi-elden-ring"><h3>All-Consuming Event Releases Like Silksong Are Growing Fewer And Further Between</h3></a><p>"Silksong and then GTA VI coming up are the two big launches that almost feel like the end of the big launch"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-7-civ-vii-layoffs-firaxis-2k-take-two"><h3>Seven Months After Civ VII’s Launch, Firaxis Workers Are Being Laid Off</h3></a><p>2K said the layoffs were part of an effort to increase "adaptability, collaboration, and creativity" at Firaxis, whatever that means</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/play-for-peace-bundle-palestine-aid-fundraiser"><h3>10 Months In The Making, Play For Peace Bundle Launches To Raise Money for Palestinian Aid</h3></a><p>‘It was important that our charity's proceeds directly went to Palestinian relief efforts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/oxo-rapid-brewer-coffee-espresso-soup-shots"><h3>The OXO Rapid Brewer Is Great For Coffee And Better For ‘Soup’</h3></a><p>The OXO Brew Rapid Brewer is a fantastic portable coffee brewer.

                <p>Nintendo's star heroine wasn't always named Princess Peach, and for many years prior to the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-64/" data-ref-id="5000-2007">Super Mario 64</a> went by a different name: Princess Toadstool. Now, fans know the reason why, and it wasn't because of any decision Nintendo made.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>, Nintendo veteran Leslie Swan, who over the course of her nearly three-decade career helped localize countless Nintendo classics, wrote for Nintendo Power magazine, and even voiced Princess Peach in Super Mario 64, spilled the beans on the unlikely origin of the Toadstool moniker. She said in Nintendo's early days, there wasn't a lot of communication between the development teams in Japan and those working on marketing in the US.</p><p dir="ltr">"So on Super Mario Bros. they [Nintendo] had outsourced the production of the manual to an ad agency," Swan said. "And the ad agency just kind of created names for things. And so they're the ones who came up with Princess Toadstool as the name for Peach."</p><p dir="ltr">After the ad agency's decision, the name stuck for the next decade. Swan said when localizing Super Mario 64 for North America alongside Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, Miyamoto was fond of the "Peach" name and wanted it included.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4563743-mario64princesspeachletter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4563743" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4563743-mario64princesspeachletter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4563743"></a><figcaption>Princess Peach's letter to Mario in Super Mario 64.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4563743-mario64princesspeachletter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Swan suggested combining the two names together for the US release. Peach could be Princess Toadstool's more "informal" name, Swan said. It's for that reason Peach's letter to Mario at the beginning of Super Mario 64 is signed Princess Toadstool, with "Peach" handwritten in pink.</p><p dir="ltr">The full interview includes tons more details about Swan's career and is well worth a read. Meanwhile, Princess Peach has come into her own in recent years, stepping out of Mario's shadow. Far from a damsel in distress, she proved to be a major force in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-bros-movie-was-the-most-profitable-film-of-2023/1100-6523224/" data-ref-id="1100-6523224">Super Mario. Bros movie</a> and even received her own game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/princess-peach-showtime/" data-ref-id="5000-591679">Princess Peach: Showtime</a>, in 2024, the first game to star her as the main protagonist since 2006's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-princess-peach/" data-ref-id="5000-22936">Super Princess Peach</a> for Nintendo DS.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Peach is making a name for herself, her relationship with Mario is more complicated than ever, with Nintendo recently going out of its way to remind fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-really-wants-you-to-know-mario-and-peach-are-just-good-friends/1100-6533462/" data-ref-id="1100-6533462">Mario and Princess Peach are just "good friends."</a></p>

Publisher indie.io has stated that Moon Mystery will be available from September 18th on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, with the game being priced at $19.99. It is available to pre-order on the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/moon-mystery/9pjlncrlb5md?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9RGF96TX3QgOR86Ssu2NQTh5sMunwkVmpezqfDQkN6WAjniHFgH3Jtml8MLlhgFyPf3aEYuzAL-j0zIsBXz7873fcr2w&amp;_hsmi=379566986&amp;utm_content=379566986&amp;utm_source=hs_email">Microsoft store now</a>, and available to wishlist on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10015507">PlayStation Store</a>.</p>

<p>In Moon Mystery you play as Sam, an astrobiologist who is alone on the Moon aside from AI assistant TOBY. Sam becomes stranded on the Moon after all contact with Earth is lost, prompting him to find out the cause of the issue. It soon turns out that Sam is not alone on the lunar surface, so needs to run, gun, explore, and use his head to solve puzzles to get out of this predicament. The Moon is not the only location that Sam will end up exploring, as he travels to alien planets and an orbital city.</p>
<p>We did not review Moon Mystery, but the game is currently sitting on mixed reviews on Steam, though recent user reviews are a bit more positive.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-is-fine-but-digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-is-one-1839230688"><em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em></a> was sneakily one of the best RPGs of 2016. Almost a decade later, its long-awaited successor is mounting another lowkey coup in a genre that’s only gotten more competitive in the years since. <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> plays like a very traditional turn-based role-playing game in all of my favorite ways while bringing multiple generational leaps’ worth of technical upgrades to a spin-off series whose last entries were built for PS Vita. It feels like the <em>Persona</em>-style glow-up many <em>Pokémon</em> fans have been waiting for.</p> <p>At PAX West last week I had the chance to play over 90 minutes of <em>Digimon Story: Time</em> <em>Stranger</em>, which comes to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 3, and the latest Bandai Namco-published creature fighter from veteran RPG maker Media Vision did not disappoint. Things already seemed good coming out of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677">Summer Game Fest demo</a> earlier this summer and a deeper dive only firmed up the sense that the game, first announced eight years ago, can meet the increasing expectations surrounding <em>Digimon Story</em>‘s return.</p> <p>The latest session let me play the start of the game before later shifting to a much more advanced segment over a dozen hours into the adventure. You play as a secret agent working for the ADAMAS organization investigating ominous anomalies in Tokyo that seem to be linked to social upheaval. The <em>Digimon Story</em> games have always had an emphasis on compelling conversations and background intrigue, which <em>Cyber Sleuth</em> took to the next level with a narrative that felt like more than just a means to an end of raising virtual pets.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000624121" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624121"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624121">Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>What I played of <em>Time Stranger</em> continues that with English voice acting and more polished cinematic animations, coupled with an unusually stellar soundtrack. Are there extremely goofy moments too? Absolutely. I’ve already witnessed half a dozen snippets that I can’t wait to send to folks in the group chat who have not interacted with <em>Digimon</em> since it debuted in the West on Fox Kids back in 1999. Watching familiar RPG tropes reenacted by absurd-looking creatures that speak like humans is an acquired taste, but <em>Time Stranger</em> does an admirable job.</p> <p>Eerie anime vibes established, my early tutorial section eventually transitioned to a later stretch set in the Digimon world’s colorful seaside Abyss Area which felt oddly reminiscent of<em> Chrono Cross</em>‘ tropical archipelago. Here, <em>Time Stranger</em>‘s bread and butter took center stage: fighting, collecting, and growing your Digimon. There’s the combat triangle between Data, Virus, and Vaccine type Digimon, elemental weaknesses, and a swapping system that lets you use different Digimon on the fly if your current team doesn’t have the right build.</p>

 <p>Building meter during battle also lets you unleash an ultimate attack to deal extra damage or buff your team. It’s a nimble set of mechanics that helps turn-based battles shine, forcing you to think about what you’re doing and adapt on the fly without getting bogged down in too much minutiae. It’s definitely old-school but more satisfying than just mashing the same set of attacks over and over again. If things do start to get repetitive, a fast-forward button helps bypass the boring bits. Defeat a Digimon enough times and you get a 100 percent scan rate to create your own, or you can wait for a 200 percent scan rate to get an even stronger version of it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000624122" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624122"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624122">Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>Outside of combat, the main focus remains on Digivolving and De-Digivolving your pals. The first makes them more powerful while the second makes them weaker again in the short term to raise their long-term potential. Aiding this convoluted process is the DigiFarm system which lets you tweak the new personalities of your Digimon to change which stats grow the fastest. Certain personalities are also required to Digivolve or De-Digivolve specific Digimon along with player rank and relationship status. Consumable items and training sessions let you speed up this process too.</p>

 <p>There’s also an entire character skill tree full of perks that provide extra bonuses to your team depending on a Digimon’s specific relationship with you and their personality type, though I didn’t get to see how these systems feel over the long haul. Do they feel balanced? Do they get tedious? Is it too streamlined or too convoluted? But I certainly came away with the impression that <em>Time Stranger</em> has a great foundation to work with.</p> <p>Will it hold up over a 40-50 hour adventure? Is it well paced? Does the story end up going somewhere cool even if you’re not a dyed-in-the-wool <em>Digimon</em> sicko? Only the full, finished game can answer those questions. So far, however, the successor to <em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em> continues to look like it’s making smart choices and pushing the series forward. It could easily be overshadowed next month by <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> but it doesn’t deserve to be. <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> should be on every RPG fan’s radar, whether they’ve been keeping up with the franchise or not.</p>

"So that journey for B.J., even during those first few weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for, at least, that character.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silksong%E2%80%99s-most-popular-mods-are-all-about-making-the-game-easier.1291866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em></a>is out. Did you know that? You probably pieced that together. After seven years of waiting, Team Cherry’s long-awaited 2D action-platformer is here and kicking people’s asses. But on PC, thousands of players are using mods to help them overcome the challenging game.</p> <p><em>Silksong</em> released late last week on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC after nearly a decade of waiting. And first reactions to the sequel are almost entirely positive, with fans loving the small tweaks to the<em> Hollow Knight</em> formula and the larger size of its world. Plus, that $20 price tag is nice in an era when everything is more expensive than ever. And <em>Silksong</em>, like <em>Hollow Knight</em>, isn’t the easiest game in the world. Many players are even claiming that <em>Silksong</em> is harder than the OG. <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031">This has led to a lot of discourse on the internet about how hard it is or isn’t, and about game difficulty in general</a>. But if you’re playing on PC, there’s a solution: Just mod <em>Silksong</em> and make it easier.</p> <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/hollowknightsilksong?modSort=popular">If we hop over to <em>Silksong’s</em> mods hub over at <em>NexusMods</em></a>, a popular PC modding site, you can see there are already 60+ mods available for the recently released platformer. And many of the most popular mods available for the game make it much easier to play. The most popular mods for <em>Silksong</em> include one that adds health meters to enemies, another one that stops enemies from doing double damage to the player, and one that shows the player’s position on the map at all times. All of these mods have over 15,000 downloads. An automapping mod has 9,000 downloads. Another free PC mod that increases how much damage players deal to enemies has over 7,000 downloads.</p>

 <p>In fact, the only mod more popular than all of these mods that make <em>Silksong</em> easier is the mod needed to run any of these other creations. That mod, “BepInEx 5 with Configuration Manager,” has over 28,000 downloads as of September 8. That’s a lot of downloads for a game that’s barely been out a week. Of course, not all the mods for <em>Silksong</em> are about making it easier. But those mods, like one that adds ultrawide support and a death counter, only have a few hundred downloads or fewer.</p> <p>It seems that the people coming to <em>NexusMods</em> for <em>Silksong</em> mods mostly have one goal in mind: Make the game less challenging. I expect reactions to this will vary a lot, but personally, I land on the side of “If folks want to make a game easier or harder with mods, and it doesn’t ruin it for other people, then whatever.” But I’ve been on the web long enough to know that ain’t a universal take.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-54-lost-clickwheel-ipod-games-have-now-been-preserved-for-posterity.1291860/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Last year, we reported on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/ipod-fans-evade-apples-drm-to-preserve-54-lost-clickwheel-era-games/">the efforts of classic iPod fans to preserve playable copies of the downloadable clickwheel games</a> that Apple sold for a brief period in the late '00s. The community was working to get around <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/728B5C4B-0A35-40BE-A2E7-E5464C68B80A.html">Apple's onerous FairPlay DRM</a> by having people who still owned original copies of those (now unavailable) games sync their accounts to a single iTunes installation <a href="https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject/tree/main">via a coordinated Virtual Machine</a>. That "master library" would then be able to provide playable copies of those games to any number of iPods in perpetuity.</p>
<p>At the time, the community was still searching for iPod owners with syncable copies of the last few titles needed for their library. With <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1nb9kvx/comment/nd2dozi/">today's addition of <em>Real Soccer 2009</em></a> to the project, though, all 54 official iPod clickwheel games are now available together in an easily accessible format for what is likely the first time.</p>
<h2>All at once, then slowly</h2>
<p>GitHub user Olsro, the originator of <a href="https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject/tree/main">the iPod Clickwheel Games Preservation Project</a>, tells Ars that he lucked into contact with three people who had large iPod game libraries in the first month or so after the project's launch last October. That includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thatnostalgicnerd">one YouTuber</a> who had purchased and maintained copies of 39 distinct games, even repurchasing some of the upgraded versions Apple sold separately for later iPod models.</p>
<p>Ars' <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/ipod-fans-evade-apples-drm-to-preserve-54-lost-clickwheel-era-games/">story on the project</a> shook out a few more iPod owners with syncable iPod game libraries, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1giaocx/release_3_ipod_clickwheel_games_lode_runner_star/">subsequent</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1gk4imk/release_5_new_ipod_clickwheel_games_bubble_bash/">updates</a> in the following days left just a handful of titles unpreserved. But that's when the project stalled, Olsro said, with months wasted on false leads and technical issues that hampered the effort to get a complete library.</p>
<p>"I've put a lot of time into coaching people that [had problems] transferring the files and authorizing the account once with me on the [Virtual Machine]," Olsro told Ars. "But I kept motivation to continue coaching anyone else coming to me (by mail/Discord) and making regular posts to increase awareness until I could find finally someone that could, this time, go with me through all the steps of the preservation process," he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1nb9kvx/comment/nd2dozi">added on Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>Getting working access to the final unpreserved game, <em>Real Soccer 2009</em>, was "especially cursed," Olsro tells Ars. "Multiple [people] came to me during this summer and all attempts failed until a new one from yesterday," he said. "I even had a situation when someone had an iPod Nano 5G with a playable copy of <em>Real Soccer</em>, but the drive was appearing empty in the Windows Explorer. He tried recovery tools &amp; the iPod NAND just corrupted itself, asking for recovery..."</p>

                <p>Former Bethesda executive Pete Hines has opened up on some of the predictions people made about Bethesda games over the years, and why he stuck to his guns when others doubted him.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dbltap</a>, Hines said people questioned if The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind would even work as an Xbox exclusive, or if The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim could find success with its release date--November 11, 2011--being so close to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (November 8, 2011).</p><p>"'Oh, Skyrim can't survive going up against Call of Duty. Same window. Everybody's gonna play Call of Duty. Nobody's gonna buy your game,'" Hines recalls hearing.</p><p>For his part, Hines said he understands Call of Duty is a huge brand, but he believed Bethesda had a "better game" with Skyrim and wasn't afraid to spend marketing dollars on it.</p><p>"I will go up against those guys. I will spend [marketing money] against those guys. I will never spend anywhere near as much and I can still win," he recalled.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-games-of-each-of-the-past-25-years-in-the-us/2900-5031/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5031">Both games succeeded in 2011</a>, with Modern Warfare 3 finishing as the No. 1 best-selling game and Skyrim coming in second for the year in the US. Skyrim has gone on to sell more than 60 million copies, making it one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">best-selling games of all time</a>. A final sales number for Modern Warfare 3 is unknown, although Skyrim did benefit from numerous ports to other platforms over the years. </p><p>Another line Hines heard was that Bethesda should avoid releasing The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the spring (it launched in March 2006) because "nobody releases games in the spring." But in the end, Hines said, "We did just fine." The game is still enjoying success to this day, thanks to the 2025 remaster, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6281">2025's No. 2 best-selling game in the US.</a></p><p>Challenging preconceived notions and finding success was "what made it so fun," Hines said about his time at Bethesda. "I think we were better at it than anybody else in terms of what we were able to do, when you look at the awards we won, the players we brought in, and how we went about doing it right. I wanted to be a part of a company where if anybody peeks into a window to see how we're doing this, I feel okay about it," he said.</p><p>Hines left Bethesda after Microsoft acquired its parent company, ZeniMax.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prey-2-human-head-studios-gameplay-footage-leak/">gameplay and concept footage</a> of what would've been the sequel to Human Head Studios' 2006 game Prey leaked online, published on YouTube across multiple videos from a channel listed under '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidhalsted2611">David Halsted</a>.' Today, that same channel no longer has any of the Prey 2 videos it previously had publicly listed, and instead, more gameplay footage appeared on an old <a href="https://forums.duke4.net/topic/12181-leaked-prey-1995/page__pid__385337#entry385337">Duke4 thread</a>, spotted by New Blood Interactive's <a href="https://x.com/DaveOshry/status/1964840297889997048">Dave Oshry</a>.</p>



<p>The original post includes an Imgur link, though following it at the time of this writing is fruitless, sense the page no longer appears. Oshry, however, compiled the footage and put it together in a nearly five-minute-long video that shows a very solid-looking slice of what Human Head Studios was cooking up with Prey 2.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The footage shows that Human Head Studios was building something that, if it had made it to release, would've been compared to CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077, since it appears to be well ahead of its time with the kind of sci-fi world and setting it would have featured.</p>



<p>Interestingly, this is actually the third time in the last week that Human Head Studios' Prey has come up. In a <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines">recent interview</a> with former Bethesda executive Pete Hines, besides Hines taking the time to comment <a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-arent-rewarding-content-makers/">on subscription services and Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass</a>, he also talked about the struggle he faced when it came time to decide what Arkane Austin would work on next, and how he lost in the battle for its name. </p>



<p>"<em>Don't even get me started on that</em>," Hines said in regard to Arkane Austin naming its 2017 game Prey. "<em>I definitely pissed some people off internally over that because I fought so hard against using that name. I'm the head of the spear, but I had a lot of people across my team – brand, PR and community – and we feel like we're burdening it with a name where we spend more time explaining why it's called Prey than we do talking about the game. I regret that I lost that battle. But nobody on this planet could have put more of a good faith effort into changing minds on that. My whole point was, look how much time we spend talking about what the game is versus why it's called this and like, that is wasted energy. That is wasted excitement. We could be turning that into something positive.</em>"</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see if more Prey 2 footage is published, or if an unreleased build of what Human Head Studios had appears online. For now, we can only watch and wonder at what might've been if Human Head's story had gone differently.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Best Buy is liquidating its warehouse with a big clearance sale on an oddball assortment of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842">Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch physical games</a>. However, to find deals worth potentially grabbing, you’ll have to dig through some gunk and a lot of sports games from a year ago to find some good games worth adding to your collection.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1964929126176866311">As spotted by the internet’s favorite deals guru, Wario64,</a> Best Buy is currently holding <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?browsedCategory=pcmcat1487698928729&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;loc=1719813&amp;qp=currentoffers_facet%3DCurrent+Deals%7EClearance%5Esoldout_facet%3DAvailability%7EExclude+Out+of+Stock+Items&amp;ref=388&amp;sp=Price-Low-To-High&amp;st=categoryid%24pcmcat1487698928729">a large video game clearance sale online and in stores</a> around the country. Is this more evidence that Best Buy, like other retailers, <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-buy-dvd-blu-ray-games-sales-stop-2024-1851136668">is looking to exit the physical video game space</a> and just fill stores up with more cellphones, old Funko Pops, and fridges? Perhaps, but regardless of why these games are on sale, they are cheaper than normal, and you get a physical copy, too. You can add these to your library or even pass down a copy of <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> or <em>Diablo IV</em> to your grandkids.</p> <p>Anyway, we dug through the junk to find some of the best games and biggest deals currently available via the Best Buy clearance sale. Keep in mind these might sell out at any time so this list might be out of date by the time you see it. Also, many games are only on sale on a specific platform, which we have listed below next to the usual price and the new sale price.</p> <ul> <li><em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> – Xbox – $8 ($15)</li> <li><em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands Next Level Edition</em> – Xbox – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Redfall</em> – Xbox – $10 ($70)</li> <li><em>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em> – Xbox – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Midnight Suns Enhanced Edition</em> – Xbox – $12 ($20)</li> <li><em>Deathloop</em> – PS5 – $13 ($60)</li> <li><em>Sponge SquarePants A Patrick Star Game</em> – $16 ($20)</li> <li><em>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged</em> – Xbox – $18 ($30)</li> <li><em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> – PS4 – $18 ($30)</li> <li><em>Diablo IV</em> – PS5 – $25 ($70)</li> <li><em>Core Keeper</em> – PS4 – $18 ($30)</li> <li><em>The Smurfs Village Party</em> – PS5 – $21 ($40)</li> <li><em>Super Bomberman R 2</em> – PS5 – $24 ($30)</li> <li><em>Samba de Amigo: Party Central</em> – Switch – $24 ($40)</li> <li><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> – Xbox – $26 ($50)</li> <li><em>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII: Reunion</em> – Xbox – $30 ($50)</li> <li><em>NFS Unbound</em> – Xbox – $30 ($50)</li> <li><em>Neon White</em> – PS5 – $32 ($40)</li> <li><em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</em> – Xbox – $31 ($70)</li> </ul> <p>And yeah, <em>Redfall</em> wasn’t a great game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-redfall-offline-update-4-arkane-austin-1851484821">but it got an offline mode not that long ago</a> and is easily worth $10 if you are hankering for a vampire-themed RPG shooter this Halloween season.</p>

Currently, Walmart is offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aXWXoe?object_uuid=952f1dff-2955-42a5-9033-a6b48e9f457b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Acer Nitro 60</a> gaming PC, featuring an Intel Core i7 CPU and GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU, for just $1,799.99 with free delivery.

The Intel Core i7-14700 CPU has a max turbo frequency of 5.4GHz with 20 cores, 28 threads, and a 28MB L2 cache. Although one generation old, the i7-14700 is still an excellent relevant CPU for both gaming and producitivity use.

It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. Like all Blackwell cards, the RTX 5070 Ti supports <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dlss-4-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-nvidias-latest-ai-upscaling-tech">DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation</a>.  This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution. If you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti may be a better value since it has the same amount of VRAM as the RTX 5080.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

                <p>Battlefield 2042’s recently released “Road to Battlefield 6” battle pass has proven to be a popular addition. Given it offers multiple cosmetic items for the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>, a boost in active players makes sense. And with a more active community now playing the game, EA has announced that a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1965067993185972329" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">small hotfix update</a> is coming tomorrow, September 9.</p><p>The main issue seemed to be based on progression. Some of the weekly missions involving the M1 Garand, for instance, weren’t tracking correctly in All Out Warfare. Some players also felt that the grind to unlock the free cosmetics was a bit much. This has led to a Tier Skip function--a feature that, depending on who you’re talking to, presents its own set of issues--allowing players to pay to advance through the ranks. The hotfix also addresses some weapon/gadget balancing, fixed a Playercard issue, and updated the Team Deathmatch playlist.</p>

      </div>
<p>The “Road to Battlefield 6” battle pass lasts until October 7. Fans still have time to work their way through the pass ahead of the game’s October 10 launch; tomorrow’s patch should make hitting Tier 60 that much easier.</p><h2>Battlefield 2042 September 9 update patch notes</h2><h3>Weapons &amp; Gadgets</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue on the Lynx where extended magazine reload was slower than intended. The reload animation is now faster, making it look less like slow motion and more like just motion.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the Lynx’s recoil and camera motion.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the accuracy is lower than intended when standing still for the Lynx.</li><li>Balance pass with SWS-10 and Armor Piercing Rounds and the Masterkey.</li><li>Fixed an issue where multiple Underbarrel Shotgun Attachments on Vault Weapons were not tracking progress towards quests that require you to get kills with underbarrel shotguns. For example, the unlock quest for the AK5C.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the SOFLAM and Tracer Dart interaction with a vehicle would not show “Target Acquired” messaging.</li></ul><h3>Maps &amp; Modes</h3><ul><li>Renewal has been returned to the Team Deathmatch playlist offering.</li></ul><h3>Playercards</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the names of Playercard Backgrounds ‘Always Check Your Rear’ and ‘Teamwork Makes the Dream Work’ were accidentally swapped.</li></ul><h3>Weekly Missions &amp; Progression</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where some weekly missions about doing actions with Vault Weapons would not track with the M1 Garand in All Out Warfare.</li><li>Tier Skip functionality is now active on the Road to Battlefield 6 Pass.</li></ul><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
