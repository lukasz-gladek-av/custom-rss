            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Red Square Games and Asmodee have announced&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium Digital</em>, and it is, as you've probably already guessed, a Steam version of the popular (if extremely weighty) tabletop game.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/RedSquare_Games/status/1967984321970540682" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a> on social media, Red Square says the digital version of&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium&nbsp;</em>has been made "with love by fans at Red Square Games and Asmodee", and that the game is for both "the old guard" and "the new heirs".</p>

<p>The game's Steam page describes it as an adaptation of what the two studios call a "legendary board game of galactic conquest" which has been "reimagined for digital play", so there should be a few concessions to make it a little more streamlined on Steam (steamlined?).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/twilight-imperium-digital-board.jpg?itok=FWy1wyn4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/twilight-imperium-digital-board.jpg?itok=K9xAsUQn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>adapts the legendary strategy game for Steam "soon".</figcaption></figure><p>If you're familiar with&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium</em>, you'll probably know how this one's going to play out. Expect a vast game of diplomacy, combat, and exploration in which you'll need to decide whether to trade peacefully with your other players or dominate them with military might.</p>

<p><em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>will offer 17 unique factions, each of which boasts "asymmetric powers and playstyles", and it also promises "massive replayability" thanks to its randomized galaxies and objectives.</p>

<p>If you can't convince anybody else to play this one with you, there's a solo mode in which you can take on a computer opponent, but naturally,&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>will thrive best in multiplayer. The game also supports hotseat and asynchronous play so you can enjoy it "at your own pace".</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Twilight Imperium Digital</em>, which should give you a decent sense of how the game will play out in comparison to the tabletop experience, right here.</p>




<p><em>Twilight Imperium Digital&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3669430/Twilight_Imperium_Digital/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam right here</a>. Hey, who knows? Maybe this will lead to a digital version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/twilight-imperium-spinoff-twilight-inscription-announced" rel="nofollow">spinoff&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/twilight-imperium-spinoff-twilight-inscription-announced" rel="nofollow">Twilight Inscription</a>&nbsp;</em>somewhere down the line.</p>

Sony started beta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712212/sony-ps5-power-saver-handheld-rumors">testing these features in July</a>, but they’re now rolling out to everyone today in the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/">version 25.06-12.00.00</a> console software update.</p><p>The new Power Saver mode will reduce the power consumption of PS5 consoles in exchange for scaling back game performance, according to Sony’s PS5 update notes, which could come in handy for the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">rumored PlayStation handheld</a>. Power Saving mode can be toggled on or off for supported games by heading into Settings &gt; System &gt; Power Saving &gt; Use Power Saver. When enabled, an icon will appear next to the supported game in Switcher or the control center, according to Sony.</p><p>The software for DualSense and DualSense Edge wireless controllers has also been updated to make it easier to switch them across connected devices. Controllers can now be paired with up to four devices simultaneously, preventing users from having to go through the cumbersome process of manually reconnecting the controller when switching between consoles, PCs, and cloud streaming devices.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/779837/sony-playstation-5-ps5-update-power-saving-mode#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/779837/sony-playstation-5-ps5-update-power-saving-mode]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Yaaarrr. There be a fresh report about the long-rumoured <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> remake Ubisoft have still yet to publicly acknowledge. It claims the publisher are currently looking to release the retooled piracy game in early 2026, as well as providing more alleged details as to how the remake'll differ from the original.</p>
<p>This Black Flag remake's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">reported to be in development</a> several times over the past couple of years, with the voice actor of original protagonist Edward Kenway <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-claims-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-over-remake-tease">alleging that he got in trouble</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships">being recorded teasing it at a convention</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>Enter this video report from French publication Jeux Vidéo Magazine. They cite sources as having told them that Ubisoft are currently aiming to release the remake early next year, with March being the month it's most likely to make port. That said, Jeux Vidéo Magazine also cite some sources as having cast doubt over that and indicated it could be pushed towards the end of 2026, due to there allegedly being a lot of work left to do at this point.</p><p>The report also details a number of tweaks that developers Ubisoft Singapore, along with support studios Ubisoft Bordeaux and Ubisoft Belgrade are supposedly making to the original, mostly to bring Black Flag in line with the series' more recent entries. Parts of the present-day sections that saw you coming out of the Animus and wandering around the office of Abstergo Entertainment are reportedly being swapped out for more adventures set in the past, with cut content involving pirate Mary Read making up part of that.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be too big a surprise, given the series has moved away from hefty present day elements of late, having adjusted to life without early protagonist Desmond Mason spearheading the non-past assassin/templar bickering. This year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features very little to take you out of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review">murdering your way through feudal Japan</a>, unless you're prepared to muck about in the Animus Hub menus or spend too long staring at a warning about fragmented memories.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jeux Vidéo Magazine report that the inventory and combat systems have been overhauled in a more RPG-style fashion that'll bring them closer to the likes of Shadows and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Valhalla</a>. Tech-wise, we can apparently expect improvements like load-screenless sailing, smaller islands being less barren, and the use of Shadows' engine making things look a bit less dated.</p>
<p>We reached out to Ubisoft for comment, and the publishers responded that they "haven’t got anything to share" right now.</p>
<p>My feelings are a bit mixed at the moment as to whether this Black Flag remaster'll have much to offer over just firing up the original again for some very good piracy and assassining that's also there. Then again, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, a revamp which left me quite on the fence about its deliberately minimal tweakage outside of the obvious facelift, proved plenty popular earlier this year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple Seems to Be Clearing Out the 2025 M4 MacBook Air at an All-Time Low Before Amazon Prime Big Deal Days]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-seems-to-be-clearing-out-the-2025-m4-macbook-air-at-an-all-time-low-before-amazon-prime-big-deal-days.1300254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Greater minds than ours have been driven crazy trying to predict what’s coming out of Cupertino, and when it’s coming. Now that Apple’s gotten the iPhone 17 and new AirPods drops out of the way, will there be new MacBooks on the horizon? One set of tea leaves to keep an eye on is the deals they’re offering on their current models, and right now seemingly out of nowhere, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">the 13-inch 2025 M4 MacBook Air is just $800 at Amazon — its lowest price ever.</a></p>
<p>Does that mean there’s a new MacBook Air right around the corner? Who knows — early 2026 is a better bet. But this $800 deal on the current flagship of the MacBook Air fleet is very real, and we can’t imagine it going much lower if at all when the 2025 holiday rush starts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 For the Win</h2>
<p>One day there will be an M5 chip driving a new line of MacBooks, but until then, you cannot beat the M4 for speed and sheer processing power. This M4 MacBook Air runs twice as fast as the M1 models that were all the rage more recently than we realize, and a staggering 23 times faster than the last Intel powered models of the MacBook Air.</p>
<p>Of course, the one consistent calling card of any MacBook is the display, and this MacBook Air’s 13.6-inch Liquid Retina screen supports a billion colors, all delivered with brilliance and sharpness. Pair that screen with the 12MP Center Stage camera, three microphones, and four Spatial Audio speakers built into the MacBook Air, and your video calls will always be peak. The M4 processor, Spatial Audio speakers, and Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 connections make the 2025 MacBook Air a streaming and gaming superstar.</p>



<h2>Apple-Style AI</h2>
<p>The 2025 M4 MacBook Air comes with Apple Intelligence built in, with incredible speed and ability as an assistant for research, productivity, or pretty much anything else you want it to do for you. All those searches are yours and yours alone too, because Apple Intelligence has some of the best and most robust privacy features of any AI system — so private that even Apple can’t get to your search history.</p>
<p>Trying to read the smoke signals from Apple about how and when to jump on&nbsp;<em>the</em> best deal is, honestly, often a waste of time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">What we can tell you is that this $800 deal on the 13-inch 2025 M4 MacBook Air is the lowest price ever for this laptop at Amazon</a>, and that the M4 MacBook Air is worth every penny of the price regardless of when the next-gen MacBooks drop.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">During last week's Nintendo Direct, Square Enix surprised Dragon Quest fans with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-7-remake-announced-after-months-of-speculation/1100-6534696/">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>, a remake of the classic PlayStation RPG from the year 2000. It seems Square Enix was not done with the surprise Dragon Quest reveals, as today the company announced Dragon Quest Smash/Grow, a roguelite RPG for mobile devices that will enter a closed beta test next month.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest Smash/Grow tasks players with fighting hordes of enemies at once, "smashing" through their ranks in order to "grow" their characters with experience and loot. Once powerful enough, players can then unleash powerful Coup de Grace attacks in order to finish the enemy armies off.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3mPefOfho" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6U3mPefOfho" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The roguelite mechanic in Dragon Quest Smash/Grow is called Blessings, which are chosen from randomly generated options throughout the course of a run. Each run will depend on the Blessings made available to a player throughout the adventure; as is typical with roguelite games, no two runs will feel exactly alike.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest Smash/Grow will be available for both iOS and Android devices. A closed beta test for Dragon Quest Smash/Grow has been announced for October 14-21. Players can pre-regiser for the beta test on iOS using TestFlight, Android via the Google Play Store, and at the <a href="https://smashgrow.dragonquest.com/en/cbt" rel="nofollow ">game's official website</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Square Enix has been busy with reveals over the past few months across many of its RPG franchises. Along with Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and Smash/Grow, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade was confirmed for a January 22 release on Nintendo Switch 2, while Octopath Traveler 0 and The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales were both announced over the summer.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>If you've played any PC or console games over the last 12 months, there's a good chance that at least one of them was a remake or a remaster. That's according to new research, which found that not only have these games been popular with the people they polled for this research, they've also been "desirable" diversions.</p><p>Specialist strategy and insights consultancy firm MTM (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/90-of-gamers-have-played-a-remake-or-remaster-finds-new-report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesIndustry.Biz</a>) polled 1,500 people--750 people each in the US and the UK--who play games regularly. "Our report shows that there is a strong appeal for remakes and remasters, but it's a tight balancing act for studios to get right," said Martin Bradley, head of gaming at MTM. "Many of these games are far out-selling their original release."</p>

<p>MTM also revealed that 85% of the people who played a remaster or remake in the last year had not even played the original version of the game, so this wasn't entirely a case of nostalgia guiding their choices. That being said, MTM added that nostalgia is still a powerful influence, even when gamers understand that they might be missing out on fresher and novel gameplay experiences by choosing reimagined games over newer titles.</p><p>It hasn't been difficult to find a remastered game either, as publishers have focused their efforts on reviving classic games in addition to new projects. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/">one of the best-selling games of the year so far</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, and the House of the Dead 2: Remake were all released this year, and looking ahead, remakes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-4-remake-sounds-like-its-still-a-long-ways-away/1100-6532621/">Persona 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-indefinitely/1100-6487180/">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-celebrates-splinter-cell-20th-anniversary-shares-remake-concept-art/1100-6509255/">Splinter Cell</a> are also on the way.</p><p>Nintendo has also been keenly aware of the value of its older games for years now, and while it has produced several remakes and remasters, it's even going a step further this year by remaking its flop Virtual Boy console--sort of.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pass-is-adding-nintendos-biggest-flop-virtual-boy/1100-6534695/">Virtual Boy functionality is coming</a> February 17, 2026, to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass, and to play these games, you'll need a new accessory modeled after the original console that you can slot your Switch or Switch 2 device into.</p>

            <p>
Four more games will be leaving PS Plus next month, as part of the subscription service's latest catalogue refresh.
</p>
<p>
From 21st October, the following games will no longer be available to subscribers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Battlefield 1 (PS4)</li>
<li>Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Tour de France 2023 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>The Last Clockwinder (PSVR2)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The loss of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a> will mostly be redeemed by the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> on 10th October. Today, we reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-players-on-ps5-and-xbox-can-block-pc-users-from-crossplay-as-studio-takes-cheating-extremely-seriously">console only cross-play has been confirmed</a>. Battlefield 1 is also getting on for nine years old, and if you really want to play it can be bought cheaply.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed">Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed</a>, an asymmetrical multiplayer game that essentially simulates what it would be like to be a Ghostbuster, didn't review that well on release but has gone on to carry plenty of positive sentiment amongst players.</p>
<p>
However, the loss of a PSVR2 game in The Last Clockwinder is another small blow for Sony's ailing VR device.

<p>Cuts quite the figure</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/curse_of_the_dead_gods">Curse of the Dead Gods</a> is an excellent roguelike in the now-classical <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hades">Hades</a> vein, one that earned itself a lovely 8/10 from us back when it released, and Passtech Games' follow-up to that cracker, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ravenswatch">Ravenswatch</a>, is also quite the banger itself, sitting pretty as it currently is on a very nice score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ravenswatch/">84 on Metacritic</a>.</p>
<p>Think Hades but with heroes, villains and settings plucked from twisted versions of the fairytales of your youth, and you're pretty much there. It's a goodie from a team with a good track record, in short, and today it's getting a free update called Hourglass of Dreams.</p>
<p>Here are some quick details from the press blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In</em> <em>Ravenswatch</em><em>, there is a constant intangible threat: time management. Defenders of the world of Reverie have 3 days and 3 nights (18 minutes) per level before the Master Nightmare awakens. The Hourglass of Dreams update has a significant impact on each run, as it allows players to earn additional rewards by completing a level ahead of schedule. The faster the heroes challenge and defeat the Master Nightmare, the greater the rewards.</em></p>
<p><em>Conversely, they can now decide to take their time to explore the level further and try to strengthen themselves as much as possible, up to 3 minutes after the Master Nightmare awakens. But this additional time comes at a heavy price: depending on its duration, the boss becomes increasingly formidable, with exponentially increased damage and health points!"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The free update also includes character rebalances, more environments, new side activities and quests, with something called the Leprechaun's Cauldron, a Jack and the Beanstalk challenge and more besides!<em><br></em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 6 Games Are More Likely to Be Held Back by Their PC Ports Than the Handheld]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-held-back-pc-ports/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-games-are-more-likely-to-be-held-back-by-their-pc-ports-than-the-handheld.1300203/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The now-inevitable PC ports, not the rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-handheld-specks-leaked-outperform-xbox-ally-x/">PlayStation handheld</a>, will likely be why <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-6/">PlayStation 6</a> games may not push the system to its absolute limits.</p>



<p>During a new episode of the Moore's Law is Dead <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO7jZFz97Tg">Broken Silicon podcast</a>, Massive Damage's Bryan Heemskerk commented on the rumored next-gen systems by Sony, making some interesting observations on how the handheld system is unlikely to hold back the home console. First, the developer highlighted how we are in a post-resolution era where a game such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-surpassing-xbox-series-s/">Street Fighter 6 looks better on Nintendo Switch 2 than on Xbox Series S</a>, thanks to NVIDIA DLSS, even though it runs at a lower resolution on the Nintendo system. By focusing on resolution targets, rather than scaling down visual settings, which most devs apparently find more impactful, scaling down games from their home console version to their handheld version shouldn't be a huge hurdle, especially if the leaked specs are correct and using upscaling tech like PSSR and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/amd-fsr-4/">AMD FSR 4</a>, which is getting better and better rather quickly.</p>



<p>Even if the differences between the home PlayStation 6 and the handheld system end up being bigger than the leaked specs suggest, there likely won't be a repeat of the Xbox Series X and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-series-s/">Xbox Series S</a> situation, mostly due to market share. Considering Sony's current share and what the handheld should be able to achieve in a market that's more than ever favorable for these devices, it won't be too difficult to set the portable PlayStation as the baseline system, something that Microsoft never had the chance to do for the Series S with its market share.</p>



<p>According to Massive Damage's Bryan Heemskerk, the now inevitable PC ports have a higher chance of holding back PlayStation 6 games. Nowadays, every PlayStation console game is being developed with a PC port that will follow the console release in mind. Having to take into consideration different system configurations, many sporting dated hardware like entry-level GPUs from a few generations back, and storage bottlenecks, developers are unlikely to create a game that pushes a console to its absolute limit if this will eventually lead to issues developing the PC port down the line.  The developer makes the examples of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, a multiplatform port which remade a game that pushed the PlayStation 2 to its limits that doesn't look much better than Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and has a lot of technical issues, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, a current PS5-only game that takes serious advantage of the system and pushes the Decima Engine to its absolute limits. Metroid Prime Remastered is also an example of a console-exclusive game that pushed a console, the Nintendo Switch, to its limits thanks to the fact that no PC port had to be considered. With AMD not having the market share to push the widespread adoption of any new feature it may develop for the next generation of consoles, it is easy to see how having to port games to PC will likely impact how they will take advantage of the new hardware.</p>

<p>Considering how much the video game market has changed in the past few years, it will be fascinating to see how Sony and Microsoft will face the challenges ahead with the PlayStation 6 and Xbox Next. Though nothing is officially known about the two systems, leaks suggest the two companies will tackle these challenges in<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/"> very different ways</a>, which will make the next generation one of the most interesting in a very long time.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/779062/nintendo-pokemon-summoning-battle-patent</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-nintendo-and-pok%C3%A9mon-did-not-patent-%E2%80%98summoning-characters-and-making-them-battle%E2%80%99.1300200/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As first noted by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/"><em>Games Fray</em></a> last week, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company were granted a US patent earlier this month involving summoning characters and making them battle. Headlines popped up with similarly vague language as concern spread on social media: That’s a thing in tons of games! Can they do that? Is that even <em>allowed</em>?</p><p>Well, no, because that’s not exactly what they patented. And what they <em>did</em> patent might not stand up to any hypothetical challenges in court.</p><p>The patent in question, <a href="https://gamesfray.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/US12403397B2-2025-09-02.pdf">US Patent No. 12,403,397</a>, was filed in March 2023. It does involve summoning and battle mechanics, but it’s more specific than that: The claims describe a system that sounds a lot like auto-battling from <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, in which the player can send a pokémon into the overworld to automatically fight wild pokémon rather than initiating a typical turn-based battle that the player controls.</p><p>The patent outlines the process by which, after the player has summoned a “sub character,” a game’s software would determine whether to initiate a player-controlled battle, an automatic battle with the sub character, or automatic movement by that same sub character. In general <em>Pokémon </em>terms: Say you’re out in the world and you summon your pokémon by throwing its ball. Did you throw it <em>at</em> a wild pokémon? That’s a regular battle. Did you throw it <em>near</em> a wild pokémon? Your pokémon will come out of its ball and start an auto battle. Did you throw it far away from wild pokémon? Your pokémon will come out of its ball and walk around.</p><p>It’s not a patent solely on summoning characters to fight enemies, or on automatically resolving battles — it’s the whole web of options as described in the claim. But that by itself doesn’t mean the patent isn’t concerning for other game developers. Whether this particular patent could unreasonably restrict the mechanics of other games is in part determined by any given court’s interpretation of the patent and the law.</p><p>Charles Duan, an assistant professor at American University Washington College of Law whose research has included software copyrights and patent eligibility, told <em>The Verge</em> over email that there are two main ways one could potentially invalidate this specific patent: by anticipation or obviousness, and by subject matter eligibility.</p><p>To illustrate the first point, Duan said the process outlined in Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s patent reminded him of <em>StarCraft</em>, in which the player can give units an “attack-move” order to automatically battle enemies or, alternatively, micromanage a battle themself. “If an old game like Starcraft, which obviously predates the 2022 earliest filing date of this patent, had all the features that this patent claims, then that invalidates the patent under the patent law rules of ‘anticipation’ or ‘obviousness,’” Duan said.</p><p>However, he added, the arguments in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17573221740001310271">cases like these</a> can “get really technical,” and it tends to be easier to argue that a patent is invalid on the basis of subject matter eligibility instead.</p><p>Subject matter eligibility “focuses on whether the patent’s claims are (1) directed to an abstract idea and (2) contain no inventive step beyond that idea,” Duan explained. In short, you can patent a specific process that’s unique, but you can’t patent an abstract idea.</p><p>“As for (1), basic human business practices and organizations are typically treated as abstract ideas,” Duan added. “Here, the various types of automatic and directed combat sound a lot like ordinary military hierarchies: Generals tell soldiers where to go, and depending on orders the soldiers might follow orders to fight enemies near them, move toward enemies on their own initiative, or receive a destination and automatically fight enemies along the way—all the key parts of [the patent’s claims]. So there would be a pretty good argument that the patent claims are directed to an abstract idea.”</p><p>The concerns about this patent aren’t totally unfounded: Nintendo is definitely willing to use patents to defend its turf in court. In September 2024, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">filed a patent infringement lawsuit</a> in Japan against <em>Palworld</em> developer Pocketpair. That lawsuit, which is ongoing, involves <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291232/nintendo-pocketpair-palworld-lawsuit-patents">a few different Japanese patents</a> filed in 2024 related to throwing a ball at characters in a field, as well as riding characters. US Patent No. 12,403,397, by comparison, was filed in the US in March 2023, before Pocketpair had shown any gameplay footage from <em>Palworld</em>. (<em>Palworld</em> was released in early access in January 2024.) Nintendo of America is also behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eternal-darkness-infamous-sanity-system-patent-has-expired-so-can-anyone-now-copy-it">an infamous patent</a> <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6935954B2/en">filed in 2000</a> on the “sanity system” from <em>Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem</em>, in which the player character’s decreasing “sanity” level can result in trippy visual effects and gameplay-related consequences meant to evoke a sort of mental breakdown. That patent expired in 2021.</p><p>Duan noted that it’s hard to predict how a court will read and interpret a patent, so we can’t say for certain just from reading it whether it’ll stand up to any hypothetical challenges in court. But it does seem like this patent might not be <em>quite</em> as threatening to other game developers and publishers as it sounds in a headline-length description.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/779062/nintendo-pokemon-summoning-battle-patent#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjY1MTI2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Kallie Plagge</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/779062/nintendo-pokemon-summoning-battle-patent]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As the long, long wait for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> goes on, the developers of MMO <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> have seen players take to their game to scratch their Elder Scrolls itch. In fact, they even saw a player bump following the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remarkably, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim came out nearly 14 years ago, in November 2011. Its sequel, Skyrim, was officially announced with a teaser trailer at E3 2018 an eye-watering eight years ago. Yes, Skyrim has released on multiple platforms in the years in-between (so many in fact that it’s become a Bethesda meme), but there’s a tangible clamouring for a fresh Elder Scrolls experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter, The Elder Scrolls Online.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">ESO launched in 2014 and struggled at first, but 11 years later it’s still here and continues to receive updates. The development team at ZeniMax Online Studios have survived multiple rounds of Microsoft layoffs, game shutdowns and studio closures, and recently reshuffled the game’s leadership team to help it survive another 20 years. A significant overhaul is planned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-dont-think-its-much-of-a-stretch-for-the-game-to-go-30-years-the-elder-scrolls-online-developers-promise-big-changes-following-internal-shakeup">In an interview with IGN at gamescom 2025</a>, ESO game director Nick Giacomini and studio-wide director Rich Lambert said they’ve seen plenty of anecdotal evidence that suggests Elder Scrolls fans are playing ESO as a single-player game to help fill the void while they wait for The Elder Scrolls 6 to come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We hear that a lot,” Lambert said. “It's really interesting over the years going to the various shows and community events, you hear that a lot, right? I can't tell you how many times I've answered the, ‘When's TES 6 coming?’ ‘What’s TES 6?’ ‘Tell me!’ And it’s like… That’s a different studio, right? But yes, people are super passionate about Elder Scrolls. For a lot of people, this has been their home because they love Elder Scrolls and they just want to play more of it, and we're able to provide that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Lambert, a lot of ESO players play the MMO like a single-player game, which it is well suited to after the developer tweaked how the game worked following its troubled launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the early days, at launch, we tried to walk this kind of tightrope where it was MMO and Elder Scrolls, and we didn't really hit either one particularly well,” Lambert explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And when we decided we were going to make it Elder Scrolls first and then MMO second, that helped solve a lot of the problems. And we started to see the players coming in and saying, ‘Oh, you mean I can solo all of this stuff? Oh, I don't have to play with other players. They just happen to be there.’ And then you have these organic things that happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's a lot of people that play the game that way. And then there's a lot of people that just do housing or just PVP or just play the card game. We built on more systems to that over time, but at its core, a lot of players do play it like a single-player game.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Elder Scrolls Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda released Oblivion Remastered earlier this year and it proved to be hugely popular. You’d think, then, that its release would have negatively impacted ESO’s player numbers. It did, for a while, Lambert revealed, but then player numbers were boosted after those who finished Oblivion Remastered were left hungry for more Elder Scrolls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Oblivion Remaster was another big thing,” Lambert said. “That came out and we were like, ‘Okay, that's going to hit our numbers for a while.’ And there was a small blip and then the numbers went up. Kind of like the Fallout show. We were like, ‘Wow, this is cool. Right?’ So yeah, it's interesting."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nick Giacomini added: “we saw a lot of new and lapsed players come back very quickly after [Oblivion Remastered], and it continued actually for quite some time. It was pretty exciting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, ESO continues to benefit from the wait for The Elder Scrolls 6, but what’s the latest on the hugely anticipated game? The studio confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-officially-in-early-development-but-dont-expect-to-hear-about-it-soon"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 had entered "early development" in August 2023</u></a>, and "early builds" were available in March 2024. The six year anniversary of the announcement arrived in June last year and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while"><u>Bethesda development chief Todd Howard paused to say, "oh wow, that has been a while."</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January this year, The Elder Scrolls 6’s June 10, 2018 announcement <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced"><u>became as old as predecessor Skyrim was when The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls 6 was thought to be set for 2028 at the earliest, presumably on the next-generation of consoles as well as PC. If it does launch then, it’ll do so an incredible 17 years after Skyrim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

"You can then link your existing Battlestate Games account with an active copy of the game to your Steam profile. If the editions differ, it will automatically use the higher edition of the two when launching the game through Steam."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While players will continue to be able to play via Battlestate's own launcher, some fans have slammed the developer for not providing free Steam keys, particularly as both Steam and launcher players will share the same servers, and all players, regardless of platform, require a Battlestate account. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are no excuses for buying an extra Steam copy just to play from an existing account," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1nikisx/there_are_no_excuses_for_buying_an_extra_steam/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> one player.

The fact that you can link an existing account and it automatically upgrades to the higher version is what doesn't sit right with me. You drop $30 for the Standard Edition just to link and upgrade to your $120 [Edge of Darkness edition]? You're just buying in to play your account on Steam at that point."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's droves of people who have been waiting for years to have a place to put their grievances where it might actually matter to do so," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1nikisx/comment/nemz7j0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested</u></a> one player. "No doubt, the moment that players have the opportunity to leave a Steam review, they're going to. However, you can't leave a Steam review on a game you don't own. Therefore, any of the many long-time players that have been repeatedly burned by [the developer] are not likely to spend any more money on his dogs**t. Therefore, the only reviews will be from new players that get the full 1.0 experience, without all the years of disappointment behind it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't get why people act surprised all of a sudden," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1nikisx/comment/nejo8v5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> someone else.

                <p>EA's new Skate game, the first in 15 years, launched this week and put up big numbers on Steam for its early-access release. The launch hasn't gone over totally smoothly, however, as players encountered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-server-queues-lead-to-complaints-about-always-online-requirement/1100-6534790/" data-ref-id="1100-6534790">server issues and other problems</a>.

There was an "ongoing outage" overnight that prompted EA to conduct maintenance--and <a href="https://x.com/SkateStatus/status/1968127349284811247" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">that's now resolved.</a></p><p>The version of Skate people are playing now is unfinished and known to include bugs and other issues, which is pretty standard for early-access games. EA and Full Circle have said they will examine feedback to try to make the full release better whenever it's ready.</p><p>Skate is out now for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game reached <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 80,000 peak concurrent users today on Steam</a>, and that's just on one platform.</p>

<figure><a title="Xenoblade / Days of our Lives" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f0dcf8f1da785/xenoblade-days-of-our-lives.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The long-running American soap opera <strong>Days of Our Lives</strong> has made headlines recently after one of its regular characters name-dropped <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong>, of all things.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1967660763499405407">Nintendeal</a> on X (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-cant-believe-a-days-of-our-lives-character-just-name-dropped-a-mid-tier-rpg-franchise-while-flirting">IGN</a>), the moment occurred when Aaron Greene attempted to invite Arianna Horton into his room by asking if she wants to "come play Xenoblade on my Switch". Looking like she just couldn't let the poor guy down, Arianna actually agreed and said "wow, uh, yeah, yeah sure".</p>

<p>It's not the first time a Nintendo franchise has been name-dropped in a TV show, and nor will it be the last, but usually it's the likes of Mario or Zelda that are the go-to franchises for something like this.</p>
<p>Here, however, the fact that Xenoblade is name-dropped indicates that the writer of this particular scene may be a fan; or at the very least is aware of the RPG series from developer Monolith Soft.</p>
<p>It's gone down well with fans, regardless, with user <a href="https://x.com/ZhenghuaYang">Zhenghua Yang</a> stating "This show has 61 seasons and I've never seen any bit of it until Xenoblade was mentioned. Top tier marketing."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As the weather starts cooling down and we start spending incrementally more time indoors week after week, there’s never been a better time to get yourself an iPad. Whether you plan on using it to catch up on emails, to doomscroll on your preferred social media app, or to just pour more hours into&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>but on a larger screen than your phone, the Apple iPad Air might be what you’re looking for. This 2025 model iPad normally starts at $599, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4143/">Amazon is running a limited time deal that’s bringing the price down by 25%. This $150 savings means you’ll only have to pay as low as $449.</a></p>
<p>This $449 discounted price is for the Wi-Fi-only 128GB model. There are three other storage sizes available—each with their own $150 discount. You can get the 256GB model for just $549, the 512GB model for just $749, or the 1TB model for just $949. If you want to add on cellular, the discounts are slightly different. The 128GB, 256GB and 1TB models are down $150 still but the 512GB model is only down $84.</p>
<p>For all combinations of storage or cellular capabilities, you can choose between four stylish colors. Pick either blue, purple, space gray, or starlight.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4143/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Performance</h2>
<p>So AI has been a pretty big buzzword this past year. Will it be the future of consumer tech? Or is it just a speculative fixation like we went through with NFTs. We’ll find out in due time. Though for right now, Apple and companies like it have promised a ton to consumers with the inclusion of their own proprietary AI models they’re sticking into their products. Apple has Apple Intelligence which can be used to help you craft messages, generate images, and things of the like. The M3 chip is powerful enough to make local processing for Ai models such as this possible.</p>



<p>Beyond AI, the M3 chip allows for improved performance on power-hungry apps, letting you run them side-by-side with each other with no hiccups. Graphically intensive games also get a boost.</p>
<p>To get the full use out of your Apple iPad Air, you can pick up the Apple Pencil Pro (sold separately). Use it to quickly jot down notes, draw or edit photos, and more. It’s compatible with tons of productivity and art apps on the App Store.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4143/">Finally get yourself that iPad you’ve been telling yourself you would with the 2025 model iPad Ai powered by Apple’s M3 chipset</a>. Most versions are on sale right now for $150 off.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mutant-football-league-2/">Mutant Football League 2</a> developer Digital Dreams has announced that the game will officially launch for PC and console on <strong>December 10</strong>. Originally launching in early access last year on PC--and in February 2025 on Xbox Series X|S via Game Preview--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-isnt-the-only-football-game-you-can-play-to-get-hyped-for-the-super-bowl/1100-6529297/">the NFL Blitz meets Evil Dead sports game</a> is the successor to the 2017 cult-classic football game, with the franchise first kicking off in the '90s under creator Michael Mendheim.</p><p>Like EA's popular Madden series, Mutant Football League 2 is focused on the rough-and-tough sport, but it's arguably better because you can tackle the opposition so violently that they can explode into a gory cloud of pink mist. The game mixes a dark sense of humor with 8-vs-8 arcade-style action between teams of Orcs, mutants, undead skeletons, and murderous robots. To make things even more ultraviolent, each arena is packed with deadly traps and sinister hazards like buzzsaws and giant mutant worms.</p>

<p>Basically, if you're looking for an anti-Madden football game, this will probably appeal to you as you'll have to guide a team of rookies to the top of the Mutant Football League through its single-player season, Dynasty Supreme franchise mode, and online multiplayer.</p><p>Some of the big features in the sequel include 36 MFL teams to choose from, buildcrafting to power up your team's abilities with legal performance-enhancers like Skillroids, and the opportunity to create your very own stadium loaded with deathtraps.</p><p>"Mutant League is my bastard child that I've loved since its inception in the early nineties. And now, against all odds, our small team of passionate and dedicated developers has managed to resurrect it for a new generation," said creative director Michael Mendheim. "At its core, it’s fun, hard-hitting, and unpredictable--easy to pick up and play, yet layered with depth and strategy."</p><p>If you're interested in scoring a few vicious touchdowns, you can pick up the game on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p>

            <p>It turns out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s NPCs are basically playing their own game of Grand Theft Mario.</p>
<p>A video shared on social media by Supper Mario Broth explains how NPCs can actually steal a car belonging to another character.</p>
<p>Specifically, the video shows a green Shy Guy parking a vehicle and walking away. A Toad NPC then saunters up to the vehicle, jumps inside, and drives off, leaving the oblivious Shy Guy plodding down the road. Incredible!</p>

<p>Supper Mario Broth explained there are a few scenarios for the Shy Guy after this: the NPC will either keep walking until the player leaves and they despawn; they'll enter a building to despawn; or they'll steal a car themselves.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">In Mario Kart World, NPCs will park their cars, exit them, and walk around.

<p>As much as Mario Kart World is full of these little details designed to make its open world feel alive, jacking cars seems very un-Nintendo for such a family-friendly game. Children, avert your eyes!</p>
<p>Have you spotted NPCs stealing cars in Mario Kart World?</p>

            <p>EA's Skate has now released into early access and has already proven so popular there are long queues to get in, with the team fixing ongoing outage issues.</p>
<p>Yet when players do get in, they're discovering skating isn't actually the optimal way to get around. In fact, videos on social media make the game look more like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>.</p>
<p>One player shared a video of their character rolling and jumping without a skateboard to overtake traffic and speed around the city.</p>

<p>Another player responded with a video of their character similarly rolling and jumping before belly flopping to slide over the ground.</p>
<p>Yet another player has found jumping from their board and flying to be an optimal way to build up speed.</p> <div>

<p>It's clear, then, Skate is not quite performing as expected. But for now, the studio is busy improving wait times, with the team "hard at work adding more servers and getting more skaters into San Van", it <a href="https://x.com/SkateStatus/status/1968048173492081010">wrote on social media</a>. "We appreciate your patience."</p>
<p>As per the game's subreddit, many players have been sitting waiting in queues, while others have joined a session but been shortly kicked out due to server issues.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="659"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1ninsuf/the_gameplay_so_far/">The gameplay so far</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BittaminMusic/">u/BittaminMusic</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/">SkateEA</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>As a result, many players have complained about Skate's online requirement. Developer Full Circle confirmed back in April the game would require an online connection.</p>
<p>"The game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving," it wrote in an <a href="https://forums.ea.com/blog/skate-game-info-hub-en/the-grind-vol-1/12126312">FAQ</a>. "You’ll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities. In order to deliver on our vision of a skateboarding world, the game will always require a live connection."</p>
<p>Still, that only works if players are able to get in, for which the studio is at least prioritising a fix.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Peach" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/67642939e169b/mario-kart-world-peach.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that Europe will soon be treated to its very first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> online event, as it lifted the lid on the '<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2025/September/Take-part-in-the-first-ever-Mario-Kart-World-European-online-event--2914655.html">European September Circuit</a>'.</p>
<p>This online competition will get off the start line on <strong>27th September</strong>, running from <strong>5pm BST - 7pm BST (6pm CET - 8pm CET)</strong>. It'll see participants speeding through a series of 150cc VS Races, all in the hopes of keeping their Versus Ranking as high as possible. Each player will start with a Versus Ranking of 3,000 points, which will go up or down depending on race outcomes, and one the two hours are up, that ranking is locked in.</p>
<p>If this all sounds like a bit of you, you can take part by following the instructions below. A Switch 2, Mario Kart World and active Nintendo Switch Online subscription is required to participate, but you lovely lot knew that already, right?</p>
<ul>
<li>Head to the Mario Kart World main menu and select 'Online Play'</li>
<li>Hit '-' to search for an event and enter the Event ID <strong>1023</strong></li>
<li>Once the confirmation has gone through, you're in!</li>
</ul>
<p>One week after the event wraps up, Nintendo will publish a leaderboard of the 100 highest-ranked players from the European September Circuit. There's no <em>prize</em> for the winner, as such, but the bragging rights speak for themselves.</p>
<p>A similar event cropped up in Japan last month, with the '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mario-kart-world-announces-summer-vacation-skill-test-event">Summer Vacation Skill Test</a>' similarly putting drivers through their paces. Let's hope we see more friendly competition in the future.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/heres-why-battlefield-6-doesnt-have-levolution/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-why-battlefield-6-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-bf4%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98levolution%E2%80%99.1300113/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Even before DICE and the other teams formally unveiled Battlefield 6, the developers already <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-will-feature-the-most-realistic-and-exciting-destruction-effects-in-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">touted</a> in a job ad that the next entry in the military first-person shooter franchise would feature the 'most realistic and exciting destruction effects in the industry'. </p>



<p>Now that most fans have already played the game in last month's beta weekends and the full game is only a few weeks ahead, though, it's obvious that while Battlefield 6 does feature well-made destruction, it's not quite as thorough and all-encompassing as in some of the previous installments, such as Battlefield 4's 'Levolution', which gave players the opportunity to raze entire buildings. </p>



<p>Speaking to EDGE in the latest issue (415) of the <a href="https://fave.co/4mquqZB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">magazine</a>, Ripple Effect General Manager Christian Grass explained that the developers have opted to implement 'tactical destruction' in Battlefield 6, as being able to destroy everything during matches could harm the game's fun factor. </p>



<p><em>We love the spectacle of that destruction – it looks awesome, sounds awesome, it’s really cool. But we want it to serve a gameplay purpose. If you could destroy everything, once there’s nothing left, then the game wouldn’t be fun. In Bad Company 2, it was a little bit more ‘what if you could destroy all these freestanding buildings, without anything remaining?’ </em></p>



<p><em>Battlefield 6 uses what we now call the apple-coring system, where we make sure that gameplay spaces always have cover, and are always interesting to fight around. We want people to be flanking by destroying things, to take down a building to eliminate an enemy. We have tanks driving into a building, so that you suddenly have this threat in a place you thought you were safe. </em></p>



<p>Even so, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-destruction-improvements-battlefield-2042/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offers better destruction than Battlefield 2042</a>, and it performs better, too. According to the Technical Director of Battlefield 6, this is partly because the developers had to optimize the game for the less powerful Xbox Series S, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made the game run better on all platforms</a>. We have also learned that console players <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-secretly-console-first-turn-off-crossplay-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be able to turn off cross-play with PC</a> while maintaining the feature to play between consoles (for example, PlayStation and Xbox users together).</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-fsr-4-now-works-on-steam-deck-delivering-significant-image-quality-improvements.1300110/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>AMD FSR 4 now works on Steam Deck in select games, delivering noticeable image quality improvements in Cyberpunk 2077 and Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</p>



<p>A new video shared on YouTube a few hours ago by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard</a> provides a step-by-step guide on how to install AMD FSR 4 on Steam Deck and use it in games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which both support the upscaler. The installation process is relatively simple, and the small effort seems to be totally worth it, although performance is not the best at the current early stage. In Cyberpunk 2077, for example, using AMD FSR 4 over previous versions of the upscaler delivers a cleaner and sharper image, with better detail for elements in the distance, such as buildings. The new version of the upscaler delivers similarly impressive results in Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and with a relatively minor impact on performance.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="BREAKING: FSR4 Is Now Working On Steam Deck!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7EHLj8L-VUE?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Although AMD FSR 4 is officially only supported on RDNA 4 GPUs, workarounds have been discovered to run the upscaler on devices powered by previous architectures like the aforementioned Steam Deck and RDNA 3 GPUs like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-rdna-3-gpus-run-fsr-4/">RX 7800</a>. Even without the proper hardware to run the upscaler, it seems like AMD FSR 4 delivers solid results in multiple scenarios, giving owners of older devices the chance to improve the image quality and performance of several titles, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>



<p>Many of the visual and performance improvements AMD FSR 4 delivers in supported games should make their way to the PlayStation 5 Pro soon with the new version of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler. According to rumors, the new PSSR version should launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-amd-fsr-first-quarter-2026/">early next year.</a></p>

            <p>What with all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paying-the-subnautica-2-team-their-promised-bonus-would-be-embarrassing-kraftons-ceo-allegedly-told-the-games-chief-over-lunch">lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-unknown-worlds-are-now-suing-their-former-execs-for-stealing-docs-and-sharing-them-with-the-press">countersuits</a> between publishers Krafton and certain former Unknown Worlds executives, you could be forgiven for thinking that "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>" is some kind of arcane courtroom term - a compact way of saying "vicious haggling over withheld bonuses", perhaps. Here's a new developer diary video to remind us that Subnautica 2 is actually an underwater sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game. It doesn't have any lawyers in it, but it does have a massive peckish tentacle monster. Set that one up for you, comments thread comedians!

<p>Shared on <a href="https://press.krafton.com/UNKNOWN-WORLDS-REVEALS-THE-COLLECTOR-LEVIATHAN-IN-SUBNAUTICA-2">Krafton's press site</a>, the video introduces the Collector Leviathan, which appears to be a giant squid except it only has four tentacles/arms, not the regulation 10, unless you include all the tiny wiggly ones around its mouth.

<p>Given its embarrassing tentacle deficiency, it's no shock to read that the Collector Leviathan is an "irritable" creature. If it sees you, it will emit a noisy shockwave and jet towards you with body laid horizontal. Then, it will rear up vertical to give you a lovely look at its volcanic split cranium and painterly bioluminescent forehead patterns. Then it will grab you with a tentacle and eat you.</p><p>It's definitely better to be inside a submarine when this happens, but it's even better to not let it happen at all. Hide from the Collector, and it will eventually lose interest and glide away. You can also lure it off by throwing a flare.
</p>
<p>I dread meeting something this big in a real-world aquatic context, but I do like watching videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJtd9BLCuc">human divers encountering more reasonably sized cephalopods</a>. I hear that octopus arms contain <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-octopus-arms-bypass-the-brain/">"partly independent mini brains"</a>, and that they <a href="https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/how-octopuses-and-squids-change-color">both deceive predators and court mates</a> using colour changes.</p>
<p>Please put some of that in Subnautica 2, Unknown Worlds. I'd suggest letting players talk to the Collector Leviathan by means of chromophore mechanics, but that would risk aggravating both Edge Magazine and <a href="https://tomscullin.medium.com/the-limits-of-language-wittgensteins-lion-analogy-a2d4baa5bd20">Wittgenstein</a>, and I make it a rule never to piss both of them off at once. Also, now that I consider it, maybe don't give the Collector active camo - the prospect of it sneaking up on me through murky water is quite harrowing enough.
</p>
<p>The video is a tacit reminder from Krafton that there are still "veteran developers" at Unknown Worlds following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">the sudden ejection of Subnautica 2 director Charlie Cleveland, studio CEO Ted Gill, and co-founder Max McGuire</a>. It's a 10 minute walkthrough of the Collector's creation that doubles as a dissection of the production itself - transporting us from concept sketches through modelling and animation to the creation of visual effects and AI behaviours.
</p><p>There's a teasing glimpse of a doc from September 2024, created by game designer Louis Karim, which rolls through how the Collector conveys its alertness through posture and sound. As regards some of the game's areas, at least, it will spawn at a distance from the player and despawn when you're sufficiently far away. It's a relief to learn that there's only one present per session, even during co-op. All this is WIP, mind.
</p>
<p>The doc also mentions a couple of in-game biomes, Sparse Plains and Outer Bounds, plus a blurred-out reference to another Leviathan. There's an untitled image of a third creature that looks like a piscine aeroplane. Apparently you will encounter the Collector in the course of "pearl interactions". Perhaps we'll have to crack open giant clam shells while avoiding the megasquid's attention.
</p>
<p>The September 2024 doc will likely be of interest to the Subnautical subredditors who are trying to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-leak-is-authentic-say-publishers-who-benefit-the-most-from-that-leak">gauge the completeness of Subnautica 2 from leaked materials</a>. The current pie-slinging match between Krafton's lawyers and those of the departed Unknown Worlds execs hinges on whether or not the game is fit for early access release this year. 
</p>
<p>Krafton claim it needs more time to cook, partly because the bygone Unknown Worlds bigwigs have been shirking their responsibilities, and are only interested in money. Cleveland, Gill and McGuire insist that the game was substantial enough for launch this year, and that Krafton only delayed it because they're welching on a timed $250 million earn-out. I am having more fun thinking about the tentacles.</p>

            <p>As criticism of Borderlands 4's technical performance continues, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has told players to "get a refund from Steam if you aren't happy with it".</p>
<p>Since Borderlands 4's release last week, Pitchford has been on a tirade on social media <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-is-pretty-damn-optimal-randy-pitchford-responds-to-borderlands-4-pc-performance-complaints">in defence of the game</a> calling it "pretty damn optimal".</p>
<p>In his latest post, Pitchford stated every PC gamer "must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing", effectively placing responsibility on individual players to perform their own optimisations.</p>

<p>One player responded "Your product doesn't meet the standards" and said it took days to get the game to a tolerable state.</p>
<p>"You can do whatever you want," Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510">replied</a>. "The game is the game. Please get a refund from Steam if you aren't happy with it.</p>
<p>"You made an analogy to a vehicle. I would not put a Ferrari engine in a monster truck and expect it to drive like a Ferrari. If you tell me about your specification, I can help you optimise your performance. I'm sorry you don't like being told to use DLSS, but that is the way. If you're not happy using the tools available to you to improve frame rate and you're not happy with the frame rate you have, you should play a different game.</p><p>"The game is awesome and it is designed to be just fine of an experience at 30fps and feel great at 60fps. We also have provided a lot of options for you to make different trade offs between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features than we would make and we encourage you to use those tools to optimise to your taste.

<p>Despite performance issues across both PC and console platforms, Borderlands 4 is proving popular. On Steam alone it's reached a concurrent player count of over 304k (though this remains behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>).</p>
<p>The official Borderlands account released some player stats such as items looted and bosses defeated, with <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1968049883925078218">Pitchford adding</a>: "Holy bananas you guys played a LOT of Borderlands 4 over the weekend. The backend on-line services all held, which is what we hoped would happen!"</p>
<p>It also looks like a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/easy-queasy-borderlands-4-fov-sliders-may-be-coming-to-console">POV slider could be added for console players</a>, following complaints of motion sickness.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-survivor">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a> has launched its 1.0 version today, September 17th, ending the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>-like and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">DRG</a> spinoff’s two-year spell in early access.</p>
<p>Despite some initial umming and ahhing about how a comedy co-op FPS would translate into a single-player autoshooter – if I press the Rock and Stone button and nobody hears, did I say Rock and Stone? – DRG: Survivor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-early-access-review">quickly won me over</a>, thanks in particular to the tension and horde-dodging trickery afforded by its adaptation of the original game’s pickaxe mining. I’ve also had a little go on the 1.0 build ahead of release, and it does indeed feel like the most complete, well-tuned version yet.</p>

<p>The big additions are a new escort mission type, inspired by (yet sadly not also starring) Dotty the Drilldozer from OG Deep Rock, and the Gear system, which provides an alternative to the persistent upgrades shop by rewarding successful runs with equippable clobber. Your bearded exterminator can only don a handful of these at a time, but they grant juicier stat boosts than the upgrades that your cash and minerals will stretch to in the early game, so they’re good for a more tangible power boost.</p>
<p>Per-run, XP-earned weapon upgrades also seem slightly more generous than I remember from various early access builds, and the lower hazard levels (or difficulties, if you’re a smooth-handed leaf lover) are generally more forgiving. That all gives DRG: Survivor a much more welcoming introductory phase, though there are also plenty of nasty mutators in the Anomaly Dives and Lethal Operations modes for danger seekers.</p><p>I, for one, am all about the power spikes, those cackling turnabouts where all your accumulated upgrades finally flick a brain switch from 'run away to survive' to 'run into them to kill.' I still think Vampire Survivors is more forthcoming with these moments, but DRG: Survivor 1.0 is at least more willing than previous versions to let you become a wave-wiping whirligig of bullets and plasma. Good on it.</p>

            <p>My liege, I bring more tidings from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> and its Coronations DLC. After <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-apologise-for-crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-not-being-up-to-the-standard-you-deserve">apologising for the add-on "not being up to the standard you deserve"</a> last week, developers PDS Black have released a second patch aimed at smoothing out the edges of in-game oaths that've been causing issues.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-debuts-to-boos-and-jeers-from-the-steam-review-court-largely-thanks-to-broken-oath-breaking">we reported</a> not long after Coronations arrived, it quickly turned into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">another instance</a> of Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-take-first-step-in-response-to-bloodlines-2s-dlc-clan-backlash-with-playstation-refunds-promise-more-info-next-week">rather stepping in it</a> when it comes to DLC. Negative reception was fuelled both by technical issues with the new oaths rulers can take on ascending the throne, and the fact that the publishers were charging for features that are relatively compact, but also a pretty central aspect of any kingly lifespan.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To be fair to PDS Black, it's taken them less than a week to follow up on the promise of more Coronations fixes. Taking a look at the notes for the regal strategy game's freshly-released Update 1.17.1, there certainly isn't a shortage of tweaks, with a bit of balancing and a couple of new features to boot.</p>
<p>Those new additions are "a powerful new event for coronation hosts, allowing you to use your skilled chancellor to break up a neighboring confederation or earn a new vassal or tributary", plus some extra reasons for lovers to be in relationships. I assume the latter includes lines like 'his crown's got like seventy jewels, how sexy's that!' Meanwhile, balancing-wise, zealous characters are now easier to convert to witchcraft assuming their faith's OK with it. The Level six Millet Storage yurt also costs more to build, and "the ‘Divine Marriage’ tenet now has the incestuous trait as a virtue". Say what you want about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a>, its patch notes are rarely boring.</p>
<p>The rest of the bug fixes include, but aren't limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘Consolidate the empire/kingdom’ oath: The requirement now fully checks for the title for which the coronation was held, not the current primary title.</li>
<li>‘Purge Pretenders’ oath: Fixed the requirement for the children having a claim on your primary title.</li>
<li>‘Purge Pretenders’ oath: Fixed decision display issues, fixed wrong law displayed in the selection tooltip.</li>
<li>‘Repent’ oath: One pilgrimage is no longer counted as multiple</li>
<li>Removed the requirements for the oath buildings and replaced them with piety/prestige costs</li>
<li>Character Memories about Coronations are now more reliable</li>
<li>The event ‘Fulfilled Oath’ will no longer display "Consolidate the None" upon completing the Reconquer Oath</li>
<li>Forbid Pope and other Heads of Faith from bringing any demands in the ‘Petitioners’ event chain</li>
<li>Upon losing the last Kingdom title, all active oaths are removed, thus preventing a lot of edge cases</li>
<li>‘Install Claimants’ Oath: The decision now properly requires 3+ claimants installed via wars.</li>
<li>Building Oaths now better display the requirements for buildings in held baronies</li>
<li>‘Shape the Realm’ Oath now has an updated building requirement in the decision window</li>
<li>‘Strengthen the House’ Oath now is fully mechanically resolved upon completion</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/573767838266819604?l=english">the full notes here</a>, sire. This patch should hopefully stop you from instantly forgetting they exist or being distracted by some Popely demand.</p>
