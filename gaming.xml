            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/26/24228779/d-and-d-beyond-magic-items-spells-update-d-and-d-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has walked back some of <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/changelog#UpdatingtheDDBeyondToolsetforthe2024CoreRulebooks">its planned updates to D&amp;D Beyond</a>. All your current <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> characters sheets are once again safe with the publisher no longer forcing updates to newer versions of spells, weapons, and magic items.</p><p>Last week, as a part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24180843/dont-call-it-6th-edition-though-well-all-probably-do-that">the updates to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition</a> — collectively known as the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23728470/dnd-dungeons-dragons-6e-5e-changes">2024 revision</a> — the publisher announced that it would update D&amp;D Beyond, the tabletop RPG’s official digital toolkit that players use to reference content and create characters using a host of official and third-party sources. The update would add the new 2024 rulebooks to the toolkit, mark outdated content with a “legacy” badge, and change players’ character sheets to reflect all the new rules and features. </p><p>That last part is critical to understanding why some <em>D&amp;D </em>players (including my own dungeon master) spent the last 72 hours in a state of panic. Though some of the 2024 revisions are essentially cosmetic in nature — for example, “races” will be updated to “species” — other updates like the ones to weapons, spells, and magic items fundamentally alter the game. Wizards of the Coast would have essentially overwritten every user’s character sheet with the new information whether they wanted it or not. </p><p>“All entries for mundane and magical items, weapons, armor, and spells will also be updated to their 2024 version,” Wizards said in its initial announcement.</p><p>The publisher did say that players would have the option to continue to use the 2014 version of spells and magic items. But doing so requires using the game’s homebrew rules. which aren’t known for being user-friendly. </p><p>To put this in perspective, think of it like owning a car. Imagine that after 10 years with one car, learning its ins and outs, the manufacturer decides that when it rolls out the latest model of your car, it’s going to magically change your car to the new model, too. Now, though your car is essentially the same, it doesn’t work like you’re used to. And when you ask the manufacturer if you can go back to your old car, it says you can but that you’ll have to manually restore it yourself.</p><p>Thankfully, Wizards of the Coast isn’t in the car business, and after a weekend of backlash on social media, the company will no longer force the new changes on players.</p><p>“We misjudged the impact of this change, and we agree that you should be free to choose your own way to play,” <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1806-2024-d-d-beyond-ruleset-changelog-update">Wizard’s said in its latest announcement</a>. Current character sheets will only be updated with new terminology while the older versions of spells, magic items, and weapons will be preserved. Also, players who have access to both the 2014 and 2024 digital versions will have the option to use both when creating new characters.</p><p>Essentially, Wizards of the Coast is doing what it should have done in the first place: simply adding the new content and giving players the choice to opt in. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-factions-future/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-will-add-more-factions-if-the-community-want-them.963957/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-factions-future/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Last week, I had the opportunity to sit down at Gamescom with Ian Proulx, Co-founder and CEO of 1047 Games, to talk all things Splitgate 2. We’ve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-new-details-anti-cheat-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compiled some of that interview here</a>, in which Proulx discussed Esports, Anti-cheat, and other updates. </p>



<p>But now that I’ve returned home after walking almost half a marathon a day at Gamescom, I’ve listened back to our interview again. </p>



<p>1047 Games is very focused on making Splitgate 2 the best game it can be (as it should be), and the sentiment conveyed in our interview was that this will be achieved through community feedback. Several times, Proulx mentioned a ‘Community First’ approach, which was refreshing and comforting to hear. You see, I am a massive fan of the original Splitgate. Its simplicity and mechanics made it fun, and after the announcement of the second game, I was somewhat perplexed about the game’s new direction. </p>



<p>Fortunately, I did have the opportunity to play the game a couple of weeks ago. Although my initial concerns have been squashed, I still wanted to ask those all-important questions that the community has expressed concerns about since the game’s initial announcement. </p>



<p>One of the most significant changes in Splitgate 2 compared to its predecessor is the introduction of Factions. After my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-is-a-solid-sequel-but-with-a-big-esports-influence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on time with the game</a>, I found that the Faction-based system worked well, but I did want to know about Splitgate 2’s live-ops model and when, or if, that live-ops model includes the addition of more factions in the future. We often see live service games with characters, heroes, factions, or whatever you want to call them balloon into an unnecessary amount after a couple of years. For example, Apex Legends has gone from eight characters to launch to 25, and sometimes, such additions feel like they are implemented just for monetization rather than gameplay and quality. On this and on the addition of more factions, Proulx said,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think we want to go to 10 factions [for example], you know? I think like one of the problems, and one of the problems we’ve thought through is, how do we prevent bloats from happening? You know, you play a lot of games where just over the years, it gets crazy and unsustainable, and so I think that’s part of the motivation for going classes versus heroes. Is there a world where we add more classes, like sure, is there a world where we don’t? Yes.</p>



<div><p>Genuinely we don’t know which direction we’re going to take it. I think a lot of it is like, let’s launch this game and let’s see with the community wants you know? If adding a new faction is what the community wants, we are in a position where we could do that, but maybe they just want new guns, and they don’t want new abilities or equipments or anything.</p><p>So maybe we’re just building on these three factions and that’s a great thing about how we’ve structured our company and just our mindset, like we’re very nimble. Were very ready to pivot, we’re very ready to take feedback and roll with it.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p><br>So there you have it: if the Splitgate 2 community wants more Factions, it’ll happen. I did try to squeeze Proulx a little further to ask if they’ve already considered or thought about future Factions and their abilities, but for now, he said the team is entirely focused on the core game for launch. </p>

<p>I like knowing precisely how well my system will run upcoming games. Numerous benchmarks are available to test performance, but nothing beats information straight from the developer. In this, we finally have the Black Ops 6 system requirements on PC, including the long-rumored storage size!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-black-ops-6-system-requirements-on-pc">The Black Ops 6 System Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>To prepare for the upcoming beta for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Activision finally unveiled the PC system requirements for the game. They align with what we expected, and thankfully, the overall storage space requirements are somewhat more manageable!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 5 1400</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 / GTX 1650 / AMD Radeon RX 470</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 149 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>



<li><strong>Internet</strong>: Broadband Internet Connection</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-6700K / AMD Ryzen 5 1600X</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti / RTX 3060 / AMD Radeon RX 6600XT / Intel Arc A770</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 149 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>



<li><strong>Internet</strong>: Broadband Internet Connection</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-big-is-black-ops-6">How Big is Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Now that we have official PC system requirements available for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, we know the game doesn’t weigh in at over 300 GB, as initially rumored. Instead, you require just 150 GB of space for the game. Unfortunately, it’s still absolutely massive, but that’s how many AAA titles are heading these days.</p>



<p>That said, if you already have Call of Duty HQ and Warzone installed on your computer, you can download Black Ops 6 for a measly 78 GB! Impressive!</p>

Though the name references the long-running Resident Evil series it was first created for, it's been used since in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon's Dogma 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Street Fighter 6</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Devil May Cry 5</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and even </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The engine follows in the footsteps of MT Framework, Capcom's first studio-wide game engine that debuted in 2006's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Rising</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Framework's legacy lives on in other ways too, according to Tsujimoto. "We're greatly focused on multiplatform releases at Capcom, and we need an engine that can work across multiple [types of] hardware," he said. MT Framework was a "great porting engine," and its strengths there were replicated for RE Engine's development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Today, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> teams and other Capcom developers work "right alongside" the RE Engine engineers, and benefit from a "fast feedback loop" to request features or bugfixes slowing down development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That seems simple enough on its face, but Capcom isn't the only game company to mandate use of a single internal engine. At companies like EA, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/frostbite-labs-is-ea-s-new-skunkworks-for-developing-future-tech">the practice</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-frostbite-engine-was-too-hard-to-manage-according-to-former-bioware-gm/">been blamed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for slowing down development on games not in based in the genre the engine was created to support. The difference, Tsujimoto explained, is that no single game or franchise has the final say on updates to RE Engine.</span></p><p>Image via Capcom.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have the flexibility to work with them on a priority list," he said. If the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team makes a request that the team can't immediately accommodate, they aren't told "no," they're brought into a conversation about the pipeline—one they can participate in because they're aware of every other game in development and their technical needs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In fact, having developers at Capcom in constant conversation with each other is a common practice. From the way he described it, there doesn't seem to be a habit of siloing teams away from each other on secret or need-to-know projects. "Our teams all work closely together, even across different titles," he said. "We're able to share ideas and discoveries and technology with each other."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That sense of cooperation extends as far out as the sales teams in Japan and across the globe. Tsujimoto seemed to nod at the fact that the Monster Hunter series' massive sales numbers come from regions outside the US and Japan, saying the company has developed a "tight-knit" relationship with the teams marketing and distributing the game across those regions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Close relationships between game developers and salespeople are slightly unusual—but the series' ever-growing popularity seems to be shaping the production process in a number of impactful ways.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Is five years too long to make a game like ">Is five years too long to make a game like <span>Monster Hunter Wilds?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though not all of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' developers have been on the project for all 5-6 years of its development (Fujioka, the art director, said the team also worked on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Rise</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and its expansion </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sunbreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in that time period), that's still an eye-popping amount of time to work on a single game. Fujioka told Game Developer that its expanded development was driven in part by the series' growing playerbase, whose existence increased the amount of time spent on research and development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The more people came on board the series, the more we had to think about how we actually meet our users' needs when we start a new project," he said. "There's so many more players now, and they [possess] a broader level of skill levels and experience with the [series]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's especially worth calling out with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/monster-hunter-wilds-open-world-leap-is-thanks-to-growing-global-popularity">major shakeups</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to the Monster Hunter formula. The game is set in a series of open worlds where players can take on more open-ended hunts, tracking different monsters and mimicking the role of a hunter in a real-world ecosystem. Not every player can smoothly navigate the jump from one type of gameplay to another, and accommodating them (seemingly with insights from the global sales teams) was a key part of the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As game director, Tokuda was the one who "felt" the long years developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Tsujimoto joked. Tokuda told us he's been creatively invested of exploring the "monster ecosystem" at the heart of the series ever since he first saw the first game's trailer over 20 years ago. But for the team to push the boundaries of that development philosophy, it increases the scale of the project, which "inevitably has a resource cost, and one of those resources is 'time,'" he observed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His passion for the "monster ecosystem" is palpable, telling us that Capcom has reached the point where it can "push the boundaries" on how it's represented on screen. "Not just in terms of graphical quality, but just being able to feel like you're leaping into this living, breathing world," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Are half-decade-long development cycles worth that fantasy? For players, probably. For developers—well, we'll have to wait until 2025 to truly find out.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-adds-new-gameplay-mechanics-has-a-lot-of-densely-packed-content/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Starfield: Shattered Space, the first expansion for the single player sci-fi RPG released last year by Bethesda Game Studios, is now just about a month away from <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-releases-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launching</a>.</p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, the developer opened up slightly on what will be featured in the premium DLC. In an <a href="https://gamingboulevard.com/2024/08/interview-starfield-shattered-space-with-tim-lamb-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with Gaming Boulevard, Lead Creative Producer Tim Lamb said:</p>
<p><em>We've added a few new mechanics that we're really excited about. For example, there are new zero-gravity combat scenarios that really change the dynamics of how you approach fights. It adds a layer of strategy that wasn't there before. We've also introduced new ship customization options, which allow players to really tailor their vessels to their play style. And on the exploration front, there are new tools and gadgets that will help players interact with the environment in deeper, more meaningful ways.</em></p>
<p><em>The new sector we've created is pretty substantial. It's not as large as the entire galaxy, obviously, but it's densely packed with content. We focused on making sure that every corner of this new area feels alive and has something for players to discover. Whether it's hidden side quests, unique encounters, or just the sheer beauty of the landscapes, there's a lot to keep players engaged. It's less about sheer size and more about the depth of the experience.</em></p>
<p>Lamb also said that the expansion content is integrated seamlessly into the game, so the content will seem like a natural fit for players in the middle of a playthrough. Artistically, Starfield: Shattered Space will offer vibrant colors and more diverse landscapes, and the story will feature several twists and turns that should surprise players.</p>
<p>Starfield: Shattered Space is out on September 30 for PC and Xbox Series S|X. However, with Microsoft porting more Bethesda games to PS5 (such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming</a> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle), it may be only a matter of time before PlayStation players get to fly the stars as well.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-state-of-play-is-likely-coming-in-late-september-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.963837/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/september-2024-state-of-play/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb has claimed that a PlayStation State of Play will likely be released by the end of September.</p>



<p>The rumor came during today’s Game Mess Mornings, when after speaking on the PlayStation 5 Pro, Grubb said, “There is probably going to be a PlayStation State of Play by the end of September.” Unfortunately, Grubb didn’t dive into what could be announced during the event. Still, both he and his co-host guest theorized that it could be something akin to a PS5 Pro announcement followed by a miniature games showcase on the new console.</p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro was reportedly heavily talked about at Gamescom this year, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wccftech</a> and the Italian website <a href="https://multiplayer.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Multiplayer</a>&nbsp;both hearing from developers that the console is on its way. </p>



<p>It remains to be seen when the PlayStation 5 Pro will be announced. Unfortunately, such information is hard to pin down due to how PlayStation segregates its departments from one another in an effort to stop leaks. However, logically, it makes sense to announce the console ahead of the Tokyo Game Show, which starts on September 26, 2024. </p>



<p>According to our developer and manufacturer sources, the PlayStation 5 Pro is still on track to release around mid-November. </p>



<p>Will you be buying the PlaySation 5 Pro on release? And are you looking forward to another PlayStation State of Play? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

That direction helped establish the visual language of the game, but developer Massive Entertainment wanted to take things a step further by making Star Wars Outlaws look like it had been shot with the same film lenses as the classic movies.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzR8Rg-4840" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lzR8Rg-4840" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To achieve this technical feat, the studio developed its own digital "camera lens" in the Snowdrop Engine, which was used to give Star Wars Outlaws a more cinematic presentation. While this is an optional mode, players can enable a widescreen presentation in the game that adds black bars to the bottom of the screen, a period-accurate film grain, and other small cinematic touches.</p><p>"We developed a lens, a camera lens within Snowdrop, our game engine, that allows us to replicate the sort of, lenses of the '70s and 80s," creative director Julian Gerighty explained in a new GameSpot Insider documentary. "So you have barrel distortion, chromatic aberration, film grain, and vignetting all wrapped up in an ultra-widescreen presentation. All of these things you can turn on and off individually, but the whole impact is that it really pulls you into a cinematic presentation."</p><p>According to technical art director Stephen Hawes, the lens project was challenging but worth pursuing as it harkened back to how the original films were shot and helped create a cinematic experience for Star Wars Outlaws. Massive Entertainment was able to render technical effects like lens breathing and film grain that ran at 24fps independent of the game's chosen frame rate, and other small touches like CRT screens, a slight barrel distortion, and a soft focus helped create a "grounded, cinematic" atmosphere, Hawes explained.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws launches on August 30 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-preorder-guide/1100-6522523/" data-ref-id="1100-6522523">but if you're looking to play a few days early</a>, you'll be able to do so if you have a Ubisoft Premium+ subscription. <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/star-wars-outlaws/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On GameSpot's sister site Metacritic</a>, Star Wars Outlaws currently has a "generally favorable" metascore of 77 from 59 reviews.</p>

            <p>
A new Nintendo Direct broadcast will air tomorrow, Tuesday 27th August, at 3pm UK time. 
</p>
<p>
For those across the pond, that's 7am Pacific, or 10am Eastern.
</p>
<p>
Lasting roughly 40 minutes, the show will feature upcoming games and announcements for Nintendo Switch, from both major third-party developers as well as indie studios. Just don't expect any news on Nintendo's own games - such as the upcoming Zelda: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> - or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow's broadcast is a combined Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, which focuses on big games from non-Nintendo developers, and an Indie World Showcase, which spotlights projects from smaller creative teams. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">post</a> on X this afternoon, Nintendo also gave it's now-familiar statement that it would not be revealing any new information on Switch 2 tomorrow. (The company is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">detail its upcoming new hardware at some point before March 31st 2025</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025">launch it later next year</a>.)

			<p>Despite the system having yet to be announced, the PlayStation 5 Pro is apparently still coming this year, according to a report from a reliable insider.</p>
<p>During the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8TqCntkFPg&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Mess Mornings</a>, Jeff Grubb discussed Sony's yet-to-be-revealed system, saying that, last he heard, the console is still coming out this year. In addition, the insider heard that there will probably be a State of Play presentation by the end of September. The insider doesn't know if the PlayStation 5 Pro will be at the State of Play, but there's a good chance it will be.</p>
<p><iframe title="Game Mess Mornings 08/26/24" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o8TqCntkFPg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At this point, the PlayStation 5 Pro has become an open secret, and almost everyone in the video games industry seems to know about it. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/">During this year's Gamescom</a>, Alessio was told by a developer that they have been informed about the system specifications and are sure Unreal Engine 5 games will run better on the system. Given that it wasn't a big developer, it definitely seems like Sony shared the system specifications with a wide range of developers to gear up for the system's announcement and release.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

It won’t be long till you can try her toolset out for yourself, but while you wait here’s everything we know about Vyse, including her backstory, abilities, and release date.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h4692"><a id=""></a><strong>When does Vyse release for <em>Valorant</em>?</strong></h2><p>Good news! Vyse joins the roster as part of <em>Valorant </em>Episode 9, Act 2, which releases on August 28 at 9:00 a.m. EST. That means you only have a couple of days before you’ll be able to test out the latest agent for yourself. </p><h2 id="h4693"><a id=""></a><strong>What is Vyse’s backstory?</strong></h2><p>As part of her reveal, Riot dropped a cinematic titled “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btpWg1gDXIE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btpWg1gDXIE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All Paths End Here</a></span>” that gives us some insight into who exactly Vyse is. In the short video we see a team of current agents led by Jett embark on a mission in South Korea to take down a mysterious new combatant. That combatant is, of course, Vyse, who manages to hold her own against the strike team thanks to a series of abilities like laying traps and summoning metal thorns out of nowhere. Before the battle gets out of hand, Omen suggests they talk, hinting that Vyse will join the <em>Valorant </em>protocol. </p><p>The cinematic doesn’t reveal too much about the mysterious masked agent. We do hear her talk and she sounds American, so maybe she has some history with Viper, but only time will tell. The cinematic does make the new agent out to be a cold and calculating force of nature, one that <em>Valorant </em>is lucky to have on its side.</p><h2 id="h4694"><a id=""></a><strong>What are Vyse’s abilities?</strong></h2><p>Vyse takes on the sentinel role in <em>Valorant</em>. Agents in the sentinel role typically have a toolset that focuses on defensive play and supporting the rest of the team. Vyse will become the sixth sentinel in <em>Valorant</em>, joining Killjoy, Cypher, Sage, Chamber, and Deadlock. Vyse’s skills center around manipulating metal, sort of like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-unlock-magneto-1851585011&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-unlock-magneto-1851585011">Magneto</a></span> from the <em>X-Men</em>. Here is the full list of Vyse’s abilities.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Arc Rose</strong>: Equip an Arc Rose. Target a surface and fire to place a stealthed Arc Rose, or alt fire to place the Arc Rose through it. reuse to blind all players looking at it. This ability can be picked up to be redeployed.</li><li><strong>Shear</strong>: Equip filaments of liquid metal. Fire to place a hidden wall trap. When an enemy crosses, an indestructible wall bursts from the ground behind them. The wall lasts for a brief time before dissipating.</li><li><strong>Razorvine</strong>: Equip a nest of liquid metal. Fire to launch. Upon landing, the nest becomes invisible. When activated, it sprawls out into a large razorvine nest which slows and damages all players who move through it.</li><li><strong>Steel Garden</strong> (ULT): Equip a bramble of liquid metal. Fire to send the metal erupting from you as a torrent of metal thorns, jamming enemy primary weapons after a brief windup.</li></ul><p>Vyse’s toolset positions her as a great agent for zone control and laying traps for opponents seeking to flank you and your team. With abilities that blind enemies or activity on command it really seems like Vyse will thrive on letting your opponents walk into traps that turn them into fish in a barrel for your teammates.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Star Wars galaxy has a unique aesthetic, and for its open-world adventure game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6515795/" data-ref-id="1100-6515795">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, developer Massive Entertainment had the tricky task of keeping that design ethos intact while putting its own spin on that franchise. In a new video in GameSpot's Insider series, the developers at Massive Entertainment revealed just how they managed to strike that balance between authenticity and originality for their open-world adventure game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzR8Rg-4840" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lzR8Rg-4840" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Thanks to all the reference material provided to the developer--like concept art and sketches--the studio felt inspired to create a world for Kay Vess to inhabit that's inspired by the original films and the time period they took place in. Massive Entertainment aimed to use those assets to create worlds, cities, and vehicles that could feasibly exist in the original trilogy of Star Wars films, like Kay Vess' ship, the Trailblazer.</p><p>Inspired by the technology, vehicles, and even the kitchen utensils of the '60s and '70s, Massive Entertainment followed the same artistic path as the artists who worked on the Star Wars films to create an authentic layer of detail for Star Wars Outlaws. "For us it was really important to bring new things, but in the same methodology," associate art director Marthe Jonkers explained about the studio's artistic approach to the design of Star Wars Outlaws.</p><p>Massive Entertainment knew it was headed in the right direction when it had discussions with LucasFilm and the company struggled to tell if the developer had created an original asset for the game or replicated one from the Star Wars movies. "We definitely had situations where people weren't sure if this was something we had created or if it's something that we took from existing stuff," associate narrative director John Bjorling said. "And I think that's like the highest grade of accomplishment that you could probably have. It's so authentic that we don't even know."</p><p>The end result is a Star Wars game that looks like it could fit very easily in the classic Star Wars universe, thanks to Massive Entertainment's eye for detail and authenticity. The various locations visited by Kay Vess and Nix feel lived in, the technology looks like it was pulled from a funkier decade of sci-fi design, and even the NPCs sport fashion that looks like it was based on the wardrobe of extras in the old movies.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws releases on August 30 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but if you're a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fubisoft.pxf.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F864200%2F12050%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fubisoftplus&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhow-star-wars-outlaws-looked-to-the-past-to-create-an-authentic-galaxy-far-far-away%2F1100-6526112%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft+ Premium subscriber</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-preorder-guide/1100-6522523/" data-ref-id="1100-6522523">you can start playing three days early</a> while getting all of the bonus content from the Ultimate Edition of the game.</p>
