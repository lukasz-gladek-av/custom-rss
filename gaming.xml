            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-modding-tool-at-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has revealed that a&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>modding tool will be available in its beta stage at the game's launch, allowing you to make custom maps, models, scenarios, and more if you wish.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/4572929880423149849" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a>, 11 bit says that while mod support has been talked about in the&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>community "ever since the launch of the first&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>", that game's engine limitations prevented official modding support from being introduced.</p>
<p>However, since&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>is being built on Unreal Engine, "things are totally different" this time around, and official modding support will be available for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>when the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-delayed-september">arrives in September</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-modding-tool-city.jpg?itok=Og3D0gEE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-modding-tool-city.jpg?itok=y1tJCoLU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s modding tool will allow you to create all kinds of things.</figcaption></figure><p>The devs are calling this modding tool FrostKit, and it will bring support for creating custom maps, populating those maps with custom models, and creating custom scenarios as well.</p>
<p>11 bit says you'll be able to make cities that are "ancient, cosmic, or differentiated in thousands of other ways from the original frosty-apocalypse setting", so if you've ever wanted to create a Lovecraftian city builder, it looks like your time has come.</p>
<p>At first, the tool will be released in beta, but it will include "most of its functionalities" at launch. 11 bit then plans to iterate on the tool based on community feedback.</p>
<p>However, before it's launched, 11 bit says it will hold a closed beta prior to&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s release in order to test FrostKit out "with selected members of the modding community". It's not yet clear how - or, indeed, whether - you can apply to be one of those members.</p>

<p><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>is due to arrive for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on September 20th.

However, the latest discovery blows the rest out of the water. Here is the full translation, per Reddit:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Three there were who made the journey, without whose knowledge there is no returning. A pathway connecting near and far, across the heavens star to star. Despite great powers which do object, this secret way the three protect. So heed the path with a watchful eye, for if you wander you will die.</p></blockquote><figure id="" data-id="f43c67207eea397001cfcfb3288a1439" data-recommend-id="image://f43c67207eea397001cfcfb3288a1439" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hologram projects a map and a phrase in runes" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hologram projects a map and a phrase in runes" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f43c67207eea397001cfcfb3288a1439" data-recommend-id="image://f43c67207eea397001cfcfb3288a1439" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hologram projects a map and a phrase in runes" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once the translation was posted fans immediately began attempting to decipher what exactly the message actually meant in the context of <em>Ahsoka</em>, with many focusing on who the “three” are. Fans seem to have come to the joint conclusion that the most likely answer is that the three are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ones/Legends&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Ones/Legends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Ones</a></span>, also known as the gods of Mortis.<br></p><p>These three gods—the Father, the Son, and the Daughter—have history in the<em> Star Wars</em> canon, having previously appeared in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2023/07/the-essential-clone-wars-episodes-every-star-wars-fan-should-watch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2023/07/the-essential-clone-wars-episodes-every-star-wars-fan-should-watch/"><em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em></a></span> before making a major appearance in the finale of <em>Ahsoka </em>in the form of massive statues discovered by Baylan Skoll. The three represent the different sides of the force: the Son is the dark, the Daughter the light, and the Father represents the balance between both. Each also mirrors characters throughout <em>Star Wars</em> canon, with many seeing Anakin as the Father, Ahsoka as the Daughter, and perhaps Baylan as the Son following the conclusion of season one. The pathway connecting near to far is clearly the Pathway to Peridea so it seems that season two of Ahsoka will delve even further into the attempts of the cast to find that long lost route to another galaxy. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ahsokaofficial/status/1745147241579303084&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ahsokaofficial/status/1745147241579303084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concept art</a></span> for the second season revealed Ahsoka and Sabine standing atop the Mortis statues that Baylan discovers at the end of season one, hinting that the two will follow after Baylan on the journey laid out in the cryptic message, though the “no returning” bit could mean someone might lose their life on the trip—or be stranded there forever. But as there is currently no release date for <em>Ahsoka </em>season 2, fans will have to wait a little longer to find out what is in store.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-reveals-aggressive-multiplatform-target-plans-with-catchy-new-name/1100-6523394/" data-ref-id="1100-6523394">Square Enix revealed a new aggressive multiplatform plan going forward</a> in May. "So now we are moving towards the policy of releasing our games on a multiplatform basis, and we really want as many players as possible to play our titles," the developer said. "So with Final Fantasy XIV as the starting point, we do want to release more Square Enix games on Xbox, and there will be more of our titles released on Xbox."</p><p dir="ltr">Other mainline Fantasy Fantasy games have launched exclusively on PS5. For example, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth came out earlier this year and is still only available on Sony's system. Meanwhile, Final Fantasy XVI released last year on PS5 but will arrive on PC on September 17.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on the MMO, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-a-new-world/1900-6418254/" data-ref-id="1900-6418254">Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail review</a>.</p>

            <p>Demonschool - the upcoming RPG inspired by Persona and Italian horror films - has been delayed.</p>
<p>The game was initially meant to release next month, on 13th September. However, after careful consideration, the team has decided to postpone the launch to ensure it reaches a higher standard.</p>
<p>"You never want to delay a game, but Demonschool means a lot to us. We've really put everything we have into this project, and as we got closer to release we realised that meeting the 13th September deadline would necessarily mean a game with less content than we originally envisioned," developer Necrosoft Games said today.</p>

<p>It continued to state the team could have shipped the game in September as originally planned, or delay it a touch to "allow us to manifest our bigger dreams into reality". It chose the latter.</p>
<p>"Realistically, the player would never have known. It still would've been a finished product. But we would have known that the game could have been more, and that's the game we want to share," it wrote, adding Demonschool's publisher Ysbryd had given everyone involved the flexibility to do this.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while work on Demonschool continues behind the scenes, Necrosoft Games will also be releasing some "short dev diaries" to keep everyone up to speed on what it is doing.</p>
<p>"We're sorry for those who are eagerly awaiting the game, but are very hopeful that all the extra content will be worth the wait," Necrosoft Games closed. "2024 has been a very trying year for the team, so we appreciate your understanding."</p>
<p>Demonschool is now targeting a release during the first quarter of 2025.</p>

<p>Our Ed gave the demo for Demonschool a whirl earlier this year, calling it a mix of Persona meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer.</p>
<p>"It's playful, funny, nostalgic, and spooky in equal measure and I can't wait for the full release," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demonschool-is-persona-meets-buffy-and-i-love-its-90s-vibes">Demonschool Wishlisted feature from June</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>After a long period of dormancy, the Legacy of Kain franchise is poised to make a return as a prequel graphic novel.</p>
<p>This graphic novel is known as Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver - The Dead Shall Rise, and earlier this week Crystal Dynamics revealed the project had surpassed $1m in Kickstarter funding.</p>
<p>"This is more than just a milestone - it's proof of the power of this community," Crystal Dynamics celebrated on social media platform X. "We're beyond grateful. Let's keep the momentum going!"</p>

<p>This particular Legacy of Kain project was first announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-is-making-a-comeback-but-its-not-what-you-think-it-is/1100-6524621/">several months ago</a>, and promises readers the chance to "discover an untold tale", as the graphic novel bridges the gaps between Blood Omen and Soul Reaver.</p>
<p>"Readers will discover Raziel's origins as a human child, the events that led him to join the Sarafan, and the mysterious emergence of his wings," reads the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitbotmedia/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-prequel-graphic-novel?ref=dtv72k">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver - The Dead Shall Rise Kickstarter page</a>.</p>
<p>"The graphic novel offers fresh insights into the lore, revisiting iconic moments and characters like Kain, Moebius, and Raziel's brothers, while introducing new faces such as Elaleth, whose connections to Raziel, Kain, and the Hylden bring unexpected twists to the tale."</p>
<p>If you are interested in backing the project, there is still time. The Kickstarter will end in a little over two weeks from the time of writing.</p> <div>

<p>Fans have been hopeful for a series remaster of sorts following some perhaps unintentional teases from the developer in recent months.</p>
<p>Along with the upcoming re-release of both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blood-omen-legacy-kain">Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</a> and Legacy of Kain: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-legacy-of-kain-games-will-be-re-released-for-evercade-next-month">Evercade retro handheld console</a>, logos for an unannounced "Legacy of Kain: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> 1 &amp; 2 Remastered" were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remaster-hints-surface-at-comic-con">included on display plaques accompanying statues of game characters Kain and Raziel</a> during a Comic-Con event held in San Diego earlier this year.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, Crystal Dynamics sent out a survey asking if recipients would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-wants-your-thoughts-on-legacy-of-kain">interested in seeing the Legacy of Kain series make a comeback</a>. This survey followed an announcement from the developer that it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-now-has-control-of-tomb-raider-following-square-enix-sale">regained "control" of its Legacy of Kain series</a>, as well as that of the Tomb Raider IP, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sells-off-western-studios-and-ip-including-tomb-raider-and-deus-ex">Square Enix's sale of its Western studios</a> (which included Crystal Dynamics) to Embracer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-remaster-announced-alongside-developer-revival.965994/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/croc-legend-of-gobbos-remaster<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>British studio Argonaut has announced a&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>remaster, and as you might imagine given that it's making an announcement, Argonaut itself is being revived as well.</p>
<p>Describing itself as a "legendary studio known for bringing its pioneering 3D technology to a 2D gaming world" back in the 80s, Argonaut says it's making a return after "a 20-year hiatus", although "hiatus" seems a strange word to use given the studio closed its doors in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p>The studio goes on to say it's making a "grand comeback as a boutique publisher" and that it's got a "planned slate of classic Argonaut IP" in the works, starting with a remaster of&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-remaster-argonaut-platforming.jpg?itok=2X54HITk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-remaster-argonaut-platforming.jpg?itok=BuXJy_8V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Croc is back, in remaster form.</figcaption></figure><p>According to a press release on the <a href="https://www.argonautgames.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new official Argonaut website</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Croc&nbsp;</em>remaster will come complete with "enhanced HD graphics", as well as "updated modern control mechanics". Hopefully, we can still play with the original's lovably janky tank controls.</p>
<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Croc&nbsp;</em>you're getting with this remaster, though; you're also getting access to the "Crocipedia", a repository of&nbsp;<em>Croc&nbsp;</em>development assets including design documents, concept art, and more. Honestly, that's a win for preservation however you slice it.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that this inspires a revival of&nbsp;<em>Croc 2</em>, which deserves to make a comeback. In the meantime, however, you can check out the reveal trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>remaster right here.</p>

<p>Croc is the latest in a string of platforming mascots from the late fifth console generation era to be revived for modern systems. He joins the likes of <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kao-kangaroo-2022">Kao the Kangaroo</a></em>,&nbsp;<em>Glover</em>, and, of course,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time">Crash Bandicoot</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spyro-reignited-trilogy"><em>Spyro the Dragon</em></a>, although those revivals are a little further back.</p>
<p>We don't have a release date or a list of platforms for the remaster of&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>yet, but Argonaut has said it's coming to "all the current consoles and PC" later this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Every now and then I reflect on the statistically determined average age of a Gamer – what is it now, 36, 37? Please let it still be under 40 – and realise with alarm that, by extrapolation, a lot of the people reading this probably have children. Augh, children! Please excuse me while I go stand on a chair, clutching a broom. I’ve never understood the craze for generating smaller versions of yourself. It’s one of those weirder subcultures you read about in the papers, but rarely observe in daily life. 
</p>
<p>
I do, however, understand the appeal of same-screen co-op games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/run-from-mummies">Run From Mummies</a> - which, being a bloodless comedy dungeon romp, seems like a fair pick for those encumbered with boisterous selfspawn. Don’t worry, the “mummies” of the title are just regular old disembowelled corpses wrapped in cloth, not those sinister, non-embalmed “mothers” you’ve been hearing about down the grocers.

Run From Mummies is a game about archaeology in much the same way that Whack-A-Mole is a game about moles. You and up to three friends are tourists trapped in a giant pyramid filled with rambling undead, spike traps and laser-beam statue bosses. Your only weapon is a camera – you can stun the inhospitable relics and mess with other objects using the flash, in what is probably a serviceable metaphor for the effects of tourism on archaeological sites generally. Snapping a picture means standing still while an AOE triangle extends from your feet, however, so try not to do it whilst running away from a rolling boulder.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2503180/Run_From_Mummies/">There’s a demo for Run From Mummies on Steam</a>. The full game spans seven regions linked by hand-drawn cutscenes that have reasonable Two Point energy. There are apparently “secrets” and “lore” to uncover, but while I can get behind probing layouts for sliding walls, I’m not sure plumping the codex is the point of a game like this. It reminds me a bit of Sega Dreamcast classic Power Stone, except that it’s top-down and 2D. Undoubtedly, half the fun will be getting in each others’ way.
</p>
<p>
Too cartoonish for your tastes? I can only assume you have older children between the ages of ten and twenty, “teen-agers” if you will, who think 2D is way uncool, ma. Perhaps they’ll be happier with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-both-a-more-relaxed-wolfenstein-and-riddick-plus-nazis">the new Indiana Jones game</a>. It’s fully 3D, boasting the finest polygons Microsoft's money can excavate from all the programmer brains they've got stowed in the cellar. It also has a photography mechanic where the point is actually to take photos of stuff, rather than giving hangry skeletons a seizure. Bit off-the-wall, but let's see where it goes.

<p>During a new interview <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Eurogamer</a>, Final Fantasy 14 director and producer Naoki Yoshida offered new comments about the latest Xbox release and plans for future titles.</p>



<p>Yoshida, who fans may recognize as Yoshi-P, revealed that “we’ve seen a really strong response on Xbox” following Final Fantasy 14’s release on the platform.</p>



<p>They also mentioned that Phil Spencer “put in a lot of hard work into making it a reality.” So, Yoshida says that “we would like to make the best of that and further deepen the relationship with Xbox gamers moving forward.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Yoshida said they consider Final Fantasy 14 to be just the starting point. They concluded that “we do want to release more Square Enix games on Xbox, and there will be more of our titles released on Xbox.”</p>



<p>Yoshida also addressed the Xbox market in Japan, as a general argument. They explained that “in the Japanese market there is an extremely low number of users on Xbox.” They added that developers in any country may want to focus on appealing to fans in their own country.</p>



<p>Last June, Yoshida also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-14-director-denies-ff9-remake-involvement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied recent rumors</a> that they have any involvement in a Final Fantasy 9 remake. </p>



<p>Most recently, fans of the Final Fantasy series learned this week that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-16-releases-for-pc-this-september-demo-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 16 is coming to PC</a> via Steam and EGS in September 2024. </p>

                <p>Bandai Namco has announced that the MMO Blue Protocol will be ending service in Japan, and that the international release via Amazon Games has been canceled.</p><p>Blue Protocol will be shut down on January 18, 2025 in Japan. "As a result, we have also canceled our plans to release a Western version of the game in collaboration with Amazon Games," Bandai Namco said in a <a href="https://blue-protocol.com/news/507" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "We have enjoyed a strong relationship with Amazon Games throughout the development of Blue Protocol, and both of our teams are disappointed that we will not be able to deliver the game to players around the world."</p><p>Bandai also added that while it been preparing for the game's launch, it ultimately concluded that it would be difficult to provide a satisfactory experience. Blue Protocol was supposed to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/anime-mmorpg-blue-protocol-will-release-in-2023/1100-6509907/" data-ref-id="1100-6509907">worldwide simultaneously in 2023</a>, but only the Japanese version launched. The Western version, to be published by Amazon Games, <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1660998805053906945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1660998805053906945%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">was delayed to 2024</a>. Earlier this year, Bandai reported a <a href="https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1757894569059066137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1757894569059066137%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">21 billion yen loss due to an underperforming game</a>, which may have been Blue Protocol.</p><p>Amazon Games has been synonymous with the MMORPG genre as of late, with games such as Lost Ark and New World. It's also publishing another MMO, the Korean-developed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/being-a-free-player-in-amazons-new-mmo-wont-be-quite-so-rough-thanks-to-new-changes/1100-6525061/" data-ref-id="1100-6525061">Throne and Liberty</a>, next month.

The longtime Ubisoft voice actor and motion capture performer is now the voice and face of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> protagonist Kay Vess. Not only is it her first lead role, it's a role that lets her recreate her childhood, playing with Star Wars toys, and imagining she was one of the characters up on the silver screen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She's had a lot of time to dream since then. But when push came to shove, what is it she wanted to bring to a role like this? Kay's personality and appearance were being cooked up by the rest of the team at Ubisoft. With such a high-stakes license on the line, was there room for her to explore the character and build on everyone else's work?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yep. As she told Game Developer at Gamescom 2024, her time with Kay Vess saw the character shift from snarky and confident to someone who's more of a "dreamer"—honing what would make for a compelling lead for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="González saw much of herself in Kay's journey">González saw much of herself in Kay's journey</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to González, Kay originally was written as more "cynical" and more "jokey" before she came in, describing a character that sounds like Nathan Drake and his many quippy peers in the land of video game protagonists. "When they got me in the role, they noticed that I brought a bit more heart and vulnerability and because she is a rookie scoundrel," she recalled.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/take-a-look-at-nix-s-motion-capture-puppet-from-star-wars-outlaws" target="_self">Take a look at Nix's motion capture puppet from Star Wars Outlaws</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft's made a lot of hay about how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fulfills the "scoundrel" Star Wars fantasy—a role tailored for the fans who connected more with the Han Solos of the series than the various Jedi protagonists. Luke Skywalker, Anakin, and Rey were all chosen heroes, but Han Solo, Lando Calrissian, and other supporting characters embodied a sense of freedom, adventure, and loose obligation to morality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's a different type of story here in comparison to Lando Calrissian or Han Solo," González said. "They have the expertise, they're confident, they have the swagger...they're almost too confident."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kay, by contrast, is living through what you might say is her first day on the job. The game begins with her trying to score enough cash to leave the casino city of Canto Bight, and her adventure embodies a "fake it until you make it" attitude.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">González said that direction let her bring "more of herself" to the performance. "I know what it means to put on a mask, and pretend like I know what I'm doing, and use my charm—Kay Vess has a lot of that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, González brought back a little bit of the Luke, Anakin, and Rey energy—characters whose stories all began with them dreaming of getting out and seeing a bigger world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"She's a dreamer," González said affectionately.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The motion capture team worked 8 hour days to preserve actor's energy">The motion capture team worked 8 hour days to preserve actor's energy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because this was González's first lead role, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> gave her the most amount of work she'd had on an Ubisoft production. Good for her paycheck—but also demanding on the body. She explained how Ubisoft's motion capture process was designed to give actors time to rehearse and rest to make it through months of filming.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The wonderful thing about motion capture, in comparison to TV and film, is that it's a very balanced lifestyle," she said. "We work nine to five, we always get our evenings off...which means that you do get a lot of rest."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team would rehearse a week's worth of performances on Monday, then spend Tuesday through Thursday shooting scene after scene. "The scenes take maybe a little longer, and when you shoot them, they're a bit more linear like in theater because we're not cutting in between [takes]. Because it's all mocap, and there's no sets or hair or makeup or costumes, you focus on the work a lot more."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Vess said as a motion capture performer, she's used to acting against "nothing," and quizzing directors for information on what will be onscreen in the final game. But getting to work with Camille Loiselle-D'Aragon and her </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/take-a-look-at-nix-s-motion-capture-puppet-from-star-wars-outlaws?cache=false">handmade Nix puppet</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a particular delight. "That was a special moment," she said, recalling how Loiselle-D'Aragon would maneuver the puppet into jumping on her lap and other "visceral" interactions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That was a very special moment," she recalled, "because I know that we don't often get that as motion capture performers."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="González and other performers face new kinds of threats.">González and other performers face new kinds of threats.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">González, a Candian actor, isn't a member of SAG-AFTRA and thus isn't part of the ongoing strike against developers for their alleged refusal to bargain with actors on protections against exploitative use of generative AI. But she supports her peers, including actors like Dee Bradley Baker (who voices Nix and Jabba the Hutt in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">). "Voice actors can play so many roles in one game," she said, nodding to his multiple performances. "If they're only saying, 'we'll protect your likeness,' that doesn't really work."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">González has had to grapple with another challenge facing video game actors today: the threat of online harassment. In her case, it's largely manifested as part of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/this-was-never-about-anything-other-than-hate-1851602820">a racist and sexist backlash</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which is the first Ubisoft open-world game in recent history to not let players select a player character from one of two genders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She's not particularly concerned with the backlash (echoing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-says-swedish-pride-in-craftsmanship-was-key-to-development-progress">comments made</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by creative director Julian Gerighty in our conversation with him at Gamescom), telling Game Developer that she does "zero engagement" with players who have nothing "constructive" to say, preferring to interact with fans like those she'd come to Gamescom to meet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She did say however, that the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-are-valve-and-discord-permitting-harassment-against-sweet-baby-inc-">persistence</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of said campaigns shows why representing characters like her is important. "Having someone like me, who's an immigrant, who's queer, who's a Latina, who's a female protagonist in one of the biggest franchises in the world...I understand people are protective of those worlds, but we need to have representations of what [our] world actually looks like," she said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kay Vess may be a dreamer setting her way out in the galaxy, but it's clear González is ready for whatever the game industry throws at her.

            <p>If you are looking to get a bite sized portion of narrative-driven horror into your evening, you can now give The Casting of Frank Stone a quick whirl thanks to its free demo.</p>
<p>The Casting of Frank Stone is the upcoming interactive game set in the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-narrative-game-the-casting-of-frank-stone-revealed">collaborative effort between slasher aficionados Supermassive Games and Behaviour</a>.</p>
<p>Its demo acts as a prologue to the main game itself, and plops players down at the Cedar Hills Steel Mill. Taking on the role of Sam Green - who is described as a "determined" policeman - players will then start investigating the rather sad case of a missing child.</p>

<p>I had a go last night, and the demo probably took me around 25 minutes to complete. It gave me the chance to find hidden collectables, get an idea how the game's choice mechanic works and just generally enjoy the unsettling atmosphere as we head closer towards autumn and the spooky season. I will probably give it another shot later, and make some different choices to see how much I can change the overall outcome (which I will not spoil here).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2223840/The_Casting_of_Frank_Stone/">try the demo out for yourself on Steam now</a>. Please note, even if you finish the demo, progression will not carry over to the full game on release.</p>
<p>As for when that is, The Casting of Frank Stone is set to launch across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC next month, on 3rd September.</p>

		<p>Everyone has a game from their past that they’d love to see again. That classic of your childhood that brimmed with imagination, and which you played to death because you only had one game. Well, if Croc Legend of Gobbos was that game for you, it’s time to rejoice, as both it, and original developers Argonaut Games, are returning, bringing that wiggly-bummed crocodile to modern platforms later this year, greener and shinier than ever before.</p>
<p><iframe title="Croc Legend of the Gobbos Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1lxQ4m_g21I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Originally released in 1997 for the PlayStation 1, and selling over 3 million units, it was also ported to the Sega Saturn (the console of kings) and PC. It’s easy to throw around the word ‘classic’, but Croc Legend of Gobbos stands resolutely amongst the most beloved platformers of the era, and especially for PlayStation owners, bereft of games like Mario 64 and Bank Kazooie, Croc Legend of Gobbos filled that space admirably.</p>
<p>The remastered release is going to feature enhanced HD graphics, updated modern control mechanics, and an authentic gameplay experience that will take gamers back to the golden age of 3D platforming. Beyond that, fans will also have access to the Crocipedia, an extensive and meticulously curated digital museum containing long lost development assets including game design documents, concept art, animation tests, team member interviews, and more.</p>


<p>Unusually, alongside the remaster, the original developers are returning as well, after a 20 year hiatus. Argonaut Games were a huge part of the gaming scene of the 80s and 90s. Founded by gaming icon Jez San OBE, the team are known for bringing pioneering 3D technology to a 2D gaming world in the 1980s. Alongside Croc, the team are probably best known for the seminal original Star Fox for the Super Nintendo, as well as the Super FX chip that made its 3D visuals possible on the 16-bit console. The team went on to make some of the best-known licensed games of the era as well, with the awesome Alien Resurrection and Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone and its sequel.</p>

<p>A developers union at Call of Duty studio Raven Software <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/18-CA-349076" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have filed a complaint</a> with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. </p>



<p>First reported by Stephen Totilo in his <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-partner-showcase-raven-activision-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameFile</a> newsletter, the union at Raven Software claims that its parent companies are bargaining in bad faith as well as taking part in “concerted activities” such as retaliation and discipline. There are also allegations of changes in the terms and conditions of employment without agreement of the union.</p>







<p>“After Microsoft’s acquisition of&nbsp;Activision Blizzard, our members were optimistic that they would progress quickly to a first contract at Raven Software,” CWA president Claude Cummings Jr. said to GameFile. “Unfortunately, that has not happened. We encourage Microsoft to address the concerns raised in the Unfair Labor Practice charge and make reaching a fair agreement a priority.”</p>



<p>Microsoft nor Activision Blizzard have responded to Insider Gaming’s requests for comment. Microsoft, however, did tell Totilo that it is “committed to negotiating in good faith.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has filed a request to view the full complaint, and will provide details should the request be granted.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>From each character’s magical awakening and all the RPG mechanics it opens, to the social sim elements that feed into how you interact with the world, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor ReFantazio</a> is clearly adopting the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">Persona formula</a> – but it’s doing so for something seemingly bigger in scope from both a gameplay and storytelling perspective. After playing about five hours of Atlus’ upcoming RPG, it’s extremely apparent how it’s leveraging the strengths of its previous games to think outside the confines of traditional fantasy and create something wholly unique. And as much as I love Persona, it’s about damn time we’ve had a game of this style that goes beyond the classroom walls and halls of high school.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Metaphor ReFantazio Preview - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>No matter which way you cut it, Metaphor is a politically charged story – not just in the concept of being the main character who is striving to win an election to be the next king. Having played the opening hours, it boldly establishes the social dynamics of its medieval fantasy setting, the Kingdom of Euchronia. The story opens up with the protagonist in a carriage with a group of wanderers getting ambushed by bandits, where he witnesses a red-haired elven girl slice down the bandits before he gets kicked off a cliff to fend for himself. It’s a grim, hostile world outside of the towns and city walls where outlaws and monsters always seeking prey. And even within its capital, its society rife with classism and discrimination shows that nowhere is truly safe. Metaphor makes this clear as soon as you reach the Royal Capital in the opening hours, showcasing how poverty, racism, and militarism dictate life across the kingdom.</p><p>The protagonist is an “elda,” a tribe (or race) that presents as regularly human – they’re a rare sight in Euchronia and are treated with disdain. The elven “roussainte” and horned “clemar” are more commonly accepted while the hedonistic cat-like “paripus” live on the fringes of society. The tribal dynamics set the tone for a story that seems to wield social injustice as a major theme. But the main character isn’t just any young elda; he’s best friends with the crown prince, who’s effectively in a coma after a violent coup attempt from years ago. This relationship is revealed early on, which begs the question of what the protagonist’s role and motivations really are as he becomes a serious candidate in the kingdom-wide election process.</p><p>Significant parts of this opening use beautiful anime-style cutscenes and I didn’t mind putting the controller down for long periods because these show an elevated level of production chops compared to Atlus’ previous games. That extends to its stunning aesthetic; Metaphor brings the kind of flash and fashion you expect from Persona while blending in the harshness of a brutal medieval world.</p><p>However, I wasn’t <em>entirely </em>sold on Metaphor in the opening hours. It’s visually striking with a captivating setup, but it’s delivered in a fairly by-the-numbers sequence of events as it tries to build the foundation of a brand new setting. I started to see the vision once I got deeper into the preview demo, though. After signing up as a foot soldier in the army and getting sent off to a dangerous military operation, you’re paired with a clemar named Strohl, and your fairy companion Gallica reminds you that your mission is to meet with someone on the inside who has vital information for your true goal. Not much is explained at first, but as I got through the introductory dungeon, I saw more of Metaphor’s pieces fall into place. I began to see how corruption from within the kingdom exploits people who are used as political pawns. I forged an early bond with Strohl who’s a well-meaning noble willing to put his life on the line for what’s right. But I also questioned why all the bosses of this world are deranged amalgamations of humans with monikers that harken to our real world. So much of Metaphor remains a mystery, but I was quickly convinced that its world warrants a journey upwards of 80-plus hours. And one thing I was sure of was that it still has that badass edge expected from an Atlus RPG.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Metaphor brings the kind of flash and fashion you expect from Persona while blending in the harshness of a brutal medieval world.</p></div><p>Just like in Persona, each party member in Metaphor has an adrenaline-induced awakening that opens them up to supernatural powers, literally ripping their hearts out to transform into beastly figures. In battle, they transform into what are called Archetypes when casting spells or using certain types of attacks – they work more like RPG classes job system than they do than the Pokemon-like personas or demons from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-review">Shin Megami Tensei</a>. And instead of the Velvet Room or World of Shadows where you build a roster for combat, Metaphor has what’s called Akademia (which serves a similar purpose) where you assign and customize Archetypes for each party member.</p><p>When the preview demo fast-forwarded to much further into the story, the Archetype mechanics opened up significantly. Every character can unlock and spec into any of the 40-or-so Archetypes – a few of which include the spell-focused Mage, the swift trickster of Thief, the more balanced Seeker, and the tank-like Warrior. While I didn’t get to experience how deep it goes, I saw the various branches of Archetypes which also hinted at how they’ll evolve over the course of the game. Each of these come with their own stats that dictate combat roles, but also come with specific elemental affinities and spells, so party composition is still a fundamental part of Metaphor much in the same vein as a Persona or SMT.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Metaphor’s turn-based RPG combat leans heavier into SMT with the press-turn system where you earn extra actions for each turn phase, as opposed to Persona’s one-more and baton pass system. Although the naming conventions for certain elemental abilities have changed (light, dark, and buff spells have not, by the way), the flow is very familiar since you’re still targeting enemy weaknesses to get through battles effectively. A new wrinkle, however, is how you cast multi-target spells – in Metaphor, Synthesis attacks consume two turn icons and combine the elemental powers of two characters in order to execute devastating specials, including multi-target spells. It made me think more strategically about when I should use these kinds of abilities, but it’s also a clever rework since I no longer have to dedicate a character’s limited action slots to these spell types.</p><p>Another smart way Metaphor rethinks the formula is in how you initiate combat. There’s a real-time action element where you attack enemies in the dungeon to gain a turn advantage and damage foes before jumping into the turn-based battles. It’s a bit more involved than stealthy ambushes in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-5">Persona 5</a>, and instead of repeatedly churning through low-level enemies, you can reach a point where you just hack and slash through the fodder entirely. However, enemies fight back in the overworld so you have to approach them carefully and dodge their attacks, lest you yourself get ambushed and put at a severe disadvantage. While the action element isn’t intended to be in-depth and is more of a preface to the full battles, it improves pacing by having a more sensible flow between exploration and combat.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Metaphor’s lasting impact will be in how its political storytelling comes together.</p></div><p>When I jumped later into the story, I was able to explore the humble town of Martira and experience how the day-night cycle and calendar system work. Spending time to understand the cultures of the world and the different peoples who embody them to build bonds is a revamp of the Confidant/Social Link mechanics, and these feed into combat since they unlock new Archetypes and abilities. Taking part in certain activities boosts social stats to let you access new interactions or quests as well. There’s still a countdown of days until a major story event happens, requiring you to progress the main quest at the appropriate pace and make tough decisions about how you spend your limited time in each phase of the day – as is Persona tradition. But from a conceptual level, winning the hearts and minds of seemingly disparate peoples amid political turmoil while carrying out your own personal mission fits this gameplay framework incredibly well.</p><p>Time management isn’t just about how you spend parts of your day either. Going on expeditions for quests to far-off locations across the kingdom consumes multiple days, pushing you to plan ahead and think about what’s worth doing. During expeditions on your Gauntlet Runner (the ground-based ship that works like a mobile headquarters), you can access unique interactions with characters while in transit, so it’s not like you’re simply burning days off the calendar. I got to strengthen my bond with the former royal knight Hulkenberg better through her love for tabletop games, and I cooked with my guy Strohl to get know him better while making healing items. Sidequests themselves involve battling through curated dungeons and bosses, and also present supplementary story content you wouldn’t see from the main quest alone. Metaphor is said to be packed with so much side content that the development team claimed you won’t be able to complete it all in one playthrough.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Playing five hours of Metaphor ReFantazio proved what I’d been thinking for years since I fell in love with Persona – that the series foundation could reach new heights if used in a different context. And the context here is a violent political fantasy drama. The daily structure and social sim mechanics built around a turn-based RPG are so familiar but have been revamped in several small yet impactful ways, and it’s shaping up to be a brilliant, synergistic way of exploring an entirely new and fascinating fiction in the comfort of a framework I already know and love.</p><p>Aside from the bold new soundtrack from longtime Atlus composer Shoji Meguro (who’s now wielding classical orchestras and a Latin-style choir), Metaphor’s lasting impact will be in how its political storytelling comes together. A preview demo of a lengthy RPG isn’t going to reveal that, of course, but it’s showing promise with characters who make great first impressions, narrative themes that are clearly inspired by the problems we face in our real world, and a signature style full of powerful imagery. </p><p>I was also left with questions I’m eager to seek the answers to. There's this book that the protagonist is always carrying with him, and it contains a story of a utopia where everyone has happy and prosperous lives with images vaguely representing our reality. And the very first thing you do in Metaphor is name <em>yourself</em> before naming the protagonist. Given the crueIty displayed and the statements it makes early on, I can't stop thinking about what Metaphor will ultimately say about virtues and perils of the human condition. It won’t be long until we get those answers because Metaphor ReFantazio launches on October 11 this year for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and 5, and PC.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

But I know this style of battle isn’t for everyone. Plenty have skipped over the likes of Baldur’s Gate 3, Persona 5, and Marvel’s Midnight Suns because of the slower, more managerial-like pace of turn-based combat. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 wants to provide the solution to those issues. The upcoming RPG has plenty of smart ideas that aim to evolve turn-based battles, transforming them from baton-passing attack sequences to thrilling, skill-based conflicts. </p><p>I recently met with developer Sandfall Interactive to watch creative director Guillaume Broche play through just under an hour of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. While clearly inspired by Japanese RPG titans like Final Fantasy, Clair Obscur feels distinctly European. Rather than sporting outrageous anime hair and a sword larger than the Empire State Building, protagonist Gustave is a handsomely dressed gent with a face that could be almost mistaken for Robert Pattinson’s. During my demo, he and the equally elegant mage Lune explored the ocean floor-like Flying Waters region, picking through the remains of prior expeditions that had been scattered among the coral. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Gustave and Lune are the latest team attempting to defy the will of the Paintress, a god-like figure who kills scores of people each year by painting a number on a monolith. Anyone of that age instantly fades away, Infinity War style. The demo’s short hour duration didn’t allow for much insight into this story, but what was obvious was the dark and melancholic tone. It seems somewhat literary in a manner I found very appealing, rooted in its character's emotions and fears. </p><p>Gustave was soon reunited with his foster sister, Maelle, who’d been lost in a manor that lies beyond the boundaries of time and space. Together with Lune, the trio formed a full party, which brings us to those aforementioned evolutionary ideas for turn-based combat. Broche tells me that he was inspired by Sekiro’s parry system to implement skill-based elements into the genre’s traditional tactical framework. The result is quick time event-augmented turns, with reflex and timing-based actions required in both the attack and defend phases. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Clair Obscur’s action elements really impress: you can dodge, jump, or parry every incoming blow.</p></div><p>Clair Obscur isn’t the first turn-based RPG to use QTEs in combat, but it’s the first I’ve seen that seems to put equal emphasis on both the action and tactical aspects. Every attack demands some kind of input, be that reflex-testing button prompts or manually aiming a weapon at targets. More complex attacks chain together QTEs, providing a better sense of kinetic energy in each phase of the fight. </p><p>But it’s when your characters are on the defensive that Clair Obscur’s action elements really impress: you can dodge, jump, or parry every incoming blow, and perfect deflects trigger powerful counter-attacks. Gone are the days of just watching a boss unleash hell on your party – here you can actively avoid and punish damage. Broche tells me that you can even do a no-hit run of the entire game, right up to and including the final battle. </p><p>Alongside these pacier ideas are more traditional staples. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 uses a menu-driven interface that looks like Persona 5’s UI as translated by Dishonored. Each move requires a character to spend from their pool of action points, which gradually increases as the turns tick by (an idea inspired by card game mana systems). Parries refund one action point, so there’s an incentive to try and nail that parry window – the better you defend yourself, the better attacks you can unleash on the next turn. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Each character’s ability set is unique to them, which hopefully makes them feel like significant individuals both in and out of combat. Spearheading their kits are special skills with bespoke mechanics; Lune is able to ‘stain’ enemies with her spells and then later consume those stains to inflict big damage, while Maelle is able to switch through a variety of stat-altering stances depending on which attacks she uses. </p><p>Sandfall Interactive also promises a deep progression system for each party member. Each level attained allows you to upgrade each character’s stats Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style, as well as choose a new ability from a skill tree. On top of that are Pictos, trinkets that provide tactic-shifting passive skills (such as parries granting an extra action point), plus the unique properties of the weapons each party member wields. Broche tells me that combining and upgrading these elements in the right way can unlock wild and destructive synergies. I hope this character build system, combined with the developer-crafted ability kits, allows players to put together fascinating, tactics-driven parties akin to the way that card game players hone a deck to a particular strategy.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is almost like a next-gen Final Fantasy from an alternate timeline.</p></div><p>Due to the somewhat contextless nature of the demo, much of what I saw outside of combat was harder to judge. What I did take away was the sense that this is almost like a next-gen Final Fantasy from an alternate timeline; like Square’s JRPGs of old, Clair Obscur is not open world, opting instead for linear regions complete with save point-like resting spots. Sandfall promises these regions have been built to be expansive enough to allow off-the-beaten-path adventures, though, including optional bosses. At this stage, I can’t say how strong Clair Obscur’s exploration chops are, but what I saw ranged from the relatively mundane (shoot three symbols to unlock loot) to the ethereal (a child NPC peeling away into the ether like an ancient painting) to the genuinely funny (a sentient, French-speaking paintbrush called Noco, who will sell you his best wares provided you fight his gigantic boss form). </p><p>While I’ve yet to form any significant opinions on its wider gameplay ideas, I can say that I really liked what I saw of Clair Obscur’s world. It has concepts and characters I’m looking forward to delving into, strong voice acting, and a genuinely gorgeous graphical style. But the thing I’m really excited about is the smarts-skills-smarts loop the fights seem to thrive on. A cerebral moment of lining up a clever attack is followed by a speedy burst of rhythmic button taps, a perfectly-judged parry, and then it’s back to quietly contemplating exactly what attack will rupture your foe’s defences. Staunchly traditional turn-based fans may consider this up-and-down tempo a bit too jarring – tactical combat for the short-attention-span generation. But from my perspective at least, this is the fresh approach the system has needed for some time. I hope, when I finally get to play Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 myself, it proves itself to be a more involving turn-based experience as opposed to a system that simply makes concessions to the action-loving crowd.</p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The one other caveat is that the main character of the first Suikoden game can't hold both orbs at the same time. The more you know.</p><h2>What is Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster?</h2><p>The first Suikoden game released in Japan on the original PlayStation in 1995, with the sequel coming out in 1998 on the same platform. The games made it to the West a year after their Japanese release. Each game in the series focuses on having you recruit 108 warriors to fight by your side. So your job is to build up an army and fight the forces of evil.</p><p>Some remasters have completely overhauled graphics, which runs the risk of losing the charm of the original. That does not appear to be the case here. The original pixelated graphics are pretty intact, but now they fill modern wide-screen displays. They've also redone some of the spell effects to look better and more smooth, and redrawn the character portraits in HD.</p><p>In addition to the improved graphics, you now have the ability to speed up battles, or turn on an auto-battle mode. The game also has auto-save and a conversation log, in case you accidentally tap a button to progress the conversation before reading it (this happens to me all the time in RPGs). It also has a revamped UI, making things like changing equipment easier.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Suikoden I&amp;II Nintendo Direct August 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output></p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-is-up-for-preorder-out-september-6">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-physical-edition-of-alan-wake-2-is-officially-up-for-preorder-out-october-22">Alan Wake 2 (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Astro Bot Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Sid Meier's Civilization VII Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-release-date-preorder-bonus">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-preorder-guide">Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-anniversary-edition-switch-ps4">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-xbox-pc">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-switch-release-date-preorder">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-release-date-preorder">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-is-up-for-preorder">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/master-detective-archives-rain-code-plus-is-up-for-preorder">Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-collectors-edition">Metaphor: ReFantazio Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-special-editions">Star Wars Outlaws Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster">Suikoden 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-release-date-preorder">Super Mario Party Jamboree Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

The game’s charm and creativity made it an instant classic, and the remaster promises to bring the beloved game to a new generation of gamers with enhanced high-definition graphics, updated modern control mechanics, and a nostalgic, fun, and authentic gameplay experience that will be sure to ignite the imagination of players and remind them why they fell in love with video games in the first place.</p><p>Additionally, retro-gaming fans will be excited to learn that the remaster includes the Crocipedia, an extensive and meticulously curated digital museum containing long-lost development assets such as game design documents, concept art, animation tests, team member interviews, and much more.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_909909"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
