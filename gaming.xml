            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Mario’s modern-day voice actor, Kevin Afghani, debunks a rumor about his involvement with Nintendo before taking on the role of voicing several iconic Nintendo characters. He’s also discussing what it means to him to carry on the legacy of Mario, Luigi, and others.</p>



<p>Kevin Afghani began voicing Mario and Luigi with the 2023 release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder on the Nintendo Switch. He also voices the nefarious Wario. He replaced the retired Charles Martinet, the legendary voice actor who had voiced the characters for decades. However, he recently stated that, despite an online narrative, he had never worked for Nintendo before 2023. Specifically, he denied ever narrating the Nintendo Direct presentations.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’ll give you one. I was never in Nintendo Direct,” he told <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/14/nintendo-new-mario-kevin-afghani-video-games/88185428007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">USA Today</a>. There’s this weird narrative online I was in Nintendo Directs, I narrated Nintendo Directs. I never worked for Nintendo before being Mario.”</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-kevin-afghani-has-nothing-but-respect-for-the-og-mario-charles-martinet">Kevin Afghani Has Nothing But Respect For The OG Mario, Charles Martinet</h2>



<p>Discussing his fandom that led him to this dream role, he says he’s living his dream, but he has nothing but respect for the man who came before him, and in his mind, Charles Martinet is Mario.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Look, Charles, as far as I’m concerned, IS Mario. He created something that is so unbelievably iconic. And he did it so masterfully. If I wasn’t nervous, then I’m the wrong guy,” he said. “I’m the second guy who’s doing Mario. Charles is THE guy. There is such an unbelievable respect for Charles. He is amazing.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Kevin Afghani will be back in the roles of Mario, Luigi, and Wario in the upcoming Mario Tennis Fever game, set to release in February 2026 on the Nintendo Switch 2.

<p>Ubisoft says its recent upload of the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag soundtrack to Ubisoft Music’s YouTube account was due to technical issues with some of its videos.</p>



<p>On January 14, 2026, the Ubisoft music account on YouTube uploaded 18 songs from the Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag soundtrack. Naturally, the move excited fans and sparked speculation that the game developer may be preparing to announce the much-anticipated remake of the 2013 game, dubbed Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag Resynced.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has now commented on the uploads, stating in <a href="https://t.co/WYPZTZZtZW">a community post on their music YouTube channel</a> that the songs were re-uploaded due to technical issues with some of their prior videos.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hi there music lovers! We encountered some technical issues with a few of our videos, which we had to reupload. Apologies for the trouble, and hope you enjoy the music.</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-where-things-stand-with-ubisoft-s-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake">Where Things Stand With Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake</h2>



<p>In January 2024, it was first reported that a remake of the game was in development. Insider Gaming later confirmed that the Remake, codenamed Obsidian, was on track to be released before April of this year. Sources familiar with the situation originally said that marketing for the release was scheduled to begin this month, with the release set for March. Learn more about where things stand with the forthcoming remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-leaks-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">at this link.</a></p>

Here's a quick rundown of the five big takeaways from the showcase today:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/resident-evil-showcase-january-15-2026-6-28-screenshot-1768516637347.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Resident Evil: Requiem's Difficulty Settings</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil: Requiem will have at least three different difficulty settings, and one in particular seems pretty cool. There's a Casual mode for those who just want to focus on the story, and it comes with an aim assist. And there's a Standard mode, which is just what it sounds like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the really neat one is Standard (Classic) difficulty, which is the Standard difficulty but with an added challenge, where Grace will need to collect ink ribbons for typewriters in order to save her game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/resident-evil-showcase-january-15-2026-5-38-screenshot-1768516607693.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Bloody It Up</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A new game mechanic was revealed today related to the crafting system. In RE: Requiem, a number of items are only craftable using infected blood, which is obtained by killing zombies. Though Grace isn't much of a fighter, she does have a gun on her (appropriately called Requiem) that she uses to get out of tight jams, and she'll need to use it to take down zombies so she can get their blood and craft more useful survival tools.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/resident-evil-showcase-january-15-2026-8-30-screenshot-1768516563208.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">There's a Lot of Stuff You Can Buy, If You Want</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A surprising amount of today's showcase was dedicated to stuff you can buy in real-life that ties in with the game. There's a watch collaboration with Hamilton for two different watches, one for Grace and one for Leon, that they'll wear in-game, and only 2,000 of each watch are being made for sale. There's the amiibo, which we already knew about, and a special Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller themed around Requiem. There are special Resident Evil orchestra concerts coming, and obviously, the Deluxe Edition of the game and all its bonus content. And Capcom is releasing figurines of both Grace and Leon. If you're interested in buying any of that stuff, it's all easy enough to find, but this section of the video really did feel a bit shopping channel given the circumstances.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">These Zombies Are...Different</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There's something different about the zombies in Resident Evil: Requiem. Rather than just violent and lurching, some of them seem to have other personality traits, and have carried over characteristics from their lives before. For instance, one custodian zombie continues to clean the building even after being turned. There's another man frantically pushing elevator buttons. And at the end of the trailer, there's one that straight up talks to Grace. Like, seems to be holding a normal, smooth, human conversation. What's going on here? Is this a different virus than the usual one? Mysteries!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/resident-evil-showcase-january-15-2026-14-29-screenshot-1768516505500.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Elpis</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">What? Pipis? No, you said Elpis? Okay, sure. At the end of the showcase, there was a mention of some sort of "secret" Leon is carrying, referencing something called "elpis." We have...no idea what that is! We know now that it's potentially related to the murder of Grace's mother, Alyssa, and we can maybe guess that it's connected in some way to that zombie bite mark fans keep seeing on Leon in trailers. But this is another mystery that will need further investigation. Or, as Leon S. Kennedy put it in the trailer, a second opinion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil: Requiem is coming to Xbox, PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch 2 on February 27, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Capcom's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-showcase-coming-thursday-includes-brand-new-requiem-footage/1100-6537372/" data-ref-id="1100-6537372">Resident Evil Requiem Showcase</a> didn't reveal much about the story, but it did go into detail about how the game will change depending upon which character you're playing, and the title will also introduce new difficulty settings to the franchise. The new heroine, Grace Ashcroft, will represent a more classic, horror-focused approach to gameplay, similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-2/" data-ref-id="5000-448874">Resident Evil 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-6/" data-ref-id="5000-82753">6</a>. But when players are in control of Leon S. Kennedy, the tone of the game will shift to a more action-oriented style like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/" data-ref-id="5000-565525">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p><p>It doesn't sound like players will get to choose which character they will control, since certain parts of the story are meant for one or the other. Although Grace is physically weaker than Leon, she will have some abilities to make up for that. She will be able to craft weapons using the blood of the infected. And when Grace needs to shoot her way out of trouble, she'll have a powerful gun called Requiem to fall back on. To keep players from relying only on Requiem, the ammo will be limited.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Resident Evil Requiem - 3rd Trailer (With Leon)</p>
      </div>
<p>RE Requiem is also introducing some new difficulty settings. The easiest mode is Casual, which lets players concentrate on the story and gives them an aim assist. Standard difficulty is a little harder, while Standard (Classic) won't let players save their games without finding a limited number of ink ribbons to use. That's a throwback to the save system in the older games in the franchise.</p><p>Another departure from the series' norms are more human-like zombies. Some of these poor lost creatures find themselves still working their dead-end jobs even after their death simply because their bodies remember how to do them. Players can sneak past some of these zombies or closely observe their actions for clues about how to proceed.</p><p>At least one of the infected zombies seen in the showcase was human enough to converse with Grace. It's unclear if that's simply a random zombie or a more important character to the narrative.</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 27.</p>

<p>Launching alongside the game on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>, the two models are featured in the game itself and are (conveniently) worn by both protagonists: Grace Ashcroft and Leon Kennedy. They also cost enough to make RE4's merchant break out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>The models in question are:</p>
<ul>
<li>American Classic Pan Europ - £1,170</li>
<li>Khaki Field Auto Chrono - £1,800</li>
</ul>
<p>You can sign up for more information over on the official <a href="https://www.hamiltonwatch.com/en-gb/resident-evil-requiem">Hamilton website</a> right now. Regardless of price, these things will likely disappear pretty quickly, so if you're genuinely interested, then definitely head on over there ASAP.</p>

It'll launch day one on Switch 2 alongside both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard Gold Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil Village Gold Edition</a>.</p>

            <guid>1407718</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-showcase-to-air-this-thursday/">Resident Evil Showcase</a></strong>, which was announced earlier this week by <strong>Capcom</strong>, delivered on its promise to show off more information on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></strong>, with the game's director, <strong>Koshi Nakanishi</strong>, taking players through the different gameplay styles players will experience with between playing as <strong>Grace</strong> and <strong>Leon</strong>.</p>



<p>The showcase did not, however, live up to fans' speculation, as people believed the mention of "<em>games</em>," as in more than one game, being shown amounted to nothing more than references to <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-with-new-trailer/"><strong>Resident Evil VII</strong> and <strong>Resident Evil Village</strong> making their way to Nintendo Switch 2</a>. The showcase did not include, as players hoped, the reveal of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ports-of-every-re-engine-game-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/"><strong>Resident Evil 2 </strong>and <strong>Resident Evil 4</strong> remakes</a>, making the jump to Nintendo's latest console.</p>



<p>Back to what it did include, Nakanishi began by addressing the fact that, after months of rumours, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hes-really-here-leon-finally-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-with-a-playstation-store-leak/">we now know that <strong>Leon Kennedy</strong> is in Resident Evil Requiem</a> as the second playable character alongside Grace. "<em>So, I never said he wasn't going to show up</em>," Nakanishi said before breaking out into a short laugh. "<em>Seriously, I didn't say that at all</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Resident Evil Showcase | January 15, 2026" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i9HIc7GZLa0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Nakanishi then went on to explain <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-grace-ashcroft-series-most-fearful-character-leon-kennedy-series-strongest/">what we've heard before since Leon was confirmed for the game</a>. Capcom wasn't confident it could deliver a horror game centred entirely around Leon, because players don't know him as a character who gets frightened. </p>



<p>Grace is therefore the balance and contrast between Leon, as the more timid, fearful character, whose gameplay stays closer to that of Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil VII, while Leon is the action-forward character we know and love, with his gameplay more akin to Resident Evil 4.</p>



<p>"<em>In this title, it's like you're playing completely different games with Grace and Leon,"</em> Nakanishi says. "<em>Grace's parts are more similar to Resident Evil 2 and 7. Really entrenched in the horror aspects of the gameplay. Whereas Leon's part is closer to the thrilling tension featured in Resident Evil 4. Full-on action that doesn't focus as much on the horror aspect. It may be a survival horror game, but I think we've made an experience that suits Leon."</em></p>



<p>"<em>By combining Grace's horror and Leon's action and allowing you to play them side-by-side, we created an experience with an emotional range unlike any other Resident Evil title to date."</em></p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>Nakanishi continued, "<em>The gap between tension and release is one of the things that makes Resident Evil so interesting.</em> <em>However, getting to experience the terrifying and atmospheric sections of Grace's gameplay, then switching to the dynamic, high-action Leon gameplay, offers a huge sense of catharsis. In a broad sense, each part is ordered to offer the ultimate balance of tension and release</em>."</p>



<p>Beyond divulging more about the gameplay ethos of Resident Evil Requiem, Nakanishi offered a couple of story-related hints to better place where Requiem takes place in the timeline, but didn't offer anything particularly revealing. He did, however, put special emphasis on Elpis, which clearly seems to be key to the story.</p>



<p>We also got a look at some updates to the game's crafting system and some of the changes to the zombies, like how zombies will now retain some of the characteristics from their lives. An example shown was the building's custodian continuing to clean, even while undead.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>As for the crafting changes, while Leon is able to clear a path in front of him with an array of weapons and deadly roundhouse kicks (he can even pick up an enemy's weapon and use it against them), Grace has to stealth her way through situations and find other means of dispatching zombies.</p>



<p>That's where the new crafting comes in. If you do manage to take down a zombie as Grace, you can use a sample of their blood to create Specialized Injectors that you can jam into a zombie. In the example shown in the trailer, one such concoction makes the zombie explode.</p>



<p>The showcase also showed off some of the differences between playing on its easiest difficulty versus standard, before getting into two collaborations Capcom has done for the game. One with Porsche, to design a car for Leon to drive in-game that's also been made into a real vehicle. </p>



<p>The other is with the watchmakers at Hamilton, which will sell two watches, one for Grace and one for Leon, inspired by their characters in the game. Both watches will be available in a limited supply, with only 1,000 of each being made, and they'll be available to buy the same day the game comes out on <strong>February 27, 2026.</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Capcom also confirmed that Resident Evil Requiem will be available on <strong>GeForce NOW</strong> when it arrives next month, so you can expect it to pop up in an upcoming GeForce NOW Thursday blast. Requiem will also support NVIDIA's DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation.</p>



<p>Lastly, the showcase ended by running through some of the bonuses you'll get by pre-ordering and purchasing the deluxe edition of the game instead of the standard, like additional costumes for Grace and Leon, one of which makes Grace look like Lady Dimitrescu from Resident Evil Village.</p>



<p>There are also new figures of both Leon and Grace being made that will be released sometime in Fall 2026. Capcom also has a Requiem-themed Switch 2 controller coming, and some Requiem Amiibo, though we unfortunately didn't get a look at the latter. The showcase also revealed a concert series, Resident Evil: Symphony of Legacy, that will feature performances across Japan, North America, and Europe.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#950)—Clues and Answers for Friday, January 16]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-16-950/</link>
            <guid>1407706</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Friday – you made it! As another week ends, hopefully your NYT Connections streak <strong>doesn’t</strong>. If I can help you out today, I’ll consider my day a success, and to facilitate that, I’ll direct you to the clues and solutions below. To answer today’s NYT Connections challenge, simply scroll down and tick those boxes.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-16">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 16)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #950:</p>



<ul>
<li>PANAMA</li>



<li>ALABAMA</li>



<li>BATH</li>



<li>BAHAMA</li>



<li>SANTANA</li>



<li>BANANARAMA</li>



<li>SLAM</li>



<li>PAJAMAS</li>



<li>PIANO</li>



<li>PORKPIE</li>



<li>BRUSHNG</li>



<li>KANSAS</li>



<li>DERBY</li>



<li>STORY</li>



<li>CANYON</li>



<li>FEDORA</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think classic headwear you might see at a horse race, a jazz club, or on a 1920s gangster.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Picture the checklist a parent runs through before lights out.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are all band names where <em>every</em> vowel sound is the same.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word can follow the same adjective to form a familiar phrase.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 16:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-16-950">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 16 (#950)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– DERBY, FEDORA, PANAMA, PORKPIE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BATH, BRUSHING, PAJAMAS, STORY</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – ALABAMA, BANANARAMA, KANSAS, SANTANA</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BAHAMA, CANYON, PIANO, SLAM</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders’ Confusing New Skin Makes Sense, It Seems]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-skin-makes-sense/</link>
            <guid>1407703</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, Embark Studios unveiled the ‘Abyss’ skin bundle in ARC Raiders, introducing an outfit that fans had been waiting for since the game came out. It featured a unique, armored skin that was shown in earlier marketing materials, and the company dubbed it ‘highly anticipated’ when it dropped.</p>



<p>However, the <strong>lower portion </strong>of the skin had fans disappointed. It featured what many described as ‘leg corsets’, and the memes and AI rewrites flowed within minutes of the bundle being revealed. As it turns out, the Abyss outfit is pretty damn accurate.</p>







<h2 id="h-abyss-skin-is-an-old-fashioned-anti-g-suit">Abyss Skin is an Old-Fashioned Anti-G Suit</h2>



<p>The Abyss bundle was added to the ARC Raiders store for a premium price recently, rewarding those who’d waited an age (read: a couple of months) to get their hands on it. It’s a unique outfit that includes a bizarre, otherworldly helmet, a mess of tubing, pouches, and small machines, and of course, the <strong>leg corsets</strong>.</p>



<p>Each leg is adorned with a tightly-laced wrap, open at the knees to allow for a range of movement, and admittedly, it looks pretty ridiculous.</p>



<p>But a little internet sleuthing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARC_Raiders/comments/1qd1jis/just_gonna_leave_this_here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by eagle-eyed fans</a> has uncovered a fact about the Abyss outfit.</p>



<p>It’s actually accurate, and it’s based on an old-fashion ‘anti-g’ suit, worn by pilots to ensure high levels of compression along the legs when sitting and flying for long periods of time. It would ensure optimum blood flow to the brain and prevent pooling in the legs. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The running theory is that the suit applies to those raiders leaving Speranza in their high-speed capsules, rocketing along rails at breakneck speed. That doesn’t necessarily make sense, given the fundamental purpose of the ‘anti-g’ suit.</p>



<p>That’s the topic resolved, then. It might look silly, but no, the ARC Raiders Abyss skin <strong>is not </strong>some kind of gimp suit or skewed, sexy lingerie. It’s a legitimate, retro-futuristic element based on something that genuinely existed – and in some ways, continues to exist today.</p>



<p>Case closed.</p>

As revealed previously, both protagonists will be playable in first-person perspective for deeper immersion, and third-person perspective for more dynamic action, swappable at any point during the game.</p><ul><li><strong>Leon Kennedy</strong> – Leon, experienced in both hand-to-hand combat and firearms, is investigating a series of suspicious deaths. While navigating this deadly situation, he’s able to wield a variety of weapons and execute close-quarters combat maneuvers with the all-new hatchet. Perfect Leon’s skills as you time your moves to parry enemy attacks, turn the tables as you attack with a chainsaw seized from an enemy, and pull off exhilarating finishing moves to deliver the final blow.</li><li><strong>Grace Ashcroft</strong> – Grace begins her survival journey in a sanatorium overrun with zombies, requiring fierce judgement when deciding which enemies to fight and which to avoid. Limited resources and carrying capacity force the player to make critical decisions that can mean life or death. Acquiring a special device allows Grace to craft vital items using infected blood, unlocking the opportunity to diversify your attack strategies.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Resident Evil Requiem comes out next month, and fans have been frothing at the mouth for more news about it, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/leon-kennedy-takes-the-stage-in-resident-evil-requiem" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cc2d9a57-fdac-435d-a254-c1664b22eeab" data-entity-substitution="canonical">especially since seeing the Game Awards trailer that confirmed Leon's playability</a>. Today's Resident Evil Showcase gave us exactly that, with director Koshi Nakanishi breaking down the gameplay styles of both protagonists, Leon and Grace, amidst other tidbits of information about the game.</p><p>Capcom wanted to bring Leon back into the main series, especially after the success of the Resident Evil 4 Remake, but Leon's inherent combat skills and action hero vibe make him ill-suited for a full-on horror game. Grace Ashcroft is the solution to that, as her relative lack of experience makes her much more vulnerable and afraid of her encounters with zombies. Her sections play more like Resident Evil 2 or 7, Nakanishi says, while Leon's gameplay is very reminiscent of the remake of 4.</p>

<p>For example, Leon can parry again, but instead of his trusty combat knife, he now has a hatchet. Mechanically, it looks identical, and can be sharpened to maintain its durability. Leon can also take weapons from fallen foes – the showcase shows him parrying a massive chainsaw, shooting its wielder, and then grabbing it for himself. The footage also gives extra focus to how shooting specific body parts can be strategically helpful, like blasting out a zombie's kneecaps to stun them for a hatchet swing.</p><p>Meanwhile, Grace has much slower gameplay. We see her explore some kind of mansion, and while she has a weapon, ammo is much more scarce, so combat is worth avoiding if possible. That weapon, a large caliber assault revolver, is called "Requiem", which explains the game's title. Grace also shows off a new crafting system that requires zombie blood, so while fighting is especially deadly, the rewards might be worth it. One concoction is later injected into a zombie's neck, causing it to explode in a splatter of blood. Gross!</p><p>After showing some gameplay, the showcase moves on to remind players that either Grace or Leon's journeys can be played in first- or third-person, though footage typically shows Grace's camera perspective as the former and Leon's as the latter. There will also be a Casual difficulty option, which includes heavy aim assist, and a Classic option, which requires the player to find ink ribbons to save the game while playing as Grace.</p><p>The back half of the showcase is less gameplay-focused, explaining the game's collaboration with Porsche and watchmaker Hamilton, giving slightly more details about the deluxe edition, detailing the game's compatibility with GeForce NOW, announcing an upcoming worldwide concert series, and showing off some figurines of the protagonists.

Not only that, but we've also received official confirmation that zombies are back. But they're slightly different this time...</p>
<p>The zombies here are not completely mindless, but rather retain some of the attributes of their personalities when they were alive. This means you'll see zombies attempting to complete tasks like cleaning the environment, albeit in a completely deranged manner.</p><div><figure data-videoid="L6F_QBKeXfU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytL6F_QBKeXfU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4033abrtqiyz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The showcase explains that careful observation of your enemies will allow you to either sneak around them or get the drop on them. If you're playing as Leon, you'll be able to parry attacks with a hatchet and execute brutal finishing moves while also picking up weapons dropped by the zombies. And yes, this includes a chainsaw. Grace's gameplay, meanwhile, is more akin to classic survival horror, placing emphasis on limited ammo.</p>
<p>Crafting also makes a return, and you'll actually need to extract blood from your fallen enemies to create specialised injectors. The description for one of these says "Prevents corpses from mutating", so it seems reasonable to assume that we might see some enemies similar to the Crimson Heads from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> remake.</p>
<p>The showcase also revealed three default difficulty levels for Requiem. Casual will add in auto-aiming to allow newcomers to ease into the experience, while Standard comes in both Modern and Classic forms. The latter brings back the Ink Ribbon items during Grace's gameplay, meaning your ability to save is finite. It's likely that a more difficult 'Hardcore' option will be available upon completion of the main game, but this wasn't mentioned.</p>
<p>It was also reiterated that you can change between first and third-person perspectives at any time during gameplay. Meanwhile, a Requiem Pro Controller will launch for the Switch 2 alongside the game next month, while amiibo will also arrive later in the year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE">Hardware Unboxed</a> reported that Asus is winding down production of its RTX 5070 Ti, saying, Asus “explicitly told us this model is currently facing a supply shortage and, as such, they have placed the model into end-of-life status.” They added that the same applies to Asus’s 16GB RTX 5060 Ti, and mentioned how retailers in Australia have had trouble sourcing the product.</p><p>Nvidia’s director of global public relations for GeForce, Ben Berraondo, confirmed in a statement to <em>The Verge</em> that it’s still producing these GPUs: “Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained. We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability.”</p><p>Hardware Unboxed specified <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxjULwwm0m16AH8zznJZ34D2OVVGWEl3Ub">in a follow-up post</a> that this only applies to Asus, and added, “Whether or not AIBs actually receive enough supply to justify continued production is another question. Asus don’t seem to think so.” Asus did not immediately respond to a request for comment from <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>This may not be the case for all manufacturers. For instance, PNY public relations representative Michael Farino confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that the Dual-Slot Slim (DSS) RTX 5070 Ti, <a href="https://www.pny.com/company/press-center/pny-press-releases/pny-announces-new-dual-slot-slim-models-for-nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series">which was just announced at CES</a>, is still on track to “start shipping [in] February, and will be at all the usual retail suspects,” including Best Buy, Micro Center, and Amazon.</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s not surprising to see constraints hitting the more affordable versions of 50-series GPUs first. Christopher Moore, Micron’s VP of marketing, mobile and client business unit, <a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">said to <em>Wccftech</em></a> last week that “What we’re doing now is trying to run as few pieces of silicon as possible to max out, few differentiated DIDs as possible to max out the output… We’re saying, you know, I know you used to wanna go from 12 gigabyte to 16 gigabyte, or 16 gigabyte to 24 gigabyte. Those changes actually drop our output. So we’re working with them to try and get our demand as steady as possible so that we can get our supply as steady as possible and maximize the output.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/863000/asus-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-5060-ti-supply-rumors]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lenny-kravitz-talks-inspiration-for-007-first-light-character/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Lenny Kravitz has commented on the inspiration for his character in 007: First Light and has given some insight into the recording process.</p>



<p>In December 2025, IO Interactive confirmed that Lenny Kravitz would voice one of the game’s main villains, an exclusive character named Bawma. The Grammy award-winning artist is now providing some insight into his inspiration for the role and the process of recording lines for the character.</p>







<h2 id="h-lenny-kravitz-pulls-the-curtain-back-on-bawma">Lenny Kravitz Pulls The Curtain Back On Bawma</h2>



<p><a href="https://youtu.be/8M3Xc-RBv-I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">During an interview with IGN,</a> Kravitz explained that some of the inspiration for the character came from some of the people he grew up around.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I grew up in the Bahamas as well as New York City. There were guys that had that vibe and that were doing things in the islands that I’d known, so I had a little bit of reference,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also revealed that he did not have the opportunity to record lines alongside the rest of the cast. Instead, he just had the direction from those leading the project.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I hadn’t seen any other footage or heard any other voice-overs. So it was really sort of just in the dark, you know? They know, thus the director knowing kind of what he wants, because they know the balance, they know what all the other people are doing. I didn’t get to hear that.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Players will have to wait a little longer for 007: First Light, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-delay-may-2026/">which was recently delayed to May this year from the original March release date.</a> Learn more about that here.

            <guid>1407673</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>On Jan. 7, I received an email from a Royal Caribbean International communications person asking for a correction to a story. The request said that I had used an image of Royal Caribbean's Liberty of the Seas cruiseliner in a story about a death on the Carnival Horizon ship, and asked if I could replace the image given that Royal Caribbean wasn't involved. A fair ask, for sure, but not something I could help with: The story was one I didn’t write, on a website I don’t write for.</p><p>When I clicked the link included in the email, I was surprised to see the byline was indeed Nicole Carpenter. The story appeared on MSN, Microsoft’s news aggregator, but was connected with the Tri City Herald, a McClatchy publication. There was no link to see what else Nicole Carpenter had written, nor was there a contact email attached. Just a note at the bottom: "This story was reported by content partner Modern Newsstand LLC."</p><p>I am somewhat familiar with the other Nicole Carpenters of the world. I've looked at the various online profiles that come up when I've Googled myself. Besides Nicole Carpenter the reporter who covers the video game industry (me), there's Nicole Carpenter the actor, Nicole Carpenter the women's leadership advocate, Nicole Carpenter the realtor, Nicole Carpenter the beach volleyball player, Nicole Carpenter the pest control expert. It's typically me and Nicole Carpenter the actor who take up the majority of the space on Google's first page of results, at least when I search.&nbsp;</p><p>I was intrigued to learn that there was another Nicole Carpenter the journalist. But after spending the last week or so looking for her, I'm not sure whether Nicole Carpenter the other journalist is even real.&nbsp;</p><p>Modern Newsstand has no online presence, but a company of the same name is registered as an LLC in Delaware and was incorporated in 2024. I reached out to Justin Levine, who lists himself as the CEO of Modern Newsstand on LinkedIn, to tell him that I'd been contacted by a confused communications person. He responded in a LinkedIn message: "Yes, this has come to our attention. Given your success and prominence in the industry, we have advised our writer to update her byline, bio and contact info for greater distinction. We will either use a middle name or make further adjustments." I asked him to confirm that she's a real person, and he hasn't responded.</p><p>But in the days after I reached out to Levine and then to McClatchy's communications person, rather than update Nicole Carpenter’s byline, all of her stories were removed from MSN. The pages now read, "This story is unavailable," and not only has Nicole Carpenter not posted a news story since, but it seems like Modern Newsstand has stopped posting on MSN as well. I don't know if stories being removed is common with MSN-syndicated stories, because I've found other links that don't work. Some of Nicole Carpenter's stories remain on another syndication service, NewsBreak, and they're all the same as what <em>was</em> on MSN. I've reached out to Microsoft, which owns MSN, and they haven't responded.&nbsp;</p><p>While Nicole Carpenter’s MSN-syndicated stories are connected to the Tri City Herald and other McClatchy publications, none of them appear on the actual Tri City Herald website, nor does her byline show up there. I reached out to McClatchy on Jan. 7, after the Royal Caribbean communications person emailed me. On Jan. 15, I got a response from McClatchy chief revenue officer Tony Berg. Berg didn't have much information about the Modern Newsstand operation, but he confirmed that McClatchy had a deal with the company to post content, tied to its brands, to syndication platforms like MSN and NewsBreak, and that McClatchy gets paid per views on those syndication platforms. He said that McClatchy had no control over the stories. (Previously a McClatchy spokesperson, in an email acquired by Aftermath, had said the stories were "produced by Modern Newsstand but reviewed by McClatchy editors.")&nbsp;</p><p>Berg also told me that in the past week or so McClatchy had stopped working with Modern Newsstand and that it's no longer a vendor of the media company. "We have no tolerance for people that are not following policies of what our vendor agreements are, and in this case, that was not being done," Berg told me.&nbsp;</p><p>Berg didn’t say what policies Modern Newsstand didn’t adhere to. And I’m not sure whether McClatchy learned of the issue through my email or had concerns previously. I asked Berg if Modern Newsstand used artificial intelligence to write the stories, and he said he didn’t know and said I'd have to ask Modern Newsstand. Berg said McClatchy didn't remove the stories from MSN, because the company has no control over the stuff that's published there.</p><p>There seems to be a small stable of bylines under Modern Newsstand, and the majority of them have the names of other verifiable journalists. I haven’t been able to find a profile or portfolio using any of those names that list Modern Newsstand, and I didn’t receive a reply from any of the verifiable journalists who shared names with Modern Newsstand writers who I reached out to. At the same time, many of the Modern Newsstand names are ones that are at least somewhat common, making it hard to tell whether this overlap is intentional. Many Modern Newsstand stories are still available on MSN; it's largely the Nicole Carpenter ones that have gone entirely missing. No new stories were published this week, however, which makes sense, since McClatchy cut ties.&nbsp;</p><p>The stories that Nicole Carpenter and the other Modern Newsstand journalists wrote are largely about national politics. They're very short, and always based on another publication's work with no backlinks to the source. They make heavy use of quotes, which sometimes comprise the majority of the story. They're not particularly well-written or interesting, though some of them get a ton of comments on MSN and NewsBreak. I haven't noticed any egregious errors, but I did find a user on Bluesky who had reached out to McClatchy after claiming to spot an error in a Modern Newsstand story that described Kamala Harris as the president, which they thought was weird, and possibly an AI mistake. (That story is no longer available to read.) They’re not the sort of stories I'd expect to see on reputable, local newspapers and publications.</p><p>I don't know a lot about what's going on here, but I do know that these are not stories I want associated with my byline. On MuckRack, which is a website that automatically makes portfolio pages for journalists, MSN is listed under my "As seen in" section, which might cause someone to think I wrote those stories. However, some of my actual stories have also been syndicated on MSN, through Polygon.&nbsp;</p><p>At best, this is all a very weird misunderstanding, and there's simply another journalist named Nicole Carpenter who has no online presence whatsoever, and works for a very mysterious content provider. At worst, Modern Newsstand is using the names of verifiable journalists to make its work look trustworthy. Somewhere in the middle, Modern Newsstand chose random pseudonyms to publish some of its stories under, one of which happened to be the same name as mine. And if, for some reason, Modern Newsstand chose to use my name, why? I don't cover national politics, unless they relate, somehow, to the video game industry. I'm not particularly well-known outside of my own beat. It doesn't make sense. (Nicole Carpenter the other journalist, if you are real and reading this, I'm sorry I said your work isn't particularly well-written.)</p><p>While I still can’t say for sure what’s going on here, the whole strange situation feels like it highlights the ways it’s harder than ever to know what news sources to trust. And while there’s no indication that Modern Newsstand’s stories are created by AI, I definitely wondered. McClatchy itself has <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/12/23/80385841/the-mcclatchy-news-group-is-pushing-ai-their-union-is-pushing-back?ref=aftermath.site"><u>been accused of using artificial intelligence</u></a> to create curated listicles summarizing McClatchy stories, which its union is pushing back on. Earlier this month, the day I got the correction request, media publication <a href="https://www.status.news/p/mcclatchy-newspapers-ai-reporting-policy?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Status reported</u></a> on a meeting with McClatchy leadership and the union in which the company "blindsided" the journalists with "the company's desire to aggressively integrate artificial intelligence into its workflow."&nbsp;</p><p>I still have a lot of questions, so if you know anything more about Modern Newsstand, please reach out. It’s hard not to look at this whole situation and just long for a human journalist, with a byline and photo, writing an article at a real outlet. It's a bad time out there for real journalists.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>GDC Awards</strong>, similar to the<a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/"> <strong>DICE Awards</strong></a>, are an awards show voted on entirely by game developers and industry professionals. Also similar to the DICE Awards, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">every other major</a> video game-related <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">awards show for that matter</a>, is the fact that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></strong> leads the pack with the most nominations, including a nomination for <strong>Game of the Year</strong>.</p>



<p>In fact, Clair Obscur is nominated in almost every single category included in the GDC Awards. To be fair, it's not a grand list of 20+ categories; there are only <strong>nine</strong> categories included in the GDC Awards. That said, Clair Obscur has been nominated in eight of those nine categories, which is still impressive, and a sign of just how much respect and adoration people inside the industry have for the game.</p>



<p>Out of the nine categories, the only nomination Clair Obscur is missing is a nod in the Social Impact category. As for other games that got multiple nominations, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">Ghost of Yōtei</a></strong> runs just behind Clair Obscur with five nominations, while <strong>Blue Prince</strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/">Split Fiction</a></strong> all have four nominations. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></strong> and <strong>Dispatch</strong> both walked away with three nominations.</p>



<p>What is different about the GDC Awards compared to other shows is that it lists Honourable Mentions for each category alongside the nominees. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">ARC Raiders</a></strong> didn't receive a single nomination, but it did get three honourable mentions. </p>



<p>The GDC Awards will take place on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> and will be the day after the IGF Awards, unlike previous years, where both shows would take place on the same day during GDC.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of nominees, and the honourable mentions for each category:</p>

              <p>Almost five years after <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> brought the game to PlayStation 5, that version of the game is getting a free new update that will add a new “streamlined” mode to the game for people who just want to enjoy the story. This patch will arrive on January 22, just in time for the RPG’s launch on <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-switch-2-remake-framerate-final-fantasy-2000622094">Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p> <p>“To celebrate <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> launch day on Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; Xbox, a patch for the PS5 and PC versions will launch next Thursday,” Square Enix announced on January 15. “This introduces Streamlined Progression, including the ability to keep HP and MP topped up, and always hit for 9,999 damage!” Now every attack can be an Omnislash and you won’t even have to spend over 500 hours <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-player-hits-level-99-in-the-first-rea-1794171766">grinding at the first reactor to make it happen</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">To celebrate Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launch day on Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; Xbox, a patch for the PS5 and PC versions will launch next Thursday.</p> <p>This introduces Streamlined Progression, including the ability to keep HP and MP topped up, and always hit for 9,999 damage! <a href="https://t.co/XMuEdhreTP">pic.twitter.com/XMuEdhreTP</a></p> <p>— FINAL FANTASY VII (@finalfantasyvii) <a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/2011740264772305213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The previously teased Streamlined Progression mode is effectively a story mode for people who want to follow Cloud and his Avalanche pals in their journey through Midgar to topple Shinra without having to deal with all of the difficulty that might come from combat, and especially certain boss encounters. Instead of toggling the game to easy, players can make it so their characters are already maxed out and hitting for the most damage possible.</p>

 <p>While included at launch in the new ports, the patch will let existing players on PC and PS5 play around with the mode as well. Could it be an easy way to clear the game on hard for the Platinum trophy? Maybe! And for newcomers it’s worth noting that anyone who buys the game digitally before the end of the month will automatically get the digital version of the original <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> along with it.</p>

                <p>We're called GameSpot, so we clearly love to play some video games. You're reading stories on this site called GameSpot, so it's safe to assume that you love to play some video games, too. However, we all need to be careful with how long we play video games because a new study suggests that logging too many hours could seriously hurt our physical, emotional, and mental health.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900725003685?via%3Dihub" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new study published in ScienceDirect's Nutrition journal</a> and <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2026-01-reveals-hours-video-games-week.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported on by Medical Xpress</a>, 10 different researchers from around the world investigated the effects "excessive gaming" has on young people. Led by Professor Mario Siervo of the Curtin School of Population Health in Perth, Western Australia, and surveying 317 students from five Australian universities with a median age of 20 years old, the study found that "high gamers"--people whose playtime exceeded 10 hours a week--were at greater risk of dietary issues, sleep deprivation, and weight gain.</p><p>"What stood out was students gaming up to 10 hours a week all looked very similar in terms of diet, sleep, and body weight," Siervo said. "The real differences emerged in those gaming more than 10 hours a week, who showed clear divergence from the rest of the sample."</p><p>(It's worth noting that 317 students across five universities in one country is an incredibly small sample size.)</p><p>Alongside "high gamers" (10+ hours per week), the researchers split the participants into "low gamers" (0–5 hours per week) and "moderate gamers" (5–10 hours), depending on the self-reported amount of time they spent playing video games. In these categories, the researchers found that high gamers experienced a decline in diet quality and an increase in obesity when compared to low and moderate gamers. For example, according to the study, high gamers had a median body mass index (BMI) of 26.3 kg/m2 (generally considered overweight), compared to 22.2 kg/m2 and 22.8 kg/m2 (generally considered normal or healthy weight ranges) for low and moderate gamers, respectively.</p><p>Additionally, while all three groups reported generally poor sleep quality, moderate and high gamers scored worse here than low gamers, with their hours spent gaming being a significant disruptor to the quality of their sleep.</p><p>"Each additional hour of gaming per week was linked to a decline in diet quality, even after accounting for stress, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors," Siervo explained in the findings. "This study doesn't prove gaming causes these issues, but it shows a clear pattern that excessive gaming may be linked to an increase in health risk factors. Our data suggests low and moderate gaming is generally fine, but excessive gaming may crowd out healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, sleeping properly, and staying active."</p><p>It's not all bad, though. Siervo said that there's hope for young people whose college habits may carry over into their adulthood: change their behavior before the habit becomes an identity.</p><p>"Because university habits often follow people into adulthood," Siervo said. "Healthier routines such as taking breaks from gaming, avoiding playing games late at night, and choosing healthier snacks may help improve their overall well-being."</p><p>As for the rest of us? Well, the jury's still out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Remote Work Is Part of the Reason for Recent Game Delays’, Says Ex Tripwire CEO: ‘People Are Often Less Efficient and Creative at Home’]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ex-tripwire-ceo-remote-work-game-delays/</link>
            <guid>1407616</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the second chapter of my report from the long chat I had with former <strong>Tripwire Interactive</strong> CEO <strong>John Gibson</strong>, the owner and founder of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/templar-media-acquires-bible-x-studio-making-gate-zero-where-you-play-the-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Templar Media</a></strong> shared his opinion on the recent game delays and industry-wide layoffs. Both were, in essence, caused by COVID-19: the pandemic practically cracked the door wide open for remote work, which Gibson believes makes people less efficient and creative, and also sparked a massive hiring spree and inflated salaries, which are only now being readjusted. <span>Regarding game delays, Gibson specifically mentioned&nbsp;<strong>Killing Floor 3</strong>, which he said took <strong>5 years to make</strong> (and received</span> <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/killing-floor-3-review/">a mixed reception when it launched last July</a>).</p>



<p><em>The industry faced a "video game apocalypse" in 2023 and 2024 as things collapsed following the pandemic boom. Games were not always of high quality or were taking much longer to develop. For instance, the sequel to Killing Floor 2 took five years to make. I believe part of the reason for these game delays is remote work. While working from home feels great, people are often less efficient and less creative. Some of the greatest ideas in the games I have worked on came from random encounters in the hallway. Two people might have different parts of a great idea, chat in the hallway, and create a whole concept for the game. As part of this acquisition, the core team on Gate Zero is relocating to our offices in Georgia. Having everyone in the office will allow us to iterate quickly to finish the game. This business decision will result in a more entertaining and fun game for the player.</em></p>



<p><em>Another challenge was overinflated salaries during the pandemic. Companies with high COVID-era profits were overpaying for talent. For instance, an engineer might be offered a million dollars for their first year. This was unsustainable, and many of those companies eventually conducted massive layoffs. There is now a reset occurring where people must readjust their salary expectations to fair, sustainable levels.</em></p>



<p>As a reminder, in the first chapter, the ex co-founder and CEO of Tripwire shared his '<strong>Entertainment First</strong>' vision for games (and movies and TV) that <strong>focus on fun instead of any specific agendas</strong>. In the full interview, you'll also learn a lot more about <strong>Gate Zero</strong>, the upcoming game based on the <strong>Bible</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie’s Latest Marathon Deep Dive Shows Off the Seven Runner Shells Classes, New Gameplay Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-deep-dive-runner-shells-gameplay/</link>
            <guid>1407613</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Bungie</strong> has debuted its latest deep dive into <strong>Marathon</strong> with a new 'Developer Insights' video, which details all seven of the different Runner Shells, which essentially act as the classes that players will be able to choose from, each with their own abilities and skills and strengths for different playstyles.</p>



<p>The seven different Runner Shells include six that could be considered the 'main' classes players can choose from, which are: Destroyer, Assassin, Recon, Vandal, Thief, and Triage. The seventh shell, Rook, is a solo-queue-only class that lets you jump into ongoing matches, grab a bit of loot, and get out with a free loadout you don't risk at all. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/dev-insights-runner-shells-new-video">A blog post shared alongside the video</a> also digs into the difference between <strong>Cores </strong>and <strong>Implants</strong>. Both are mechanics that give you a boost in the middle of a match, with the difference being that Implants can be used by any Shell, whereas to use a Core, you'll have to find the Core that is made to be used with your specific Runner Shell.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon Developer Insights | Runner Shells" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jFzR8bN13FA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It also digs into the buildcrafting you can do with the different Runner Shells, and how you can push each of their abilities further by leaning into different cores and implants. "<em>For example, with Vandal you can lean into a mobility build, with powerful map traversal and repositioning. Equip cores that turn your double jump into a triple jump, and implants that increase your base movement speed, jump height, and improve your heat capacity</em>," the blog post reads.</p>



<p>One thing not included in today's video is a release date or even a release window, as to when we can expect to see Marathon on shelves. Hopefully, we'll have that information sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>To say that Marathon has had a troubled development would be an understatement. The game's original <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/">director was fired on misconduct allegations</a>, Bungie has suffe<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/">red several layoffs during its development</a>, press around the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/">has been consistently negative with rumors of internal issues</a>, and it went through <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">a massive plagiarism scandal</a> that only <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">delayed the game further</a>.</p>



<p>Today's gameplay of the seven Runner Shells is honestly the best the game has ever looked, as it actually seems to be taking the shape of the kind of extraction-hero-shooter it's going for. Hopefully, it'll be able to stick the landing when it does arrive. If Bungie doesn't get a clear-cut win soon, it may be in for some even more dark days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Because </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/veryimportant.lawyer/post/3lybxlwzjuc2h"><span>everyone on the internet is 12 years old</span></a><span>, the current American administration is posting through its fascist agenda with memes. Trump’s White House has previously used </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><i><span>Pokemon</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><i><span>Halo</span></i></a><span>, and even pop star </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sabrina-carpenter-ice-video-juno-song-response-trump-2000649672"><span>Sabrina Carpenter’s music</span></a><span> to try to recruit people for ICE. Now, it’s using an AI mockup of beloved farming sim </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>to promote the return of whole milk to school lunches.</span></p> <p><span>On January 14, Trump signed a law that will </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/whole-milk-school-lunches-trump-5572176286b322d844bb76d52906e2c7"><span>return whole milk to school lunches</span></a><span>, This is overturning an Obama-era restriction on higher-fat milk options. Alright, whatever. On a list of things Trump has done in his years in office, that’s hardly the worst. But now, the White House has used this as another opportunity to use a video game’s imagery.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Whole milk is back. 🥛 <a href="https://t.co/kHf51s5qwX">pic.twitter.com/kHf51s5qwX</a></p> <p>— The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/2011864079053238516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>At a glance, it might not look like much. The AI-generated image has an ugly faux-pixel-art sprite of Trump looking like he got hit in the face with a frying pan, his inventory has a bunch of the things you’d expect like a MAGA hat and a cop badge, and he’s shown saying, “We’re bringing back Whole Milk and Making America Healthy Again.” But also, if you look at the gold he’s carrying in the screenshot, the number is 45464748.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Trump is the 45th and 47th president of the United States, and has held onto the debunked claims that he won the presidency against Joe Biden in 2020. He has also publicly said he’s </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-third-term-white-house-methods-rcna198752"><span>open to a third term</span></a><span>, which would be in </span><a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxii"><span>violation of the 22nd amendment</span></a><span>, but Trump doesn’t seem to think the law applies to him. Steve Bannon, the ex-chief-strategist of the Trump administration, has also said that Trump </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/president-trump-2028-steve-bannon.html"><span>will have a third term</span></a><span>, while also </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2026/01/10/steve-bannon-2028-campaign-maga"><span>reportedly planning to run himself</span></a><span>. So these numbers seem to be a thinly veiled threat that Trump wants to be president again in 2028.</span></p>

 <p><span>We’ve reached out to </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>developer Concerned Ape for comment on this story and will update it if we hear back.</span></p>
