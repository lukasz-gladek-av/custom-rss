<p>In their tech review of the action-adventure title developed by MachineGames, which is now available in early access for those who purchase one of the game's special editions, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how the game is an impressive ray tracing showcase on both Microsoft's current-generation consoles, thanks to its main visual feature, ray-traced diffuse global illumination. This is used to calculate indirect lighting from light sources like the sun, making the lighting in pretty much every scene feel incredibly natural. In a couple of scenes shown in the video below, RTGI makes scenes with light pouring from outside look incredible, with no light bleed or gaps in the lighting. Even more impressive is how clean it looks, although there are some light image quality stability issues when moving the camera around quickly, and the fact that, on Xbox Series X, the game averages 1800p resolution and successfully targets 60 FPS gameplay. Building the lighting system of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle using ray tracing was also an excellent choice for the game's setting, as Indy explores a lot of locations that have natural lighting, enhancing the experience considerably while making the whole game a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>MachineGames also managed to get the game running decently on Xbox Series S with RTGI. Unsurprisingly, some compromises had to be made, such as lowering the resolution to 1080p and below, but generally, experiencing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on the system is perfectly viable, even with some image quality issues caused by a disappointing implementation of Variable Rate Shading, lower texture quality and more.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an impressive game not only for its gorgeous visuals but also for its gameplay and story, which is one of the best Indiana Jones stories ever made.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-server-issues-warning<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>developer Grinding Gear Games has warned that the game may run into server issues during its Early Access launch period owing to the sheer volume of players who've redeemed keys.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1864880645228630299" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media platform X</a>, Grinding Gear technical director Jonathan Rogers says that a million&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>Early Access keys have been redeemed, which counts both sales of the game and those who've received a free key for spending a certain amount on the original&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>.</p>

<p>Rogers says that the sheer volume of redemptions means there are "probably going to be some queues" over the weekend, and that Grinding Gear "really didn't expect" a million players to log in at the same time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-server-issues-early-access-warning-combat.jpg?itok=DmR86Dzv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-server-issues-early-access-warning-combat.jpg?itok=RlqKL3e3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Grinding Gear Games has warned that&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>may experience some server issues over the weekend.</figcaption></figure><p>In a refreshing display of honesty, Rogers says he does "have some concerns about issues with the backend" of&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>, even though Grinding Gear has ordered more cloud capacity, with those servers coming online "very soon".</p>

<p>Rogers goes on to say that he and Grinding Gear "quite frankly don't know what our backend services are going to be able to handle" with regards to player numbers, and that while everything's been scaled up as far as it will go, it's not clear what "limits" could be hit during the first weekend.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Rogers says that if&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>does hit server issues over the course of the launch weekend, then the dev team will work as hard as it can to solve those issues, so if you do hit queues, be patient; fixes will be on the way.</p>




<p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>is the sequel to&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-style action RPG&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. It packs in a brand new campaign, hundreds of new monsters, and plenty of loot to gather, plus new skills to discover and more.</p>

<p>The game launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-release-delayed" rel="nofollow">later today</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

"We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields, like Sky TV with sports. Just as Christmas was approaching when Xbox would launch, a few of us went out to our favourite third-party publishers and developers, and we asked them, 'How would you like a special deal if you keep your next-generation game on PlayStation exclusive for a two-year period?' And one of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn't clear that Grand Theft Auto 3 was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top-down game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was very lucky for us. And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid. Those deals aren't uncommon in industries with platforms. Including today with things like social media."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Grand Theft Auto Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result of this deal, Grand Theft Auto 3 released in October 2001 as a PS2 exclusive, a month before the original Xbox came out. The game released in May 2002 on PC, and then, two years after the PlayStation launch and after this exclusivity deal ended, in November 2003 for the Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Deering mentioned, Sony’s Grand Theft Auto exclusivity deal was for three games, so included Vice City, which came out in October 2002 for the PS2 first, and San Andreas, which released in October 2004 for the PS2 first. Grand Theft Auto 3 and Vice City hit Xbox together as a pack late 2003, with San Andreas launching in June 2005.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The deal worked out perfectly for both Sony and Rockstar parent company Take-Two, as Deering suggests. Indeed, San Andreas ended up the best-selling PS2 game of all time, Vice City the third best, and Grand Theft Auto 3 the fifth best. Only Gran Turismo came close the the sales the Grand Theft Auto games posted on PS2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The exclusivity deal also helped cement Grand Theft Auto as a PlayStation-first series, and while Grand Theft Auto 4 and Grand Theft Auto 5 launched on PlayStation and Xbox at the same time, Rockstar’s open-world crime epic is still strongly associated with Sony’s consoles, even now. In fact, a number of Grand Theft Auto games made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-100-best-playstation-games-of-all-time">IGN’s Top 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time list</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>? It’s due out on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S at the same time in the fall of 2025, but marketing deals with either Sony or Microsoft have yet to be announced, if they exist at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

      </p></div><div><p>The version 1.4 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “A Storm of Falling Stars,” will launch on December 18, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [179 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-931725"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>As falling stars pierce the night sky, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>‘s upcoming Version 1.4 will introduce an overhaul of Main Story stages, significant updates to Hollow Zero, the game’s debut on <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,472 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> Pro, and the highly anticipated Agents, Hoshimi Miyabi and Asaba Harumasa.</p><p>In this upcoming version, the TV mode in the Main Story will be replaced with more immersive combat and exploration. The highly anticipated Section 6 Agents, Hoshimi Miyabi and Asaba Harumasa, are coming soon, unveiling the culminating chapter of the year. The update will also introduce a major new combat gameplay mode, Hollow Zero: Shadows Lost, alongside the addition of new areas, Port Elpis and <a title="Games > Reverb" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/reverb">Reverb</a> Arena.

Redesigned Main Story stages from the Prologue to Chapter 3 are now added to the HDD system. In future updates to the Main Story, the TV mode will also be replaced with story stages, allowing Proxies to dive directly into battles while commanding Eous to explore the Hollows. Additionally, all contracted Agents will be playable in the city, and a new Quality Time Mode lets Proxies stroll through New Eridu with their Agents. In combat, Decibels will no longer be shared across the squad, allowing all squad members to unleash their stunning Ultimates in a row for even more spectacular battle scenes. The update also adds a Quick Sweep feature for Shiyu Defense challenges, along with other optimizations to streamline progression and character upgrades.</p><p>In previous chapters, Proxies were drawn into a conspiracy surrounding Sacrifice after the demolition case orchestrated by Vision Corporation. In Chapter 5, with the awakening of our “old friend” Perlman, the hidden truths and the Wise and Belle’s backstories will be revealed. Meanwhile, New Eridu Public Security is undergoing a leadership election. As the truth comes to light and a new crisis emerges, Proxies will join forces with Section 6 to venture into the unknown Port Elpis, where all mysteries will be unveiled as the story reaches its finale.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

As an Electric Agent, Harumasa seamlessly switches between bow and blade, marks targets, and delivers unexpected strikes to enemies with active Electro Quivers. Proxies who reach Inter-Knot Lv. 8 can obtain Asaba Harumasa for free after Version 1.4 goes live.</p><p>Moreover, new combat gameplay modes are coming in Version 1.4, including Hollow Zero’s major update, Shadows Lost, and a new periodic operation, Deadly Assault.

			<p>Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas launched as PlayStation 2 exclusives back in the day, and the deal to bring these games exclusively to the console was signed partially because Sony was worried about Xbox.</p>
<p>Speaking during an EGX London special session hosted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/authors/christopher-dring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry's Christopher Dring</a>, Chris Deering, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe president up until the release of the PlayStation 3, commented on the many deals that made several third-party games PlayStation exclusives, saying that some of them, such as the Grand Theft Auto exclusivity deal, were signed partially as a reaction to Xbox. The company was worried when they saw the console coming, and they knew exclusivity was a big deal in other fields, so, as the first Xbox launch was approaching, they spoke with some of their favorite third-party developers and publishers, asking them if they would have liked to sign a special deal to keep their next-generation games PlayStation exclusives for two years. Take-Two was among the publishers that accepted the offer, which paid off in a very big way against expectations, as<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/grand-theft-auto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Grand Theft Auto</a> wasn't as big as it is nowadays, with its first top-down entries not having exactly set the world on fire.</p>
<p>Besides commenting on the Grand Theft Auto exclusivity deal, other former Sony executives commented on other interesting facts about PlayStation's 30-year history, such as trade media skepticism of the PlayStation 2, the well-known PlayStation 3 development issues, London Studio complaining about the lack of a built-in camera for the PlayStation 4, and more.

<p>Lots of enjoyment is to be had on PlayStation 5. Whether your kids beg for something new to play or could use a fun distraction, there’s no going wrong with the games on this list. There are also a few notable, kid-friendly PlayStation exclusives not to be missed. In no particular order, we’re compiling some of the best PlayStation 5 Games for children.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-ps5-games-for-kids">Top PS5 Games for Kids</h2>



<p>Look no further than this list for the best breakdown possible:</p>



<h2 id="h-1-astro-bot">1. Astro Bot</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Astro Bot is one of the highest-rated PlayStation 5 games of 2024 and probably the <strong>best </strong>game for kids on PS5. It features a wealth of worlds to explore, puzzles to solve, and obstacle courses to overcome. If you’re a PlayStation fan of any kind, you’ll adore digging through Astro Bot to find all the cameos and ‘guest appearances’, and there’s plenty of meat on these bones to keep children entertained for hours on end.</p>



<p>It’s a follow-on from Astro’s Playroom, and it’s one of our key picks for PlayStation 5 games for children.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-astro-s-playroom">2. Astro’s Playroom</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you already have, or plan on getting, a PlayStation 5 then you’ll have Astro’s Playroom already pre-installed on the console. This game is pretty short but it’s got huge appeal. Astro’s Playroom is more than a tech demo for the PS5. It’s a culmination of what Sony has accomplished with the PlayStation over the years. </p>



<p>In addition to featuring the DualSense controller’s unique capabilities, players can uncover hidden collectables that contain renderings of past PlayStation consoles, controllers, and accessories. A gacha machine, within the game, can also yield additional memorable goodies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-3-super-monkey-ball-banana-mania">3. Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Super Monkey Ball has kept the good times rolling for years, literally. Banana Mania will keep kids busy for hours. The game is a compilation of over 300 stages from the original Super Monkey Ball, Super Monkey Ball 2, and Super Monkey Ball Deluxe. </p>



<p>Whether you’re speeding directly to the goal, or collecting every banana for a perfect run, there’s no wrong way to enjoy these games. The DualSense controller’s motion controls make this one an easy pick. Kids can also customise their characters and play several minigames involving racing, bowling, soccer, and baseball.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-4-justice-league-cosmic-chaos">4. Justice League: Cosmic Chaos</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>When the kids have a superhero itch that needs scratching then Justice League: Cosmic Chaos is just the thing. Play as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman in a light-hearted action-adventure to stop the prankster, Mr. Mxyzptlk. </p>



<p>That is not a typo. It’s got simple combat but boasts lots of DC Comics Easter eggs, humour, unlockable outfits for the superheroes, and a dynamic levelling system.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="h-5-sonic-frontiers">5. Sonic Frontiers</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>When you gotta go fast in an open-world platformer, an obvious choice is Sonic Frontiers. It’s the first game in the Sonic series to truly go open-world. The Starfall Islands contain several action stages with their own challenges to complete. The real treat of the game is exploring the islands themselves. </p>



<p>Each has obstacle courses and some platform puzzles to solve. The only drawbacks are that the game has a tedious level-up system, a so-so combat system, and some texture pop-ins. But fun is always to be had when exploring up, down and all around Sonic’s surroundings.</p>



<h2 id="h-6-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">6. LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>LEGO games are great picks for the best PlayStation 5 games for children. They’re easy to pick up and keep kids (and adults) of all ages preoccupied. Although a plethora of PS4 Lego games are forward compatible with the PS5, we’re specifically looking at Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga. </p>



<p>The game features a startling 380 playable characters pulled from all manners of Star Wars medium Because the saga is within the subtitle, players can expect to visit many worlds and scenarios spanning the Prequel, Original, and Sequel trilogies. Kids can play as lightsaber users or blaster wielders alike. </p>



<p>The gameplay is also interwoven with random encounters like TIE Fighters swooping from the sky, Tusken Raider attacks, and dog fights with Star Destroyers.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-just-dance-2024-edition">7. Just Dance 2024 Edition</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>If parents are reading this you may recall a little thing back in the day called “Now That’s What I Call Music” compilations. The Just Dance series is the closest equivalent to that. Modern-day musical hits and those from yesteryear are set against vibrant, colourful backdrops. </p>



<p>Chances are you know what a Just Dance game entails and it says so in the title. On-screen avatars perform the dance moves while the kiddos follow along. The smartphone Just Dance app will keep track of accuracy and kids hold it in hand. Put down the controller, turn the volume up, and dance.</p>



<h2 id="h-8-ratchet-amp-clank-rift-apart">8. Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart is a third-person shooter action-adventure that guarantees a fun, entertaining story. This time around the conundrum is that Ratchet has accidentally opened a rift in the space-time continuum. With a lot of media nowadays covering multiple universes, kids can immerse themselves in this colourful adventure. </p>



<p>Dr. Nefarious is ever the comic foil, but now he is joined by his opposite, Emperor Nefarious who has assumed rule of his own galaxy. What’s more, is that he’s never been defeated, so go change that. Rift Apart is among the best PlayStation 5 games for children.</p>







<h2 id="h-9-kena-bridge-of-spirits">9. Kena: Bridge of Spirits</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Similar to Ratchet &amp; Clank before it, Kena: Bridge of Spirits is like you’re in control of a beautifully produced animated movie. In this action-adventure platformer, kids control Kena, a young spirit guide. Joining Kena in her adventure throughout her mystical world are small spirit companions called the Rot. </p>



<p>The Rot can assist Kena by carrying objects to solve puzzles, distract enemies, or assist in battles. Kena utilizes an enchanted staff for combat, exploration, and platforming. It may be on the short side, but exploring Kena’s beautiful world for upgrades and treasure hunting needs to be experienced by every PS5 owner.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-sackboy-a-big-adventure">10. Sackboy: A Big Adventure</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>One of the best PlayStation 5 games for children is a side-scrolling platformer similar to Super Mario Bros. Sackboy: A Big Adventure can be compared closely to Super Mario 3D World regarding its gameplay structure. However, this time around, Sackboy’s moveset has expanded to best suit a new way of play. </p>



<p>Flutter jump, roll, dive, and slap everything in your way. The generous customization features of LittleBigPlanet carry over into Sackboy. There’s no end to the hysterical cosmetic decorations. Whether platforming solo or together, Sackboy keeps the smiles coming.</p>



<h2 id="h-11-minecraft">11. Minecraft</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>You can’t talk about the best PS5 games for children and <strong>not </strong>name Minecraft. This classic, decade-old game is a staple for any child looking to game from a young age. It promotes healthy learning and exploration, and it’s one of the best games for new players who are just starting to explore a controller.</p>



<p>In Minecraft, you and your kids can explore an infinite open world, build whatever you can imagine, and go on an adventure that only ends when you’re ready for it to. It’s the best-selling game of all time for a reason.</p>



<h2 id="h-12-overcooked">12. Overcooked!</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>For kids who enjoy cooperative play, Overcooked is a cooking simulator with a cartoony flair. Prepare yourselves though, you have to work through the laughs to become an ultimate chef. The gist of Overcooked, and its sequel, is preparing dishes by following onscreen instructions. It’s not as simple as lading soup into a bowl. </p>



<p>Some dishes will require cooking and preparing food to order such as managing temperatures, chopping vegetables, and preparing the plate. The real challenge is doing this against a time limit and setting time aside to clean dishes for the next order.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-13-moving-out">13. Moving Out</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another fun cooperative simulator, Moving Out is not unlike Overcooked in its gameplay style. As you would expect, kids have to move household amenities like couches, fridges, and microwaves out of the house and into a moving truck. It’s not that quite simple, however, as there are hazards that can disrupt your progress. </p>



<p>Almost like Home Alone traps, players have to be wary of fires, icey flooring, and ghosts. Fortunately, for the kiddos who need to dial back on the difficulty, Moving Out has an Assist feature that can remove stage hazards and increase the time limit.</p>







<h2 id="h-14-hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged">14. Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Racing games are plentiful but here’s a newly released suggestion. Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged is a great improvement on the shortcomings of its predecessor. This sequel contains beautifully stylized racetracks that are set against home backdrops. The racetracks you can only dream of building in your house are fully realized in video game form. </p>



<p>Whether racing as miniature muscle cars, bikes, or big rigs, each with its own specifications,&nbsp; Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is one of the fastest racing games you can get your hands on.</p>



<h2 id="h-15-crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled">15. Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another racer that is gushing to the brim with content, Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled is a must-have for any racer. No pun intended but developer Beenox went the extra mile with this reimagining of the original Crash Bandicoot kart racer. Nitro-Fueled brings back all the racetracks from that game plus additional racetracks from the Crash Nitro Kart and Crash Tag Team Racing games. </p>



<p>It got a lot of flak at launch for its use of microtransactions after promising there would be none. Online multiplayer is not as populated as it used to be, but the single-player story experience is solid. By this point,t it shouldn’t hurt the bank either.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>PUBG creator Brendan Greene has revealed his PlayerUnknown Productions studio is working on "an ambitious" three-game plan: Prologue: Go Wayback!, Preface: Undiscovered World, and Project Artemis.</p>
<p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is a single-player open-world "emergent" survival game in which you'll use "classic" survival mechanics to explore machine learning-driven terrain generation, "challenging your limits".</p>

<p>Promising to engage with the community during development, Greene expects this project to release in early access in spring (Q2) 2025.</p>
<p>You won't have to wait so long to give Greene's second project, Preface: Undiscovered World, however. A demo is already available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/">Steam</a> to give players "an early look at the innovative technology that will power the subsequent titles in the series, and eventually project Artemis". It's not faring particularly well - early adopters have put it at a "mostly negative" rating - but it's free and available to try right now.</p>
<p>As Greene explains it, though, the world will become more populated and interesting the more people visit it.</p>
<p>"In Preface, users can witness an Earth-scale world generated in real-time by our machine learning agents directly on their GPU," Greene said. "This digital planet is still quite empty for now, but every person who enters it and shares their feedback, contributes to its future development."</p>
<p>As for that aforementioned Project Artemis?</p>
<p>"My vision for Artemis is challenging, but we plan to take it one step at a time and the three games aim to give us a solid tech foundation on which to scale up. After Prologue, two more games are planned for release in the coming years, each addressing critical technical challenges that will bring the studio closer to the final product. With Prologue, we aim to engage players and introduce them to the emergent mechanics and expansive worlds we're developing."</p>
<p>PUBG Studios, the studio behind - you guessed it - PUBG, recently unveiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-studio-unveils-top-down-pvp-shooter-project-arc-with-real-time-shared-line-of-sight">Project ARC</a>, a new 5v5 PvP shooter viewed from a top-down perspective and featuring "shared real-time line of sight".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-4/">Fallout 4</a> arrived nearly a decade ago, and it's anyone's guess when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a> will be released. Thankfully, the fan developers  at Team Folon took it upon themselves to create <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-fallout-london-worth-your-time/1100-6525518/" data-ref-id="1100-6525518">Fallout London</a>, an unofficial Fallout 4 mod that gives players a glimpse of the post-apocalypse in the United Kingdom. Now, Team Folon plans to go even further with an upcoming DLC release for Fallout London.</p><p>"What started as a simple hotfix has grown into something much bigger," said the team on the Fallout London Discord. "Given the scope of this update, we're aware it may make changes that impact save files, so rather than risking breaking things for a small update, we're looking to roll this into a part of our very first DLC!"</p><p>Specific details about the release date and what will be in the DLC weren't disclosed, but it was said to include new content as well as things that were cut from the original release of the mod. Additionally, Team Folon announced that it's no longer just a collective of fans, and the company is now incorporated as an official business. The team suggested that it may work on "a small indie game," but promised to "always continue to support Fallout London."</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-london-just-set-a-record-on-gog/1100-6525741/" data-ref-id="1100-6525741">Fallout London was downloaded 500,000 times</a> in the first 24 hours, which is a record for the GOG store. <a href="https://fallout4london.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fallout London still has its own page</a> outside of Discord, where more information about the mod can be found. Meanwhile, a separate team is working on another ambitious and unofficial Fallout 4 mod. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-nuevos-mexico-mod-trailer-brings-the-post-apocalypse-south-of-the-border/1100-6526953/" data-ref-id="1100-6526953">Fallout: Nuevos Mexico</a> doesn't currently have a release window, but it will explore what's happening in Mexico during the events of the Fallout games.</p>

<p>While much of the options included are what you would expect as standard - things like the ability to change the subtitle font size and edit button layouts - the team has also included a welcomingly customisable action experience.</p>
<p>What this means is that players can tweak specific aspects of the game's combat and enemies, rather than just go for a blanket 'one size fits all' approach to the action's difficulty.</p>

<p>When players first boot up the Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, they have the option to choose from three 'Action experience' options: Light, Moderate and Hard. However, once the game actually starts, players can then customise this Action experience further via the pause menu.</p>
<p>Here, there is the option to adjust things such as number of melee attackers, number of ranged attackers, enemy awareness speed and enemy damage.</p>

<p>We just awarded Indiana Jones and the Great Circle a shiny five out of five stars.</p>
<p>"Indiana Jones really feels like he comes full circle (sorry) in this latest adventure. At long last, there's an Indy game that nails both the puzzles and the kind of action we know so well from the films, and it does so with wit, charm and a real eye for spectacle," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>What a great end to the year we’re having – at least in terms of game releases! I’ve had the good fortune to check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/infinity-nikki-review/">Infinity Nikki</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/mythwrecked-ambrosia-island-review/">Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island</a> and Snow Bros. Wonderland (more on that one to come). Other than those, I’ve patiently waited for Marvel Rivals to release, and I’m literally just about to hop into the first matches. Excelsior! Or… something like that.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> wrapped up Assassin’s Creed Mirage and then got back to playing Valiant Hearts which he’s been chipping away at for a little while. He says, “It’s a thoughtful little puzzle set during World War I from a time when Ubi were doing plenty of cool smaller games. I also dipped my toes in Alan Wake II before picking up Warhammer 40,000: Darktide.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has mostly been playing being ill in bed, but he’s been hammering Mario and Luigi which has been about the right level of challenge for his poorly brain. Oh, he also managed a couple of hours killing Skaven on Vernintide 2 multiplayer before the bronchitis really set in. Hope you’re on the mend, mate!</p>
<p>If he’s playing Destiny 2, you know he’s <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, but he’s also played other things too! Funko Pop Fusion “is a bit of a mess”, and the Jurassic Park Classic Game Collection is “a useful reminder that collision detection was awful back in the day”. Meanwhile, <strong>Gamoc</strong> played Phasmophobia, telling us, “It’s still great despite its janky bugginess. Also The Thaumaturge for review.”</p>


<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been playing Shadow Tactics: Aiko’s Choice for review, as well as a spot of Helldivers 2 (he’s so close to getting a mech-thingy now!). He tells us, “I also picked up Astral Chain in the sales and boy-oh-boy what a game! I’m only a few hours in but already slathering for a sequel, for Switch 2 perhaps?”</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing The Witcher 3 and revisiting old haunts. He says, “I’m just taking my time exploring and clearing the hundreds of question marks off the map. Also playing Overthrown for early access review. Balataro has been a massive time sink as it is very addictive when trying to get a good run going.” It wouldn’t be a What We Played without a spot of Football Manager too, continuing, “In FM24, I’ve guided Valencia to the last 16 of the Champions League and semi final of the Spanish Cup. Lost both, but competing in the league to qualify for Europe again. Not sure if the board will give me a new contract yet though, after all I’ve done for them over the last 4 seasons like winning their first European title in over 20 years.”</p>

<p>And finally there’s <strong>Tef</strong>, who dished out a beating to hundreds of fascists while <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">reviewing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> this past week. He really enjoyed it, and felt that the first person view really helped get the tone and pacing just right for and Indy adventure. Now if only he could remember that it’s a “Great” circle and not a “Giant” one, that’d really help…</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

<p>In a brief message to players and fans alike, director Jonathan Rogers said that as interest in the sequel is "far beyond" expectations, this may impact waiting times as fans jump on to try out the early access build over the weekend.</p>

<p>With sales still increasing, Rogers said that "whilst [the sales] is great news, it also comes with some downsides, too. There are probably going to be some queues during the launch weekend".</p>
<p>"Before our announcement, when we're ordering capacity, we really didn't expect to have more than a millions people online at the same time. We've already ordered way more cloud capacity and those servers will be coming online very soon. But I do have some concerns about issues with the backend.</p><p>"We quite frankly don't know what our backend services are going to be able to handle as we go above a million users. Now, we've added more database shards, scaling everything we have up as far as it'll go. But we're really not sure what kind of limits we might hit. We never expected things to go this big during [early access]," Rogers added.</p>
<p>"So I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you guys so much for believing in this project. If we do run into server issues at launch, just know that we're going to be working as hard as we can to solve them."</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 is now available in early access on PC and consoles. It was originally expected to release in November, but the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-delayed-by-three-weeks">had its early access release date pushed back</a> to today, 6th December, after some "server-side infrastructure work" necessitated additional work.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Following yesterday's PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025 announcements, the last remaining showcase before the end of the year is The Game Awards. It's also the biggest show, usually, although there have been slow years when host Geoff Keighley himself has tempered fans' expectations in advance to avoid disappointments.</p>
<p>This is not one of those times, at least according to VideoGameChronicle Founder Andy Robinson, who undoubtedly inherited a lot of contacts from his former career as an industry professional. In a tweet <a href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1864973090263900372?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on X, Robinson teased a very big show, adding that it's not a guess.</p>
<p><em>Expecting a VERY big The Game Awards next week. Fire up the hype train. </em><em>Definitely not a guess.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps that shouldn't be surprising. 2024 may not have had as many big releases as 2023, but 2025 is looking better thanks to games like Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Civilization VII, Assassin's Creed Shadows, Avowed, Monster Hunter Wilds, Borderlands 4, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, Doom: The Dark Ages, Fable, Ghost of Yōtei, Grand Theft Auto VI, Mafia: The Old Country, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, South of Midnight, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2.</p>
<p>There's a solid chance to see at least some of these 2025 games at The Game Awards 2024, but Robinson seems to refer mostly to game reveals for titles we haven't really seen anything yet. This category could include the likes of Ark 2, the upcoming BioShock title, Rare's Everwild, Archetype's Exodus, Marvel's Wolverine, Monolith's Wonder Woman, the next Metro from 4A Games, and even projects we haven't heard before. Let us know in the comments which of these games (or other titles we haven't mentioned) you'd like to see unveiled.</p>
<p>As a reminder, here's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-nominated-in-the-game-of-the-year-section-at-tga-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of candidates</a> for the coveted Game of the Year award:</p>
<ul>
<li>Astro Bot</li>
<li>Balatro</li>
<li>Black Myth: Wukong</li>
<li>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</li>
<li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li>
<li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li>
</ul>
<p>The Game Awards 2024 goes live on December 12 at 4:30pm PT / 7:30p ET / 12:30a+1 GMT from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles.</p>

			<p>Today's Path of Exile 2 Early Access launch is setting out to be a smashing success, considering the huge number of EA redemptions reported by developer Grinding Gear Games.</p>
<p>A few hours ago on X, the Path of Exile 2 developer confirmed they reached 1 million Early Access redemptions, thanking players for the unexpected level of support. With so many players, however, unforeseen issues may arise during the launch window, and queues during the weekend should be expected, according to the developer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’ve just reached 1 million Early Access redemptions. The support you have all shown for Path of Exile 2 Early Access is far beyond anything we could have ever predicted. However we want to be upfront with you all and let you know there may very well be queues over the weekend. <a href="https://t.co/bwGpsVNdGU">pic.twitter.com/bwGpsVNdGU</a></p>
<p>— Path of Exile (@pathofexile) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathofexile/status/1864880645228630299?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The smashing success of the Path of Exile 2 Early Access release is completely deserved. The very first version of the second entry in the series will launch with<a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access/"> a lot of content</a>, which includes six playable classes with two Ascendancy classes each, three story acts, and a fully featured endgame that introduces new mechanics that will push the gameplay mechanics to their absolute limits. Everything that Grinding Gear Games revealed so far only reinforced the positive opinion I had of the game after having tried the game during Gamescom earlier this year.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 Early Access launches later today on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. While the full game will be free-to-play like its predecessor, the Early Access version is only available after purchasing any of the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/purchase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporter packs.</a></p>

But the true concurrent figure will be much higher given Marvel Rivals launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S also (Sony and Microsoft do not make player numbers public).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems to be going down well on Steam, too, with a ‘mostly positive’ user review rating from over 5,700 reviews (76% of the reviews are positive). Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review">Marvel Rivals Review in Progress</a> to find out what we think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For NetEase, it will be hoping not only to keep Marvel Rivals’ player count as high as possible for as long as possible (something that’s proved particularly tricky for live service games of late), but to make enough money from players to meet the company’s internal revenue projections. To that end, Marvel Rivals sells a battle pass and premium skins. But is it paying off? The game is currently third in Steam’s top-sellers list, which is sorted by revenue, behind only the pricey Steam Deck and Grinding Gear Games’ Path of Exile 2. This suggests Marvel Rivals is already convincing players to open their wallets.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/06/unnamed-11-1733478165414.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Marvel Rivals Twitch Drops Season 0.

This month-long kick-off season starts with a total of 33 heroes, all available to play for free, eight maps for Quick Match and Competitive modes, a Conquest map, and a Practice Range. Dooms' Rise serves as the opening chapter “for the chaos caused by each of Doctor Dooms’ time experiments colliding and unleashing the Timestream Entanglement,” NetEase said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a Twitch Drops event for Season 0, as you’d expect from a live service game of this type, an 'Entangled Moments' seasonal event to unlock spray rewards, gallery card rewards, and stories for completing tasks, and a global launch gift: a special code for a free Iron Man costume.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

		<p>Eternal Strands, the debut game from Yellow Brick Games, now has a release date and you will not have to wait much longer for it. Eternal Strands will be available on January 28th, and it will be coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox Game Pass. Yellow Brick Studios has also revealed a partnership with Square Enix’s Creative Studio III for some free post launch content.</p>

<p>Jeff Skalski, COO and Executive Producer at Yellow Brick Games said, <em>“As a long-time fan of Square Enix and the games Creative Studio III have made under the helm of Naoki Yoshida, member of Square Enix’s board of directors, and studio head of Creative Studio III, this is a dream come true for all of us here at Yellow Brick Games. To first have the opportunity to create our own original fantasy IP and then have the chance to work with the Creative Studio III team to further enrich it with all-new content is just a once in a lifetime moment. As an independent studio working on our first game, we will forever be thankful to them. I can’t wait for the players to experience the new cool designs from the master artist Yusuke Mogi when our first free post-launch update for Eternal Strands arrives in the spring of 2025.” &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Eternal Strands’ story puts players in the shoes of Brynn, a Weaver on a mission to push back the Surgeborn and reclaim her people’s home. Brynn has access to magical abilities and weapons to aid in her fight that will take her across expansive world of the Enclave where everything can be explored. Players will be able to climb mountains and create paths using magic. It is a world fraught with dangers and giant enemies, which are seen in the above trailer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/they-come-from-the-water-in-sci-fi-horror-shooter-deepest-fear/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>“Stay away from the water” is pretty easy advice to follow in many parts of the inhabited world, but it’s less handy when you’re trapped on an underwater research station that has awoken some kind of deep sea terrors. That’s exactly what you will encounter in sci-fi horror shooter Deepest Fear.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEEPEST FEAR™ | Horror FPS | Worldwide Exclusive Reveal | 4K 60fps" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zsw5hRbtd7A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So what the heck are you doing down there? Dr. Danni Carrol has to fight to the heart of this secret project, which has been masterminded by her estranged father. Whatever he’s been up to, it’s brought bizarre watery monsters out of the ocean. Thankfully they can still be blasted with a big gun.</p>
<p>Inspired by 80s horror action films like The Abyss, The Thing, and The Fly, and Total Recall, you’ll immediately spot the retro futuristic tech that sets the visual aesthetic of Deepest Fear’s world. For the gameplay it leans in on Metroidvania world design and FPS immersive sims, where there’s puzzles to unravel and a degree of improvisation that’s possible to get the job done.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty great looking reveal, to my eye, feeling a bit like modern horror classic Alien: Isolation thanks to that retro-futuristic tech, but then with a much greater emphasis on combat and gunplay. This will be really interesting to keep tabs on as development continues.</p>

<p>Developed and self-published by Variable State, there’s no word on release date targets or platforms beyond PC.</p>

            <p>Gwent, the card game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, is finally getting a physical release.</p>
<p>It's been almost 10 years since the release of the video game, which has spawned a couple of spin-off card games in The Witcher: Thronebreaker and mobile app Gwent, but only now is a physical reproduction of the game being created.</p>
<p>The set will come with over 400 cards and a playmat to replicate the full experience from The Witcher 3, and will have variant rulesets from casual play to tournament rules.</p>

<p>It will cost £44 and arrive in Q3 2025.</p>
<p>The set is being created by Hachette Boardgames UK and new publisher No Loading Games, which is focused on bringing licensed brands to tabletop gaming - an Asterix set is also planned for next year.</p>
<p>"Gwent is the biggest 'game within a game' in media history," said Rob Trounce, marketing manager for Hachette Boardgames UK.</p>
<p>"After a 10-year wait, we are proud to be working alongside No Loading Games to bring this beloved game to tabletops in a stunning package - whether it's a souvenir for fans of Geralt and his adventures, or a game for competitive card game enthusiasts, Gwent will be one of the hottest games of 2025."</p>

            <p>NetEase Games' free-to-play, team-based PVP shooter Marvel Rivals has got off to a rather heroic start on Steam.</p>
<p>Following its debut earlier today, the game - which boasts a vast roster of characters from across the Marvel universe - has managed to already reach a peak concurrent player count of 444,286 over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/">Valve's platform</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are still 181,057 Marvel-ites (not sure that is actually a word, but let's go with it for now) still battling it out amongst each other. This number may well rise further again over the weekend, when we are free from the shackles of the work week.</p>

<p>It isn't all numbers and no praise. Marvel Rivals currently sits with a "mostly positive" review average on Steam.</p>
<p>"Marvel Rivals is proving that the competitive multiplayer space does indeed have room for new titles. Just gotta get the execution right," reads one positive review. "Finallyyyyyy, a game that's actually fun," adds another. "First off, the team is amazing, and the gameplay is fantastic - I just love it."</p><p>One area the game is receiving particular praise for, is its roster of characters. Prior to its launch, the team confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-next-five-characters-have-been-confirmed-heres-the-list">Black Widow, Cloak and Dagger, Iron Fist, Squirrel Girl, and Wolverine would all be joining the line up</a>. Other characters include Iron Man, Hulk and Scarlet Witch.</p>

		<p>During the PC Gaming Show last night, Nightdive Studios surprise released The Thing Remastered, making it available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch. You can check out the brand new trailer to celebrate the game’s launch, and also see the improvements that Nightdive Studios has brought to the classic game.</p>

<p>Here are all the places you can get The Thing Remastered from. It is priced at £24.99/$29.99</p>

</ul>
<p>The Nightdive team has worked with the original developers to bring some gameplay improvements. One key area is with the interface for the fear/trust system that determines whether an AI will cooperate with you or defy you, depending on their psychological state. It’s well known that Computer Artworks had to make a few… creative decisions to get things to work and fit with the game’s technical limitations in the early 2000s, and just designing an open-ended structure like this to work with the story. There are improved models, textures and environments, and there’s also new dynamic lighting and 4K resolutions at up to 144 FPS, depending on the platform.</p>

		<p>Raccoon Logic has announced that Revenge of the Savage Planet will release in May 2025, the sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/journey-to-the-savage-planet">Journey to the Savage Planet</a> coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One and PC.</p>

<p>The new trailer features Kindred Aerospace CEO Martin Tweed from the first game, as he reveals his new nemesis, Gunther Harrison, the CEO of rival Alta Interglobal, and some brand new gameplay.</p>
<p>You’ll notice one big change for this game compared to the original, in that it’s shifted to a third person view, letting you really soak in the bombastic cartoony animations of the characters as they run, slide, leap and blast their way through the game.</p>
<p>You’ve been abandoned on an alien planet after your mission to colonise it has been deemed a bit too spendy for Alta Interglobal. So, you’ll head out to explore, scavenge and salvage from habitats that were sent on a one way trip before the cutbacks, capture animals, upgrade gear and discover secrets. Also… there’s actually four planets in this game, all of which are savage.</p>

<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet can be played solo or co-op (both split screen local or online) and with full crossplay.</p>
<p>Journey to the Savage Planet originally launched in 2020, shortly after developer Typhoon Studios had been acquired by Google. It still launched crossplatform, though was ported to Stadia a little while later. Of course, we all know what happened to Stadia, and Google shutdown Typhoon Studios in the process. Thankfully the founders were able to set up Raccoon Logic with some backing from Tencent, and they reacquired the Savage Planet IP from Google, allowing this to be a full sequel and not one of those spiritual successors.</p>
<p>We had a great time with the original. Dom said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/01/27/journey-to-the-savage-planet-review/">our Journey to the Savage Planet review</a>, “A rollicking space adventure, Journey to the Savage Planet has the smarts to make you laugh out loud while taking shots at consumerism and big business”</p>

			<p>The 2D/2.5D platformer has become a somewhat neglected genre in recent years. Aside from Mario Wonder, many of the main standout series have been dormant for some time. A few months ago the cancellation of Crash Bandicoot 5 was reported and it’s been 10 years since Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze (6 since the Switch port). As a big fan of this style of game I was pleasantly surprised to hear about Nikoderiko – through a YouTube advert of all things. Initially, I was concerned that the game would turn out to be Crash from Wish but the full game is a well-made and polished platformer that is a welcome addition to the genre.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nikoderiko: The Magical World - Feature Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExG4ce6anoM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moving away from the antipodean marsupial of Naughty Dog’s series, you play as a pair of mongooses (mongeese?) who are depicted as Nathan Drake style treasure hunters – a portrayal which feels like a deliberate nod again to Crash’s original developers. This conscious reference is confirmed late in the game when a side character incorrectly identifies Niko and Luna as bandicoots, a clear sign both of the self-awareness of this game and also its meta sense of humour. The broader story is that the Cobra King has stolen a treasure chest found by the mongoose pair and they must venture across the land to track it down again.</p>


<p>Graphically, Nikoderiko is very much in keeping with the style of its influences. Bright and bold cartoony visuals abound with a variety of traditional biomes all present and correct. Enemies are very reminiscent of both DK and Crash’s foes, with the boss battles perhaps being more influenced by the former with larger-than-life encounters. Both Niko and Luna are well designed but it can be a little too easy to get them mixed up when playing in coop.</p>
<p>To make your way through the 30 or so levels of this adventure you’ll be running and jumping in very traditionally organised levels with regular checkpoints and lots of collectables. Instead of the genre’s popular double jump, the two heroes can glide across long distances (a characteristic that would better suit a flying squirrel surely?) &nbsp;Enemies can be defeated by jumping on their heads or using your slide attack, the latter also being needed to traverse small gaps at times. At set points during levels you’ll also find barrels and chests that you can pick up to throw at more stubborn enemies. Towards the end of the game some challenging combinations of enemies require you to string together all your abilities in order to overcome them.</p>


<p>The majority of the time you’ll be travelling from left to right in the style of Donkey Kong Country with the occasional swimming level included for variety. The latter control really well and aren’t the low point that subnautical sections often are. You even unlock animal friends to help you through some levels with these often being designed around the special abilities of each. Alongside these level-specific appearances, however, you can also buy extra uses of the mounts to bring along to other levels – although this wasn’t something I used in my completed playthrough.</p>
<p>More in keeping with Crash Bandicoot, though, are the parts of some levels where you turn away from the camera (and less often run toward it) and take on a third dimension. These are a relatively smaller part of the game than the 2D sections but play out almost identical to the Bandicoot, even to the point of having some of the same issues with depth perception at times. Boss fights vary between the different perspectives too and are mostly challenging enough to be fun without being too annoying – unless you are trying for some of the more tricky boss-based trophies.</p>
<p>In terms of collectables, there are fireflies that serve as your main currency, coins and trophies that are used to unlock extra material via ingame lootboxes, letters that spell out NIKO (in a huge borrowing from DK), and finally large purple crystals. There is one crystal hidden on every main level and finding some of these adds an extra layer of exploration to your travels. The aforementioned lootboxes are not as egregious as that description might suggest since they are entirely self-contained and don’t require any microtransactions although some grinding will be necessary if you want to unlock everything.</p>

<p>Finally, one of the most positive aspects of Nikoderiko is the ability to play the whole game in local coop, with two players controlling each of the mongooses. This is always a huge addition to a game and should be celebrated. The main question with any single-screen coop is how it handles one player being too far ahead and Nikoderiko goes for the bubble mechanic. The trailing player will lose a heart and teleport back to the leading one in a protective bubble. This can be a little annoying, but as long as one player survives then the game continues so it isn’t as frustrating as it could have been.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I really enjoyed my time with Nikoderiko: The Magical World. It's a blast in singleplayer, and after a good few evenings playing in coop with my kids I and can absolutely recommend it as a local multiplayer experience too. If you're a platforming fan, then this is one you won't want to miss.	</p></div>

			<p>Today, Square Enix <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1864846226392588539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has already sold two million copies between retail and digital. Given that the game launched less than a month ago, it's a great result for the Japanese publisher.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, Kai Tatsumoto rated the remake 8.6 out of 10:</p>
<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has been given a complete graphical overhaul, instead giving the iconic RPG a makeover in the same vein as Square-Enix’s Octopath Traveler and other similar titles. The entire world is brightly colored and blooming with light. Even if you’re intimately familiar with every step retracing Ortega’s journey, the complete reimagining of the adventure makes this feel like a brand new adventure rather than just another release of Seeds of Salvation. All I can say now is that I can’t wait to go through Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake next year.</em></p>
<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D, while not the definitive edition that includes all of the previous side content, embodies the perfect version of Erdrick's adventure that both old and new fans can appreciate as if a brand new adventure from Yuji Horii.</em></p>

		<p>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, the follow up to the incredible Citizen Sleeper, will be releasing on January 31st for PC, Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and will also be available day one on Game Pass. There is a limited time <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442460/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector/">Hexport demo</a> available now on Steam, but will only be playable until December 8th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Citizen Sleeper 2 - Date Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryA2lZ-FEp8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector’s story will take different route than the one in the original, though a few similar elements remain. As a Sleeper, you are on the run trying to escape from your past, but have little memory of it. In the first game, the goal was to survive and outwit your pursuers upon a space station, while trying to keep your android body functioning. In Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector, the goal is to get a ship, put together a crew, and explore the Starward Belt. You will still need to keep your body functioning, and decisions will be need to be made that will alter the course of your relationships and the story.</p>
<p>We awarded Citizen Sleeper our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/24/game-of-the-year-2022-best-narrative/">Best Narrative Game of the Year award for 2022</a>, and it was absolutely deserving of it. While we didn’t cover the original release, Aran checked out the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/04/citizen-sleeper-episode-purge-review/">final DLC</a>&nbsp;for the game, saying, <em>“As a finale Purge is an excellent way to finish the tale of Citizen Sleeper. It ties up so many loose ends and gives fitting finales to many of the influential characters that you have met. There is one loose end regarding a particular character that I feel was not properly resolved, but at the same time it ties into the confusion of the events in the final stages. Yet, the door remains open for more stories set within this universe be it on The Eye or by following what happens out in the cosmos. This may be the end of the Sleeper’s story, but there are so many more characters who embark on new beginnings that offer worlds of narrative possibilities.”</em></p>

			<p>Among the many new game announcements featured in yesterday's PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025, Deepest Fear certainly stands out as one of the most intriguing.&nbsp;It is being developed by Variable State, a British independent studio known for games like Virginia, Last Stop, and the upcoming Polaris.</p>
<p>According to the developers, Deepest Fear is a sci-fi horror first-person shooter game featuring inspirations from the likes of James Cameron, John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and Paul Verhoven in terms of atmosphere. On the other hand, Metroid Prime, Half-Life 2, System Shock 2, and Dead Space were cited as inspirations for the gameplay, which is said to mix Metroidvania design with immersive simulation elements, allowing the player to come up with interesting solutions to the various situations presented throughout the game.</p>
<p>There's also a particular twist in that Deepest Fear features a full-fledged real-time fluid simulation, which protagonist Dr. Danni Carrol will use to fight otherworldly entities that manifest spontaneously from any water source. Moreover, the surrounding environment can flood and take in water at any moment, sweeping her away with unpredictable currents and plunging the protagonist into the suffocating depths.</p>

<p>The game has no release date yet, but there's already a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2334930/DEEPEST_FEAR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> that even includes the system requirements.</p>

			<p>Today, CCP Games announced Founder Access for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-games-announce-new-title-eve-frontier-same-universe-as-eve-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE Frontier</a>, which gives those who purchased it the opportunity to have a say on features within the space survival simulation game while also being given access to the in-development build of the game on a continuous basis. This access begins on December 10, when those who hold the Founder Access pass will be able to join the exclusive, always-on server in Closed Alpha. This gives them the opportunity to provide crucial feedback to the developers and leave their mark on the game before it is released.</p>
<p>Releasing Founder Access marks the start of the next phase of development of EVE Frontier by allowing those who have purchased the pass to access it permanent pre-launch access. By doing this, it means that players will be able to play and experience EVE Frontier before it has launched and will be able to give feedback to the developers on features that may need tweaking or adding or even bug fixes that CCP Games may have missed. Of course, that is not the only thing that players can get by purchasing Founder Access. Players will also get additional benefits, such as name reservations, cosmetics, Discord roles, and special access to CCP Games Developer streams. Additionally, when the game launches in the future as free-to-play, Founders will be able to redeem their included premium subscription time.</p>
<p><iframe title="EVE Frontier | Official 'First Look'" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0sOVGHEyCnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>CCP Games CEO Hilmar Veigar Pétursson said:</p>
<p><em>In EVE Frontier we are deepening the contribution and connection players have over a living galaxy. A virtual world where developers and players are equals, where the rules apply to all. Our long-term vision is to create an open ecosystem built, operated, and governed by the Frontier's inhabitants themselves.</em></p>
<p>From today, those interested will be able to purchase Founder Access to EVE Frontier, with three different tiers to purchase. The cheapest tier is $29.99 and includes a Unique Awakened Portrait and one month of Premium Post-Launch Subscription Time. The second tier, named Initiated, is $59.99, including two exclusive skins, a portrait, two months of Premium Post-Launch Subscription Time, and a 24-hour early start at launch.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the third tier, which is the most expensive and provides the most benefits. This comes with a unique Ascended Portrait and three exclusive skins. You'll also get four months of Premium Post-Launch Subscription Time, a Name Reservation, and a 72-hour early start at launch. To get all of these benefits, you'll have to pay $89.99.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/m80-acquire-beastcoast-rainbow-six-team-out/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/m80-acquires-beastcoast-and-throws-manchester-r6-major-champs-out-in-the-cold.1053627/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/m80-acquire-beastcoast-rainbow-six-team-out/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>M80 has moved to acquire Beastcoast, adding the likes of Dota 2 and Pokémon-focused esports to an already stacked roster. The organisation will now cover these games in addition to Rainbow Six Siege, Counter-Strike 2, and VALORANT, but the move hasn’t been completed without a few upsets.</p>



<p>The losers of this deal are represented by Beastcoast’s former Rainbow Six Siege team, which claimed a victory at the BLAST R6 Major in Manchester, England earlier this year. They’re now left without an organisation to represent at the Six Invitational 2025, which is fast approaching.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-last-minute-change">Last-Minute Change</h2>



<p>M80 posted on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>M80 is pleased to announce we have acquired Beastcoast and their esports and media businesses. Excited to welcome them to the M80 family!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In June, Beastcoast and Cloud9 partnered in the Rainbow Six Siege space ahead of the Esports World Cup. It didn’t turn out to be too fruitful a partnership, given that the team failed to qualify for the EWC, but it was also a very short-lived one. Per the <a href="https://m80.gg/article/m80-acquires-beastcoast-moves-into-dota2-pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official statement released by M80</a>, some key staff members are being pulled over from Beastcoast, but it’s bad news for some:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As part of the acquisition, M80 will absorb several of Beastcoast’s esports operations – including a top team in DOTA 2 – one of the largest Pokemon media businesses in gaming, and key staff, including CEO Grant Zinn. </p>



<p>In his new role at M80, Zinn will serve as Chief Business Development Officer, where he will support M80’s expansion and double-down on fandom in exciting, but underserved esports like Pokemon and fast-growing regions like South America.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The core trio that represented Beastcoast – Hotancold, SpiriTz, and Gaveni – has been left out in the cold following this move. They’ve resigned to stay together and add a couple of new players to their squad, but they currently have no banner to fly at the Six Invitational, which takes place in Boston in February.</p>



<p>Previous members of the Beastcoast roster, dfuzr and Gunnar, have unknown futures ahead of them.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Beastcoast beat Team BDS in an unlikely finish in Manchester to secure the trophy at the BLAST R6 Major, the first such win for the organisation in Rainbow Six.</p>
