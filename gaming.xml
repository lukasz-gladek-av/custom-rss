			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> of the official Baldur's Gate 3 modding tools by Larian back in September 2024, the modding community has begun creating full-fledged custom campaigns for the award-winning cRPG. One of the first to get a playable version is '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14914/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Grand Theater - Sell your Lute to the Devil'</a> by Moezilla. Here's the overview provided by the modder:</p>
<p><em>This is a custom modded campaign set nestled on the outskirts of Baldur's Gate, hidden from the prying eyes of the city, stands an imposing, yet strangely inviting structure: The Grand Theater. The flickering lights of lanterns and the alluring sound of music draw in travelers from far and wide, promising an experience of unparalleled entertainment. However, what lies beneath the polished veneer of extravagant performances and mesmerizing illusions is a darker, more sinister story.</em></p>
<p><em>The theater is owned and operated by a powerful faction known as the Red Wizards of Thay—arcane masters and manipulative schemers whose true intentions are often cloaked in secrecy. As they push their hidden agendas, they have crafted a show unlike any other: a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for performers to showcase their talents... but at a cost.</em></p>
<p><em>In the halls of the Grand Theater, you’ll find that the show must go on—but the question remains: who will be the star of the final act, and what will they lose to secure their place under the spotlight?</em></p>
<p><em>This is a world where the Red Wizards hold the strings, and you’ll have to decide whether the cost of fame is worth the price of your soul. Will you play your part, or will the Devil demand his due?</em></p>
<p>The modder warns users that they should have finished the base Baldur's Gate 3 campaign first. This is because Larian has reportedly made it so that if you never encountered some NPCs in the default game, they won't appear in modded campaigns, either.</p>
<p>Additionally, version 1.0 is very limited in its feature set. Players will find around two thousand new lines of dialogue (text-only, no voice acting or lip sync), with six quests that can be started but only one that can be currently completed. There's also no combat yet, though the modder plans to add it to version 1.1.</p>

<p>Some of the most exciting Baldur's Gate 3 custom campaigns to look forward to include Path to Menzoberranzan by Lotrich (who just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oBlmSvi1So" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a video showing off the mod's progress) and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forsaken</a>, which is set in the world of Warcraft, more specifically in the Undead starting zone of Tirisfal Glades. Forsaken is also currently very early, with only the starting area available.</p>

            <p>Torch-trembling spook 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> is getting a new map some time this year, say developers Kinetic Games. It'll be a small one, about the size of one of the haunted houses that make up the co-op horror's roster of cosier locations. And that decision to build small is going to be the plan from now on. No more big maps like the spectre-stalked high schools or mazey psych wards of the past, the developers have decreed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"For future Phasmophobia maps, we’ll be keeping the size relatively small," said Kinetic in <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap">a blog post showing their 2025 roadmap</a>. "This’ll allow us to release more maps, more regularly rather than fewer larger maps."</p>
<p>As for the new map, they haven't revealed its exact setting yet. </p>
<p>"We’re keeping details close to our collective chests, but we can reveal it will be a small map - akin to the houses - in a location that’ll be totally unique to anything we’ve done in Phasmophobia up until now. We’ll share more later this year..."</p>
<p>Hmmm. Mysterious, as befits a ghostly gang. But they did talk about other plans, including reworks to three existing maps: the Bleasdale Farmhouse, Grafton Farmhouse and 6 Tanglewood Drive. Bleasdale will be the first to be refurbished, and that'll arrive in a March update. They also show a "work-in-progress" screenshot of one of the rooms. </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/phasmophobia-new-map-roadmap-2025-2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kinetic Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"These reworks are all about bringing these maps in line with our full vision for them," said Kinetic. "So you can expect to see complete artistic overhauls of each map, including new assets and animations, a high level of visual detail as well as a few layout changes. They’ll still be the maps you’ve grown to love through endless investigations, however."</p>
<p>The last time ghost hunters saw a new location was in June last year, when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/739630/view/6215608421522854557">a lighthouse was added to the lineup</a>. Previous map additions <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/739630/view/3360267827388792766">came in September 2022</a> - the flickering fires of Camp Woodwind the Sunny Meadows Mental Institustion (one of the only two "large" maps in the game). A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/phasmophobias-prison-map-is-here-and-ive-already-been-spooked">bewraithed prison was added</a> back in 2020. .</p>
<p>The roadmap discusses other plans, so it's worth a look if you're a Phasmophiend. The game will see a visual overhaul of player characters, for example, and a more satisfying way of noting evidence of ghostly goings-ons in your journal. There'll also be a repeat of the seasonal events the game has been doing since 2022. Looking much further ahead, they say there'll be more new maps in 2026.</p>
<p>I have only played this freak fest for family 'n' friends a couple of times, diving in with a pal and his crack squad of hunters. I had no idea how to use any of the equipment, while they were all seasoned experts. It was like being the idiot reporter embedded in a SWAT team. I was escorted around by the hand before being led to a closet and told to wait. I was discovered and killed by a terrible, unknowable, unimaginable being. "This is the reason Phasmophobia is one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">our best co-op games</a>," I did not think, because, as I say, I was deceased. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> developer Shift Up expects the forthcoming PC release of its action game to exceed sales of the console release.</p>
<p>As part of its latest financial report, the company was asked about the expected results of Stellar Blade on PC, where it noted the "higher market share" for PC over consoles. It follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-coming-to-pc-in-2025-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-release">similar comments from its previous financial report</a>.</p>
<p>"In the AAA game market, PC devices have a higher market share than consoles, so we expect the performance of the PC version to exceed that of the console version," the company said. "We are particularly observing trends such as the significant expansion of the single-player action game market in the Asian gaming industry."</p>

<p>That "significant expansion" is presumably due to the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.</p>
<p>The company is analysing the market for comparison and also promised an optimised experience, even on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"We have identified and analysed both successful and underperforming cases of console exclusives released on PC, and we are preparing to release the game in a way that ensures continued success in the PC market," the company continued.</p>
<p>"This will include optimisation, enhancing user convenience, adding supplementary content, and tailored marketing strategies unique to Shift Up. In particular, we plan to optimise the game to ensure smooth gameplay even in UMPC (Steam Deck) environments."</p>
<p>The release of Stellar Blade on PC, expected at some point this year, will follow other PlayStation exclusives like God of War, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and most recently <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>.</p>
<p>However, these releases have seen diminishing returns in terms of player numbers. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">Helldivers 2 remains Sony's biggest success on PC</a>, released simultaneously across PC and console.</p>
<p>Other companies are also looking at PC releases of console games. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> in particular has launched a multiplatform strategy, with the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth both released on PC in the last year following PS5 exclusivity.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, meanwhile, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick teased a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">possible PC release for GTA 6</a>, though Rockstar is officially focused on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S for launch.</p>
<p>While Shift Up didn't reveal further sales figures for Stellar Blade, it previously announced it had sold over a million copies in its first couple of months. As a result, Shift Up has now recorded its highest annual revenue with a 30 percent year-on-year increase.</p>
<p>"Despite being a narrative-based single-player game with a defined ending, it has been continuously updated like a live-service game, and has steadily built a strong global fandom for the Stellar Blade IP," the company said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-stellar-blade-on-ps5-pro-a-simple-but-hugely-effective-upgrade">game received a PS5 Pro patch</a> in time for the new console's release, which Digital Foundry described as a "hugely effective upgrade".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It is I, the guy who has only played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a> playing his second autobattler, and getting strong Mechabellum vibes from it. Except, actually no, not at all. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/he-is-coming">He Is Coming</a>, from Chronocle and noted good game recognisers Hooded Horse, is actually a kinda sorta classic roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. You'll be shuffling over a Commodore 64-tified overworld map, grabbing treasure, bumping foes that move when you do, and turn-based autobattling them.</p>
<p>Got wounded? Maybe have a nice rest at that campfire. Not too long, you slovenly wastrel! You're actually on the clock: the 'he' of the title refers to the menagerie of boss creatures that turn up after a set time. The idea is to use your time wisely to prepare for the big fight, getting stronger without getting whittled down too much.</p>

<p>The first thing I get is a sword named 'heartdrinker', which restores one health on a hit. Am I invincible already? Have I won?<em> Then</em> I find an anvil that gives me a 'deal two thorns and take one damage' upgrade to my sword. Will this pair up nicely with my health regen? It absolutely does not. I'm getting battered. The next wolf I fight eats my feet and I die miserably. The game doesn't say "a wolf eats your feet" or anything, but that's what I imagine happened. Wolf's gotta eat.</p>
<p>But what's this! Meta progression between runs! Equipment I unlock by meeting certain criteria, the first of which is simply dying? This, I like. Meta progression in roguelikes is universally good and I'll hear no argument to the contrary (I am actually interested in hearing argument to the contrary).</p>
<p>I trundle around for a bit. Quite a lot of the joy early on is just discovering what all the event nodes do, so I hope this extends long past <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824490/He_is_Coming/">the Steam demo</a>. You might find a font of oil that buffs your sword, or a fairy than can transform equipment. You might just find hedgehogs. I keep killing hedgehogs in a single hit and feeling nothing. Am I broken? My icon shows a knight but I start with a stick? Is this a Don Quixote simulator? How would Don Quixote feel about killing hedgehogs? So many questions. Let's look at Steam for answers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A long-forgotten enemy rises and brings portents of doom – the Demon King is coming, and without a champion to strike him down, the world will surely fall to his corruption. Seek out powerful weapons and artifacts by day, stand against his minions by night, and prepare to be hunted by powerful entities from ages past in this roguelite role-playing game.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that settles it: it's a Sokoban, and it's out sometime this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developer <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html">NetEase last night announced</a> it would implement a mid-season rank reset "to shake up the battlefield" on 21st February.
</p>
<p>
Alongside this, the addition of Fantastic Four members The Thing and Human Torch were also confirmed, completing the superhero family's addition to Marvel Rivals' roster (and tying in nicely with Marvel's newly-released trailer for the Pedro Pascal-starring reboot).

<p>
But feedback to the sudden reveal of a mid-season rank reset was swift, and decidedly negative. 
</p>
<p>
"This is an extremely demotivating idea to rank reset every 45 days," <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1889003952877740498">one fan wrote on social media</a>. "This game is not a battle royale."
</p>
<p>
"No rank resets," wrote another. "It's not a fun and engaging mechanic stop resetting the ranks. I will stop playing this fkn game if you use this cheap tactic to grip players."
</p>
<p>
Roughly 12 hours later, and <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250211/40954_1211177.html">NetEase has this morning issued a fresh update</a> - confirming that the mid-season ranked reset had been scrapped.
</p>
<p>
"We received a wealth of feedback from the community," NetEase confirmed. "A common concern was the pressure associated with having a rank reset every half-season, which has made participating in competitive mode less enjoyable. In light of the community's input, we have decided to make some changes.
</p>
<p>
"When the second half of the season begins, there will be no rank reset," the developer continued. "Players will retain their ranks and scores from the end of the first half. To earn new rewards, players simply need to complete 10 matches in Competitive mode and meet the relevant conditions by the end of the season."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://x.com/itskyoji/status/1889208880174907838">Said one fan in response</a>: "A dev team that makes adjustments almost immediately, unlike my teammates."
</p>
<p>
Marvel Rivals debuted late last year and quickly found an audience, despite an initially mixed criticial response. "NetEase's spin on the hero battler is complex and moreish, but rarely much actual fun," our Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-review">Eurogamer's Marvel Rivals review</a>.

            <p>
I don't play many visual novels, but I've played enough to know that Of The Devil is hot. Hot like the sizzle of rain through a neon signboard as a dull-eyed redhead walks into a cyberpunk police station at 3am and starts throwing around Chandlerisms like she's boiling an egg - <em>and you're the egg</em>. "Information's like cash in my line of work," says the dame, who is a freelance lawyer called Morgan. "You've got to spend it to make it." She sizes up the holographic front desk, with its sprinkling of things to OBSERVE. "Let's see if I can't poke around and shake some change loose."
</p><!--more-->
<p>
If you hate purpulp detective fiction you may have already clicked away, in which case: up yours, Jerky McJerkface, I never liked you anyway. If you're still here, you may be relieved to learn that Of The Devil is capable of taking the piss out of itself, though this is far from parody. For example, one of the first objects you can OBSERVE is a datapad containing a corporate press release which Morgan - whose opening narration muses upon a "slight blunting of the night's ambience, emphasis on the slight" - dismisses as "flowery". One of the first things you can have her do is forget her own date of birth.

<p>
The more indulgent noir flourishes also dissipate as you push on with Morgan's task, which is to defend a guy who has seemingly been caught bang to rights for murdering his girlfriend. You interview a couple of classically mismatched detectives - a lanky whimsical oldster and a snarling young gun with an eyepatch. You use your phone's AR functionality to comb a hot pink projection of the crime scene. The near-future setting takes shape in a glittery wash of allusions to experimental androids and surveillance and unjust laws. The dialogue becomes almost steely.</p><p>As you talk and probe and deduce, filling out your phone's casefiles, you earn casino chips which you'll eventually play in interrogation sequences that resemble high-octane collectible card games. Yes, that line about information being a currency was a tutorial, actually.
</p>
<p>
Even when the writing is laying it on thick, Of The Devil gets away with it because the visuals and audio are a blast. The presentation recalls <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/danganronpa">Danganronpa</a>: fixed-perspective 3D environments, 2D character art and a very dishy interface, with a music player pulsing away in top right. The characters are rakish, crazy-eyed confections with an efficient spread of expressions and changes of posture. While there's no voice-acting, they each get their own pitch of digital typewriter noise during dialogue, which is one of those well-worn, conceptually simple tricks that never fails to delight me.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2739630/of_the_Devil/">Find Of The Devil on Steam</a>. I played the first free prologue chapter this morning for an hour and it really feels like a goer - as cool as the moon reflecting from an android's bum through the smoke from a cigarette kindled on the wrong side of a one-way-street.</p>
<p>It's a pay-per-episode format, with one paid episode available so far. To repeat a cry oftenheard around these parts of late, I don't know if we have the resources to review it, but I intend to play more. Thanks very much to freelance scribe Autumn Wright for <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/theautumnwright.bsky.social/post/3lhpsptjcic2o">spotting the game and boosting it on Bluesky</a>.

            <p>As is tradition at this point, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will have a poison swamp just like previous Souls games.</p>
<p>That said, it's a little different this time. Nightreign will feature "large-scale changes to terrain in the form of procedurally appearing volcanos or swamps or forests".</p>
<p>That's according to director Junya Ishizaki, who spoke to PC Gamer (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreigns-map-will-sometimes-see-large-scale-changes-to-terrain-including-procedurally-appearing-volcanos-forests-and-yes-swamps/">GamesRadar</a>) to discuss these changes to the game's map.</p>

<p>"We wanted the map itself to be a giant dungeon, so players have the chance to traverse and explore a different way every time they play," he says. "You have to choose the boss you want to face at the end of the third day.</p>
<p>"Once you've made that choice, maybe you have an idea of how you want to strategize against that boss, and this might change how you approach the map. We wanted to offer players that agency, to decide 'I need to go after a poison weapon this time to face this boss'."</p>
<p>It certainly seems inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s map changes, that altered familiar locations with the addition of volcanoes and swamps over time, albeit here with the possibility of happening - or not - each match. As previously announced, Nightreign also features a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-is-making-more-elden-ring-after-all-with-the-co-op-elden-ring-night-reign">battle royale-style shrinking zone, as players outlast its day and night cycle</a> over three in-game days. The procedural nature of these terrain changes also fits with what seems to be a roguelike-esque structure to the game.</p>
<p>Indeed, the reveal trailer for the game appears to show a variety of environments we can now assume are procedurally generated, including a seemingly poisonous area and a lava-filled cave.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>That looks pretty poisonous to me | <span>Image credit: <cite>FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Swamps aren't the only returning feature either, as Ishizaki previously confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms">"small number" of enemies from across the Dark Souls series will appear in Nightreign</a>. Eagle-eyed fans already spotted The Nameless King from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> in the trailer, but presumably more will be included, perhaps as part of these randomised events?</p>
<p>It won't be long before we can find out more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-beta-test-dates-times-register">Nightreign as its beta test takes place this weekend</a> for those who previously registered. The test will last from Friday 14th February to Monday 17th February as a series of three hour long sessions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Ready for something to brighten your day? If you’re a fan a vibrant, colourful games with a great art style you might remember Awesomenauts, an incredibly fun 2D online shooter from back in the days of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Well, former members of the team have been tinkering away on Nubs, a vibrant, colourful arena brawler that takes the Awesomenauts philosophy and turns it to smacking people about. It looks awesome, and as of today, you can make your own mind up, with a brand <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3471400/Nubs_Demo/">new demo dropping on Steam</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nubs! - Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrPukGmW4vA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>I love the art style here, with a grotesque but cute vibe that’s all the better for swinging a sword at strangers on the internet. Coming from dual developers Rangatang and Glowfish Interactive, based in the Netherlands and Belgium, it’s a collaborative piece of work that’s hoping to capture gamers around the world.</p>
<p>You can expect multiplayer carnage with up to four friends, and there’s both local couch multiplayer and global online play too. All of that action is going to take place on multi-level arenas, filled with traps and other foes to keep you from victory, while there’s a heap of different game modes and that current favourite, a roguelite progression system to keep you coming back for more.</p>
<p>The Nubs are the cute and spiky protagonists, and there’s a great level of humour here that I can definitely get behind. Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more on Nubs, and look out for a preview of the demo coming soon.</p>


<p>Rangatang Studio was formed from the ashes of Ronimo Studio, the developer of Awesomenauts. Nubs was saved from development hell by the team, carrying on with the work started by Ronimo, and this demo is your chance to see exactly what they’ve been working on. Go check it out!</p>

			<p>Following the new gameplay footage <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-looks-promising-in-new-gameplay-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared last month</a>, Leenzee Games has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53KnH8qJDXI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a developer diary for its upcoming game Wuchang: Fallen Feathers.</p>
<p>Producer Xia Siyuan introduced a new video that delves into the game's lore. Afterward, he talked about game mechanics and even some technical details. For example, we received confirmation that the game is now running on Unreal Engine 5:</p>
<p><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has been upgraded from Unreal Engine 4 to UE5. This brings significant improvements in visual and technical performance. Realistic lighting, scanned models, and physics-based effects, along with a more robust game framework, create a more immersive game experience. This upgrade also allows us to better showcase the cultural essence we aimed to convey.</em></p>
<p>On the combat system, Siyuan said:</p>
<p><em>Skyborn Might represents the power of the Feathered clan, the ability to control over karma. As the core of the game's combat system, Skyborn Might seamlessly blends combo mechanics with RPG builds. The game features five weapon types, with 25 unique weapons spread across these categories. Each weapon offers distinct combat style and combo techniques. Players can equip both a main weapon and a secondary one. Switching weapons and quickly unleashing weapon skills further extend the combo chains.</em></p>
<p><em>The game features 40 different spells, which can be assigned to four spell slots. Players can integrate spells into their weapon combos or choose to forgo weapon combos entirely and create their own spell-focused combat style. We encourage players to build their own unique playstyles. At the Shrine, players can freely try out different weapon skills, discipline skills, and spell combinations without any cost.</em></p>
<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is undoubtedly one of the most promising action RPG games of 2025. Published by 505 Games, it will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. It has also been confirmed that the game will be added to the Game Pass subscription service from its launch day.</p>

<p>That last point is debatable, but I'll let it slide. Also the game costs £4/$5. Cheap game, but if someone tried to charge me that much for coffee I'd be so mad I'd have to actually leave my house and find out how much people charge for coffee these days. Actually, no. No. Sorry. Going to stay in. Got a hole to dig, innit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>To find your mark you zip through hundreds of fairly basic procedurally generated rooms packed with robots which you can destroy with one of the many guns found in the game. Each has waves of enemies as well as jump pads, spikes and other things that will do their best to drain your health. It’s like a procedurally generated Doom, but thee’s a rhythmic shooter element drizzled on top with the ability to choose the soundtrack that accompanies your rampage.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROBOBEAT | Console Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0xSVU39hNnw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You’re graded on how close to the beat of the music you fire your weapons, trying to chain beats together and masting combos to lead to more effective and stylish combat sequences. Combining weapon attacks with movement abilities like the Hook can create powerful combos that deal significant damage to enemies. The mechanic for engaging the power-up combinations does take a while to master and in the heat of the battle it’s very easy to mess them up, but they are satisfying once you have a handle on the controls. During each run you may also get a chance to pick up cards which further enhance your skills by adding bonus effects like fire or reduced damage.</p>
<p>While the maps are procedurally generated you do get clues as to what the next room will hold so once you have cleared a room you can take a second to get your breath back and decide where to go next, more enemies or perhaps a detour to pick up a new weapon blueprint, or a new soundtrack. The game features a variety of ranged and melee weapons from the usual pistols and shotguns to the more esoteric choices such as [ing-pong bat and ball, each offering unique advantages and playstyles. I found the shotguns to be great fun.</p>

<p>In general, I do recommend you tweak the default values for the aim assist as this is incredibly strong and often had my camera swinging off wildly to track an enemy in the background, despite one already being in my sights.</p>

<p>For those who can’t dance, Robobeat offers the unique option of turning off the beat-matching mechanic and playing the game as a standard procedural shooter. This may seem counter to the point of the game but it does allow those without any sense of rhythm to play, which is a nice touch. You might find yourself heading to that option anyway, as the game does get rather difficult as you work your way through the levels. All your deaths will be your fault – there’s no nasty traps or silly game logic – but it does get incredibly frantic, especially during boss battles.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the option to import your music which is found in the PC version is not available on PlayStation, so you are stuck with the in-game soundtracks which are mostly pounding EDM tunes with a few rock tracks thrown in for good measure. Personally. I found them to be all quite good, but if you’re not a dance music fan this may not be the game for you, at least on consoles.</p>
<p>There’s also an interesting story to uncover with notes scattered around explaining what has been going on, and glitchy videos seem to suggest an even bigger story. You don’t have to chase these, but it does add an extra layer to the game.</p>

		
		

<p>The least interesting part of Robobeat is its graphics. Everything is fairly blocky and the enemy designs are quite generic, however this is the work of one developer, Simon Fredholm, and he’s done a great job in everything else.</p>

			<p>TiMi Studio's Team Jade has announced the release date for Delta Force Black Hawk Down. The first-person shooter game's campaign mode will be available on PC starting on February 21 at 02:00 UTC+0.</p>
<p>The Black Hawk Down mode will be added to Delta Force, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-gets-pc-open-beta-test-on-december-5-console-due-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in early December as a free to play Open Beta. So far, though, the game hasn't exactly thrived. On Steam, the average score for recent user reviews is at a meager 63%, while the average score for overall user reviews is at 68%. We'll know soon if this new mode, which will be playable solo or in co-op, can turn it around for Team Jade.</p>

This isn't a shooting gallery - it's war. Every turn could be your last, and survival is never guaranteed.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>A FAITHFUL REBOOT</strong> - The BLACK HAWK DOWN co-op campaign is a faithful reboot of the classic 2001 film and a heartfelt love letter to fans of the original 2003 Delta Force: Black Hawk Down, breathing new life into those legendary stories and moments.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>PLAY AS A TEAM</strong> - Only the best squads survive. Choose your class, customize your loadout, and, most importantly, move as a unit to overcome the unprecedented challenges ahead.</em></li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-the-order-1886-didn%E2%80%99t-get-a-sequel-as-planned.1105587/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/why-the-order-1886-didnt-get-sequel/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Order: 1886 was a one-and-done game released on PlayStation 4 in 2015. It was a pretty good title, pieced together by Ready at Dawn and offering players an immersive, original single-player campaign. It plunged gamers into an alt-history version of London in, you guessed it, 1886, pitting them against werewolves and vampires, among other things.</p>



<p>The Order: 1886 was a deeply cinematic affair, and even the game’s aspect ratio promoted a sense of ‘playing a movie’, but it wasn’t enough to warrant a follow-up title, despite one being planned by Ready at Dawn. In a recent interview, the studio’s co-founder explained <strong>why </strong>a sequel never arrived.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-missed-it-by-that-much">Missed it by That Much</h2>



<p>In an interview with MinnMax uncovered by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ready-at-dawn-co-founder-discusses-failed-the-order-1886-sequel-pitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VGC</a>, it’s revealed why The Order: 1886 didn’t receive a sequel, despite many players asking for one over the years. As the discussion unfolded in the 24-minute sequence, Ready at Dawn’s Andrea Pessino explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think it was the sales – I think it was the critical reception.</p>



<p>Sony is a very proud group and rightfully so, and the critical reception, if it had even been just in the 70s, we would have had the sequel, I’m convinced.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pessino was referring to The Order: 1886’s Metacritic score, which landed on a not-so-good 63 post-launch. That was despite the game testing well and generating solid responses from previews and mock interviews, Pessino reported.</p>



<p>The Order: 1886’s follow-up title should have arrived in 2018 if everything had gone as planned. Ultimately, the team at Ready at Dawn had to slice and dice the opening game to meet Sony’s deadlines, resulting in some of the game’s more innovative and engaging segments effectively becoming sheer cinematics:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the problems is that so much was cut.</p>



<p>A lot of the more subtle narrative parts were lost because so much was chopped away and things that were supposed to be interactive became a movie.</p>



<p>We needed another year, that’s the reality. We needed at least one more year, we didn’t get it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full interview:</p>

</p></figure>







<p><br>The Order: 1886 is one of those games that’ll go down in history as <strong>needing a sequel</strong>. It fits in nicely alongside the likes of Bloodborne, another PlayStation 4 game that, for many years, fans worldwide have cried out for a follow-up title to.</p>

<p>G2 Esports was the front-runner to win the Six Invitational 2025 in Boston, but then the team ran into the underdogs. That’s part and parcel of the esports industry, and from one day to the next, it remains dramatically unpredictable.</p>



<p>In the group stage, G2 put up one hell of a result, coasting through the opening portion of the Six Invitational 2025 without dropping a single map – a record that no other team could replicate. However, going into the playoffs, the team faltered, falling short in back-to-back fixtures and being eliminated from the running.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-g2-out">G2 Out</h2>



<p>In the playoffs of the Six Invitational 2025, G2 Esports met its match <strong>twice</strong>, losing first to Spacestation and then again to Oxygen Esports in the elimination bracket. The Spacestation loss was tough enough, but Oxygen was barely in the running during the group stage and only just managed to secure qualification for the playoffs.</p>



<p>This huge loss was dealt with a strong blow, too – G2 failed to secure a point against Oxygen before imploding and dropping out of the $3 million flagship tournament.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the likes of M80, Shopify Rebellion, Team Liquid, w7m Esports, DarkZero, Virtus, and CAG all departed the competition.</p>



<p>Recently, drama struck the Six Invitational as <a href="https://x.com/R6esports/status/1889027697776456021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">M80’s coach exploded</a> against DarkZero’s roster, going on a tirade and exhibiting extremely aggressive behaviour. The act earned him a two-year competitive suspension and landed M80 with a $10,000 fine. To put that into perspective, M80 walked away from the tournament with just $55,000 in earnings.</p>



<p>Only eight teams remain in the Six Invitational 2025 lineup going forward:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team BDS</li>



<li>Spacestation</li>



<li>Razah</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>Oxygen</li>



<li>Unwanted</li>
</ul>



<p>The predictions have shifted, and now Team BDS sits in the top spot and is the odds-on favourite to win the event and the $1 million grand prize.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-shift-up-record-year/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-helped-push-shift-up-to-a-record-breaking-year-in-2024.1105569/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-shift-up-record-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Stellar Blade was released in April 2024, emerging to a solid reception and strong sales on PlayStation 5. It has since remained in the minds of fans worldwide, with developer Shift Up plugging away to keep the content stream relatively well stoked. From a festive-themed update to a Nier crossover event, Stellar Blade hasn’t been forgotten just yet.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=225&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent financial update</a>, Shift Up revealed that Stellar Blade was a key component in the company securing record-high revenue streams in 2024. The post-apocalyptic action title generated $43.2 million in royalties, and per the financial update, it ‘continues to sell well’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-hopes">High Hopes</h2>



<p>Stellar Blade will be expanding from the confines of PlayStation this year, with a fresh version of the game landing on PC. Shift Up has already suggested that the game will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-is-releasing-for-pc-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell even better on PC</a>, giving the IP a new lease on life.</p>



<p>In the last year that the game has been on the market, it has generated more than $40 million in royalties for Shift Up. At the same time, the company’s mainstay title, Goddess of Victory: Nikke, generated around $105.4 million, making up around 70% of the studio’s income.</p>



<p>Before Stellar Blade hit the market, Shift Up started talking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-dev-already-teasing-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about its next project</a>, which was later revealed to be dubbed ‘Project Witches’. It’s set to emerge in (or after) 2027, but nothing else is known about the game.</p>



<p>In a world being driven down by layoffs and studio closures, Shift Up plans to expand, hiring around 100 people by the end of 2025. The future looks relatively bright for this South Korean studio, and I for one am excited to see what comes next from the team.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-esports-world-cup-riot-deal/</link>

<p>Riot Games has signed a three-year partnership with the Esports World Cup Foundation to bring a trio of titles to the hyper-valuable event. From this year, League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics, and most importantly, <strong>VALORANT</strong> will appear at the Esports World Cup event in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>This will mark the first time that VALORANT has appeared at the event, as last year during the inaugural showcase, the game failed to surface.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-cultural-impact-of-competitive-gaming">‘The Cultural Impact of Competitive Gaming’</h2>



<p>The Esports World Cup is the biggest modern event in competitive gaming. It boasts a collective prize pool worth tens of millions of dollars, and it plays host to the industry’s biggest games and most talented players. For many, it’s an immoral event seen as ‘esportswashing’ and nothing more, but for others, it’s a monumental thing that’s set to become a staple of the wider business.</p>



<p>In a recent release, it was revealed that VALORANT will appear alongside League and TFT at the Esports World Cup 2025. During 2024’s event, VALORANT didn’t appear, so this will be the first time that the game has a place at the EWC:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Riot Games has <strong>shaped the cultural impact of competitive gaming</strong>, transforming esports into a global entertainment force.&nbsp;With League of Legends’ iconic World Championship — which continues to set new standards for immersive experiences, Valorant’s cultural collaborations, and Teamfight Tactics’ community-driven events, Riot has pioneered an ecosystem far beyond the competition. </p>



<p>By bringing these titles to the Esports World Cup, we are not just celebrating elite gameplay — we are, together, expanding esports as a global entertainment movement, creating deeper connections with fans across gaming, music, and digital culture</p>



<p>– Fabian Scheuermann, Chief Games Officer at EWCF.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Riot Games representatives explained that last year was an evaluation of sorts, and that’s why VALORANT wasn’t one of the games to appear at the Esports World Cup in 2024. In a post, the team explained, <em>‘The feedback we got from players and teams who participated last year was positive. The event’s significant prize pool offered crucial financial support for them, providing stability at a time when many esports organizations were working toward a stronger future.’</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/iconic-mmo-new-class-1997-tibia-monk/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-iconic-mmo-is-getting-a-new-class-for-the-first-time-since-1997.1105560/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/iconic-mmo-new-class-1997-tibia-monk/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I’ve been playing Tibia since 2004 – but not <strong>consistently</strong>. I’ll dip in and out of the game around special events, but it remains my number one most-played game of all time simply because of how long I’ve been a user. Recently, Tibia’s developer, CipSoft, revealed that <span>the game is getting a ne</span>w character class –&nbsp;<strong>Monk </strong>– for the first time in almost thirty years.</p>



<p>Those familiar with Tibia’s four-class paradigm are about to have their worlds shattered.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-monk">Enter the Monk</h2>



<p>CipSoft has unveiled Monk, an all-new character class coming to Tibia later this year. This humble MMORPG was released in 1997 with four core character pillars: Knight, Sorcerer, Paladin, and Druid. That structure has remained fundamentally unchanged for almost thirty years – until now.</p>



<p>With a very short trailer posted online, the CipSoft team revealed the Monk character class:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tibia - Vocation Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMzXYOz6o7I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>This new Tibia vocation promises to be a capable hand-to-hand fighter that can use ‘mystical abilities’ to heal allies while pummeling enemies into dust. Here’s the full description of the new character type:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Monk</strong>&nbsp;will be a melee fighter capable of supporting and healing allies while using martial arts and mystical abilities to defeat enemies. The great truth seeker will have some very special features, such as&nbsp;<em>harmony</em>,<em>&nbsp;virtues</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>serene</em>.&nbsp;A&nbsp;<strong>Monk</strong>&nbsp;can be played in a very special way and, at the same time, is expected to integrate seamlessly into the Tibian world. In fact, one of our main goals was to ensure that the new vocation holds a unique position without undermining the value of others or rendering them obsolete.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From February 25, CipSoft will be holding player tests for the Monk class, and later this year, the vocation will be permanently added to Tibia, which is still going strong after 28 years on the market.</p>



<p>It’s incredible to see CipSoft pouring so much love into Tibia after all these years. It was only a couple of years ago that the developers decided to add sound to the game, implementing audio effects and a soundtrack alongside countless other updates. The core aesthetic of Tibia has remained unchanged since 1997, but the game is still evolving today.</p>



<p>To learn more about the new Monk class,  check out the full breakdown from CipSoft’s ‘Niadus’ <a href="https://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=latestnews&amp;id=8215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on the Tibia website</a>.</p>

                <p>RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic is a unique game that combines the best aspects of the first two titles in the series to create something entirely new. It met with positive reviews when it first launched on PC and mobile in 2016, and now it’s gearing up for a physical release on Switch that is available to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder</a> ahead of its April 24 release. Preordering at Amazon locks in its price guarantee, so if the game is discounted ahead of launch, you’ll pay the lower price. You also won’t be charged until the game is shipped.</p><h2>Rollercoaster Tycoon Classic Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>There are currently no preorder bonuses for RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic. It’s unlikely that’ll change in the coming weeks, though if anything is announced, we’ll update this section with details.</p><div title="6529329 - RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic Preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3152" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6529329 - RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic Preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic Physical Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$30 | Releases April 24</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic is essentially the best parts of RollerCoaster Tycoon and RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Just like those games, you'll build, customize, and manage your own theme park. Along with the option to simply build and manage your park in a free-form effort, there’s a structured Park Scenarios system that tasks you with completing 95 challenges from the first two games. This version of the game includes the Toolkit, Wacky Worlds, and Time Twister expansion packs. Physical editions are available to preorder at most retailers.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-playstation-network-outage-is-modern-gaming-in-a-nutshell.1105491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sony-playstation-network-outage-psn-ps5-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend, PlayStation Network – the backbone of PS5 and PS4’s online services – <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/521195/playstation-network-down-outage-psn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went down</a> for roughly 24 hours. If we’re talking video game service outages in recent memory, it doesn’t get much longer than that. You’d think that Sony would want to provide some sort of explanation for such an unprecedented halt to basic functionality. But you’d be wrong.</p><p>After enduring a day of confused clamor across social media and Reddit, Sony published <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a brief statement</a> to Twitter on Saturday, gifting PS Plus members an additional five days of service and saying that PSN had “fully recovered from an operational issue.” What kind of operational issue? Did it come from inside the house, or were hackers to blame – like during the 2011 PSN outage, so noteworthy that it has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_PlayStation_Network_outage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its own Wikipedia entry</a>? Unclear! But it’s over now, so who cares. It’s yesterday’s news. Move on.</p><p>Never mind that as a result of the outage, some people lost access not just to multiplayer games, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/521519/playstation-network-outage-psn-single-player-games-not-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">singleplayer games and features</a> – a stark reminder of the fact that <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-comfortable-owning-game-prince-of-persia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we don’t own our games anymore</a>, even as price tags grow and developer headcounts shrink. This also puts into perspective Sony’s insistence on shoehorning PSN requirements into PC ports like <em>Helldivers 2</em> and <em>God of War: Ragnarok</em>, which PC players openly rebelled against for the better part of a year until Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally relented</a> just a couple weeks ago with the PC release of <em>Spider-Man 2</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>In that case, too, Sony repeatedly failed to provide a compelling explanation for its actions. In May 2024, <em>Helldivers 2</em> was <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-psn-login-steam-review-bomb-arrowhead-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">briefly removed from sale on Steam</a> in 177 countries due to the PSN requirement, and yet, the best Sony could offer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4196868529806518741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the time</a> was a claim that PSN was necessary to “protect players from griefing and abuse by enabling the banning of players that engage in that type of behaviour,” something plenty of non-PSN games have proven perfectly capable of doing. Sony’s main objective is clearly to corral PC players into PSN’s ecosystem and monopolize their attention, but it refuses to just come out and say that. So now that requirements have failed, it’s dressing up its desire with <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-game incentives</a> like early unlocks of cosmetics that can already be obtained via other means.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Just like the PSN requirement, this new incentive-based approach feels almost insultingly low effort. Why should anybody make an account for a service with an ulterior motive that offers little benefit when the best Sony can do in the face of a worrying wobble is act like it’s all business as usual? Why would anyone <em>want </em>to be assimilated into that ecosystem if they can avoid it?&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing needs to work this way. Nobody benefits from not being able to access single-player games and features when servers go down. There is no upside to <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-ea-paradox-launcher-pc-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">logging into multiple game services at once</a> that outweighs the downsides. And being left in the dark about all of it – even if the underlying cause of major issues was relatively mundane – just leads to speculation and catastrophizing. It erodes trust.&nbsp;</p><p>But, contrary to the meaning of the term, services created by companies like Sony no longer seek to serve users; they are first and foremost means of control, extensions of the attention economy. When viewed through that lens, Sony’s actions here make sense. Control is a one-way street, not a relationship. You’ll take what you’re given, and you’ll like it. You’ll enjoy your five additional days of service, and you will not think beyond them.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/metaphor-refantazio-lynch"><h3>Fantasy At The End Of The World</h3></a><p>A new world is possible, but only if we log off and put in the work</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Almost all the major Capcom series are here, though don't expect many new titles. The picks mostly include HD remasters and collections of classic entries in series like Ace Attorney, Mega Man, Devil May Cry, Street Fighter, Resident Evil, and more. One of the only major omissions is the Monster Hunter series--likely because Fanatical recently ran a separate Monster Hunter Bundle that is unfortunately no longer available.</p><p dir="ltr">The pricing structure is like Fanatical's other build-your-own bundle deals, with the price per key dropping as you add more games to your bundle. The savings aren't as high as most Fanatical bundle deals, but you're still getting big discounts on most titles. The deal starts at $13 for two games ($6.50 per key), three games for 19 ($6.33 per key), and four games for $25 ($6.25 per key). There's no limit to how many games you can add, meaning you can grab all 21 games for $131.25 if you want. </p><ul><li dir="ltr">Capcom Beat 'em Up Bundle</li><li dir="ltr">Dead Rising 4 - Frank's Big Package</li><li dir="ltr">Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Devil May Cry 5 + Vergil</li><li dir="ltr">DmC: Devil May Cry</li><li dir="ltr">Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective</li><li dir="ltr">The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles</li><li dir="ltr">Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite - Definitive Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Mega Man 11</li><li dir="ltr">Mega Man X Legacy Collection</li><li dir="ltr">Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2</li><li dir="ltr">Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection</li><li dir="ltr">Onimusha: Warlords</li><li dir="ltr">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil &amp; Resident Evil 0 Double Pack</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil 2 Remake</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil 3 Remake</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil 4 (2005) &amp; Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition Double Pack</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</li><li dir="ltr">Street Fighter: 30th Anniversary Collection</li><li dir="ltr">Street Fighter V: Championship Edition</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-buy-one-get-one-half-off-movie-tv-shows-blu-ray-amazon-february-2025/1100-6529351/">Amazon Kicks Off B1G1 50% Off Movie And TV Series Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-accessory-sale-how-to-save-20-on-playstation-portal-helldivers-2-dualsense-controller-and-more/1100-6529304/">PS5 Accessory Sale - How To Save 20% On PlayStation Portal, Helldivers 2 DualSense Controller, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-preorder-deals-collectors-edition-amazon/1100-6526606/">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii Collector's Edition In Stock At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-on-sid-meiers-civilization-7-preorders-for-pc-mac-early-access-starts-february-6/1100-6525971/">Save On Sid Meier's Civilization 7 Preorders For PC &amp; Mac - Early Access Starts February 6</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-airpods-4-discounted-to-only-100-at-amazon/1100-6526375/">Apple AirPods 4 Discounted To Only $100 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-riffmaster-guitar-controller-gets-biggest-discount-yet/1100-6528970/">Fortnite Festival Riffmaster Guitar Controller Gets Biggest Discount Yet</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-preorders-where-to-get-steelbook-edition-and-best-deals/1100-6526687/">Monster Hunter Wilds Preorders - Where To Get Steelbook Edition And Best Deals</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geforce-rtx-50-series-gpus-launched-today-but-its-not-easy-to-grab-one/1100-6528684/">GeForce RTX 50-Series GPUs Launched Today, But It's Not Easy To Grab One</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Hopefully, that means we'll see a new single-player entry in the series soon. Either way now is a great time to be a Legacy of Kain fan. Even better, it's also a great time to get into the series if you're new to the games, too, as most of which have been re-released on modern platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">The Soul Reaver duology only represents one chunk of the overarching Legacy of Kain timeline. The franchise started with <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fblood_omen_legacy_of_kain&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen</a>, which follows Kain's transformation into a vampire, and its events serve as the basis for the rest of the series and are even revisited--and reframed--by Soul Reaver's time-hopping plot. It was followed up with <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_blood_omen_2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blood Omen 2</a>, and while it's largely disconnected from the events of Soul Reaver, it furthers Kain's characterization and Nosgoth's history. Both games are available on the PlayStation Store and on PC via GOG and Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">The storyline capped off with Legacy of Kain: Defiance, which directly follows the events of Soul Reaver 1 and 2, and features both Raziel and Kain as playable characters. Fair warning that it ends on a cliffhanger--which is part of why fans have been pining for a new game in the series--but it at least offers some closure on the events of the Soul Reaver arc and is worth grabbing after completing the remastered collection. Legacy of Kain: Defiance is only available on PC (unless you get your hands on a used PS2 copy), but it's currently <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_defiance&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">discounted to less than $1 at GOG</a> (normally $7).</p><h2 dir="ltr">Legacy of Kain PC Game Deals</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fblood_omen_legacy_of_kain&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen</a> -- $7</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_blood_omen_2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2</a> -- $7</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_soul_reaver_12_remastered&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered</a> -- $22.49 (<del>$30</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_defiance&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Defiance</a> -- $0.97 (<del>$7</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-buy-one-get-one-half-off-movie-tv-shows-blu-ray-amazon-february-2025/1100-6529351/">Amazon Kicks Off B1G1 50% Off Movie And TV Series Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-accessory-sale-how-to-save-20-on-playstation-portal-helldivers-2-dualsense-controller-and-more/1100-6529304/">PS5 Accessory Sale - How To Save 20% On PlayStation Portal, Helldivers 2 DualSense Controller, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-preorder-deals-collectors-edition-amazon/1100-6526606/">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii Collector's Edition In Stock At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp;

This particular model boasts a massive 25,000mAh battery capacity, 165W of total charging output, and two built-in USB Type-C cables in case you forget to bring your own. It's also attractively priced at under $100, and there's even a deal today that drops the price by another $10 to $89.99. This is a great complement to your power-hungry gaming handheld PC like the Steam Deck, Asus Rog Ally, or Lenovo Legion Go.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New Release: Anker 25,000mAh 165W Power Bank</h2><div catalogid="8479891f-e34a-4cd8-951d-5230aeb5aeed" id="215024"><div id="215024" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Anker 25,000mAh 165W Power Bank with Two Built-In USB Type-C Cables</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Anker power bank features a 25,000mAh battery capacity, which is the second largest capacity we've seen from Anker in a compact form factor. So how much juice will that offer to today's gaming handheld PCs? A 25,000mAh battery equates to a 95Whr capacity. An 80% power efficiency rating (which is standard for power banks) means you get about 76Whr of usable charge. That means this power bank will charge a Steam Deck or ROG Ally (40Whr) from empty to completely full <strong>2 times</strong>, an Asus ROG Ally X (80Whr) <strong>1 time</strong>, and a Nintendo Switch (16Whr) about <strong>4.75 times</strong>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Anker power bank has one USB Type-C port and one USB Type-A port. In addition, there are two built-in USB Type-C cables. One is a retractable cable that can extend up to 2.3 feet. The other is a fixed 1-foot cable that doubles up as a lanyard when not in use. Each USB Type-C port is capable of up to 100W of Power Delivery with a total 165W maximum output. That means all three USB outputs are capable of charging any gaming handheld PC at its fastest rate, including the Asus ROG Ally X, which supports up to 100W of fast charging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another feature common to Anker's other premium power banks is the digital LCD readout. It displays a wealth of information like remaining battery capacity, current charging rate, input/output wattage, battery temperature, battery health, charge cycle count, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TSA-Approved</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">TSA states that power banks must be under 100Whr in capacity for carry-on (check-in is not allowed under any circumstances). This Anker power bank is rated at 95Whr. You might get checked simply because this is a relatively hefty power bank, but you shouldn't have any problems getting it cleared.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">See more power banks we've recommended</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Chapter 6 has gotten off to a pretty strong start, adding new permanent modes with Fortnite OG and Ballistic, dropping a full-sized Godzilla on the island, and ushering in the game's Hatsune Miku era. But Chapter 6 Season 2 is just around the corner, bringing with it a whole new slate of attractions. With a few days to go before Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 starts, here's everything we know so far.</p><h2>When does Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 begin?</h2><p>Season 1 is currently scheduled to come to a close on February 21 at 11 PM PT/ 2 AM ET. That would mean that Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 should begin a few hours later on the morning of Friday, February 21.</p><h2>Will Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 1 have a live finale event?</h2><p>The Jan. 31 update added some interesting items to the Fortnite game files, including many indications that Season 1 <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1885260657940971852" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will end with some sort of ambient live event</a> on the battle royale island to bring the season story to a close. What exactly the event will entail is still a mystery, but the first stage of buildup has begun--the NPC Daigo has moved on from the spot in the Nightshift Forest where he's been battling demons all season and has taken up new residence by the unused portal in the mountains above Warrior's Watch, and that is where the big finale will go down.</p><h2>Fortnite chapter 6 Season 2 battle pass and season theme</h2><p>No part of the battle pass has leaked just yet, but we've got a big hint in the form of a theme: <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1886127448703533108" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reportedly</a>, Chapter 6 Season 2 will be <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1886129502956249167" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another heist season</a>. Fortnite has had a lot of heist seasons, including two different ones in Chapter 4. Since Chapter 6 already echoes Chapter 4 with the feudal theme and a throwback version of the Japan biome from that map--Seaport City is basically proto-Mega City in terms of its layout and structure, and the surrounding areas are very similar--the return of a prominent Chapter 4 theme isn't too shocking.</p><p>Epic Games co-founder Mark Rein has the seasonal tradition of teasing each upcoming season with a single word--his word for Season 12 is <a href="https://x.com/MarkRein/status/1889054637803593935" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"pickled."</a> We don't know what all that terms entails, but it likely has something to do with the Kappa Kappa pickle factory that was added to the map last month, and all those little posters there that appear to depict a pickled version of Peely. So I'd expect a big pickle man skin in the battle pass, at least.</p><h2>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 potential collabs</h2><p>Like we said above, there aren't any confirmed details yet about Chapter 6 Season 2 cosmetics. But there are some rumored collaborations coming up that may fall into Season 2. In particular, there have been reports of <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1885257390993342568" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cosmetics based on James Cameron's Avatar, </a>and <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1885281187586822448" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a customizable Iron Man skin</a>. Both of these leaked collabs could happen during Season 1, but I think that's unlikely for the Iron Man skin specifically because there are also rumors of new cosmetics tied to Captain America: Brave New World, which is in theaters on February 14.</p><p>It seems unlikely that Marvel would undercut its own timely collab for a skin that could be released literally any time, and a customizable Iron Man skin sounds more like a battle pass thing anyway, given the lack of style options we've seen among item shop collab skins for the past year. See, for example, the Iron Man Mk. 45 skin that Epic dropped in the shop last fall, which had no style options at all.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fortnite has been advertising heavily during WWE events lately, including Monday Night RAW in January, Royal Rumble on February 1, and also the upcoming Elimination Chamber in March. But none of the existing WWE skins have even appeared in the item shop in seven months and counting, so we're overdue for some wrestling content in Fortnite.</p><h2>Other rumors and leaks for Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2</h2><p>One particularly interesting change that Epic made with Chapter 6 was to allow players to use their Festival guitars and other instruments as pickaxes and back blings, dramatically increasing the hypothetical usefulness of those cosmetics--if you like hitting things with guitars, anyway. Now, reportedly, Epic is looking at doing something similar with kicks by <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1887927606747500639" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">turning the shoes that certain skins are wearing into kicks</a>--meaning, for example, that buying the Green Roots Billie skin would also grant you her green and black Air Force 1 Mids as kicks to use on any skin.</p><p>Stick around as we'll be updating this roundup of Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 news, rumors, and leaks frequently as we approach the start date.</p>
