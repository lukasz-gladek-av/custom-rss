            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/638490/microsoft-kinect-ghost-hunting<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Billy Tolley swings a Microsoft Kinect around an abandoned room in sudden, jittery movements. “Whoa!” he says. “Dude, it was so creepy.” On the display, we see an anomaly of arrows, spheres, and red lines that disappears almost as soon as it arrives. For Tolley and Zak Bagans, two members of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG17LDeGs14">Ghost Adventures</a> YouTube channel, this is enough to suggest they should leave the building. Because for this team and other similar enthusiasts, that seemingly innocuous blotter of white arrows means something more terrifying: a glimpse at specters and phantoms invisible to the human eye. </p><p>Fifteen years after its release, just about the only people still buying the Microsoft Kinect are ghost hunters like Tolley and Bagans. Though the body-tracking camera, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542870/microsoft-kinect-dead-stop-manufacturing">was discontinued in 2017</a>, started as a gaming peripheral, it also enjoyed a spirited afterlife <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/6/2616242/kinect-hacks">outside of video games</a>. But in 2025, its most notable application is helping paranormal investigators, like the Ghost Adventures team, in their attempts at documenting the afterlife.</p><p>The Kinect’s ability to convert the data from its body-tracking sensors into an on-screen skeletal dummy delights these investigators, who allege the figures it shows in empty space are, in fact, skeletons of the spooky, scary variety. Looking at it in use — the Kinect is particularly popular with ghost-hunting YouTubers — it’s certainly producing results, showing human-like figures where there are none. The question is: why?</p><p>With the help of ghost hunters and those familiar with how the Kinect actually works, <em>The Verge</em> set out to understand why the perhaps most misbegotten gaming peripheral has gained such a strong foothold in the search for the paranormal.</p><p>Part of the reason is purely technical. “The Kinect’s popularity as a depth camera for ghost hunting stems from its ability to detect depth and create stick-figure representations of humanoid shapes, making it easier to identify potential human-like forms, even if faint or translucent,” says Sam Ashford, founder of ghost-hunting equipment store <a href="https://www.spiritshack.co.uk/about-us/">SpiritShack</a>.</p><p>This is made possible by the first-generation Kinect’s structured light system. By projecting a grid of infrared dots into an environment — even a dark one — and reading the resulting pattern, the Kinect can detect deformations in the projection and, through a machine-learning algorithm, discern human limbs within those deformations. The Kinect then converts that data into a visual representation of a stick figure, which, in its previous life, was pumped back into games like <em>Dance Central</em> and <em>Kinect Sports</em>.</p><div><p>The Kinect isn’t always seeing what it thinks it is</p></div><p>When it was released in 2010, the first-gen Kinect was cutting-edge technology: a high-powered, robust, and lightweight depth camera that condensed what would usually retail upward of $6,000 into a $150 peripheral. Today, you can find a Kinect on eBay for around $20. Ghost hunters, however, typically mount it to a carry handle and a tablet and upsell it for around $400-600, rebranded as a “structured light sensor” (SLS) camera. “The user will direct the camera to a certain point of the room where they believe activity to be present,” says Andy Bailey, founder of a gear shop for ghost hunters called <a href="https://www.infraready.co.uk/">Infraready</a>. “The subject area will be absent of human beings. However, the camera will often calculate and display the presence of a skeletal image.”</p><p>Though this is often touted as proof we’re all bound for an eternity haunting aging hotels and abandoned prisons, Bailey urges caution, telling would-be ghost hunters that the cameras are best paired with other equipment to “provide an additional layer of supporting evidence.” For this, Ghost Hunters Equipment, the retail arm of haunted tour operator <a href="https://ghostaugustine.com/">Ghost Augustine</a> recommends that “EMF readings, temperature, baseline readings, and all of that are essential when considering authentication of paranormal activity.”</p><p>That’s because the Kinect isn’t always seeing what it thinks it is. But what <em>is</em> it actually seeing? Did Microsoft, while trying to break into a motion-control market monopolized by the Nintendo Wii, accidentally create a conduit through which we might glimpse the afterlife? Sadly, no.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>The Kinect is actually a straightforward piece of hardware. It is trained to recognize the human body, and assumes that it’s always looking at one — because that’s what it’s designed to do. Whatever you show it, whether human or humanoid or something entirely different, it will try and discern human anatomy. If the Kinect is not 100 percent sure of its position, it might even look like the figure it displays is moving. “We may recognise the face of Jesus in a piece of toast or an elephant in a rock formation,” says Jon Wood, <a href="https://jonwoodscience.com/">a science performer</a> who has a show devoted to examining ghost hunting equipment. “Our brains are trying to make sense of the randomness.” The Kinect does much the same, except it cannot overrule its hunches. </p><p>That suits ghost hunters just fine, of course: the Kinect’s habit of finding human shapes where there are none is a crowd-pleaser. The Kinect, deployed in dark rooms bathed in infrared light from cameras and torches, wobbling in the hands of excitable ghost hunters as it tries to read a precise grid of infrared points, is almost guaranteed to show them what they want to see.</p><p>Much of ghost hunting depends on ambiguity. If you’re searching for proof of something, be it the afterlife or not, logic suggests you’d want tools that can provide the clearest results, the better to cement the veracity of that proof. Ghost hunters, however, prefer technology that will produce results of any kind: murky recordings on 2000s voice recorders that might be mistaken for voices, low-resolution videos haunted by shadowy artifacts, and any cheap equipment that can call into question the existence of dust (sorry, <a href="https://www.spiritshack.co.uk/blog/ghost-hunting/what-are-orbs-and-what-do-orbs-mean/?srsltid=AfmBOop0q1b5vRMlNWw7sKVl1DCra20mlKMdO0a4-hpSqFJWqCsj1Scz"><em>spirit</em> <em>orbs</em></a>) — bonus points if battery life is temperamental.</p><p>“I’ve watched ghost hunters use two different devices for measuring electromagnetic fields (EMF),” Wood says. “One would be an accurate and expensive Trifled TF2, that never moves unless it actually encounters an electrical field. The other would be a £15 [$18], no-brand, ‘KII’ device with five lights that go berserk when someone so much as sneezes. Which one was more popular, do you think?”</p><div><p>Glitches aren’t tolerated — they’re <em>encouraged</em></p></div><p>Given the notoriously unreliable skeletal tracking of the Kinect — most non-gaming applications bypass the Kinect’s default SDKs, preferring to process its raw data by other, less error-prone, means — it would be stranger if it <em>didn’t </em>see figures every time it’s deployed. But that’s the point. Like so much technology ghost hunters use, the Kinect’s flaws aren’t bugs or glitches. They’re not tolerated — they’re <em>encouraged</em>.</p><p>“If a person pays good money to enjoy a ghost hunt, what are they after?” Wood asks. “They prime themselves for a ‘spooky encounter’ and open up to the suggestion of anything being ‘evidence of a ghost’ — they want to find a ghost, so they make sure they do.”</p><p>If it were just the skeletal tracking that ghost hunters were after, better options are now possible with a simple color image. But improved methodology wouldn’t return the false-positives that maintain belief, and so skeletal tracking from 2010 is preferred. None of this is likely to move the needle for those who believe towards something more skeptical. But we <em>do </em>know why the Kinect (or SLS) returns the results it does, and we <em>know </em>it’s not ghosts.</p><p>That said, even if its results are erroneous, maybe the Kinect’s new lease on afterlife isn’t a bad thing. Much as ghosts supposedly patrol the same paths over and over until interrupted by ghost hunters, perhaps it’s fitting that the Kinect will continue forevermore to track human bodies — even if the bodies aren’t really there.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As you might expect, it employs a level scaling system, where the enemies and quests you encounter get stronger as you do. That is to say, if you’re level five, the enemies around you will be level five. When you reach level six, the enemies will turn into level six enemies.

The gradual drip feed of rewards presented in a straight line evokes strong déjà vu of countless live service and free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite </em>or <em>Genshin Impact</em>. Additionally, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>has microtransactions, so you might (reasonably) fear that Projects exist just to separate your cash from your wallet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-back-on-twitch-unban-two-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Adin Ross, one of the most controversial streamers on the market, has been unbanned on Twitch after a historic two-year hiatus. He was suspended in 2023 for failing to control offensive content on his channel and in his chat, and he relocated to Kick.com to become one of the biggest faces of the platform.</p>



<p>In July 2024, I covered the topic of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-unbanned-on-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ross’s return to Twitch</a>, which surfaced when the company’s CEO, Dan Clancy, suggested he’d be open to ‘chatting with him’ to see if he’d truly changed. </p>



<p>I guess he has.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-took-you-long-enough">Took You Long Enough</h2>



<p>Adin Ross peaked at 7.2 million followers on Twitch before being banned in February 2023, racking up over 70,000 subscribers and some of the highest average viewer counts on the platform. His success carried over to Kick.com, but he never reached such lofty heights, despite putting out some insane content, like hosting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-donald-trump-stream-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview with Donald Trump</a>.</p>



<p>Twitch zeroed <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/adinross" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Adin Ross’s account</a> on the platform after his ban, so he needs to rebuild from the ground up, but in the 12 hours since his return was discovered, he has landed 56,000 followers. It’ll take quite some time to get back to where he was, and with global viewership dropping, he might <strong>never </strong>get back there.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Adin Ross revealed his intention to partner with FaZe Clan to create <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-faze-gta-6-rp-crypto-server/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a crypto-backed RP server in GTA 6</a>, which set the gaming space ablaze. It’s almost certainly <strong>never </strong>going to happen because it conflicts in a major way with Take-Two and Rockstar Games’ terms of service, but you never know.</p>



<p>Ross is yet to stream on Twitch but his account is gathering steam, so it might only be a matter of days before he returns to the platform. Will you be turning in to see his grand resurfacing on Twitch? Let me know in the comments or over on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-marketing-will-only-start-closer-to-launch-says-take-two-ceo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a recent interview with Wall Street Week's David Westin, which was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M53-LKlECk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on the Bloomberg Television YouTube channel, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick discussed the company's strategy for GTA VI marketing.</p>
<p>So far, we've only had one trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-breaks-100-million-youtube-views-is-the-biggest-non-bts-video-ever-for-its-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released in December 2023</a>. Red Dead Redemption 2 had three trailers scattered over the course of three years, plus a gameplay video and a launch trailer. If this pattern were to be followed, it would inherently mean a delay outside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced Fall 2025 release window</a>. However, Zelnick outlined a different strategy for GTA VI where the marketing will only kick off in earnest when closer to launch, to balance excitement with 'unmet anticipation'.</p>
<p><em>The anticipation for that title (GTA VI) may be the greatest anticipation I've ever seen for an entertainment property. And I've been around the block a few times and I've been in every</em><br>
<em>entertainment business there is, and we want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement. And we do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance.</em></p>
<p><em>We found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand and balance the excitement</em><br>
<em>with unmet anticipation. We&nbsp;don't always get it exactly right, but that's what we are trying to do.</em></p>
<p>It sounds a lot like the approach championed by Bethesda with Fallout 4, which was announced and released within six months. Of course, GTA VI was announced a long time ago, but it does seem like we'll get more details and trailers about the game relatively close to launch this time around.</p>
<p>It's not just gamers but also competitors who are waiting to know exactly when the most anticipated entertainment product of all time will debut on the market. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/possibility-of-gta-6-delay-threatens-games-industry-some-companies-are-going-to-tank-if-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by analysts, companies are desperate to guess right if GTA VI will launch this Fall or not, as they will have to try and get out of Rockstar's behemoth to stay afloat. It's certainly no coincidence that the current schedule is nearly wide open, with only Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch in October</a> and Crimson Desert also <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned for the Fall window</a>. Everyone else is waiting to see, just like fans.</p>

There's a lot we still don't know about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>, but probably the most annoying thing that has gone unanswered is just when it's coming out. Not annoying in the sense of, "oh golly gosh I'm so excited please I need to know", more "come on now, just get it over with!" It's just a whole thing, and I wish it wasn't, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rockstar">Rockstar</a> and their owner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two</a> also clearly know it's a whole thing, and are riding on that very fact. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick recently spoke with Bloomberg about a whole bunch of bits, and of course the question of when GTA 6 is coming out came up.
</p>

<p>
Doubly of course, Zelnick didn't give a definitive answer, but he did give the exact kind of response a CEO would give. "The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I've ever seen for an entertainment property, and I've been around the block a few times," he said. "We want to maintain the anticipation." Speaking of "competitors" who lay out their release schedules quite plainly, Zelnick said that they "found that the better thing to do is provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window".

<p>
Translation? A release date isn't being shared probably until the summer or so, given that Take-Two have already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-wont-slip-to-2026-take-two-assure-theyre-highly-confident-about-fall-2025">expressed confidence in meeting a fall release window</a>. And as game devs everywhere read this, I can hear them all saying "cripes, when the hell can we even release our game?" Alright, maybe they wouldn't say cripes, but you know what I mean.
</p>
<p>
A recent report from the newly established site <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games">The Game Business</a> claimed that multiple major publishers have plans in place to deal with the release of GTA 6, because they all fear that it would completely obliterate anything released close to it (a fear they're right to have). Now just imagine trying to be an indie dev with a game out this year. I shudder at the thought, glad I'm this side of the fence.
</p>
<p>
All of this doesn't matter much for readers of RPS though, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-think-pc-is-of-increasing-importance-in-2025-but-still-wont-announce-the-magic-date">given that GTA 6 won't be available on PC at launch</a>, and will likely come a bit further down the way. Which, now that I think about it, is just another release date other devs will likely have to avoid. Just a bit of a lose-lose situation, isn't it?

<p>At the end of The Last of Us (2013), Joel performed an act that split the community. He dove into a hospital full of Fireflies and slaughtered them to rescue Ellie, his ward. For the last decade, it has been the topic of widespread debate, with fans on both sides of the fence arguing whether Joel was right to save Ellie.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the release of The Last of Us season two, showrunners and writers Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann sat down with IGN to discuss that very topic, and we secured a definitive answer from the highest authority in the debate.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-did-joel-do-the-right-thing">Did Joel Do The Right Thing?</h2>



<p>Love it or hate it, Joel’s decision kicked off a chain of events that led to The Last of Us Part II being born, and that was good enough for me to side with him. On a more real note, I fully appreciate where Joel was coming from – we do crazy things for family, even if that family is represented by a twisted, pseudo-adoptive daughter figure.</p>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-hbo-creators-answer-whether-or-not-joel-was-right-to-save-ellie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with IGN</a>, Neil Druckmann, the creator of The Last of Us, offered his two cents:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I believe Joel was right.</p>



<p>If I were in Joel’s position, I hope I would be able to do what he did to save my daughter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Craig Mazin, who has been partnered with Druckmann for the last few years working on HBO’s The Last of Us, chimed in:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That’s so interesting, because I think that if I were in Joel’s position, I probably would have done what he did.</p>



<p>But I’d like to think that I wouldn’t. That’s the interesting push and pull of the morality of it. And that’s why the ending of the first game is so provocative and so wonderful. It just doesn’t let you off the hook as a player.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s mostly subjective, and it’s not a binary thing – there’s no black and white with what Joel did, and every person will end up giving a unique take on what they think about Joel’s actions.</p>



<p>Would you have saved Ellie if you were in Joel’s shoes? Let me know what you think in the comments, or hop over to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

We can probably all agree that planting trees is pretty much universally good, right? I can't really imagine a scenario where planting a tree is a bad thing, we need them to live after all. If you're not into planting trees you're probably an oil tycoon, or a squirrel with incredibly bad survival instincts. If you are, though, might I interest you in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3531490/Treeplanter/">Treeplanter</a>, a game whose name is exactly what it says on the tin? It was announced just yesterday, and looks quite, quite lovely.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Treeplanter doesn't exactly appear to be a traditional game, more something in the vein of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mountain">Mountain</a>, where the priority is lovely, naturey vibes. Described as an "interactive woodland", you grow little landscapes and ecosystems where over time plant life grows, and animals flock to. It's the kind of thing I can imagine spending 15 minutes on at the end of a tough day to help recuperate.

<p>
Most appealing of all, though, is the fact that proceeds from every sale of the game will go straight to tree-planting charities to help grow actual trees. This isn't surprising given the person who made it, Henry Driver, is apparently a sixth-generation farmer alongside being a game developer. Talk about living up to your name!
</p>
<p>
In particular I quite like the final line from the game's Steam page: "Please keep in mind that this is a small game with no goals or challenges, created by Henry with help from his friends - it's all about creating small but beautiful dioramas, using the tools and items from the game alongside the influences of nature." I'm not big on traditional sim games myself, but this sounds up my alley.
</p>
<p>
Treeplanter doesn't have a release date just yet but it is set to arrive sometime in 2025.

<p>Pre-orders for the highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 are set to go live soon, but when can I pre-order?</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order date is a little complicated as we currently only have leaked information to relay on. It’s expected that Nintendo will officially announce their pre-order information during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct on April 2nd, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-the-leaks-say-about-the-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">What The Leaks Say About The Nintendo Switch 2 Pre-Order Date</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, Best Buy Canada accidently leaked that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-open-april-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 are set to go live on April 2, 2025</a>, after the Direct. However, shortly after the information went live on their website and the news started to circulate online, Best Buy Canada promptly removed the information.</p>



<p>According to Insider Gaming sources, who provided internal information and emails from Best Buy USA, they state that the pre-order date for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 will be on April 9, 2025</a>, one week after the Direct.</p>



<p>So, if the leaked documents are to be believed, Best Buy Canada made some kind of mistake and just assumed that pre-orders would go live on the same day as the Direct.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-included-in-the-pre-order">What’s Included in the Pre-Order?</h2>



<p>At the moment, no official details have been given on the Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders, but according to the same leaked documents, it will contain a Switch 2 collectable coin.</p>



<p>Other information such as what SKU’s, games, and colours will be available for the Nintendo Switch 2 on launch have yet to be announced or leaked.</p>



<p>Will you be buying the Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/stuttering-issue-registered-in-several-ps5-and-ps5-pro-games-with-vrr-enabled/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stuttering-issue-registered-in-several-ps5-and-ps5-pro-games-with-vrr-enabled.1148910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stuttering-issue-registered-in-several-ps5-and-ps5-pro-games-with-vrr-enabled/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's a stuttering issue in several PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro games when enabling Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) and unlocked frame rate. The report <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2smFwG3Xkc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes from Digital Foundry</a>, which investigated the issue across various games. They found out that after twenty to thirty minutes of playing one of these games, stuttering would occur roughly every eight seconds, give or take a few frames here and there.</p>
<p>The following games were confirmed to be affected on both PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Last of Us Part One</li>
<li>The Last of Us Part Two Remastered</li>
<li>Diablo IV</li>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>
<li>Elden Ring</li>
<li>Resident Evil 4</li>
<li>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</li>
<li>Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered</li>
<li>Metaphor: Refantazio</li>
<li>Kingdom Come Deliverance II</li>
</ul>
<p>Digital Foundry also tested Warhorse's first-person open world role-playing game on Xbox Series X and noticed no such stuttering problem. They also noted that testing took place across various TV sets, eliminating that as a potential factor.</p>
<p>However, other games do not seem to exhibit this behavior. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>God of War Ragnarok</li>
<li>Gran Turismo 7</li>
<li>Immortals of Aveum</li>
<li>Dragon's Dogma 2</li>
</ul>
<p>What's even more interesting is that some of these games are powered by the same engines seen in the first group. For example, Dragon's Dogma 2 runs on CAPCOM's RE Engine just like Resident Evil 4, but the latter is impacted, and the former is not. Having said that, Digital Foundry noted that it's not unthinkable that some of these games could still suffer from the issue, albeit only after playing them after longer than half an hour.</p>
<p><iframe title="Confirmed: PlayStation 5 and PS5 Pro Have VRR Stuttering Problems" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z2smFwG3Xkc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Interestingly, the stuttering issue seemed to go away for a while after switching to another input (for example, PC) and back. Of course, that's not a proper fix, which can only come from Sony or the developers, depending on whether it is a system-wide issue or a game-specific issue.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we'll let you know if Sony acknowledges the problem and provides an ETA on its resolution.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-lack-of-gta-6-news-is-to-create-enormous-anticipation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s been almost a year-and-a-half since the first Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6 trailer was released, exciting fans of the franchise around the world. Since that moment when a 2025 release was confirmed, however, it’s been silent from both Take-Two Interactive and developer Rockstar Games when it comes to any GTA 6 news. </p>



<p>Fans have gone to theorizing every possible clue they could about when the next bit of information or trailer will be released, but nothing has come yet. And now, thanks to a new interview with Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick, the silence has been confirmed to be part of the plan.</p>



<p>Talking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M53-LKlECk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Zelnick said that a reason for the lack of news is to “create enormous anticipation” for the game.</p>



<p>“The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I’ve ever seen for an entertainment property,” the Take-Two CEO said. “We want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement.”</p>



<p>Zelnick said that there are competitors who reveal their release schedule “years in advance”. For Take-Two, Zelnick believes in doing heavier marketing as a release gets closer.</p>



<p>“We found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation,” Zelnick said. </p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Zelnick was asked about why wait so long—12+ years in the case of GTA 6—before releasing follow ups. He said that it’s intentional in order to “rest [their] intellectual property.”</p>



<p>“Some of our competitors come to market very regularly, maybe even annually with their titles,” he said. “We only annualize our sports entertainment titles.” </p>



<p>Regarding GTA 6, specifically, Zelnick added that Rockstar “seeks perfection in what they do and perfection is a pretty high bar.”</p>



<p>When do you think the next GTA 6 trailer or any news will be released? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1787/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

Look, not every dating sim under the sun is insatiably horny, but I don't think you can argue that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/date-everything">Date Everything!</a> isn't. Like, the whole game is about how you can date everything, from a chair, to a clock, to a fridge. There's literally 100 different objects you can date, this is somebody's something for sure. And, as revealed in a new trailer earlier this week, as it turns out all you tabletop fiends out there will be able to date a twenty-sided die.

Surprising literally no one, Chance, as the anthropomorphic D20 is known as, is voiced by Critical Role star and prolific voice actor Matthew Mercer. Who could have seen that coming! Chance looks to be exactly what you might envision a guy that loves Dungeons &amp; Dragons a bit too much - a bit of a bumbling buffoon, way too happy to go into detail, and perhaps a bit too eager to play with someone. 
</p>

Following up a request to play the game's version of the popular TTRPG (dubbed Grottos and Gargoyles, that's a new one) he does express that eagerness quite plainly by saying "it would only be the single greatest thing you could do for me", which is killing my vibe a bit personally. But hey, just because you can date everything, doesn't mean you should, right?
</p>
<p>
Mercer's involvement is no surprise, given that the game is being developed by prolific voice actors like Ray Chase (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy 15</a>), Robbie Daymond (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, Sailor Moon), Max Mittelman (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> Rebirth), and Amanda Hufford (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>). Not to mention there's other voice talent like Felicia Day (Supernatural), Johnny Yong Bosch (Bleach), and Grey DeLisle (The Last Airbender). A bonafide feast for people that like to play/ watch things and go "wait I definitely know that voice, let me check IMDB."
</p>
<p>
Date Everything! doesn't have an exact release date just yet, but it's due out this June.

Bah, it's never fun writing one of these, but unfortunately <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/myst">Myst</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/riven">Riven</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/cyan-worlds">Cyan Worlds</a> have laid off 12 of its staff members this week, supposedly cutting the studio by about half. Cyan shared the news on its social media accounts yesterday, noting that "industry conditions" have "forced" the studio to "weigh the future health of our studio against the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The post also states that it has been communicating with the entire team about the "choppy waters" it has been in, and that the layoffs weren't a surprise for the team, so it sounds like it has been a long time coming. At the very least those affected will be getting severance packages, but I imagine that's not quite enough consolation. Also worth noting is that the studio's current priority is to "secure financing for our next project."

Cyan are a long-running developer, having been founded almost 40 years ago. They're obviously best known as the studio behind Myst and Riven, having focused on remakes of both titles in recent years. The latter was just released last year, and was broadly well received, so you have to wonder what went wrong. Plenty of indie studios are struggling to find funding at the moment, but it's not always as simple as something as that, as we all know. For what it's worth, Cyan did also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cyan.com/post/3llhcingbwb27">provide a list of employees impacted by the layoffs</a> to help them get new work.
</p>
<p>
I really do hope Cyan manages to pull through, and that all the laid off staff manage to land on their feet. Honestly, I can't think of another developer with half as much history, let alone 37 years of it. Fingers crossed for all those involved.

Have you been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everywhere">Everywhere</a>? Not like, literally, everywhere, but Everywhere, that sort of Roblox, sort of Fortnite, everything game from Build A Rocket Boy, a studio founded by ex-Rockstar dev and GTA 3 to 5 producer Leslie Benzies. That whole, uh, interactive experience or whatever you want to call it still seems to be in beta. But the first project spun off from it, MindsEye, a near-future action game that really just looks like slightly sci-fi GTA, now has a release date: June 10th, later this year. Except, I'm a little bit confused by it.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
MindsEye was first formally revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-gta-boss-unveils-mindseye-a-new-blockbuster-available-in-robloxlike-everywhere">back in 2023</a>, and was meant to, firstly, be episodic, and secondly, be available in Everywhere. As it currently stands, though, it looks like you'll be able to pick it up on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox solo. The game's <a href="https://ioi.dk/MindsEye">official website</a> makes no mention of Everywhere, nor does its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/">Steam page</a>, which is pretty sparse overall. Hell, one of its key selling points is that you're meant to be able to use all the assets featured in MindsEye to make your own games in Everywhere, but I have no idea if that will be possible now.

This latest trailer introduces you to the city the game takes part in, but it's all cutscenes, and the only gameplay trailer that's been released was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSn42TbRngY&amp;ab_channel=MindsEye">from a month ago</a>, which doesn't really show you how it plays, outside of looking like a GTA clone. Sure, there's a release date, but this thing feels like borderline vapourware.
</p>
<p>
It could always be that publisher IO Interactive (you know, those folks that make Hitman) wanted Build A Rocket Boy to get something out the door to start bringing in some money. That would just be conjecture though, don't hold me to it. Honestly, I'm a bit baffled by this whole game. I'll be on the lookout for one of those lengthy walls of text explaining how the game has been delayed because the devs really want to polish it up so you can have the best experience.
</p>
<p>
I should also mention that there were some concerns over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everywhere-devs-respond-to-nft-speculation-saying-its-built-on-unreal-engine-5-not-the-blockchain">Everywhere utilising blockchain technology</a>, in no small part thanks to the fact that Build A Rocket Boy was literally hiring for people to join its blockchain team. The studio claimed Everywhere wouldn't be using it, and that it was just for research purposes. I can't see any evidence of it in MindsEye right now, but I'd probably hold off on pre-ordering this one all the same, given its mysterious, slightly off-putting vibe.

<p>"Say goodbye to 'Overwatch 2', I guess. Looks like they are dropping the '2'. This suggests that the overwatch 2 name may be retired."</p>
<p>The leak is accompanied by a handful of images that purportedly depict Overwatch 2's S16 main screen, Juno Mythic, new Mythic aspects, and reveal an upcoming collab with Gundam.</p>
<p>As with most leaks, for now, all we can do is chalk this up to a rumour until Activision Blizzard confirms one way or the other. Either way, though, it's once again got players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jmbcuq/comment/mkc5qpl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">talking</a> about whether or not live-service games like Overwatch or Destiny should simply keep evolving rather than develop stand-alone "sequels".</p>
<p>We've reached out to Activision for comment and will update as/when we hear back.</p>
<p>Last month we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-is-bringing-loot-boxes-back-two-years-after-they-were-removed-from-the-series">Blizzard is reimplementing loot boxes into Overwatch 2</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-loot-boxes-will-be-withdrawn-from-sale-at-the-end-of-the-month">a little over two years after the team removed them from Overwatch</a>.</p>
<p>Blizzard detailed its plans for what the studio calls "one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>'s most significant years so far", including a brief look at Overwatch 2 season 15, which is set to debut later this month, on 18th February. It is this season that will see those aforementioned loot boxes make their return to the hero shooter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/637717/assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-assassinations<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I realized quite late in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/631744/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></em> that being this version of a shinobi is hard — but it was precisely the precision the game demanded that made it all the more rewarding.</p><p>With <em>Shadows</em>, the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise has achieved both its most impressive stealth and assassination mechanics. At its best, <em>Shadows</em> evokes games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13719322/dishonored-2-immersive-sim-serious-game-melodrama">Arkane’s <em>Dishonored</em> series</a>, mixing emergent action with an artful blend of skills and scenarios. While not nearly at the level of sophistication as those games, I nevertheless had moments that left me breathless from what I could achieve. These put me more in the space of immersive simulated assassination games than the most recent, chest-thumping<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> games.</p><p>Here’s an example. In Ubisoft’s open-world third-person action game, I was faced with a group of about 10 men in a dark cave, all of whom turned out to be targets I’d been hunting for ages. They were all part of one group, who I’d been carefully taking down individually — one leading me to the next. Now, after tracking one, it turned out he and his remaining colleagues had decided to hold a meeting. Together. With their guards. I hadn’t planned this, but now I either had to leave or use this opportunity to finish the job in one lethal swoop.</p><p>Importantly, my character, the shinobi Naoe, was not without her own tricks to balance the overwhelming odds. First, she wasn’t alone. In <em>Shadows</em>, you organically recruit allies throughout your massive revenge quest. You can summon them at a moment’s notice to assist you in any scenario: from a barefisted fighter monk to a giggling, creepy teenage poisoner. Having “upgraded” my poisoner, her poison bomb put three enemies to sleep immediately. Her upgrades also meant anyone who came to investigate fell under the same spell. I began by summoning said poisoner to take out several of the targets and guards.</p><p>Second, Naoe herself has skills that verge on magical, such as slowing down time while moving at normal speed — again, reminiscent of <em>Dishonored</em> or Arkane’s other big hitter, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc">Deathloop</a></em>. Using this skill immediately after my poisoner allowed me to throw several deadly kunai at guards’ heads and move closer to the actual targets for a slick close-up double assassination.</p><p>All of this happened within less than 20 seconds. And voila! All the targets and their guards were down.</p><p>Never had I felt more like an assassin in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. It surprised me, given that I have been playing the franchise since the first game. But this moment made me realize that I had never had to be this clever before in these games, or had access to such a variety of complementary skills, tools, and abilities. Even the more recent trilogy of “reboots” — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16414638/assassins-creed-origins-ancient-egypt-hands-on-open-world-exploration"><em>Origins</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/1/17921552/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-ps4-xbox-pc"><em>Odyssey</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/12/21319059/assassins-creed-valhalla-hands-on-preview-pc-xbox-one-ps4-gameplay-ubisoft-rpg"><em>Valhalla</em></a> — did not feature such variety and complementary actions. While the lovable goofball protagonists of those games develop god-like abilities, most were centered around combat rather than stealth. The last expansion of <em>Valhalla</em>, for example, literally saw you play a god, Odin, battling through the Norse realms to save his son, Baldur.</p><p>Now, with <em><em>Shadows</em></em>, Ubisoft has managed to balance both action and stealth, allowing you to play as the shinobi Naoe and the lethal mountain samurai Yasuke. It’s Naoe’s stealth, in particular, that has left me impressed. <em>Shadows</em> creates multiple scenarios that require planning for your shinobi. While Naoe moves like dark silk on a night wind and can instantly assassinate multiple targets, she can die quickly. Yet, she will often face large set pieces with upward of 20–30 enemies patrolling an area.</p><p>The game places huge rewards in, for example, giant, heavily guarded castles. Walking in the front gate is almost never an option. But Naoe can climb overhanging trees, find cracks in walls, and swim in via aqueducts. Once inside, she can use “eagle vision” to see through walls and tag enemies. <em>Shadows </em>removes the flying companion from the previous three games, which acted like a military drone to provide air reconnaissance.</p><p>Now, it’s entirely within the limited confines of Naoe’s vision — but that’s not necessarily limiting. If used properly, Naoe can never be surprised and can plan the order of assassination such that no one ever realizes she has infiltrated. For example, if one guard is patrolling, it could be easier to take him out, rather than his colleagues who are stationed, since he may spot you moving.</p><p>The size of these places turns this into a murdery puzzle. If I take Guard A out, I have access to Guards B and C. However, Guard D is watching Guard A, etc. Without realizing it, you have to create an assassination Rube Goldberg machine, taking one out, then another, timing it and using different abilities, recruits, and so on. It takes some time to get through these giant castles, but you’re rewarded with some of the best weapons and armor in the game. And if you’re caught, you are hunted for a while, making traversal a hazard. In previous entries, stealth was largely optional and functional but unremarkable. There was also no real penalty for being spotted that those godlike protagonists couldn’t easily silence.</p><p>Similarly, the other playable character, the samurai Yasuke, requires careful consideration, despite being a moving mountain. He doesn’t have eagle vision. He is made for loud lethality; even his instant assassinations sever heads and limbs. This creates its own thoughtful play since you need to carefully move and work your way through these large set pieces, ideally without drawing attention.</p><p>Yasuke’s advantage is that he can use a huge bow to take enemies out instantly from a distance — unlike Naoe, who has to be close. This speaks to the give-and-take theme central to the game’s mechanics. But Yasuke can more easily and quickly end alerts, making his style of murder puzzle less clean but easier to recover from should things go awry.</p><p>I did not expect <em>Shadows</em> to place so much work and thought into its assassinations, which is obviously amusing given the name of the franchise. Having played this series since its inception, I was struck by the emphasis on clean, thoughtful assassinations — not only within scripted contexts, but in the open world itself.</p><p>After years of trending toward bombastic action, <em>Shadows</em> points toward a future where <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> continues to live up to its name — and hopefully creates scenarios to make players feel like the titular leads, rather than god-like warriors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
