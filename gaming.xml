<p>The talented team confirmed this in an official announcement on social media this week. Nintendo asked the studio to "help demonstrate new capabilities of the Nintendo Switch 2 system" while remaining faithful to the original versions of each title.</p>
<p>As you can see, the titles Panic Button helped release updates for include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/new_super_mario_bros_u_deluxe">New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arms">ARMS</a>.

<p>These were all free upgrades, with multiple other first-party Switch titles receiving similar Switch 2 launch updates.</p>

<p>Panic Button, as you might recall, worked wonders during the Switch generation - porting titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_eternal">DOOM Eternal</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/wolfenstein_ii_the_new_colossus">Wolfenstein II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/warframe">Warframe</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_league">Rocket League</a>. So, it's nice to see its efforts haven't gone unnoticed. Its <a href="https://panicbuttongames.com/games/">official website</a> has also been updated to include its most recent work.</p>
<p>If we hear about Panic Button's involvement in anything else related to Switch 2 going forward, we'll provide an update.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-dumps-color-floor-lamps-now-selling-at-new-all-time-low-for-prime-members-2000645559</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-dumps-color-floor-lamps-now-selling-at-new-all-time-low-for-prime-members.1358719/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smart lighting transforms bland rooms into dynamic spaces that adapt to mood and activity. <em>Govee</em> just dropped an <strong>exclusive Prime member deal</strong> on its RGBIC Floor Lamp, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">slashing the price down to $64 from its usual $99.</a> This Black Friday discount is a record low that no one other than a Prime member gets, and if you subscribe, now’s the perfect time to upgrade your lighting game. With <strong>16 million color options and music sync capabilities</strong>, the lamp does away with dead corners and bland ambient lighting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The RGBIC designation means<strong> this lamp displays multiple colors simultaneously across different segments</strong>. Traditional RGB lamps can only show one color at a time across the entire fixture, limiting your creative options. The Govee lamp divides the light strip into independent zones that each display different colors, creating flowing gradients and multi-color effects. You can set the bottom to glow blue while the top fades into purple or create rainbow effects that flow up and down the lamp.</p>
<p>The<strong> 1000 lumen output provides serious brightness</strong> that actually works as primary lighting, not accent mood lighting. You can light up an entire corner of a room or use it as your main light source when you want softer, interesting lighting than overhead fixtures provide. The brightness smoothly adjusts from dim ambient glow to full brightness, allowing for granular control over the light intensity.</p>



<h2>Syncs With Music</h2>
<p><strong>Music sync capability</strong> turns the lamp into a reactive light show, pulsing and changing with whatever you’re playing. Equipped with a built-in microphone, the lamp picks up the audio from your room and analyzes the beat, tempo, and intensity. Colors shift and pulse in rhythm to your music, creating an immersive experience that beats static lighting. Sensitivity can be changed depending on volumes of playing music, so it will be as relevant for background jazz as for electronic dance music played at full volume. The <strong>sync works with any audio source in the room</strong>, from TV shows to Spotify to live instruments.</p>
<p>Alexa integration means that when it’s all connected to your Amazon Echo devices, the lamp is completely voice-controllable. Without needing to open the app or touch physical controls, saying, “Alexa, turn on the floor lamp” powers it up. You can change colors with your voice, adjust brightness, turn the lamp on or off, and trigger preset scenes. This voice control becomes key when you are caught up on the couch and do not want to reach for your phone.</p>



<p>The <strong>Govee app unlocks the full potential of the lamp’s 16 million color options</strong>. You can save custom color combinations as presets, browse community-created scenes, and fine-tune every aspect of the lighting. The app <strong>includes dozens of pre-programmed scenes</strong> like “Sunset,” “Ocean,” “Forest,” and “Party” that change the lamp’s appearance with one tap. DIY mode lets you pick specific colors for each segment of the lamp, creating personalized combinations that match your room’s color scheme.</p>
<p>From unboxing to first use, the lamp takes about five minutes to set up. Plug in the lamp, download the Govee app, connect it to your WiFi network, and go. The WiFi connection is a standard 2.4GHz network which most homes are already set up with-no special router configurations are required. The lamp remembers your last settings even in the event of power outages, so it will immediately go back to those settings upon being turned back on. Energy consumption stays very low despite the brightness of the output; it <strong>uses about as much electricity as a regular LED bulb</strong> while offering much more functionality.</p>
<p>This Govee RGBIC Floor Lamp provides smart lighting features that other brands sell at double the price, down to $64 from its usual $99, for Prime members only.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/riftbound-origins-review-tcg-with-movement-strategy-im-in</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riftbound-origins-review-a-tcg-with-movement-strategy-im-in.1358701/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I got a chance to get my hands on <em>Riftbound</em> earlier this year as I was invited to Riot HQ to test out some trial decks. I've dabbled in a lot of TCGs over the years, finding elements that I like and dislike about them, but I've never enjoyed one quite as much as <em>Riftbound</em> off the bat. As I dive into the Proving Grounds beginner set, the starter decks and deckbuilding, and playing the game I'll get into what makes this game such a strong contender.</p>

<h2>Your Cards Teach You Deckbuilding</h2>

<p>In talking about <em>Riftbound</em> and how to play the game we've got to talk about how the decks are made. Each Deck has a Legend, a two colored card that features a League of Legends Champion that will serve as the face of your deck. From there, you'll then also want a Champion Unit, normally the same League of Legends hero as another ambassador for your deck.</p>

<p>Your Legend will have an ability that can be accessed at any time, normally once a turn, while your Champion Unit is a Unit you can summon with the required Runes without having to worry about drawing it to your hand.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-legends.jpg?itok=xlZvsPcy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-legends.jpg?itok=UpDfVfE6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In picking these two cards you've immediately been able to narrow down your pool of possible cards to two colors, and even further you'll look to obtain cards that interact positively with the abilities of your Legend and Champion Unit.</p>

<p>Hand of Noxus, Darius' Legend card, gives you an additional Rune as a Legion ability, while Lee Sin's Blind Monk, can buff a friendly unit. From here you can find all manner of other cards that will have Legion effects or allow for the spending of buffs.</p>

<p>It's in this way that as you create your deck based off the chosed Legend you're being taught by the game "This is how a deck using these cards will want to function, so you should continue to work with that mechanic." While loose, it's a basic framework that means even if you don't know all of the cards or the best strategies that you can start planning your own combos.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-types-of-cards.jpg?itok=P-q-vn7p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-types-of-cards.jpg?itok=HjSq8Fbe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The rest of your deck gets filled with 39 additional cards; Units, Spells, and Gear. Each deck will also include three different Battlefields, potential battle grounds that you'll be moving your units to and from during games of <em>Riftbound</em>, and 12 Rune cards (six of each color) that work as your ramping energy system for the game.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the cards that I was most short on opening booster packs was Runes. Each pack has 1, maybe 2, that to create a deck with 12 of the same colored Runes you'll need to hope that you open enough of a certain type. For a lot of my playtesting, I just pooled all of my Runes from Boosters, Proving Grounds, and Starter Decks together so that I'd have enough. There will definitely be a time where I don't need to do that… but that time is not now.</p>

<h2>Proving Grounds Is Where To Start</h2>

<p>If you're just interested in getting into <em>Riftbound</em>, Riot Games has created a box for up to four players. This is something a bit closer to a board game approach to Riftbound but works as a starter set with underpowered decks to hopefully keep scalpers away.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-proving-grounds.jpg?itok=7dbPAs2m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-proving-grounds.jpg?itok=Ya527mFg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Inside this box you'll find a large set of rules for how to play <em>Riftbound</em>, four <em>Riftbound</em> Decks, four Carboard Play Mats with additional instructions for how to play on them, oversized battleground cards, and acrylic character standees to use as point trackers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While this box was planned to be less desirable, it hasn't stopped a few cards, such as the Flash spell and the Master Yi and Annie Legends, from becoming very desirable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Playing <em>Riftbound</em></h2>

<p><em>Riftbound</em> can be played with two to four players in pretty much any configuration from 1v1, to 2v2, and free for all. On each turn a player channels (draws) an additional two Runes, draws a card from their deck, and then can take any number of actions provided they're allowed to and they have the Runes to back it up.</p>

<p>Before the game is started Battlefields are put out on the table, these are zones that combat will take place in. Each player has a chance to contribute their own Battlefield as a way to potentially give themselves an additional advantage. Playing with friends, I never seemed to get to use my Battlefield and when a friend had a Battlefield that made use of Buffs (something my deck had none of) there was immediately an uphill battle to be had.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-playing.jpg?itok=dZ6Su5y6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-playing.jpg?itok=PboB3ki5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Players will summon Units to their field, activate Gear and Abilities, cast spells, or move their units from their base to a battlefield, resolve combat where necessary and pass their turn to the next player.</p>

<p>There are a lot of common aspects that you'll find in <em>Riftbound</em> if you're familiar with other TCGs: Units come out exhausted unless they have an ability to say otherwise, Runes create an energy that's accumulated to play cards etc.</p>

<p>The two major differences for <em>Riftbound</em> that I have really enjoyed are its Battlefields and the ramping Rune system.</p>

<p>When summoning a Unit you can normally only summon them to your base, which is a zone that's (normally) safe from your enemies. It's only when you start moving them out to the previously mentioned battlefields that they are at risk. Battlefields are where you earn points, so it's important to get Units out there, but the base lets you be more deliberate about when you do and don't want to engage in combat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-big-combat.jpg?itok=UZxNg4mh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-big-combat.jpg?itok=-PSnQu8f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even with all of this... I lost this battle</figcaption></figure><p>Playing in a free for all, being high on points but low on Units, I was able to look at my board and hand and know that I didn't have anything to make any power plays this turn but I was able to take two turns to focus on my base, filling it up with Units and abilities to then launch an assault later. When to move your characters up, and when to lie in wait, becomes a bit of a game of chicken waiting for the right time to strike.</p>

<p>The other feature that I really love from <em>Riftbound</em> is that your Runes are constantly accumulating. Each turn there's two more energy to be able to spend on more units of weaker strength, or you can gain access to far stronger units. This ramping guarantees there's no way you're stuck with nothing to do at any point in time, and better than that it always means there's escalation to the tempo of the game.</p>

<p>Round 1 and 2 are always one or two cards being played, and then passing on, while round 8 or 9 has you chaining together a variety of different abilities letting your Legend abilities truly shine.</p>

<p>There's an excitement that's inherent to pretty much every <em>Riftbound</em> game I have played as you get to see your opponent building up their abilities and you try to stop them.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-artwork.jpg?itok=s-1iawsq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-artwork.jpg?itok=l2qk9Vc5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Riftbound</em> Facing Standard TCG Issues</h2>

<p>As expected, <em>Riftbound</em> is facing current issues of pretty much every TCG, high resale and scalpers. It's not really something that can be avoided, and I definitely didn't think that Riot would have an answer, but it does make me worry about my own ability to enjoy the game outside of digital simulators.</p>

<p>As we go into Set 2: Spiritforged, already set to release in February of 2026, it will be interesting to see how the general public is able to get their hands on the product.</p>

<p>I do hope that we'll eventually see an official simulator, but for now I'm going to continue enjoying my time with the three decks that I was able to make from a Booster Box.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-card-sleeves-and-mat.jpg?itok=9OFegh7K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-origins-review-card-sleeves-and-mat.jpg?itok=1UMEvW2X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Riftbound</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I'm a huge fan of <em>Riftbound</em>, everything that I enjoyed about playing it earlier this year is even better now that I'm able to be playing it with a wider variety of players and have more cards to craft decks out of.</p>

<p>I love how intuitive building a basic deck is, and how playing and refining it helps you continue to funnel towards what might be your 'perfect' deck. In addition to that I love how varied each of the different major abilities in the game are. Even when playing your own deck a number of times the way you need to respond to a trap player vs a ganking player is going to cause you to reconsider strategies at any point in the game.</p>

<p>I think what Riot Games has pulled off here is incredible, creating a fresh and quite unique TCG in what is a very busy space right now and it's almost terrifying to think with how many LoL champions out there how much room they have to continue growing.</p>

              <p>Professional monitors make everything look better but the price tags usually sting. Amazon just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5718/">torched its profit margins on the LG <em>Ultrafine</em> 27-inch 4K monitor, dropping it to $177 from the usual $249 price</a>. This move screams inventory clearance which means you’re getting a <strong>legitimate 4K display for less than many 1080p monitors cost</strong>. The LG <em>Ultrafine</em> monitor delivers true<strong> 4K resolution with HDR10 support and 90% DCI-P3 color coverage</strong> that creative pros actually need. This record-low Black Friday price makes upgrading from your aging 1080p screen a no-brainer decision.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>True 4K Resolution Changes How You Work</h2>
<p>With a <strong>native resolution of 3840×2160</strong>, it packs four times the pixels of standard 1080p into the same-sized 27-inch display. You can easily set multiple windows side by side without straining to read tiny text or giving up readability. Spreadsheets show more rows and columns at once, code editors display more lines simultaneously, and photo editing reveals details that 1080p screens completely miss.</p>
<p>IPS panel technology offers accurate colors and wide viewing angles that TN panels simply can’t touch. Colors remain consistent even when you’re viewing the screen from extreme angles, which matters a great deal when you work with clients or show content to others. The 1000:1 contrast ratio creates deeper blacks than typical budget monitors, which makes dark movie and game scenes richer. IPS response times have dramatically improved over the last few years, so you won’t see ghosting or motion blur from this display like you did on older IPS displays</p>



<p><strong>HDR10 support</strong> brings compatible content to life with enhanced brightness and contrast. The likes of Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video stream HDR content that looks significantly better on this monitor compared to standard dynamic range displays. This monitor automatically jumps into HDR mode when it detects compatible content, then seamlessly flips back to SDR at all other times. Peak brightness reaches levels that will make the highlights pop without washing out the rest of the image.</p>



<p>Minimized bezels around display edges means maximum utilization of screen real estate. Thin bezels create a cleaner aesthetic, adding to the modern, professional look of any desk. Borderless designs are great for multi-monitor setups since the gap between screens will be almost invisible. The white finish will match perfectly with Apple aesthetics if you’re building a cohesive workspace; it works well with any setup, though. The matte screen coating helps reduce screen glare from windows and overhead lights, maintaining clarity of image in bright rooms.</p>
<p>Reader Mode reduces blue light emission for extended reading sessions that don’t strain your eyes. The mode shifts colors toward warmer tones that feel easier on your eyes during long workdays or late-night work sessions. Flicker Safe technology eliminates the invisible screen flickering that causes eye fatigue and headaches after hours of use. Put together, these create a display you can stare at for eight-plus hours without the burning, tired eyes that cheap monitors cause. Within the first week of using it,<strong> the reduction in eye strain is indeed noticeable</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Both HDMI and DisplayPort inputs</strong> are available for maximum compatibility. Modern laptops, gaming consoles, desktop computers, and media devices can be connected directly with no need for an adapter. DisplayPort is capable of higher refresh rates and bandwidth than HDMI, though both inputs provide full 4K resolution at 60Hz. A pair of inputs allows the connection of two devices at once and switching with the onscreen menu. USB-C displays are significantly more expensive, so the use of traditional connectivity here keeps the price accessible while still providing full functionality.</p>
<p>At $177 down from $249, this LG Ultrafine 27″ 4K monitor delivers professional specs at a price that undercuts basic 1080p displays. You’re getting true 4K resolution, HDR10 support, 90% DCI-P3 color coverage, and IPS panel quality for 29% off the regular price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO display sets represent a creative outlet for adults that melds nostalgia with serious building satisfaction. Amazon is flooded with LEGO deals this Black Friday, but the <em>Hogwarts Castle and Grounds</em> set stands well above the crowd as the most iconic Harry Potter build on offer. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">2,660-piece masterpiece drops to $140 from its usual $169 price, making it the perfect time to grab</a> what many collectors consider the <strong>definitive Hogwarts model in existence</strong>. Due to its massive scale and incredible detail, this set costs well more than average LEGO builds even at full price, but this discount makes it more affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Most Intricate Hogwarts Creation LEGO has Ever Built</h2>
<p>Detail is captured with this scale model of Hogwarts Castle in ways that no LEGO attempts have ever quite achieved: the build of the Main Tower, Astronomy Tower, Great Hall, several courtyards and connecting bridges, functional greenhouses, Boathouse, and even the surrounding Black Lake at the castle grounds. Architecture faithfully adheres to the movie depictions, giving you a displayable replica any Harry Potter fan can easily recognize. The<strong> baseplate is 13.5 inches wide and 10 inches deep</strong>, and creates a large footprint that commands attention on any shelf or desk. The <strong>castle itself rises over 8.5 inches high</strong>&nbsp;which makes it a fantastic centerpiece that won’t require a microscope to appreciate.</p>
<p>The interior details reveal the hidden rooms and iconic locations that defined the Harry Potter series. You can build the Chamber of Secrets complete with the basilisk’s lair, the Winged Key room from the first film, Snape’s Potions Classroom in the dungeons, and the life-sized Chessboard Chamber. These interior spaces add much depth to what might have been just an exterior shell, giving reasons for investigating the model from all angles.</p>



<p>The grounds around it feature components that complete the Hogwarts experience rather than a mere castle structure. The Durmstrang Ship sits in the Black Lake, recreating one of the dramatic entrances featured in Goblet of Fire. The Beauxbatons Carriage sits ready near the castle gates, recreating an entrance to the Triwizard Tournament. The Whomping Willow stands with its characteristic twisted branches, and the crashed Ford Anglia rests nearby as a nod to Chamber of Secrets.</p>
<p>The<strong> 2,660-piece count gives you hours of engaging building</strong> which breaks down into sections. LEGO designed the instructions to guide you through one area at a time, preventing the overwhelming feeling that massive sets sometimes create. You can build the castle over several evenings and make it a relaxing activity rather than a marathon building session. The variety of bricks includes special pieces for architectural details, transparent pieces for windows, and textured pieces adding depth aesthetically to walls and roofs.</p>



<p>Adding a really premium feel to the display is the inclusion of the gold-colored mini-figure of the statue of the Hogwarts architect. You can place this statue next to the included <em>“Hogwarts Castle”</em> nameplate or place it at any corner of the baseplate for balance. The nameplate gives the display a museum-quality finish that makes it clear this set targets adult collectors rather than kids.</p>
<p>At $140 off from $169, this LEGO <em>Hogwarts castle and grounds</em> is incredible value for a 2,660-piece licensed set. You get the most detailed, comprehensive Hogwarts recreation LEGO has made-complete with iconic locations, surrounding grounds, and display-ready presentation.</p>

            <p>
A bit of creepy crawly, low-key city building? Ah, go on then. October and Halloween might be behind us, but Fangtopia is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game stroke city builder that still feels appropriate for late autumn. Having had a go with its demo, it's deceptively simple, in fact it felt so simple I wasn't entirely sure if I was doing anything at all. But when it clicked, all the pieces fell into place resulting in a pleasantly chill time.
</p>
<p>
The game is tile based, each tile having six sides, all of which are rotatable. These tiles come in different flavours, like forest tile, or a mountain tile, a wheat field tile, a village tile etc., you get it! And then some of these tiles mix and match those traits, hence why they're rotatable. You only have a certain amount of these tiles in what is essentially a deck of cards, though I hesitate to call it a deck builder, it's more just that each tile you're able to place is random from one move to the next. Placing certain amounts of tiles next to particular landmarks that crop up then add more tiles back into your deck, so you can keep building your little island.
</p>
<p>
Once you build up your little island, classic monsters like werewolves, yetis and the like crop up and they do their own thing. You know, monster stuff. One of my favourite aspects was that you could build your own little spectral trainline too. It was mostly for the aesthetics, though (I think) also helps you gather tile resources, but really I was just in it for watching the ghost train navigate its way along the path I set for it. 
</p>
<p>
It reminded me of Lego Loco, an old simulation game where you build up a town and train network for minifigures that my dad would leave me to play obsessively at his work to keep me distracted. There's something so delightful in building up a quiet corner of the world with not particularly high stakes, a quality I think comes through quite nicely in Fangtopia. Worth a punt, whenever it comes out! You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010170/Fangtopia/">wishlist it on Steam</a> and try out its demo in the meantime.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-dumps-13-inch-ipad-pro-m4-at-new-record-low-now-more-tempting-than-pricey-m5-models.1358677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium tablets bridge the gap between laptops and phones and give you serious computing power in a portable package. Apple just unveiled its new iPad Pro M5 lineup a few weeks ago with the 13-inch model launching at $1,299, which <strong>makes the M4 version suddenly look like a steal</strong>. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5717/">dropped the 13-inch iPad Pro M4 to $1,049 from its original $1,299 price and matches what you’d pay for a smaller, less capable tablet</a>. The M4 and M5 models share so many similarities that spending $250 more for the newer chip makes zero sense for most people.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5717/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Tablet</h2>
<p>The <strong>M4 chip inside this iPad Pro brings desktop-grade performance</strong> that makes the upgrade to M5 seem superfluous for real-world work. What’s more, the 10-core CPU tackles tasks like video editing, 3D rendering, music production and multitasking without breaking a sweat. Apple built the M4 on a 3nm process that balances raw power with incredible efficiency, giving you all-day battery life even under intensive tasks. A 10-core GPU further pushes graphics performance to levels comparable to serious gaming machines, making this tablet ideal both for creative work and entertainment. The difference between M4 and M5 mainly exists in benchmark scores which most people never notice in real use.</p>
<p>The <strong>Ultra Retina XDR display represents one of the best screens ever put on a tablet</strong>. This 13-inch panel gives truly extreme brightness that remains readable in direct sunlight, while also offering deep blacks to make the OLED screens jealous. ProMotion technology adjusts the refresh rate to up to 120Hz for smooth scrolling and responsive input from Apple Pencil, then drops right down to conserve battery when the on-screen content has become static. P3 wide color gamut reproduces colors more accurately than standard displays, something that makes a big difference with photo editing and creative work. <strong>True Tone adjusts color temperature</strong> according to ambient lighting to reduce eye strain with extended use.</p>



<p>The impossibly thin design makes this 13-inch tablet feel lighter than its size suggests: <strong>Apple shaved the thickness down to just 5.1mm</strong>&nbsp;and created a profile that slips into bags easily with no extra bulk. A Space Black finish does a better job of resisting fingerprints than past aluminum finishes on Apple’s tablets, so the device stays clean throughout the day. The weight reduction means that you can hold the iPad Pro comfortably through marathon reading sessions or video calls without your arm tiring. The overall structural rigidity is impressive for such a slim frame, and the tablet doesn’t flex or creak at all if you press hard.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration</strong> changes how you’ll interact with the iPad Pro using AI-infused features: It helps write emails, summarize information, create images, and organize material all through natural language. It also includes privacy protections that mean all of this AI processing happens locally on your device rather than by sending sensitive information to cloud servers. The AI features seamlessly connect apps by suggesting what should be done next based on context, and the more you use them, the better they learn your preferences.</p>



<p>The <strong>new landscape 12MP Ultra Wide front camera finally puts the camera where it belongs for video calls</strong>. Center Stage automatically keeps you in frame as you move around, making video conferences feel more natural and professional. The 12MP Wide back camera captures stunning photos and 4K video with ProRes support for professional editing workflows. Four studio-quality microphones record clear audio from any direction while the four-speaker system delivers rich, immersive sound.</p>
<p>This iPad Pro M4 provides flagship performance for $250 less than the nearly identical M5 model down from $1,299 to $1,049. For your money, you’re getting the same Ultra Retina XDR display, similar processing power, an identical design, and full Apple Intelligence support, making the upgrade to an M5 unit a pretty questionable decision. The fact that <strong>this Amazon-exclusive discount</strong> combines with those cutting-edge specs to create value that’s out of reach for Apple’s official store is rather fascinating.</p>

      <p>AI, as you well know by now, is the future of everything – including, Microsoft has recently taken to informing users, malware installation. No, this is not a joke or a bit, but rather a glimmering new wing in the hallowed halls of “What are we even doing here?”</p><p>This week, Microsoft <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/experimental-agentic-features-a25ede8a-e4c2-4841-85a8-44839191dfb3?ref=aftermath.site"><u>updated its support page</u></a> on “Experimental Agentic Features” – user-like AI sidekicks that interact “with your apps and your files, using vision and advanced reasoning to click, type and scroll like a human would” – with the following warning:</p><blockquote>Agentic AI has powerful capabilities today – for example, it can complete many complex tasks in response to user prompts, transforming how users interact with their PCs. As these capabilities are introduced, AI models still face functional limitations in terms of how they behave and occasionally may hallucinate and produce unexpected outputs. Additionally, agentic AI applications introduce novel security risks, such as cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.</blockquote><p>So basically, the not-actually-intelligent, agency-free “agent” making decisions about your apps and files on your behalf might accidentally give away your data or plague your PC with malware. Cool! Microsoft says that humans will need to approve all decisions made by AI agents, but a) that’s a far from fool-proof stopgap, and b) then what’s the point of letting an AI agent take the wheel in the first place?</p><p>Lumping this tendency in with hallucinations makes sense on multiple levels: Once again, a company has uncovered what should be considered a fatal flaw, but which it has evidently decided is little more than an annoying glitch – an aberration rather than something hard-coded and essential about how generative AI functions. And again, this sure sounds like yet another instance in which AI is liable to cause more problems than it solves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On the upside, Windows 11’s agentic workspace is toggled off by default. On the downside, there’s no guarantee that will last, especially as Microsoft continues to foist AI upon every element of its business imaginable. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/business/nvidia-elite-investors?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the AI bubble is looking worryingly shimmery</u></a>, like the gentlest of jostles could blow the whole thing wide open. If all of Wall Street breathes a sigh of relief following <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-q3-earnings-live-updates-nvda-stock-price-ai-chips-2025-11?ref=aftermath.site#nvidia-says-energy-could-be-a-bottleneck-for-ai-adoption"><u>a lone company’s earnings report</u></a>, that’s probably not a great sign for the structural integrity of… everything else.</p><p>But for now, a silver lining: it <a href="https://defector.com/it-took-many-years-and-billions-of-dollars-but-microsoft-finally-invented-a-calculator-that-is-wrong-sometimes?ref=aftermath.site"><u>took many years and billions of dollars</u></a>, but Microsoft finally invented a calculator that’s wrong sometimes <em>and </em>can install malware on our computers. </p>

Not only did it pull in a record $57 billion in revenue — and roughly $4,000 of pure profit per second — it grew its data center business by $10 billion in a single quarter alone. It reported a record $51.2 billion from that data center business, a 66 percent increase over last year.</p><p>A lot of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/812455/ai-industry-earnings-bubble-fomo-hype">eyes are on Nvidia’s data center revenue</a> right now as a bellwether for the “AI bubble” as a whole. Nvidia doesn’t seem to expect its data center growth to slow down despite fears of that bubble popping — its Q4 outlook is a whopping $65 billion, which would require it to grow quarterly revenue by another $8 billion in just three more months.</p><p>Nvidia <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2026">CEO Jensen Huang says</a> the company’s selling every AI server chip it can make: “Blackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out.” Turns out that doesn’t <em>literally</em> mean Blackwell is sold out, though: “We’ve got plenty of Blackwells to sell you, we have lots of Blackwells coming,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnYZiCtI0GQ">he clarified on <em>Bloomberg</em> <em>TV</em></a>.</p><div><p>Nvidia adds that its <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2026/Q326/Q3FY26-CFO-Commentary.pdf">Blackwell Ultra chip is driving the bulk of its latest data center surge</a>: “Blackwell Ultra is now our leading architecture across all customer categories while our prior Blackwell architecture saw continued strong demand.”</p></div><p>Additionally, gaming revenue is up 30 percent year-over-year, a good sign for Nvidia’s Blackwell gaming chips, which got off to a bit of a rocky start with some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/672637/nvidia-rtx-5060-review-meddling-gamersnexus-wake-up-call">mixed reviews of the RTX 50-series GPUs</a> earlier this year.</p><p>During today’s investor call, Huang seemed confident when concerns about an “AI bubble” were raised, saying, “There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.” He went on to recap many of the same claims Nvidia has been making for years about how AI will change everything, and added that AI has “reached a tipping point,” saying, “The transition to agentic and physical AI will be revolutionary.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, November 19th: </strong>Added comments from Nvidia’s investor call; updated headline after Nvidia clarified to Bloomberg that it still has “plenty of Blackwells to sell you.”</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/824111/nvidia-q3-2026-earnings-data-center-revenue]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign is bad</a>. So it’s a shame that the coolest bit of <em>Black Ops 7</em>, a new co-op RPG-meets-extraction-shooter mode called Endgame, is locked behind completing said not-very-good campaign. But that’s changing very soon, according to the game’s developer, Treyarch.</p> <p>The latest entry in Activision’s long-running FPS franchise,<a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-user-reviews-steam-2000644734"> <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a>, launched earlier this week to mixed reviews from fans and critics. While many praised the game’s visuals and zombies mode, its multiplayer feels long in the tooth, and its campaign is a wild, incomprehensible mess that is only fun to play through if you like experiencing expensive trainwrecks. And for some odd reason, Treyarch decided to lock perhaps the best, coolest mode in<em> Black Ops 7,</em> Endgame, behind completion of the campaign.</p>

 <p>Currently, you have to complete the campaign to play Endgame <em>or</em> get invited to a lobby created by someone who has already finished the story. It feels like a bad decision, and many players have likely not touched Endgame yet because they don’t want to play (or finish) this year’s terrible campaign. And Treyarch seems to get that it was a regrettable design choice, and will be removing the restriction on November 21.</p>

 <p><span>“We’ve seen an awesome response to Endgame from players who’ve already been dropping in,” <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1991220426618597519">tweeted Treyarch.</a> “So we’re making it available to everyone in </span><em><span>Black Ops 7</span></em><span>.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We've seen an awesome response to Endgame from players who've already been dropping in, so we're making it available to everyone in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> starting Friday, Nov. 21.</p> <p>Team up with other players to complete objectives, increase your power, earn unique Weapon Camos, and take on… <a href="https://t.co/2igahTPHv6">pic.twitter.com/2igahTPHv6</a></p> <p>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1991220426618597519?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p>Endgame is set on the same open-world island map that is found in the campaign. But this time around, you land with nothing and have to complete various challenges, missions, and quests dotted around the large island, either alone or with a few pals.</p>

 <p>As you kill enemies, find new loot, and complete activities, you get more powerful and can explore more of the island, with the end goal being to reach the most challenging enemies and powerful loot and then extract before time runs out. Do so, and you can return with all your stuff. Die or fail to leave, and you start over. It’s a very fun mode that takes the excellent and snappy combat of <em>Black Ops 7</em> and transplants it into a new experience inspired by extraction shooters like <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>, but which doesn’t feel as punishing as those games tend to be.</p> <p>As a bonus reward, Treyarch will send out a bunch of XP boosters and Gobblegum packs to players who beat the campaign and started playing Endgame before this change. And that’s cool; I think it’s just nice to give players who suffered through the campaign some sort of gift for their trouble. Regardless, I’m excited to play more Endgame with more people later this week and check out more of the island and what it has to offer.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-bets-big-on-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-now-selling-at-new-record-low-to-crush-iphone-sales-2000645542</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Flagship smartphones keep getting more expensive but Amazon just threw down a record low price on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra that makes the decision easier: This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/">powerhouse with 512GB storage drops to $1,057 from its usual $1,419 price tag</a>&nbsp;and puts it in direct competition with Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro that launched in September.</p>
<p>Samsung loaded the S25 Ultra with arguments that might<strong> just make it the best smartphone of 2025</strong>. This Black Friday deal represents the lowest price we’ve seen on Samsung’s absolute best phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Smartphone</h2>
<p>The<strong> Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</strong> inside the S25 Ultra represents a real leap in mobile computing power. Qualcomm built this chip on a 3nm process that gives faster speeds while using less power than previous generations. You get desktop-class performance in a phone that fits in your pocket with benchmark scores that embarrass Apple’s A18 Pro chip. The processing power handles intensive tasks like 4K video editing, complex photo processing, and demanding games without breaking a sweat.</p>



<p>The <strong>camera system of AI Night Mode</strong> takes low-light photography to a whole new level. Samsung’s AI algorithms analyze scenes in real-time and auto-optimize settings based on what you are shooting. The phone captures multiple exposures and combines them in an instant to churn out bright, clear photos in conditions where other phones would produce grainy messes. You can shoot in near-darkness and still get a usable photo with correct colors and sharp details. The AI recognizes different subjects like food, pets, landscapes, and people, then adjusts the processing to make each shot look its best without any manual tweaking.</p>
<p>With 512GB of storage, you finally have room to actually use your phone – not constantly manage it. Store thousands of photos, hundreds of video clips, and dozens of apps without the stress of running out of room. This storage tier is prohibitively expensive in iPhones, making Samsung’s pricing much more consumer-friendly. The fact that this is unlocked means you can switch carriers anytime without buying a new phone or dealing with carrier restrictions.</p>



<p>The<strong> built-in S Pen turns the S25 Ultra from just a great phone</strong> into a real productivity tool. You can take handwritten notes directly on the screen, annotate PDFs, sketch ideas, and have precision that your finger simply can’t match. The pen stores inside the body of the phone magnetically, so you never need to carry a separate stylus or have any fear of misplacing it. Samsung’s software converts handwriting into text instantly, making note-taking in meetings or during lectures infinitely more useful.</p>
<p>A 5000mAh battery keeps the phone running <strong>through full days of heavy use without needing a midday charge</strong>. You can stream video, browse social media, shoot photos, and make calls all day while still having juice left by bedtime. In addition, fast charging brings this phone’s battery from empty to 50% in about 30 minutes, saving you when you forget to charge it overnight. <strong>Wireless charging is also supported</strong> so you can simply drop your phone on a charging pad instead of fumbling with cables.</p>
<p>What’s more, it boasts a <strong>6.8-inch display diagonal, with colors and blacks delivered by an Dynamic AMOLED panel</strong>. Scroll through apps and websites with incredibly smooth and responsive kinetic performance given the<strong> 120Hz refresh rate</strong>. Peak brightness is sufficient to keep the screen readable in direct sunlight, a problem that plagues cheaper phones. The screen will work with Samsung’s S Pen perfectly, with ultra-low latency making writing feel natural and immediate.</p>
<p>Flagship performance from this Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with 512GB of storage can be had for $1,057 down from $1,419 and that undercuts Apple by a serious margin. The combination of cutting-edge specs and this record Black Friday price makes the S25 Ultra impossible to ignore if you’re in the market for a premium smartphone.</p>

In just 30 seconds, we see Jonesy dodging giant tentacle monster attacks as Godzilla, King Kong, and Star Wars X-Wings battle overhead. Naturally, a giant, half-naked Homer Simpson then shows up before Uma Thurman’s Kill Bill character, The Bride, swoops in, with the trailer then finally telling players to expect the Fortnite Chapter 6 Zero Hour Finale event to take place November 29 at 11 a.m. PT / 2 p.m. ET.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot to unpack here, but the reveal most will pick up off the bat is that Kill Bill appearance.

Some believe Epic is dropping hints that The Seven, a star-studded group that has largely been MIA from Fortnite story content for years, could somehow make a comeback for the Seven-themed Chapter, for example.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Should The Seven return to Epic’s grand video game multiverse, it would likely mean the stars who play them, including Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Brie Larson, would be back, too.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only is <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/2/reiner-knizia" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reiner Knizia</a> certainly the most prolific designer in hobby board games, but The Hobbit: There And Back Again isn’t even his first (or second, or third) game based on Tolkien's book for children. First was a <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/83629/the-hobbit" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2010 game</a> where players were the hobbit’s dwarf companions, helping on his adventure and trying to escape with as much gold as possible. Then came two 2013 cooperative games. None were particularly well-received, especially when you consider how many Knizia titles could count among the best games of all time. So now he’s back for a fourth bite at the hobbit’s ample table, with an all-new design.</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><div catalogid="76f9079f-4bfe-4563-a7e7-987284baddc1" id="230894"><div id="230894" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Hobbit: There and Back Again</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual box contents are very straightforward. There are four big flip-books of dry-wipe pages and an accompanying marker, one for each player. The books are a fantastic idea, sturdily bound and much more convenient than the mess of loose playsheets that dominate in dry-wipe games. You also get a standard 12-sided die and five custom printed six-sided dice bearing a variety of shapes and symbols. Finally there’s a sheet of punch out tokens representing various resources you can collect on your adventures: bread, swords and, in a wholly unnecessary nod to a famous scene from the book, pine-cones.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s more interesting to discuss is the art style. Interpretations of Tolkien tend toward the meticulous and lavishly detailed, as befits the rich setting he created. But The Hobbit was originally conceived as a children’s book, separate from the legendarium he was creating in his spare time: its incorporation into those invented myths came later. And this seems to be the inspiration behind the illustrations here, which are chunky, cartoonish, and occasionally silly. This is likely to be divisive – it increases the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family-weight</a> appeal of the title, but might annoy fans who take their Tolkien lore more seriously.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/pxl-20251106-190117785-1763583467659.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hobbit: There and Back Again is fundamentally a path-drawing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-roll-and-write-board-games">roll and write game</a>. However many players are competing, someone rolls the five dice, three of which will come up with path symbols that draw a line, often with turns and branches, across one, two or three squares. The other two roll resources, like bread and swords. There are eight scenarios in the game, each with its own page in the included flip-book, and in most of them the goal is to use path symbols to draw a line from a starting point to an end goal, ideally hitting certain squares and avoiding others along the way. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The art is likely to be divisive – it increases the family-weight appeal of the title, but might annoy fans who take their Tolkien lore more seriously.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This being a Reiner Knizia game, however, there is a great deal more to this than first meets the eye. For starters, most games of this kind see all the players sharing the results of the roll, marking them up on their own sheets. But this involves dice-drafting so, on your turn, you pick one and remove it from the pool. Instantly this makes the decision more interesting as you’re not only picking to optimize your own route but potentially deny it to other players. For this reason the game works best as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">2-player board game</a>, as it’s easier to keep a close eye on what others are doing. It’s still fun with more, but loses a bit of that interactive edge. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every scenario also has its own specific requirements to explore. A couple of them are too similar, but for the most part they’re impressively diverse, given the relatively simple core rules. In the first, for example, you have to link 12 starting squares, containing the dwarfs heading to Bilbo’s unexpected party, to his hobbit-hole at Bag End. The second sees you trekking a single route across a dangerous, troll-filled wilderness on your way to the elves at Rivendell. Following adventures involve picking shapes determined by a die roll to surround specific squares, filling in flight routes for eagles to rescue stranded dwarfs, and using paths to rescue burning houses while shooting arrows at the marauding dragon, Smaug.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/pxl-20251115-095136870-1763583689101.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Further tricksiness is baked into the scoring that determines the winner. In the first adventure you’ll score points for each dwarf that you successfully link to Bilbo’s home, but get a bonus if you have a bread resource ready to feed them first. Except if you look at the available scores closely, you’ll note that might not always be the best idea. You can also get extra points if you connect and feed Thorin, the dwarf leader, and the wizard Gandalf except, crucially, the scenario ends for all players as soon as one of them collects the other 12 dwarfs. There’s also extra score available for collecting sword icons, even though they’re useless in completing the scenario. So there’s a constant temptation to cede ground in the race, fishing for those tasty bonuses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can probably imagine, this setup turns every scenario into a race, with the catch being that you don’t always want to finish first, if falling behind gets you enough extra points to take the win. There are mini-races, too, with a pot of glory points available for the first player to reach particular sub-objectives, like surrounding each riddle symbol in the Gollum chapter. Between the various chases, the random dice rolls, and the uncertainty of who’s going to pull what in the draft, The Hobbit: There and Back thrums with excitement and uncertainty right down until the points are totted up at the end.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/pxl-20251115-100202113-1763583876024.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Where the game begins to get into stickier territory is replay value. Once you’re played through a scenario and worked out the best way to approach it, the appeal of going through it again begins to drop. But the game has yet another smart twist to try and maintain your interest: unlike most path-making games you can partially draw over previous paths, using your selected shapes to add new bends and junctions, allowing you to reach new areas of the map. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This enriches the spatial puzzle of each scenario tremendously, because there’s no one best route, and you have enormous scope to change up your path each time. When connecting the dwarfs to Bilbo's hole, for instance, you can draw individual paths but you can also link several dwarfs together and then connect them to the hole as a group. Most maps also have squares that give you bonus resources or points, and other squares that you’re discouraged or outright banned from entering. So even when you’ve figured out the scoring, the way the dice fall creates a novel challenge, and there’s always the thrill of the race to anticipate. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/pxl-20251115-100419202-1763583987303.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">What you definitely don’t get is anything other than path-drawing. You can collect wizard hat symbols to unlock one-off extra paths or resource rewards, and if there’s really nothing to do with a die you can assign it to Bilbo the burglar for a wild extra, but this isn’t deep decision-making. And the game is pretty minimal in its evocation of the Hobbit’s narrative. Each scenario tips its hat to Tolkien in visual and spatial terms, but it’s pretty hard to imagine surrounding a troll icon as watching it turn to stone with the break of dawn, especially when the same mechanic is used later to answer riddles.</p><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp4qKY?object_uuid=8a26d2cf-331e-4c15-ae93-40a2e5e073be&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Asmodee Store</a></li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Nov 19, 2025 8:54 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Games that use drawn routes as the central mechanism on which everything else hangs are not common nowadays. So it’s really welcome to see The Hobbit: There and Back Again resurrect this niche genre, and doubly so for instantly becoming the best title in it. There’s so much to enjoy here, little tricks to uncover in each scenario, different approaches to filling in the routes, and the excitement of the race. Just be aware that a fantastic path-finding game is all you’re going to get: while family-weight players are going to have a great time, hardcore strategists and Tolkien purists may be disappointed.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-hobbit-there-and-back-again-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Here's a sentence I am very glad to write: the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a>-like is here! Or at least the first one I'm aware of (and the actual genre is dice-driven <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, no more something-likes, ok?). It's called Dusk Punk, which mixes the narrative and mechanical framework established by Citizen Sleeper with the aesthetics and world of games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>, and it's out today.
</p>
<p>
The setting of the game is a steampunk city called Dredgeport, a singular location more like the first Citizen Sleeper as opposed to the second. You must explore this city, coming face to face with gangs and corrupt law enforcement, as an ex-soldier, accidentally marked as dead and shipped back to the city. It is also an explicitly political game, a voice over in the game's trailer noting "unions rising up" and that "revolution is in the air."
</p>

<p>
Similarly to Citizen Sleeper, you have to balance your health, energy, and stress levels, a lot of which comes down to how lucky you get with the role of the dice. Such a mechanic is so obviously embedded in tabletop RPGs, and was so well translated into Citizen Sleeper. There is a strange feeling in having to pray for digital dice rolling in your favour, one I'm happy to see transplanted into a new world from a fresh perspective. Not to mention having to balance relationships with the game's various characters, some of whom may have questionable goals in mind.
</p><p>
I'm particularly won over by the final bit of voice over in the trailer: "break their laws, break the city, break free." Duskpunk is clearly not a game that features an easy or welcoming world, again much like Citizen Sleeper, but on the surface it seems like one that wants to push its audience to make a change. That's an even funnier thing to push someone to do when your ability to do so may be impeded by the luck of some dice. I suppose that's life! And that's interesting, so, Duskpunk has piqued my curiosity.
</p>
<p>
You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2610880/Duskpunk/">pick it up on Steam now</a> with a 25% off launch discount, and there's a demo for you to take a look at too.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%B2s-new-map-is-so-good-i-can%E2%80%99t-stop-playing-it.1358614/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’m not happy that I have to write about <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a>‘s new map, Eastwood. I’d rather be playing it. I’ve already put around five hours into the map in a single night, and I’m here to say: It good.</p> <p>On November 18, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s latest major season one update</a> landed on all platforms. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news?page=1&amp;type=game-updates">It added a new game mode</a>, Sabotage, which is too small and not very good. But more importantly, it added a whole new map. And unlike the last map added earlier this month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-is-very-bad-2000639647">the dreadful Blackwell Fields,</a> this big new warzone set in a rich California suburb is amazing, providing the perfect blend of open warfare and close-quarters chaos that makes good <em>Battlefield</em> maps so damn enjoyable.</p> <p>First off, Eastwood is big. Or at least it feels big. I’m sure if you were to take it and compare it directly with other maps from past <em>Battlefield</em> games, it wouldn’t appear massive. Heck, I’m not even sure it’s the biggest map in <em>Battlefield 6.</em> But raw acreage isn’t the key to making a map feel big.</p>

  <p>Instead, what Eastwood does is provide lots of spaces to play around in and a variety of locales to destroy. While playing on Eastwood you’ll run into multiple houses with fully explorable interiors, pools, and garages; a large golf course complete with a fancy clubhouse; undeveloped sections of nature; and more. Crossing Eastwood on foot or in a vehicle just feels like such a journey because you’ll pass by so many different locations and landmarks. That helps it feel big.</p>

 <p>That variety also makes the map a blast to play. The first night it was in the game, my pals and I played it non-stop for nearly five hours. And I never got bored because matches often felt like smaller battles spread across different tiny maps. Perhaps, at first, we’d fight hard in the dense suburbs, going house to house and dodging tanks. Later, we’d be assaulting the clubhouse in drivable golf carts and avoiding snipers. And we might end the match in a tank war up near the hills as our allies flank via the golf course.</p> <p>Eastwood has quickly become one of my favorite <em>Battlefield 6</em> maps and already feels like a classic map that people will talk about years from now. This new level also makes me excited for <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s future. It shows that the teams working on the game can make maps that feel big and dense, and offer loads of exciting locales in which to fight. More of this, please.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-review-good-eastwood-big-large-ps5-pc-2000645547]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined isn’t just a reimagining of the late PlayStation 1 era JRPG, it’s also a fresh approach to how Square Enix’s back catalogue can be revisited. We’ve had the pixel remasters of early <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/26/final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-and-more-mana-games-are-now-on-xbox/">Final Fantasy</a>, we’ve had the HD-2D engine applied liberally to the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/29/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review/">Dragon Quest trilogy</a>, and there is, of course, the vast production for the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/"> Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy. Dragon Quest VII, though, has been treated in a new, distinct fashion, and I love how it’s turning out.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Quest VII Reimagined - Follow-Up Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wf6HMdCStmQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Simply put, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined looks like dolls wandering around a diorama. Square Enix created these characters as real-life, physical dolls and then 3D-scanned them into the game to really capture the look, giving them a slightly otherworldly feel, but one that’s uniquely charming. They’re still animated as you’d expect from characters in a video game, as opposed to bobbing around like marionettes in a Thunderbirds episode, and combined with the style of the environments you get to explore, it comes together beautifully to help this remake stand out from the crowd.</p>


<p>My hands-on demo time took me to two early portions of the game, visiting the village of Emberdale just as it’s being shaken to its core by earth tremors. They think they’ve got it all in hand –&nbsp;just go ahead as usual with the Fire Festival to head up Burnmont to tribute to and appease the gods –&nbsp;but one of the village elders thinks otherwise and enlists you to try and help. As everyone troops up to the volcano and chucks flaming headgear down into the pit, you instead skirt past and descend into the magma tunnels to find the truth of the matter.</p>


<p>Just as with the Nintendo 3DS remake of this game, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined does away with the randomised battle encounters and instead has all the enemies appearing in the overworld. It’s a significantly more modern approach that helps to ease some of the pain of running around and exploring the world, and gives you the chance to sneak up or time a Sudden Strike attack while still in the main game world.</p>
<p>This comes in tandem with a bunch of other quality-of-life improvements that are now fairly typical for RPG remakes, but always good to see. There’s a bevy of party automation which can be applied across all the characters or individually, giving them battle tactics to be more aggressive or defensive, to us magical abilities or focus on healing. This is already a massive time saver for basic encounters, but you can also speed up battles, dip in and out if battles are going to plan or not, and it’s just great to be able to cut through to the more meaningful moments.</p>

<p>You’ll still have plenty to do, though, thanks to the expanded Vocation system, allowing all the characters to ‘moonlight’ with a different class, blending their abilities together instead of entirely switching. Periodically in combat, this will also lead to characters getting ‘Worked Up’ and being able to unleash a powerful, vocation-specific attack, buff or ability that you can set up to aid your party composition. These can be really useful when toughing it out in a beastly boss battle.</p>

<p>Jumping ahead in this adventure to the town of Wetlock, and the townsfolk have been captured by a man doing his best Pied Piper impression. Another bad guy to battle, eh? Well, not all is as it seems, and after battling some real hordes of slimes and other monsters – some of which combine themselves in large numbers, call in reinforcements and more – you get the truth of the matter. Wetlock has been flooded, but it wasn’t this old chap; he was actually saving people from the evil merman Gracos.</p>
<p>Once you reach him, Gracos proves to be a stern challenge, and it’s for these moments that you really want to pull back some of the automation and take more manual control to pick the best abilities, choose when to heal or defend, and generally make every moment count. The party has become more varied thanks to the addition of the wolf-raised Ruff and the battle dancing Aishe, and being deeper into the game means that there’s a huge array of abilities and spells to choose from across the board. Finding the most effective abilities, buffing the team and staving off Gracos’ worst is a fun juggling act.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is shaping up to be another fantastic remake from Square Enix. It’s a bit bewildering just how many different styles and approaches they’ve taken to revisiting their classics, but this takes a wonderful art direction and combines it with a great set of quality-of-life improvements while tweaking it to address the biggest criticisms. All in all, it should be the best way to revisit this adventure when it arrives next year.</p>

<p>Nearly two months after announcing the plans, Avalanche Studios has officially closed its office in Liverpool. This closure sees 31 people lose their jobs, adding to the ever-growing job loss count in the gaming industry.</p>



<p>In a post on its website, the company confirmed the closure and thanked the staff who were impacted.</p>







<p><strong>“The exceptional talent, passion, and commitment from everyone leaving have impacted every project,” </strong><a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/updateliverpool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the statement reads</a>. <strong>“We are truly grateful for the dedication and invaluable contributions to Avalanche Studios Group.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Our focus remains on supporting the [staff] through this transition and to carry on making great games for our player communities.</strong>“</p>



<h2 id="h-layoffs-months-in-the-making">Layoffs Months In The Making</h2>



<p>Plans of the Liverpool closure was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avalanche-studios-closes-office-lays-off-staff-after-contraband-cancelation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced in September</a>. They came just weeks after it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-development-stopped-at-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development on Contraband</a> was ending. Avalanche said the decision came after an internal review of the company and its plans moving forward after the game’s cancelation. </p>







<p>“<strong>This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations</strong>,” they said at the time, while saying it would impact all employees in Liverpool.</p>



<p>In addition to the Liverpool office, layoffs were planned for offices in Malmö and Stockholm. There hasn’t been an update on those locations, however. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Avalanche Studios for what the plans for the studio are moving forward. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite releasing less than a month ago, AdHoc’s Dispatch has sold two million copies. The last episodes, 7 and 8, only came out last week and reached <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-million-copies-adhoc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a million copy milestone</a> within 10 days.</p>







<p>Released in late October, Dispatch follows Robert, a former superhero working a desk job and dispatching ‘reformed’ villains in Los Angeles. Composed of former TellTale Games members, AdHoc Studios brought the iconic Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-type dialogue choices and consequences. The game quickly became&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1981416301709934652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best-selling title</a>&nbsp;on Steam with only two episodes. Then, it reached a million copies only a week and a half after release. Now, with all the episodes out, the team shared an even bigger milestone.</p>



<h2 id="h-adhoc-studios-celebrates-two-million-copies-sold-for-dispatch-with-new-drawing">AdHoc Studios Celebrates Two Million Copies Sold for Dispatch With New Drawing</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We're also sad there are no new episodes this week, but thank you to the 2 million players that have joined us so far. Wouldn't be here without you.</p><p>Art by Derek Stratton. <a href="https://t.co/1Bu2MIMmh9">pic.twitter.com/1Bu2MIMmh9</a></p></div>— AdHoc Studio – Dispatch OUT NOW! (@theAdHocStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1991235043868410096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>A <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1991235043868410096" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new post from AdHoc Studios</a> reveals that Dispatch has sold two million copies, a huge milestone for an indie title. To commemorate the occasion, Derek Stratton, the game’s art director, drew a new picture featuring everyone’s favorite character, Beef. The drawing is somber, as no new episodes have been released due to Episode 7 and 8 being the last ones. Still, the team seems pretty grateful for the many fans who joined in the journey.</p>



<p>Currently, Dispatch is available on PC and PlayStation 5. No ports to Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch 2 have been announced. Unfortunately, no Season Two has been revealed yet, though the team <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/11/11/a-new-update-on-dispatch-season-2-after-its-surprising-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">seems adamant</a> about bringing it back. Given how it started development years ago, it’ll likely be some time before we see the Z-Team again. Still, with how popular it has become (and earning a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Award nomination</a>), the future for the title is looking bright.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been one year since STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl debuted on PC and Xbox Series S and X, marking the end of a long and troubled development phase that saw developer GSC Game World facing numerous challenges, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, to reach completion.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my review of the game</a>, I rated it 8 out of 10, praising its ambitious features but also noting that it was rough and needed refinements as well as balancing tweaks. The developer has indeed released several major updates over these past fifty-two weeks, the last of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-update-1-7-adds-faction-turf-wars-expedition-mode-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went live this week</a>, significantly improving the A-Life system, adding new difficulty modes and many other improvements.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, the game is also set to debut on Sony's PlayStation 5 consoles, now that the timed Xbox console exclusivity deal with Microsoft has expired. We sent a few questions to GSC Game World to discuss this new version of STALKER 2, as well as inquire about the state of promised post-launch features and content, such as DLCs, cross-platform mods, and multiplayer. The answers were kindly provided by Communications Director Zakhar Bocharov and Technical Director Ievgen Kulyk.</p>

<iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — PS5® Feature Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2edfhwIb0Aw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>One year after the game's launch, how do you feel about STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl? Has it achieved what you were aiming for, both in terms of quality and sales?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar:</strong> We’ll strive to be as objective as possible. <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One million copies sold in under three days</a> and several million players through Game Pass on PC and Xbox can undoubtedly be considered successful figures. Over the year, the game received 7 major updates — and far more smaller ones — which not only improved performance but also added new content. The game is now significantly different from what it was at launch. Updates are a complex matter. In the world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R., they could probably go on forever, much like the pursuit of perfection. Nevertheless, they will continue forward on.</p>



<p><strong>I have noticed that you added gyro aiming through the controller's motion sensor on PlayStation 5. Do you believe this is a legitimate alternative to the regular method in terms of accuracy and comfort?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ievgen:</strong> This can be done on PS5, and it will add comfort for many players — so we’re doing it. Preferences for a specific control method are 100% a matter of taste, but in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, you can play with gamepads on PC, and with keyboard and mouse on consoles — if that’s your desire.</p>



<p><strong>Out of all the features enabled with the DualSense controller, which one do you feel is the most fitting addition to STALKER 2?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar:</strong> The technical team loves the gamepad radio chatter and the gyro aiming the most. To my taste, haptic feedback works great — this PS5 feature still feels fresh to me in many games, including ours. In any case, literally all DualSense and PS5 features work to multiply immersion in an immersive game — and that means they're right on point.</p>



<p><strong>How long did it take you to develop the enhancements for the PS5 Pro version? Could you please share the rendering resolution/frame rate options, as well as whether you are using PSSR?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ievgen:</strong> PS5 Pro improvements were in the same scope as the development for the platform in general — just the power of this specific console allows for graphical enhancements. Below are our targets in terms of performance:</p>



<p>Base PS5</p>



<ul>
<li>Performance: 2K 60 FPS</li>



<li>Quality: 4K 30 FPS</li>
</ul>



<p>PS5 Pro</p>



<ul>
<li>Performance: 4K 60 FPS</li>



<li>Quality: 4K 30 FPS</li>
</ul>



<p>We don’t use PSSR — only UE5-integrated TSR.</p>



<p><strong>Would it be fair to compare the PS5 Pro version to PC's High settings? If not, what are the differences?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar:</strong> Console optimization is a bit more complex and specific than just porting over PC presets. It's hard to answer the question 100% precisely, but the PS5 Pro version is definitely leaning towards PC High settings. I think comparison videos between platforms are just a matter of time, so you'll be able to form your own opinion.</p>



<p><strong>Will the DualSense features, such as speaker support, gyro aiming, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers, also be available on PC when using this controller?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ievgen:</strong> Yes, starting with update 1.7.</p>



<p><strong>In your roadmap, you've <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-2025-roadmap-includes-ue-upgrade-new-missions-anomalies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> an upgrade to a newer version of Unreal Engine 5. When will this be available, and what kind of performance improvements do you anticipate?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar: </strong>Switching to a new version of Unreal Engine 5 is a very big task, which is exactly why even in our roadmap we especially noted that we cannot guarantee the exact timing. It should bring a significant boost to optimization overall, but we will keep you updated on the timing of this update through our socials. But here I would like to note that update 1.7 has already delivered a significant and very noticeable optimization gain, and it is available right now. </p>



<p><strong>The roadmap also listed new missions. What can you tell us about those?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar:</strong> This update is quite close, so the answer might end up being more of a spoiler.</p>



<p><strong>Are you still planning to deliver <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a multiplayer mode</a> at some point? If so, could you share any information about how it would work?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar:</strong> I have no updates on multiplayer right now.</p>



<p><strong>Beyond multiplayer, you also mentioned cross-platform mods and hardware-accelerated ray tracing as two things you were working on post-launch. Do you have any updates to share on that front?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar: </strong>There are no new details right now, but we’ll share them on our social media as soon as we’re ready.</p>



<p><strong>Can we expect the first of the planned STALKER 2 DLCs to be released at some point next year?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Zakhar:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Official <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> board games are coming next year. Renegade Game Studios will be adapting the popular LitRPG book series into two official tabletop experiences, bringing the science-fantasy series to gaming tables.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/blog/renegade-game-studios-announces-two-upcoming-dungeon-crawler-carl-tabletop-games/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Renegade Game Studios announced they will be producing two <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> board games. Both of these games will be coming to the crowdfunding platform Backerkit in April 2026.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeon-crawler-carl-book-cover.jpg?itok=dmbhOAEd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeon-crawler-carl-book-cover.jpg?itok=x5dimtCw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these board games is an official <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> TTRPG. This is obvious, since the book series heavily leans on the fantasy TTRPG trope of the "dungeon crawl," blown out into a demented, competitive reality show. The announcement does not specify which RPG system it will use, but confirms that navigating the commercialized elements of the dungeon will be a central mechanic.</p>

<p>The second <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> board game will be a co-op deck builder. The game will be based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/unstoppable-board-game-roguelike-deck-builder-is-fully-funded-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Unstoppable</em></a>, designed by John D. Clair. The game is set in the World Dungeon, where you'll battle against neighborhood, borough, and city bosses, gearing up and leveling up along the way. The game can be played solo or 2-player co-op.</p>

<p>Regardless of which <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> board game catches your eye, illustrations for both will be done by longtime artist&nbsp;<span>Luciano Fleitas, adding a layer of authenticity to these tabletop adaptations.</span></p>

<p><span><em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> is a science-fantasy book series written by Matt Dinniman. It involves Carl, a former Coast Guard, and his ex's cat, Princess Donut, being thrown into a subterranean dungeon created by the alien Borant Corporation as part of a Running Man-esque reality show, <em>Dungeon Crawler World</em>. Carl can either compete, or stay on the Earth's surface where modern amenities are gone.</span></p>

<p><span>The series is currently up to seven novels. According to Dinniman, he has plans for up to ten books in the series.</span></p>

              <p>We’ve just entered the sixth year of the latest console generation. Can you believe it’s already been that long? The Xbox Series X and S are now fully matured. Their libraries are more robust than ever, full not just of cross-gen ports and sequels but brand-new series as well. How do the games measure up?</p> <p>While platform barriers are starting to come down and it’s getting harder to tell the consoles apart in many respects, the Xbox Series X/S still has a few remnants left of a unique identity. We compiled this list mindful of the nuances around exclusivity and first-party games while also wanting to acknowledge the great games that are playable on Xbox Series X/S whether they originated there or not. Simply put: if you just got your first Xbox Series X/S and haven’t already played these games before, what follows are the top “must plays” for the platform.</p>

 <p>Yes, the Xbox Series X and S are basically souped-up Xbox Ones, which means you’ll rarely be pressed for awesome games to play. A good rule of thumb is this: If it was playable on the Xbox One, it’s playable on the Xbox Series X and S. (To that end, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-games-for-the-xbox-one-1500422046">here’s our list of the best games for the Xbox One</a>.) There’s also the matter of a little service called Game Pass.</p> <p>For $30 a month, you can also access Microsoft’s subscription library, including first-party exclusives and a rotating slew of third-party hits. (Hey, look, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-games-on-xbox-game-pass-1841477023?_ga=2.146372340.1373133010.1689166215-2090935794.1654779924">here’s our list of the best games on Game Pass</a>.) With all that in mind, here are the best games for the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>Every family has at least one nostalgia-filled retro gamer. You know, that person who still swears the SNES controller is perfection or insists that nothing beats the original Pokémon intro. And honestly? They might not be wrong. There’s something timeless about jumping back into the games we grew up with, which makes retro-themed gifts some of the best surprises you can give during the holidays.</p>



<p>Whether you’re the type of person who has to hunt down classic cartridges from the 70s, 80s, and 90s, or you just want to do something small for someone special in your life, there are plenty of gift options to make that retro gamer in your life happy. From fantastic books to novelty gifts, these are the best gifts in 2025 for your nostalgia-filled friend.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-retro-gaming-gifts-for-2025">Best Retro Gaming Gifts For 2025</h2>



<p><strong>Press Reset by Jason Schrier</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>One of the best books on games and the people that make them, Press Reset comes from veteran journalist Jason Schreier. Rather than tell you more, let’s let Schreier explain it himself.</p>



<p><strong>“The business of videogames is both a prestige industry and an opaque one. Based on dozens of first-hand interviews that cover the development of landmark games—Bioshock Infinite, Epic Mickey, Dead Space, and more—on to the shocking closures of the studios that made them,&nbsp;Press Reset&nbsp;tells the stories of how real people are affected by game studio shutdowns, and how they recover, move on, or escape the industry entirely.”</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Original Xbox: The Console and the Games by&nbsp;Jonathan Clarke&nbsp;and&nbsp;Clarke</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are a long-time Xbox fan, the upcoming book Original Xbox: The Console brings you a visual history of all of the games released on the original Xbox. </p>



<p>The book comes from the team at Xbox Era and features 360 full color pages and over 790 games. <strong>“From Fable to MechAssault, Halo: Combat Evolved to the very first Forza Motorsport, this book is a celebration of the console that started it all.”</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>The 100 Greatest Console Video Games: 1988-1998 by Brett Weiss</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The 100 Greatest Console Video Games: 1988-1998 is the follow-up to the best-selling The 100 Greatest Console Video Games: 1977-1987. </p>



<p>The book features 100 games with two-to-three full pages of the game’s history, production info, details, developer quotes and more.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>A Handheld History by Lost in Cult</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The last book on this list, A Handheld History takes a look&nbsp;<strong>“into decades of gaming memories and reconnect you to that long car journey full of discarded AA batteries before speeding ahead to the contemporary days of blockbusters in your backpack.”</strong></p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Mario Heat Changing Mug</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For your coffee or tea aficionados, this mug is as straight forward as it gets. When it’s cold, it shows and overworld Mario level. Pour a hot drink in it, it goes dark with extra details.</p>







<hr>







<p><strong>Gameboy Lego Set</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are a lot of gaming-themed LEGO sets, but one of the favorites is the Gameboy set. Featuring 421 pieces, this set includes a Gameboy display, two game cartridges that can go into a Gam Pak slot, and even options for a Nintendo Start Screen or game screen placeholders. </p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Nintendo NES Coasters</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Want to show off your fandom without leaving a ring on your table, these NES coasters look like the cartridges from eight classic games: Metroid, Duck Hunt, Donkey Kong, Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3, The Legend of Zelda, and Excitebike.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Super Mario Coin Block Pillow Plush</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are plenty of plush pillows available, but the Mario coin block pillow is one that just wants you to let out some frustration. Get this pillow and just give it a few punches, but it’s unlikely you’ll get any coins out of it. You can try, though.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Subscription (12 months)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A modern-day console gift for a retro gamer? That’s right. With a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion subscription players get access to not only NES, SNES, and Game Boy classic games, but also Sega Genesis, N64, and GameCube games.</p>



<p>If the backlog wasn’t full enough, adding these games that are full of nostalgia for the gamer in your life is one heck of a gift.</p>







<hr>







<p><strong>8Bitdo Bluetooth Retro Receiver for PS1, PS2, and Windows</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you want to play your old PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 with a modern controller, then 8Bitdo has you covered. The 8Bitdo Bluetooth Retro Receiver allows you to use your Xbox, PS4, PS5, Wii U Pro and Switch Pro controllers wirelessly with your older systems. Imagine just sitting on your couch that’s more than 10 feet from your TV?</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>The Oregon Trail Card Game</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you want to get away from the screen but still relive your gaming youth, The Oregon Trail Card Game will give you dysentery wherever you go. The game supports 2-6 players and even features 8-bit style art.</p>







<hr>



<p><strong>Atari 2600+ PAC-MAN Edition Console</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sticking with the classics, if you grew up playing the Atari 2600 or just want to see what all the fuss is about, then the Atari 2600+ might just be the next best thing to the original classic console. The Atari 2600+ includes a wireless joystick and is compatible with both 2600 and 7800 games. The system also comes with Pac-Man 7800 and Pac-Man 2600 and has HDMI output for modern TVs.</p>

The Desert Sandtrack Flea is a 1:18 scale replica from The Wand Company, and an IGN Store exclusive that has a limited run of just 1,500 units available for preorder right now. With a mix of die-cast metal, thermoplastic rubber, and engineered plastics, it’s built to last.

It even comes with Doc Mitchell’s evaluation cards, allowing you to do a psychological evaluation of friends in the real world. Everything then comes packaged in a retro display box created exclusively for this 15th Anniversary Edition. This bundle doesn’t drop till June 2026, but it’s perfect for any New Vegas fan. </p></div><p id="pip-boy-3000-replica"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pip-Boy 3000 Replica">Fallout Pip-Boy 3000 Replica</h2></p><div catalogid="84737b41-6a12-4e0e-9a1a-40bee8f54287" id="230118"><div id="230118" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout Pip-Boy 3000 Replica</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 3 will want to get their hands on, or rather arms into, this 1:1 replica of the Pip-Boy 3000. Each detail of this wrist-mounted computer remains faithful to the game. A fully functional IPS display delivers that vintage cathode ray tube look, complete with screen glitches and a huge gallery of media, including the Atomic Command minigame. The Wand Company spared no expense when creating this replica, from its die-cast metal front casing and memory foam cuff with a spacer to a rechargeable LiPo power cell and LED torch. It’s sure to elevate your cosplay to another level, but the included machined metal stand is ideal for displaying this exhibition-grade collectible — or using the Pip-Boy 3000 as an alarm clock; yes, it does that too. </p></div><p id="new-vegas-ranger-statue"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="New Vegas Ranger Statue">Fallout New Vegas Ranger Statue</h2></p><div catalogid="84737b41-6a12-4e0e-9a1a-40bee8f54287" id="230124"><div id="230124" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout New Vegas Ranger Statue</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The detail is incredible on this 8.4-inch resin statue of a New Vegas Ranger.

He’s combat-ready with his finger on the trigger of a meticulously decorated revolver.

Nuka Mix isn’t the only Nuka-Cola flavor available; Bethesda’s Gear Store has a bunch of other kinds for an epic Nuka Mix Station at home.</p></div><p id="desert-ranger-battle-helmet"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Desert Ranger Battle Helmet">Fallout Desert Ranger Battle Wearable Helmet</h2></p><div catalogid="84737b41-6a12-4e0e-9a1a-40bee8f54287" id="230123"><div id="230123" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout Desert Ranger Battle Wearable Helmet</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Before the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/New_California_Republic_Rangers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New California Republic Rangers</a> formed, there were the Desert Rangers, and you can grab a piece of their history with a durable plastic helmet modeled after one found in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. It’s hand-painted with weathered detail to make each helmet unique. A green glow even comes from the eyes, thanks to the inclusion of LED lights. Best of all, this helmet is wearable for some epic cosplay, and it comes with a stand for displaying. An enamel pin of a completely geared-up Desert Ranger is also included. You can pre-order the Desert Ranger Battle Helmet now, with shipping expected to begin in December. </p></div><p id="lucys-vault-33-backpack"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lucy's Vault 33 Backpack">Fallout Lucy's Vault 33 Backpack</h2></p><div catalogid="84737b41-6a12-4e0e-9a1a-40bee8f54287" id="230120"><div id="230120" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout Lucy's Vault 33 Backpack</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While you might not be navigating the Wasteland like Lucy, you can accessorize similarly to her in the real world with this remarkably accurate replica rolltop backpack.

You’ll find a 20L interior compartment, a laptop slot, pockets for various accessories, and, of course, the thick signature yellow blanket that rests on top.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Haha. Yeah, I know. "Half-Life 3". The long-fabled, often-rumored, still non-existent third numbered entry in the Half-Life series that fans have craved but never heard a credible whisper of. It's been a pervasive joke in the industry and among fans for years, a stand-in for a thing that doesn't exist and never would.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet, for some reason, a lot of people seem to think it's being announced soon. Possibly in the next few weeks. Maybe even today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might have seen it. The sudden flurry of mentions of Half-Life 3, some humorous, some quite serious. The surge of memes. A handful of people that seem to have lost their dang minds:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update 1:09pm PT:</strong> Originally, I had included several embeds of Reddit posts of people desperately praying and begging for a Half-Life 3 announcement. However, the r/halflife mods appear to be removing them, seemingly due to the subreddit's rule against "low-value submissions", aka memes, and perhaps due to the sheer volume of these posts recently. These have subsequently been replaced by more posts wishing for Half-Life 3 - honestly, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just check out the subreddit</a>, I'm sure you'll see some good ones that haven't been deleted yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Original story continues below:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's going on? Why do people think Half-Life 3 is imminent, seriously or unseriously? We investigated:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Half-Hope</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Half-Life 3 rumors have existed pretty much since Half-Life 2 first released, so that's nothing new. But the last couple of years have seen a steady trickle of interesting little threads that have lead many to believe that a third entry was actually in development, quietly, at Valve. There were vague nods, such as the Half-Life: Alyx team <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-half-life-alyx-sequel">saying they wanted to make more Half-Life games</a> and a Final Hours documentary that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-left-4-dead-3-details-cancelled-valve">actually confirmed it was in development at one point</a> between 2013 and 2014. We've also seen dataminers pulling crumbs from various Valve releases over the last few years of what seems to be an in-development game internally at Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">known only as "HLX",</a> using Source 2. Dataminers have worked out that it's a full-fledged, non-VR, Half-Life game of some sort, that's been in the works since at least 2021, probably earlier. That game is possibly the same one as was accidentally leaked by a voice actor in 2024, who referred to it as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Project White Sands"</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But this year there's been a marked increase in little breadcrumbs. Right after the new year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-rumors-ramp-up-after-g-man-voice-actor-issues-cryptic-tweet-his-first-in-years">G-Man's voice actor issued a cryptic post</a> teasing "unexpected surprises" in 2025 – it was his first tweet since he congratulated Valve on Half-Life: Alyx in December 2020. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-fans-are-doing-a-gta-6-and-losing-their-minds-over-hidden-half-life-3-clues-they-desperately-want-to-be-real">Fans proceeded to tear apart the post</a>, delving deep into an album cover image and the number 197 for what they believed were even more hints that something was in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But an already simmering pot of rumors turned into a full boil with the announcement last week of new Valve hardware: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-machine-hands-on-first-impressions">the Steam Machine</a>, complete with a new Steam controller, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-frame-preview-hands-on-with-valves-state-of-the-art-vr-headset">VR headset known as the Steam Frame</a>. Notably, there were no software announcements alongside these hardware reveals, which is a bit odd given that Valve tends to release new games alongside new hardware - recall Half-Life: Alyx and the Valve Index headset. Around the same time, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1ox4jzk/more_hopium/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a number</a> of Valve and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/uwn_XYk8Is8?t=2122s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">industry insiders</a> began mentioning Half-Life 3, saying confidently that it was planned for a 2025 announcement still. One leaker, who has a good track record of getting Valve stuff right, said back in May that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-is-not-just-in-development-its-now-playable-end-to-end-leaker-suggests" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Half-Life 3 was officially "playable, end-to-end."</a> There's a <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINqBTwM=/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">massive Miro board floating around</a> that has catalogued every remotely credible recent mention of Half-Life 3, and is worth digging into if you want follow along.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Go, G-Man, Go</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There are so many other weird little indicators floating around that are leading to wild speculation. For instance, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/valve" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve's "Upcoming Releases" tab</a> on its own Steam page only lists one game (Deadlock) despite the sidebar indicating that there are <em>two</em> upcoming game releases. A <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1991101144207085644?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet/X post</a> from the official The Game Awards account commemorating Half-Life's 27th anniversary today has sent everyone into a frenzy, even though it tweets this anniversary every year. There was a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/820533/valve-secrecy-security-guards-steam-machine-valve-hq-no-hl3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weird amount of extra security at Valve</a> during the recent Steam hardware preview events – something noticed by IGN's own representatives and contrasted with my personal experience there for Half-Life: Alyx years ago, which featured a relatively normal and relaxed amount of security.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there was an incredibly silly saga where <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990519287032000600?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geoff Keighley posted a screenshot</a> that showed he had one game in his Steam wishlist. When <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1990526450005651771?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked what the game was</a>, he responded with an eyes emoji. Of course, the Half-Life nerds pounced. Keighley then posted a screenshot of his wishlist showing only the game "Dadlympics," but notably, this was added on 11/18, the same day he posted the screenshot, suggesting he's hiding <em>something.</em> Is he hiding Half-Life 3? Probably not! It doesn't have a viewable Steam page! That's not how Steam works! But that hasn't stopped Half-Life 3 fans from freaking out. Seriously, the replies are hilarious.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/t5L0zHW0Il" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/t5L0zHW0Il</a></p>— arda (@lornarcoss) <a href="https://twitter.com/lornarcoss/status/1990682190263251432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever you believe is happening here, the reality is that this has resulted in the community going completely bonkers. The Half-Life subreddit is overflowing with Half-Life 3 summoning and hope posts. A quick search for Half-Life on Twitter/X reveals an overflow of discourse, prayers, and memes. It's kind of nuts, and also really, really fun:
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, so let's say everyone's right, and we really are getting Half-Life 3 announced soon. When? Well, some think it's as soon as today. November 19, as The Game Awards posted, is the anniversary of Half-Life – what better time to make an announcement? We've already passed the anniversary of Half-Life 2, and the anniversary of Half-Life: Alyx's announcement, but that particular anniversary is the reason you're likely seeing so much noise around this today. The other big possibility floated by some is an announcement at The Game Awards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-collects-12-the-game-awards-nominations-the-most-in-the-awards-history">which is coming up on December 11</a>. That would be a little surprising, given that Valve doesn't need an awards show to command attention with such an announcement. But Valve also has a long history of friendliness with host Geoff Keighley, so maybe it's not so far-fetched after all.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the case, one thing is certain: either Half-Life 3 is getting announced before December 31, 2025, or an awful lot of folks are going to have egg on their faces come January 1, 2026. I'm personally hoping for the former, but the community has been hoodwinked before with Half-Life rumors, multiple times even. Keep injecting that Hopium, folks. Perhaps the return of G-man is right around the corner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.
