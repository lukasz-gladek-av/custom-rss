But according to the devs, they wanted to make a bigger, better game, and cutting multiplayer let them do that. </p><p>“There’s only the campaign, and we decided that from the beginning,” said Stratton. “We wanted to free ourselves to create experiences like the mech and the dragon. Those are both like their own mini-games in the game. We decided to put all our effort into creating the biggest and best campaign we’ve ever made.”</p><p>Martin added: “We didn’t do multiplayer so that we could make a better single-player game. Like, we couldn’t have done the mech and the dragon and all that other stuff if we spread the resources around different game pillars, so we’ve really just focused on single player.”</p><p>Martin and Stratton were also asked if <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is an open-world game. Id Software says it’s the biggest game they have ever made and features the largest levels seen in a <em>Doom </em>game, but the devs were clear that this isn’t an open-world game like <em>Skyrim </em>or <em>Assasssin’s Creed. </em></p><p>“It’s definitely not an open-world game, but it is the most expansive world we’ve ever built,” explained Stratton. </p><p>“You really feel like you’re on a battlefield. It goes from the typical linear <em>Doom</em> to these large sandboxes where the exploration opens up, and you get multiple objectives that can be tackled in any order. Exploration is also tied to power in that you can find and unlock several upgrades for your character.”</p><h2 id="h25165"><a id=""></a><em>Dark Ages</em> isn’t inspired by <em>Quake </em>and it’s not the end of a trilogy</h2><p>Martin also said that a big thing they learned from <em>Eternal </em>was that too many currencies and skill trees can complicate a game in ways that aren’t fun. So instead, this time around exploring will make you stronger via <em>The Dark Ages</em>’ simplified progression system. </p><p>Martin also denied that <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is inspired by <em>Quake</em>. Instead, <em>Batman</em> comics inspired the developers. “The inspiration was more something like <em>Batman: Year One</em> and <em>300</em>,” said Martin. </p><p>“I’m a pretty big comic book fan. But yeah, there were rumors that it was called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-3-eternal-sequel-dark-ages-year-zero-xbox-june-1851500253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-3-eternal-sequel-dark-ages-year-zero-xbox-june-1851500253"><em>Doom: Year Zero</em></a></span> and that was what we called it internally. I still think it was a really cool name, although <em>Dark Age</em>s is pretty cool, too.”</p><p>Finally, Martin was asked if <em>Dark Ages</em>, being the third game in a trilogy, is the end of this era of <em>Doom</em>. </p><p>“I don’t think I can answer that. We’re not supposed to talk about it. Anyway, I like making <em>Doom </em>games. I wouldn’t have a problem doing this for a long time. But this isn’t designed to be the end of something.”</p><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> arrives on May 15 on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, and Game Pass. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I wasn’t cool enough to play the original release of The Thing, but I am old enough to stay up late and play scary games in the dark now, which means The Thing Remastered, the restored cult classic, was on my to-play list immediately. On launch, it ran smoothly, with minor bugs and glitches to contend with, but that’s to be expected of a two-decade-old game, right? Well, Nightdive Studios continuously proves itself as a top-tier studio, and now they’ve pushed The Thing Remastered Patch 1.1 to resolve so many issues!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-thing-remastered-patch-1-1-notes">The Thing Remastered Patch 1.1 Notes</h2>



<p>As you can see from the massive list of patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958970/The_Thing_Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">originally posted to Steam</a>, Nightdive broke the mold and decided to address everything from achievement woes to game crashes to Steam Deck performance. That last change is definitely welcome, as it’s where I tend to play the survival horror the most.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at the entire list of patch notes:</p>



<p><strong>General</strong>:<br>– Fixed the Conspiracy Theorist achievement. Old saved games are retroactively fixed!<br>– Updated Colins Fate achievement description.<br>– Fixed a softlock where Stolls would stop running to the black tech lab door.<br>– Fixed a crash after detonating the C4 on the airstrip level.<br>– Fixed a rare intermittent crash when fighting Thing beasts.<br>– Added a “Most Recent” button to the load game menu, so it’s easier to load your latest save.<br>– Autosaves now contain the name of the level they were saved on, instead of just “Autosave”.<br>– Fixed a bug where characters would sometimes become unable to step up onto higher surfaces after falling off of the curbs in the roadway tunnel.<br>– Fixed a crash when quitting the game.<br>– Fixed a bug where bindings would be missing from the input options on first launch.<br>– Fixed a crash in Strata Medibay when Fisk dies before telling you the code.<br>– Fixed Blake’s hand clipping with his sleeve in the first cutscene with Faraday.<br>– Fixed a bug where the second camera angle would fail to activate during the weather station cutscene, allowing you to interrupt it and recruit yourself.<br>– Improved performance when querying dynamic game options.<br>– Moved the game version information to the options menu, off of the interstitial screen.<br>– Decreased the visibility of the game version information so it is less intrusive.<br>– Reimplemented the pan upwards when the game over screen is visible.<br>– Added support for autoexec.cfg, allowing users to customize console variables not usually marked as saved to kexEngine.cfg.</p>



<p><strong>Gameplay</strong>:<br>– Fixed an oversight where weapon firing rates were not properly respected when mashing the fire button. Excluding the pistol.<br>– Ammo and health dispensers now dispense fewer clips and medipacks depending on the difficulty. This can be changed at any time during game play.<br>– Marked some grenades as “volatile” so that they explode when damaged, like the original game, to fix a quirk where grenades placed for cinematic purposes would not explode.<br>– Changed the direction Blake faces after ending the cutscene in the weather station level.</p>

<p><strong>Levels</strong>:<br>– Fixed an oversight where an explosive barrel would explode when passing through the tripwire of an already exploded trip-mine charge in the penultimate level.<br>– Hid the out of bounds “Back Door Key” item that looked like a document in the submersible level.<br>– Fixed inaccurate collision in the first level, where characters would appear to sink into the snow.<br>– Fixed collision in the watchtower on the third level where you could get stuck in the handrail.<br>– Renamed Carter in the Strata Medibay level to Hawk, to utilize a set of unused voice lines.<br>– Added the missing green light to a save terminal in the third level.<br>– Fixed two computers in the weather station level that did not have an ID set for the Conspiracy Theorist achievement (given automatically to old saves).<br>– Shimmied a medipack dispenser down in the level following Strata Medibay that was WAY too high up.<br>– Fixed bad collision on the external stairs in the weather station.<br>– Flipped a few ammo boxes which were facing the wrong direction.<br>– Fixed several collision bugs in the Norwegian outpost where you could fall off of the world and walk underneath the building.<br>– Fixed sounds across several levels that would duplicate forever, causing the game to eventually fall silent.</p>



<p><strong>Display</strong>:<br>– Fixed the depth of field effect sometimes creating bright flickering pixels.<br>– Fixed the glass on the doors in the submersible being opaque.<br>– Improved normal maps on many posters and boards.<br>– Gave Whitley new trousers.<br>– Changed the on-screen watermark in the editor build, so it doesn’t confuse people.<br>– Performance improvements when using the D3D11 renderer.</p>



<p><strong>Sound</strong>:<br>– Fixed a bug where speech audio would sometimes not follow the speaker.</p>



<p><strong>Steam Deck</strong>:<br>– Fixed the framerate being locked to half the screen refresh rate while using the Vulkan renderer, when launched outside of the Steam client.</p>

<p>In place of <em>Doom Eternal</em>'s "jump and shoot" gameplay loop, <em>The Dark Ages</em> focuses on more of a "stand and fight" mentality, the developers said. If <em>Doom Eternal</em> was like flying a fighter jet, then <em>The Dark Ages</em> is more like controlling a tank, they added by way of analogy.</p>

<p>That means a "flatter" game space, where the old-fashioned "strafe-to-aim" strategies work more effectively than in recent <em>Doom</em> games, with less need to be constantly floating through the air. The developers say they're returning to the slower projectile speeds of the original <em>Doom</em> games, too, allowing players to more easily weave between them in a sort of first-person take on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up">shmup pattern</a>. At the same time, your own projectile weapons tend toward the medium to short range, the developers said, encouraging you to take the fight close to the enemies.</p>
<p>While staggering enemies to set up instant Glory Kills is still a core part of <em>The Dark Ages</em>, the developers said the system has been redesigned to avoid taking control away from the player for extended, repetitive canned animations. The new Glory Kill system allows for instant, physics-based attacks that can be activated from any angle without interrupting the gameplay flow.</p>
<h2>The more things change</h2>
<p><em>The Dark Ages</em> developers also promised a more open design, where the usual more linear corridors are interspersed with larger playspaces that let you decide which direction to go and which objective to pursue in what order. And the standard shooting action will be broken up into specific sections where you control a 30-story mech or fly a powerful dragon.</p>

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>But the core game will still include the requisite raft of secret areas and hidden nooks to discover, the developers promised. This time around, though, those secrets are more directly tied to your power progression rather than just being collectible in-game trinkets, the developers said.</p>
<p>It's all in service of pushing toward a game that feels "new but familiar," Martin said. <em>The Dark Ages</em> is still about the same sense of exploration and power that all good Doom games capture. But Martin said the development team is comfortable experimenting with what that specific sense of power is, "especially if the change you make brings it closer to classic <em>Doom</em>."</p>
<p>But "I want to play a Doom game," he added. "We don't [want to] change so much that it's not a Doom game.</p>
<p>Doom: The Dark Ages<em> is scheduled to hit Windows, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on May 15.</em></p>

And those skills were part of the rational behind giving Shadows' programmers a few extra weeks to get everything ready.</p><p>Game director Charles Benoit told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-director-says-recent-delay-was-to-polish-parkour-especially-on-super-complex-roofs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that the additional time was used to polish Shadows and balance the progression. However, he noted that the really difficult issue to deal with was the architecture of Feudal Japan, which wasn't intended to be used as parkour surfaces.</p>

<p>"The Japanese architecture, the roofs [are] super complex," said Benoit. "Probably the most complex thing that I ever worked with if we compared to Odyssey and Syndicate. We needed specific codes and specific animations to support something super fluid, changing the transition of the parkour to make it even more fluid. So that's one of the specific feedback that we heard that we wanted to address, and it really improved since the last few months."</p><p>GameSpot's Jordan Ramée recently had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-feels-like-the-series-trying-to-come-to-terms-with-its-warring-halves/1100-6528968/" data-ref-id="1100-6528968">an extended hands-on preview with Shadows</a>, and he noted that he was "regularly blown away by just how pretty this game is and the team's commitment to creating as accurate a historical fantasy as possible.... I only got to explore a snippet of Shadows' 1579 feudal Japan, but I could not stop staring at what I was able to see, even when I should have probably been paying attention to the approaching guards." Ramée added that he is "inclined to go into the full experience with hopeful expectations," despite not fully experiencing the other aspects of the game during his time with Shadows.</p><p>As part of the recent preview, Ubisoft shared more details about Shadows' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-specs-highlighted-features-and-more/1100-6528990/" data-ref-id="1100-6528990">new features on PC</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-animus-hub-wont-be-a-stand-alone-launcher-but-will-still-launch-games/1100-6528985/" data-ref-id="1100-6528985">the Animus Hub</a> that will debut with the game.

Furthermore, not all the Pink Chests will have them either. Some provide you with Diamonds and Bling, while others include a sketch as well.

Naturally, that also means they’re a hot commodity for merchants too. <strong>It’s worth checking out every shop and NPC merchant as many will be selling unique clothes.</strong> <br></p><p>This ranges from the shops open all the time to the ones that only appear during a specific time of day. From what I can tell, all clothing is limited stock and sold out once you’ve purchased them. This is a stark contrast to shops with crafting materials that will eventually restock over time.</p><h2 id="h23286"><a id="nodes"></a>Upgrade nodes in the Heart of Infinity</h2><figure id="" data-id="b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-recommend-id="image://b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Fully Charged Electrician Outfit sketch, as seen on the Heart of Infinity menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Fully Charged Electrician Outfit sketch, as seen on the Heart of Infinity menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-recommend-id="image://b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Fully Charged Electrician Outfit sketch, as seen on the Heart of Infinity menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Heart of Infinity fulfills the role of the game’s skill tree. You can spend Whimstars and Bling here to unlock ability enhancements and stat increases for Styling Challenges. <strong>More importantly, the Heart of Infinity also has exclusive sketches for Ability Outfits and individual clothing pieces to unlock.</strong></p><p>Fortunately, you won’t be able to miss ability outfits since they’re all made available during the main story quests. The other individual pieces are typically set in between the ability enhancement and stat increase upgrades, so I suggest checking back now and then to see how much more can be unlocked.</p><h2 id="h23287"><a id="surprise"></a>Pull at the Surprise-O-Matic (if you dare)</h2><figure id="" data-id="8af59d422d20a2008ac07713523ad538" data-recommend-id="image://8af59d422d20a2008ac07713523ad538" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Surprise-O-Matic drawing screen, showing the limited deal that’s offered for the first pull." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Surprise-O-Matic drawing screen, showing the limited deal that’s offered for the first pull." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8af59d422d20a2008ac07713523ad538" data-recommend-id="image://8af59d422d20a2008ac07713523ad538" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Surprise-O-Matic drawing screen, showing the limited deal that’s offered for the first pull." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After completing the prologue quest, you’ll travel to the town of Florawish.

Additionally, there is no pity system to help you attain the rarer pieces. You could easily spend millions of Bling here before you get a 5-star piece. So spend wisely.</p><h2 id="h23288"><a id="gacha"></a>Pull the gacha banners</h2><figure id="" data-id="e074b61b2108fcc8f81e1d5d0ab07afb" data-recommend-id="image://e074b61b2108fcc8f81e1d5d0ab07afb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Bubbling Affections resonance banner shows a fancy outfit and a couple of fishes with giant lips." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Bubbling Affections resonance banner shows a fancy outfit and a couple of fishes with giant lips." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e074b61b2108fcc8f81e1d5d0ab07afb" data-recommend-id="image://e074b61b2108fcc8f81e1d5d0ab07afb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Bubbling Affections resonance banner shows a fancy outfit and a couple of fishes with giant lips." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speaking of gacha, that’s arguably the most prolific method of getting more clothing. <strong><em>Infinity Nikki</em> runs a series of permanent and limited-time gacha banners that you can pull to get exclusive clothes from.</strong> Anything you get from the latter will feel the most special since you presumably won’t be able to get them again unless the banner returns.</p><p>The permanent and limited-time banners use specific currencies: Resonite Crystals and Revelation Crystals. They do have a pity system to guarantee you receive a certain rarity after a while, but it still operates mostly on chance. If you see a particular item you just have to get, I recommend grinding out for the appropriate crystals.</p><h2 id="h23289"><a id="store"></a>Use Stellarites at the in-game store</h2><figure id="" data-id="f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-recommend-id="image://f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Moonlight Oath outfit, as seen in the Clothing tab in the Store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Moonlight Oath outfit, as seen in the Clothing tab in the Store." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-recommend-id="image://f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Moonlight Oath outfit, as seen in the Clothing tab in the Store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll be able to exchange for <em>Infinity Nikki</em>’s various currencies through the in-game shop. This includes Diamonds, the aforementioned gacha-related crystals, and the premium currency known as Stellarite. <strong>This Store offers many things to buy with Stellarite, including exclusive outfits that can’t be unlocked elsewhere.</strong></p><p>Many of these outfits are offered on a limited-time basis. They also cost between 60 and 2980 Stellarite, which roughly translates to $1-$45. Make sure to have a calculator out to help with the awkward bundle amounts and first-time double bonuses.</p><hr><p><em>Infinity Nikki</em> has a ton of clothing items to discover and craft. We’re sure to get even more outfits and maybe even more ways to unlock them once some big updates have rolled out. Needless to say, you’ll always have plenty of choices to make the right fit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The system RAM is quite beefy, asking 32GB for recommended and ultra settings, while you can get away with just 16GB for the minimum. Id Software is pushing visual fidelity with ray-traced lights an shadows, as well as increased gore and destruction. All three sets of recommends specs call for the game to run at 60fps, so it's possible you might be able to get away with lower-end hardware if you can tolerate a lower frame rate.</p><h2>Doom: The Dark Ages PC specs</h2><h3>Minimum (1080p/60 FPS/Low Video Settings)</h3><ul><li>OS: Win10 64Bit / Win 11 64Bit</li><li>CPU: AMD Zen 2 or Intel 10th Generation @3.2Ghz with 8 cores / 16 threads or better (examples: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X or better, Intel Core i7 10700K or better)</li><li>GPU: NVIDIA or AMD hardware ray tracing-capable GPU with 8GB dedicated VRAM or better (examples: NVIDIA RTX 2060 Super or better, AMD RX 6600 or better)</li><li>System RAM: 16GB</li><li>Storage Capacity: 512GB or higher NVME SSD (100GB Available)</li></ul><h3>Recommended (1440p/60 FPS/High Video Settings)</h3><ul><li>OS: Win10 64Bit / Win 11 64Bit</li><li>CPU: AMD Zen 3 or Intel 12th Generation @3.2Ghz with 8 cores / 16 threads or better (examples: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X or better, Intel Core i7 12700K or better)</li><li>GPU: NVIDIA or AMD hardware ray tracing-capable GPU with 10GB dedicated VRAM or better (examples: NVIDIA RTX 3080 or better, AMD RX 6800 or better)</li><li>System RAM: 32GB</li><li>Storage Capacity: 512GB or higher NVME SSD (100GB Available)</li></ul><h3>Ultra 4K (2160p/60 FPS/Ultra Video Settings)</h3><ul><li>OS: Win10 64Bit / Win 11 64Bit</li><li>CPU: AMD Zen 3 or Intel 12th Generation @3.2Ghz with 8 cores / 16 threads or better (examples: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X or better, Intel Core i7 12700K or better)</li><li>GPU: NVIDIA or AMD hardware ray tracing-capable GPU with 16GB dedicated VRAM or better (examples: NVIDIA RTX 4080 or better, AMD RX 7900XT or better)</li><li>System RAM: 32GB</li><li>Storage Capacity: 512GB or higher NVME SSD (100GB Available)</li></ul><p>At the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-all-the-big-announcements/2900-6159/" data-ref-id="2900-6159">Xbox Developer Direct</a>, it was revealed that Doom: The Dark Ages launches on May 15 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350382/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-doom-ninja-gaiden-trailers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Though Nintendo can technically claim it had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">the first big gaming news event of the year</a>, at least <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24338314/microsoft-xbox-event-developer-direct-date-2025">Xbox’s Developer Direct</a> actually showed off some games <em>and</em> let us know when we can play them. The showcase was anchored by deep dives into the biggest games coming down the green pipe like <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and Compulsion Games’ <em>South of Midnight</em>, with a couple of surprises to fill out the nearly one-hour-long runtime. Here are the highlights from the show.</p><p><h3><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></h3></p><p>Xbox kicked off the Direct with the surprise reveal of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350352/ninja-gaiden-4-xbox"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></a>. The game is being codeveloped by Koei Tecmo’s Team Ninja and <em>Bayonetta </em>studio PlatinumGames. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>revives the series’ bloody, fast-paced combat and high-stakes (but often frustrating) platforming with a new face, the ninja Yakumo. Yakumo will use his unique fighting styles to defeat the Divine Dragon Order that’s turned Tokyo into a dystopian, crumbling mess. <em>Gaiden</em>’s former protagonist, Ryu Hayabusa, will also make an appearance as a playable character and Yakumo’s rival.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> will launch in the fall of this year, but if you don’t want to wait for your bloody ninja action, you don’t have to. Xbox stealth dropped <a href="https://youtu.be/MFjWCZIVZDw?si=Dw16HKjd1MRHKDhp"><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em></a>, a remake of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em>, and it’s available right now on Xbox and Game Pass.</p><p><h3><em>South of Midnight</em></h3></p><p>The developers at Compulsion Games went into detail about <em>South of Midnight</em>’s gameplay and story. You play as Hazel who must use her powers as a Weaver, fighting monsters and traversing the haunted landscape, to rescue her mother who gets swept away in a hurricane. With this, everything I’ve seen about <em>South of Midnight</em> makes it seem like it’ll be one of my games of the year. It’s got a Black protagonist, features characters and tropes that harken to Southern gothic folklore, and its stop-motion art style makes it immediately stand out. I cannot wait to get my hands on this game when it releases on April 8th.</p><p><h3><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h3></p><p>Sandfall Interactive was founded in Montpellier, France, in 2020 with a team led by former Ubisoft developers. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is the studio’s first game — a turn-based RPG with a compelling narrative hook. The world has been ravaged by a being known as the Paintress. Every year, she writes down a number, and everyone older than that number disappears. Expeditions are sent out to stop the Paintress, and the game will follow Expedition 33 in their attempt to save humanity. In addition to an interesting <em>Persona 5</em>-style take on turn-based combat, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271773/dream-rpg-voice-cast-rotation"><em>Expedition 33</em> features some serious voice acting talent</a>, starring Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, Ben Starr, and Andy Serkis. Can’t wait to hear them perform when <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> launches on April 24th.</p><p><h3><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></h3></p><p>To close out the Direct, Xbox gave us another look at <em>Doom: The Dark Ages,</em> the prequel to id Software’s 2016 <em>Doom</em> reboot and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a>. It will, of course, feature all the ripping and tearing a <em>Doom </em>enjoyer could want, along with an interesting focus on narrative — something the series isn’t really known for. But I suspect folks are far more interested in piloting a 30-story Doomguy-shaped mech suit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349379/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-xbox-pc-ps5">when the game releases on May 15th</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Team Ninja didn’t just rock up with one announcement, but two! In addition to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/ninja-gaiden-4-has-been-revealed-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-ps5-pc-in-fall-2025/">the reveal of Ninja Gaiden 4</a> at the Xbox Developer Direct showcase, they also announced and shadow-launched Ninja Gaiden 2 Black across consoles, PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>This is an Unreal Engine remaster of Ninja Gaiden 2, the 2008 Xbox 360 exclusive.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN 2 Black Official Launch Trailer | Developer_Direct 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MFjWCZIVZDw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Writing on the Xbox Wire blog, Fumihiko Yasuda, Head of Team Ninja explained the reason for this remake, “The biggest reason for developing NINJA GAIDEN 2 Black was to address the concerns of core fans who might be wondering, ‘What’s going to happen to Ryu Hayabusa?’ We also wanted to give players something to enjoy as they wait for the release of NINJA GAIDEN 4. We chose NINJA GAIDEN 2 because it stands as one of the most solid action games in the series. We added ‘Black’ to the title to signal to fans that this is the definitive version, much like NINJA GAIDEN Black was for the first game.”</p>
<p>We can unpick this a little, given the penchant for re-releasing and enhancing games. While Ninja Gaiden 2 was and remained an Xbox 360 exclusive, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 brought the game to PlayStation 3 in a heavily modified form with new bosses, but also with content removed from the game and enemy counts modified. It’s this game that was featured in Ninja Gaiden Master Collection in 2021. Fans requested the original Ninja Gaiden 2, and so this is Yasuda’s answer.</p>

<p>“This version is crafted to satisfy both those who played the original and newcomers discovering it as a current-generation action game,” he says. “We’ve meticulously incorporated some of the additions of <em>NINJA GAIDEN Sigma 2</em> while staying true to the challenge and feel of the original 360 version, including its signature gore and violence. We’ve also adjusted the weapon upgrade system to more align with the original release.”</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, of course, comes out alongside the announcement of Ninja Gaiden 4. This is the first mainline sequel in over a decade, bringing a new protagonist, and seeing Team Ninja join forces with PlatinumGames to deliver the next generation of this ultra-fast future ninja series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-the-biggest-and-best-game-weve-ever-made-says-id-story-is-out-of-the-codex/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Prior to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySygveWfuKE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Developer Direct 2025</a> that just aired, Bethesda invited Wccftech and other press outlets to check out the DOOM: The Dark Ages presentation included in the broadcast. We also participated in a roundtable Q&amp;A with Executive Producer Marty Stratton and Game Director Hugo Martin.</p>
<p>From the get-go, id Software sounded very confident about their new game, claiming that players would feel like a superweapon in a medieval war against Hellish forces. The prequel is set in a sci-fi/fantasy world, the most expansive they've created to date by far, filled with explorable locations, unlockable weapons, and conquerable foes.</p>
<p>Being a prequel to 2016's DOOM, the developers believe this will be the ideal entry point in the series for newcomers. This is also because of the increased focus on accessibility thanks to the newly added sliders that will let users ramp up or down the difficulty as they see fit. Modifiers shown include damage to the player, demons, enemy aggression and projectile speed, parry window, daze duration, game speed, and resource values.</p>
<p>Hugo Martin said that if 2020's DOOM Eternal felt like being in control of a fighter jet, DOOM: The Dark Ages will make you an iron tank. The objective has been to make a more grounded combat system. The Slayer is still fast, but he's also heavy and strong with his moves, favoring power over the previous game's acrobatics. There's also a bit of a return to form in that the tweaks to movement speed should make strafing to aim once again viable, like in the classic game.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many new cool tools, chiefly the Shield Saw, which can block, throw, parry, and deflect depending on the context. Some melee weapons were also added to compound that medieval feel, so players will have an iron flail, an electrified gauntlet, and a spiked mace to bash enemies with, and they even come with their own combos and upgrades. Needless to say, there's a ton of devastatingly powerful guns, too, since it is still DOOM after all.</p>
<p>Finishing off enemies promises to be even cooler this time around, thanks to a new Glory Kill system that is said to be fully in the player's control.&nbsp;DOOM: The Dark Ages doesn't stop at ground combat, either, as id is giving players two big toys to play with: a 30-story-tall Atlan mech and a mechadragon. Both are reportedly fleshed out, coming with their own abilities and mini-bosses to fight.</p>
<p>However great all that sounds, the developers acknowledged combat might not be enough to win over single-player fans in 2025. Thankfully, the game also features way more exploration than in previous titles, with large, diverse environments and unique rewards for those who will explore them in-depth. While not an open world, it will feature secret caves, dungeon-like mines and more, in what's been called the largest playspace ever in DOOM and a 'sandbox.'</p>
<p>Last but not least, DOOM: The Dark Ages takes the narrative out of the codex, in the developers' own words, and into the cutscenes. The goal is to deliver a Summer Blockbuster-like cinematic action story with a combination of new characters, returning allies, and powerful villains.</p>
<p>We also learned the release date, which is set for May 15 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. As with all games published by Bethesda since they were acquired by Microsoft, it will be available to Game Pass subscribers from day one. Pre-orders are open now.</p>
<p>Following the presentation, Martin and Stratton answered several questions. You can find the transcript below.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We wanted to do it from the beginning. This is very much a full realization of the Slayer's past, and we thank the fans for giving us the chance to do it.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>DOOM has always been about sci-fi. Why the switch to a medieval setting?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:</strong> We wanted to do it from the beginning. When you reboot a franchise, usually what you want to do is create an interesting world and give that world a history. Then, you want to have heroes with an interesting past, and if you're lucky enough and the fans are happy with what you did, you get to do more iterations of the IP, and you'll be fortunate enough to explore some of that past. That's what we've been able to do. This is very much a full realization of the Slayer's past, and we thank the fans for giving us the chance to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Can you dive into the difficulty sliders and why you decided to introduce them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marty Stratton:</strong> Sure. There were multiple reasons. The important thing is that you can go up or down to make the game easier or harder. There are a lot of options, and it also works to improve approachability. It allows long-time fans to ramp it up and create these ridiculous high-end experiences, but it also improves accessibility for others who may have motor difficulties, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Will DOOM: The Dark Ages feature any multiplayer modes?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marty Stratton: </strong>It will not. There's only the campaign, and we decided that from the beginning. We wanted to free ourselves to create experiences like the mech and the dragon. Those are both like their own mini-games in the game. We decided to put all our effort into creating the biggest and best campaign we've ever made.</p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>We didn't do multiplayer so that we could make a better single player game. Like, we couldn't have done the mech and the dragon and all that other stuff if we spread the resources around different game pillars, so we've really just focused on single player.</p>
<p><strong>How is the game a reaction to DOOM Eternal?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>It's a reaction to both (previous games). We are really lucky to be able to do the third entry. Any time you get to make a game three times, there's so many lessons that you've learned. I like to focus on the negatives from fans. With the 2016 game, we heard that it was too repetitive, and with Eternal, that it was too hard. I actually think it was too complex, and the complexity of the control scheme led to unnecessary difficulty. You want to be fighting the demons, not the controls. That doesn't mean it's going to be easy to master. Also, we can't just do the same thing again and again. In a trilogy, you want each game to have its own feel.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned the story being out of the codex in DOOM: The Dark Ages, but is there still a codex?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin: </strong>Yes, there is. It's just not a requirement anymore to read the codex to understand what's happening in the story.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the return of strafing to aim?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin: </strong>What you quickly realize when you play classic DOOM is that there's a lot of movement required to be successful and dodge these slow-moving projectiles. With those, you create a three-dimensional pattern that the player has to weave through on their way to the demons. We've balanced the weapons to be medium to short range so that you're encouraged to take the fight to the enemies, weave through that maze of projectiles as they're whizzing by just like in classic DOOM, and deliver that killing blow up close with the melee, shield, or gun.</p>

<p><strong>Can you explain how the new Glory Kill system works?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah. It's really fluid. That was one of the big pillars, fluidity, because we wanted you to feel like this weapon of mass destruction. With the synced system, player control was taken away, and it kind of broke the flow. It's fantastic, and it was not an issue in DOOM 2016 or Eternal because you're not really taking out three, four, five, or six enemies at a time. But in this game, you are, so it was really important that you could finish off an enemy, transitioning from melee/shield/gun to execution, and not feel like there is a break in the action where you're losing precious seconds.</p>
<p>By leaning on the physics part of our engine, the incredible animators and programmers team made it work. It feels fantastic. Also, because you can do it from any angle, it always looks different because it uses physics, and it helps address the issue of repetition, which was a challenge with the previous Glory Kill system as you started seeing the same animations again and again.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be an enemy like the Marauder to push the player to learn the gameplay loop?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, several. Those are the black belts on the battlefield and we certainly have them. They will test your skill, knowledge, and your ability with the parry system. They're enemies who throw combos of attacks, and you don't have to just parry one melee strike, you have to parry several in a row in order to falter them.</p>
<p><strong>Is this an open-world game, or does it just have open-world elements?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marty Stratton: </strong>It's definitely not an open world game, but it is the most expansive world we've ever built. You really feel like you're on a battlefield. It goes from the typical linear DOOM to these large sandboxes where the exploration opens up, and you get multiple objectives that can be tackled in any order. Exploration is also tied to power in that you can find and unlock several upgrades for your character.</p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>There's a much greater focus on progression items. We've really streamlined the economy and the currencies. I think that's another thing we learned from DOOM Eternal. If you have too many currencies and skill trees, you confuse the player. But speaking of the level design, we're very proud of it. It's some of the best work we've ever done.</p>
<p><strong>Was Quake 1 an inspiration for the setting?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin: </strong>Not really. The inspiration was more something like Batman: Year One and 300. I'm a pretty big comic book fan. But yeah, there were rumors that it was called DOOM: Year Zero and that was what we called it internally. I still think it was a really cool name, although Dark Ages is pretty cool, too.</p>
<p><strong>WCCFTECH: How much side content is there in DOOM: The Dark Ages, and how long do you expect a regular playthrough to be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>It's really long. It's the biggest game we made. Although, to be honest, you don't want any single level to overstay its welcome. But overall, it is massive. And if you're a completionist and want to unlock all secrets, it'll last even longer.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game get DLC?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marty Stratton:&nbsp;</strong>It will, yes. As part of the Deluxe Edition, you will get access to the DLC.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I'm most excited about the shield. It's a critical part of the loop, as you saw in the presentation. It does so many things, like blocking, throwing, parrying, and deflecting. I think it's really, really cool, and it looks awesome.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What are you most excited for people to experience in DOOM: The Dark Ages?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marty Stratton:&nbsp;</strong>I think how much it's DOOM but different. We've literally been in it for eleven years. We release a game, we start working on the DLC, and then the next game. We never get that gap in time where you stop and think about it. There are a lot of people who may play the game and then move on to other games or consume other media. I'm excited for people to come back for this and for new people to experience it and just see how epic and expansive it is and get their hands on this gameplay loop because it's so DOOM, but it's different.</p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>For me, it's the shield. It's a critical part of the loop, as you saw in the presentation. It does so many things. I think it's really, really cool, and it looks awesome.</p>
<p><strong>With DOOM: The Dark Ages being the third game you've worked on, are you considering it the conclusion of a trilogy or more its own thing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>I don't think I can answer that. We're not supposed to talk about it. Anyway, I like making DOOM games. I wouldn't have a problem doing this for a long time. But this isn't designed to be the end of something.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marty-stratton-dark-ages-like-nothing-players-have-had-their-hands-on-in-doom-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You thought <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-eternal" rel="nofollow">Doom Eternal</a> </em>was badass? You ain't seen nothin' yet. What <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/id-software" rel="nofollow">id Software</a> has in store for players with <em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>is going to redefine the meaning of rip and tear, with more visceral action than ever before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So then, it's no secret this is one of 2025's most anticipated games, and we even got an early look at some gameplay for what Executive Producer Marty Stratton calls the biggest <em>Doom </em>game "by a lot."</p>

<p>After watching a deep dive into the game's mechanics, TechRaptor and other press attended a roundtable Q&amp;A session with Stratton along with Game Director Hugo Martin. We learned more about how <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is hearkening back to the roots of the franchise, as well as what players can expect in terms of weapons, difficulty, and more.</p>



<h2><em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>Is&nbsp;a Grand Adventure</h2>

<p>I don't like drawing comparisons to other games unless it's warranted, but the gameplay of <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> reminded me most of, well, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/doom-review-dynamite" rel="nofollow"><em>Doom (2016)</em></a> and <em>Eternal,</em> of course, but surprisingly, I saw a bit of <em>God of War </em>DNA in there as well.</p>

<p>By <em>God of War</em>, I'm talking about the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/god-of-war-2018" rel="nofollow">2018</a>&nbsp;entry and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-colossal-triumph-for-playstation" rel="nofollow"><em>Ragnarok</em></a>. <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is explicitly said to <em>not</em> be open world, but it does have large, open areas players can explore. Within these areas are "multiple objectives you can complete in any order," said Stratton.</p>

<p>"It is our most expansive worlds that we've ever built," said Stratton. "Kind of goes from, you know, typical, what I would say is normal, linear <em>Doom</em>, to these larger sandboxes we call them, where just, you know, the exploration really kind of opens up."</p>



<p>So basically, while you're ripping and tearing through demons, you can find secrets like collectibles, but also progression items. And progression seems to be the focus here, when it comes to exploration -- that is the main incentive for scoping out these vast open spaces while working your way to the next objective.</p>

<p>"There's secrets everywhere," said Martin, "and as Marty said, the secrets are really tied to the player's progression. So there's a great motivation there."</p>

<p>One aspect the <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> gameplay showcase wanted to emphasize is, in <em>Doom (2016) </em>players were asked to "run and gun," in <em>Eternal</em> to "jump and shoot." This time around, we're asked to "stand and fight."</p>



<p>This "stand and fight philosophy" manifests itself in multiple ways. Enemy projectiles behave more like that of older <em>Doom</em> games from the '90s, meaning you'll be moving around while shooting and slashing away. While there's less verticality in <em>The Dark Ages</em> than there is in&nbsp;<em>Eternal</em>, Martin says the aim is to have each game feel a bit different.</p>

<p>"The board, I would say, is flatter," said Martin, "to create more space for that strafe-to-aim combat loop that we see in classic <em>Doom.</em></p>

<p>"We've balanced the the range of the weapons to be medium-to-short range," Martin added, "so that way, you're encouraged to take the fight to the enemies, move through that maze of projectiles just like in classic <em>Doom </em>as they're whizzing by, and delivering that killing blow with melee, shield, and guns."</p>



<h2>Rip and Tear? No, Hack and Slash!</h2>

<p>That brings us to combat, which is the cream of the crop when it comes to <em>Doom </em>games. We know they're taking a heavier emphasis on standing your ground and really leveraging the Doom Slayer's agile nature to skirt around projectiles and move in to deliver the finishing blow.</p>

<p>To do so, you're armed with an arsenal of new weapons like the Skull Crusher -- a lethal gun that shreds skulls and spits out fragments as projectiles -- but there are also three separate melee weapons, as well as an improved and more fluid Glory Kill system.</p>

<p>Martin compares combat to that one shot from the film <em>300</em>, and this comparison was a driving force behind how the team wanted combat to feel in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>:</p>



<p>"It's a panning shot they're tracking with, Leonidas, as he takes out of, you know, breaks from the phalanx and takes out a bunch of guys... first with a spear, then with a Spartan sword and shield, and the time dilates in and out. And that's, when you see the extended gameplay footage inside of dev direct, I mean, that was a big focus for us."</p>

<p>Melee weapons include your trusty ol' gauntlet, as well as a ball-and-chain-like weapon. Combine that with the shield saw, which you can throw to tear up enemies and even use as a makeshift grapple point, and let's just say the gameplay looks as exciting as ever.</p>

<p>Of course, Glory Kills are iconic to <em>Doom</em>, and we'll be seeing great improvements to this system in <em>The Dark Ages</em>. Glory Kills were already lauded as a fantastic mechanic in the previous titles, but id Software wanted to take it a step further and introduce even more fluidity to this system, so combat goes uninterrupted.</p>



<p>"There's no control taken away so you could stagger -- and this happens a lot, it was in the dev direct -- where there's like 4, 5, 6 enemies that are highlighted, ready to be taken out, and you could just take them out in one run," said Martin.</p>

<p>"When you play it, that fluidity, it plays into everything you're doing," added Stratton, "whether it's your weapons or the way you shield bash. We haven't even talked about it, like, you see it in there, but the shield has a capability to move you very fast through the world, where you kind of lock onto an enemy, and then you lock on with the left trigger, and then you hit the right trigger, and it pulls you through the world long distances... and you smash into the character."</p>



<h2>A Positive Note on Challenge and Accessibility in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></h2>

<p>Just a hunch, and I could be wrong, but one aspect players might overlook is the way <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> handles difficulty. You have your standard, pre-made difficulty modes, but then there are also sliders allowing players to adjust multiple facets of the gameplay.</p>

<p>These sliders include, but are not limited to: Damage to player; Damage to demons; Enemy projectile speed; Parry window timing; overall game speed and more. This acts as both a wonderful accessibility feature, but also a way to amp the challenge up to ridiculous heights.</p>

<p>"And then even on the accessibility front," said Stratton, "it really does make the game more accessible for somebody who maybe has motor difficulties, you know, wants to dial in the experience just for them. We've actually done a good bit of testing from that front and really gotten great response from from the accessibility side of things too."</p>



<h2>Quick and Noteworthy Info for <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></h2>

<p>There's so much more we could touch on, but the points that stood out to me most were ones I wanted to highlight above. Though, I do want to mention a few additional notes that may be important for players to know.</p>

<p>One, multiplayer is not in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. This was in order to focus all resources on the ambitious campaign id Software made for<em> </em>this game. Second, there are full-on large areas where you can take control of the dragon and mech. They made sure to emphasize these are not one-time gimmicks, but will be present throughout the campaign. Lastly, the OST is composed by Finishing Move, a renowned team of four known for working on video game soundtracks.</p>

<p>The rest, well, we'll have to see. It won't be long until <em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>launches, and I am unreasonably excited. Bridging the gap between old-school and modern FPS gameplay is a recipe for success, and I believe <em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>will achieve just that when it launches on May 15, 2025.</p>

            <p>We called <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amplitude">Amplitude</a>'s fiendish and fanciful strategy game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a> the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-4x-games-2014-endless-legend">best 4X of 2014</a>, and its hexcellence hasn't dimmed with age. "The music, the amazing variety in terrain and units, the sheer quantity of words bringing to life every last quest, minor faction, creature, and environmental anomaly," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-goty-revisited-2014s-endless-legend-is-still-one-of-the-most-vibrant-important-4x-games">breathed</a> a reverential Ollie in 2023. "It's a simply splendid game."

<p>Why in Meier's name would Sega choose to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sell-off-studio-behind-endless-legend-and-humankind-as-part-of-restructuring-but-it-goes-to-the-original-owners">sell off the studio behind such a worldly wonder</a>? The answer is lost in time (it's through that link, there), but fortunately, Amplitude endure as an independent - and they've just announced Endless Legend 2 with no less than Hooded Horse as publisher.

<p>This one's all about the perils of water. Ah, water. The old oxo-hydro cocktail. True blue. Pre-caffeinated coffee. I've never really trusted the stuff, and only ever drink it in moderation. The game takes place on Saiadha, an ocean world that appears to intensify the first game's season mechanic, whereby you'd have to deal with inclement weather and cuts to movement and production during winter. Now, you've got to worry about changing ocean levels. Do I detect a climate change fable? Possibly, but it's buried under several layers of fantasy world-building.</p><p>"As the water goes down, the environment itself becomes both an obstacle and a chance for discovery," explains the press release. "Players will have to adapt to these constant shifts, confront ancient threats, and uncover the secrets buried deep within Saiadha. Each cataclysm brings new dangers, but also unique opportunities."</p>
<p>All-new "tidefalls" aside, the game appears familiar. This is a highly asymmetrical hex-based 4X buttressed by generous faction writing and diverse architecture design, with upgradeable heroes who sometimes make the whole thing feel like a turn-based RPG.</p>

<p>"Players need to lead their hero on epic journeys to conquer new territories, earn valuable experience, and build deep relationships with allies and rivals alike," the release goes on. "Select from a variety of factions, each with their own distinct philosophies, strengths, and playstyles, offering a unique gameplay experience. The diversity of these factions is reflected in their asymmetric gameplay, ensuring that no two paths are the same."</p><p>Endless Legend 2 will release pretty soon - it launches into PC early access in early 2025, with four factions arriving initially and two more coming in the full release. That's two less than the original Endless Legend had when it left early access, but I shan't gripe as long as the second game's factions are approximately 1.34 times as intriguing. Going by the trailer, there are a few returning faces.</p>
<p>If you'd rather play it sooner, Amplitude are reopening their Insiders Program on 30th January to let a select group of players test the thing. You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3407390/ENDLESS_Legend_2/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s January, and that means Xbox held another one of its annual Developer Direct showcases to talk about some games coming to Xbox Series X/S and Windows. We knew a few games that would be featured, including <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>South of Midnight</em>, but Microsoft had also teased a surprise announcement from a mystery studio, and the presentation started by reminding viewers that each game shown will be available on Game Pass at launch. If you want to watch the show yourself you can do so below, but for those who just want the bullet points, read on.</p></div></div><div><p>Kicking off the show was the surprise game: <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>. Team Ninja and <em>Bayonetta </em>developer PlatinumGames are working on a new <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>game in the style of the series’ 3D reboot trilogy that ran from 2004 to 2012. It  will feature two playable characters in returning protagonist Ryu Hayabusa and a new character named Yakumo who is following in Ryu’s footsteps to become a master ninja. Platinum seems like a perfect choice for reviving the series, which is known for stylish, fast-paced combat and its punishing difficulty. It will launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this fall.</p></div><div><p>After the <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>showcase, Team Ninja also announced it’s bringing a revamped version of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em> to modern platforms today in the form of <em>Ninja Gaiden II Black</em>. It’s available on PC and Xbox Game Pass, so if you’re a subscriber you can grab it as part of your membership.</p></div><div><p>Next up was Compulsion Games showing off its dark fantasy adventure <em>South of Midnight</em>. The studio showed a bit of protagonist Hazel’s nature-based magic and how she utilizes it when fighting monsters that are inspired by Southern folklore and the game’s “Southern gothic” aesthetic. It’s giving PS2-era action game and I’m here for it. <em>South of Midnight </em>is coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S on April 8.</p></div><div><p>To give us a quick break between all the action-oriented games, Sandfall Interactive showed off <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. As the name implies, the turn-based RPG follows an expedition of people in a French-based fantasy world that is ruled over by a malevolent goddess who is able to kill people over a certain age. <em>Expedition 33 </em>marries real-time and turn-based combat, though it seems this will be highly customizable and those who prefer to keep the real-time elements to a minimum can do so. The game will launch on April 24 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div><div><p>Closing out the show was an extended look at <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. The game is a prequel to the 2016 <em>Doom</em> and takes place in a hellscape that feels both futuristic and Middle Ages, a fusion that’s also reflected in the game’s  medieval-style weapons and mayhem. The shield saw, which basically functions like a Captain America shield with a buzzsaw attachment, was the star of the show, and you can use it to deflect attacks or throw it at enemies and watch it slice into them as you close in with your shotgun. Developer id Software also showed off giant mech and dragon combat, and I have to hand it to the <em>Doom </em>series, it knows how to capture “middle-school binder” excess and make it work. The game will launch on PC, Playstation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on May 15.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Thankfully, he has a dragon mount and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-dark-ages-sawshield-mod-original-1851533660?_gl=1*1qxrssg*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY0ODc5NC4xNDguMS4xNzM3NjU3NTA5LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-dark-ages-sawshield-mod-original-1851533660?_gl=1*1qxrssg*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY0ODc5NC4xNDguMS4xNzM3NjU3NTA5LjYwLjAuMA..">shield saw</a></span> to help even the odds. And this time around, Id Software wants you to feel like a big, heavy tank instead of a high-flying jet fighter. The studio really wants players to “stand and fight” in this entry. To help really sell the fantasy of being an unstoppable warrior, <em>Dark Ages f</em>eatures three melee weapons with upgrades and finishers. Oh but don’t worry, there are plenty of wild medieval-themed firearms, too. And yes, you get a fully drivable mech, something teased in past games.</p><p>It ain’t all killing and blasting, though, as Id Software promises a lot of exploration and secrets to find. Large open levels, described by Id as “<em>Doom </em>sandboxes,” will include platforms and puzzles, and if you complete these challenges you’ll unlock upgrades to make the Doom Slayer a stronger murder machine. (Okay, I guess it does all come back to killing.) </p><p><em>Dark Ages</em> also features a bunch of difficulty sliders that will let you change how fast and hard the game is, making it easy for everyone to hop in and kill demons. </p><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> arrives on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Game Pass on May 15. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For more, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-2025-everything-announced">everything announced during Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb on Ninja Gaiden 2 Black:</p><blockquote>In Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, players assume the role of Ryu Hayabusa, a deadly ninja who wields the legendary Dragon Sword while embarking on a global battle against a series of formidable foes. The beautiful and bloody remaster utilizes Unreal Engine 5 to significantly enhance the graphic expression, elevating everything from character visuals to environmental backgrounds. In fact, the stages, characters, effects, and lighting have all been completely redesigned and remastered to fully immerse gamers into the story’s dark ninja world.</blockquote><blockquote>Gore elements such as dismemberment and blood have also been remastered to enhance the action experience. The high-speed, violent fights play out in brilliant brutality, utilizing a variety of weapons and techniques including Japanese swords, shurikens, Kusari-gamas, and tonfas. Meanwhile, those looking for a more toned-down experience can simply toggle the dismemberment feature on and off in the Options menu.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black includes extra elements from the spin-off titles released after the original game’s debut, including the ability to control three additional characters: Momiji, Ayane, and Rachel. The remaster also includes “HERO PLAY STYLE”, a mode for beginners that provides automatic support in the most difficult situations, making the notoriously challenging title more accessible for those who may not be so confident in their action skills.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/ninja-gaiden-4-developer-direct-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, Team Ninja boss Fumihiko Yasuda explained the decision to remaster Ninja Gaiden 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This simultaneous announcement and same-day release alongside Ninja Gaiden 4 might have caught some people by surprise,” he said. “The biggest reason for developing Ninja Gaiden 2 Black was to address the concerns of core fans who might be wondering, ‘What’s going to happen to Ryu Hayabusa?’ We also wanted to give players something to enjoy as they wait for the release of Ninja Gaiden 4. We chose Ninja Gaiden 2 because it stands as one of the most solid action games in the series. We added ‘Black’ to the title to signal to fans that this is the definitive version, much like Ninja Gaiden Black was for the first game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yasuda continued: "This version is crafted to satisfy both those who played the original and newcomers discovering it as a current-generation action game. We’ve meticulously incorporated some of the additions of Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 while staying true to the challenge and feel of the original 360 version, including its signature gore and violence. We’ve also adjusted the weapon upgrade system to more align with the original release.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Ninja’s infamously challenging Ninja Gaiden series has a long association with Xbox. The developer’s reboot of the action series launched first on Xbox in 2004, propelling master ninja Ryu Hayabusa into the mainstream. Ninja Gaiden Black, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-ninja-gaiden-black-is-the-best-pure-action-game-of-all-time">considered one of the greatest action games of all time</a>, launched the following year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 2 came out in 2008 published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360. Ninja Gaiden 3 followed in 2012 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Since then, fans have had the critically panned spin-off Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, and, more recently, Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection, a compilation of Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher Koei Tecmo revived interest in Ninja Gaiden with the announcement of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-ragebound">Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</a>, a brand-new side-scrolling spin-off due out later this year. But the main event is Ninja Gaiden 4, which finally continues Ryu Hayabusa’s story 13 years after Ninja Gaiden 3 came out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
