            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/details-on-a-new-horizon-mmorpg-have-leaked-online.1352029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An MMORPG based on PlayStation and Guerrilla Games’ Horizon series has been leaked before its official reveal. We now know several details surrounding the game, now called Horizon Steel Frontiers.</p>







<p>While a newer IP, the Horizon series, consisting of 2017’s Zero Dawn and 2022’s Forbidden West, has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-franchise-32m-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-received by critics</a>. The third-person post-apocalyptic shooter is known for its gorgeous graphics and intuitive open-world gameplay. With hulking mechanical monsters and a lush environment, Horizon’s iconic settings make for the perfect setup for games outside of the main series. We did see LEGO Horizon Adventures and a VR spinoff, but it’s stayed in its lane for a bit. However, rumors of an MMORPG had surfaced over the past years, but it was thought to be cancelled. However, according to new information, it seems it’s here and, most likely, will be revealed quite soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-minute-video-of-mmorpg-horizon-steel-frontiers-coming-soon-according-to-leak">10-Minute Video of MMORPG Horizon Steel Frontiers Coming Soon, According to Leak</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Leaked key art from Horizon Steel Frontiers </figcaption></figure>



<p>The leak in question comes from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819657/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-sony-ncsoft-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, which supposedly saw a 10-minute video of the Horizon MMORPG, called Horizon Steel Frontiers. It even included key art, which we have above. Supposedly, the game is set to be revealed at the G-STAR 2025 event, but information came out early. </p>



<p>In the article, it mentions that the game is a collaboration between PlayStation and Korean developer NCSoft. The video, planned to be shown there, showcases gameplay, both complete and in development. As it is an MMORPG, instead of playing as Aloy, you’ll create your own character and join others in the world, called the Deathlands. It also says that the title will release on PC, iOS, and Android. No mention of a release date or if it will go to PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As the game is not yet confirmed, take the news with a grain of salt for now. However, given the content leaked, it’s safe to say it’s only a matter of time before it’s announced. Either way, it will be interesting to see how Horizon fits into the MMORPG genre and the differences between it and the main series.</p>







<p>What do you think of Horizon Steel Frontiers? Does Horizon need an MMORPG? Excited to see gameplay? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

                <p>Valve has unveiled its first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">its new gaming machines</a>, including Steam Frame, a virtual reality headset that can handle VR and non-VR games. Apparently, Steam Frame is also being used as a way to bring Android games directly to Steam users.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/818672/valve-android-apps-steam-frame" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Valve will support and encourage developers to bring Android apps to Steam. As part of this initiative, Valve will release a Steam Frame developer kit for developers who already use Android APKs for apps and VR headsets on Android phones.</p><p>"From the user's perspective, our preference is that they don't even have to think about it," explains Valve engineer Jeremy Selan. "They just have their titles on Steam, they download them and hit play ... They're really VR developers who want to publish their VR content, and they're porting a mobile VR title where they're already familiar with how to make those APKs. They are now free to bring those to Steam, and they'll just work on this device."</p><p>This seamless transition from Android to Steam is possible because Steam Frame uses an Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, which can run the apps directly. That will allow the Android games and VR apps to be easily accessed on Steam Frame.</p><p>In addition to Steam Frame, Valve announced a Steam Machine that can bring PC games to living rooms like a console, as well as a new Steam Controller. Valve <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">hasn't disclosed pricing for any of its new Steam hardware</a> yet, but hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Steam Machine will likely be competitively priced to be an affordable alternative to consoles.</p><p>"If you're trying to make a PC that has similar features and similar performance, I think the Steam Machine is going to be a really competitive price to that and provide really good value to it," said Aldehayyat.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/galaxy-buds-3-pro-with-ai-features-are-going-for-pennies-amazon-sets-a-new-all-time-low.1351990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium wireless earbuds have become one of those purchases where the options feel endless and the prices keep climbing higher. You’ve got Apple’s AirPods Pro at $249, Google’s Pixel Buds Pro at similar pricing, and Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro normally sitting at the same $249 mark. The specs all start to blur together after a while, and trying to figure out which pair actually delivers the best value can feel overwhelming. Price becomes a major factor when everything seems comparable on paper, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">right now Amazon has dropped the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to just $174, down from their usual $249</a>. This is a new all-time low that you won’t even find on Samsung’s official website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro <strong>pack AI-powered features</strong> that are constantly adapting to your environment throughout the day. Samsung’s sound optimization technology analyses the shape of your ear canal to adjust audio output for balanced sound that matches your unique anatomy. This happens automatically in the background, so you’re not always tweaking equalizer settings and wondering if you’re missing out on certain frequencies. The <strong>AI continuously monitors ambient noise levels and adjusts the intensity of active noise cancellation</strong> to match and ramps up when you step onto a busy street and dialing back when you’re in quieter spaces.</p>



<h2>Adaptive Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro works through a <strong>combination of external and internal microphones</strong> that capture ambient sound and generate inverse sound waves to cancel unwanted noise. The technology proves especially effective at eliminating low-frequency rumble from airplane engines, subway cars, or air conditioning units. You’ll notice the difference immediately on your commute as traffic noise fades into the background and you can finally hear podcast dialogue clearly without cranking the volume to dangerous levels.<strong> Transparency mode</strong> flips this system around and pips in external sounds when you need to hear announcements, have quick conversations, or stay aware of your surroundings while walking.</p>



<p>Samsung redesigned the fit for the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to address one of the most common complaints in its predecessors: This <strong>new ergonomic contour sits more securely in your ear</strong> without creating pressure points that cause discomfort after an hour or two of wear. You get three different ear tip sizes in the box, and the companion app includes a fit test that plays audio to verify you’ve created a proper seal. Getting this seal right is enormously important for both sound quality and noise cancellation effectiveness, since even small gaps let sound leak in and bass frequencies escape.</p>
<p>The <strong>Bluetooth connectivity</strong> maintains stable connections for the typical range you’d expect from modern wireless earbuds, staying paired reliably when your phone is in your pocket or bag. Pairing happens quickly through Samsung’s ecosystem if you own a Galaxy phone, as the earbuds pop up automatically on screen when you open the case near your device. Android users outside the Samsung ecosystem and <strong>even iPhone owners can still pair these earbuds</strong> through standard Bluetooth settings, though they’ll miss out on some of the deeper integration features that Galaxy phone users enjoy.</p>
<p>Battery life gives you about six hours of continuous playback with active noise cancellation enabled, which will cover most daily use scenarios, like commutes, work sessions, or gym visits. With the charging case included, y<strong>ou get about 26 hours of total listening time</strong> before you’ll need to find an outlet; it also supports USB-C wired charging and wireless charging via Qi-compatible pads. With just a five-minute charge, you can attain about an hour of playback in case you are in a hurry and forget that your earbuds are dead.</p>
<p>This is one of the best deals on Samsung’s earbuds so far in 2025.</p>

Thoughtful work, <em>human </em>work.</p><p>The art is available as both <a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a print and a premium unisex t-shirt</u></a> (available in 'natural’ and 'black' colourways). I've got the print framed in my living room and it looks <em>amazing, </em>and all proceeds are split between all humans involved.</p><p>You can buy both (and all our other merch, from hoodies to mugs to<a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/en-aud/products/new-combined-listing-offer?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>our 'Destroy AI' tee</u></a>)<a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>at the Aftermath store</u></a>.</p><p>(Also: <a href="https://aftermath.site/#/portal/account/plans" rel="noreferrer">subscribers to our Member and Benefactor tiers</a> get a discount at our merch store.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Finding a laptop that can handle everything from pro-level video editing to more casual gaming means spending upwards of $3,000, and that’s something most people simply can’t justify. Everyone wants a powerful machine that doesn’t chug when the work starts to get serious but the budgetary reality most are faced with compromises. Until now. This early Black Friday deal on Amazon completely upends that equation by dropping <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/">the Dell Inspiron 16″ laptop (1TB SSD, 32GB DDR5 RAM, etc) from its usual $3,299 price all the way down to just $995</a>. That’s a <strong>huge 70% discount on a true performance powerhouse</strong>, and the deal isn’t even available on Dell’s own website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The Intel Core 7 150U processor powers this machine with the kind of processing muscle you would expect from significantly more expensive laptops. This chip has speeds up to 5.4 GHz and boasts a hybrid architecture, with <strong>10 cores split between 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores, all working across 12 threads</strong>. You get three separate engines inside: CPU tasks, GPU graphics, and NPU AI acceleration. In other words, it handles everything from complex spreadsheets to AI-powered applications with ease.</p>



<h2>Ideal for Daily Tasks</h2>
<p>The 32GB of DDR5 RAM changes the way you work as slowdowns that plague machines with less memory are gone. You can keep dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple Adobe Creative Suite apps at once, have multiple Excel workbooks processing data, and still switch between everything instantly. Compared to DDR4 found in older laptops, DDR5 provides faster data transfer rates which means your processor spends less time waiting for information and more actually processing your work.</p>



<p>The touchscreen features a 16-inch WQXGA display with 1920 x 1200 resolution and offers more vertical real estate compared to the usual 1080p panel. That extra height makes a difference when you code, read long documents or deal with a spreadsheet that requires a few more rows visible at once. The 300-nit brightness is sufficient for you to comfortably work in well-lit offices or near windows while the anti-glare coating prevents reflections from turning your screen into a mirror.</p>
<p>The Thunderbolt 4 port delivers transfer speeds up to 40 Gbps and means you can transfer whole project folders to external drives in seconds, rather than minutes. This same port supports dual 4K displays or a single 8K monitor, turning your laptop into a multiscreen workstation when you’re at your desk. Combined with traditional USB 3.2 ports for peripherals, HDMI for presentations, and WiFi 6E for lightning-fast wireless connections, this laptop connects to everything you need without requiring a drawer full of adapters.</p>
<p>This is one of the best laptop deals you can get right now, and it’s exclusively available at Amazon.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/runescape-3/" data-ref-id="5000-174981">RuneScape's</a> Treasure Hunter microtransactions will soon be no more, after the game's community overwhelmingly voted to see it and other similar microtransactions removed. Developer Jagex is calling it a "new era" for the MMORPG.</p><p dir="ltr">In a video announcing the decision, Jagex CEO Jon Bellamy (known to the community as Mod North) said "the community has spoken," and as such, Treasure Hunter will be removed on January 19, 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">The feature sees players granted keys each day that can be used to open what are effectively loot boxes containing XP, gold, and more. While players are granted a number of keys for free each day, keys can also be bought for real money. More than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/runescapes-future-may-be-radically-reshaped-after-fan-vote/1100-6535811/" data-ref-id="1100-6535811">120,000 players voted</a> to see Treasure Hunter and other microtransactions removed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCjHVGbFwr4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JCjHVGbFwr4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That is, however, just the start of Jagex's plans. Bellamy said on the same day Treasure Hunter is removed, Jagex will also significantly reduce the amount of "gameplay-impacting MTX across the board." That includes the ability to purchase items that grant direct XP, as well as other items like Proteans, Dummies, and more, North said.</p><p dir="ltr">"January 19 is the start of a new era for RuneScape, powered by a shared desire to see this game grow for decades to come," North said.</p><p dir="ltr">Next year, Jagex will release an "integrity roadmap" that will address core issues surrounding the game, including the user interface and user experience, the game's visual identity, and more. Additional details will be shared on January 19.</p><p dir="ltr">Removing Treasure Hunter has been a long time coming. In June, Bellamy noted in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWbIXekZocI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> that its approach to microtransactions was "harming RuneScape" and stated "it's time that we took action. Jagex then experimented with a number of different changes to in-game purchases. In September, Bellamy said in an <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/jagex-prepared-to-take-financial" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a> that Jagex "probably won't maintain the revenue that we currently are" when making changes to microtransactions.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's the truth," Bellamy said. "But equally, if we're taking a 10 or 15 or 25-year view, some short-term pain is probably worth the restoration of the game if we can get to that point."</p><p dir="ltr">Jagex's adherence to a community vote for the removal of Treasure Hunter is similar to how it handles the much less microtransaction-heavy Old School RuneScape. Released in 2013 and based on the 2007 version of RuneScape, Old School Runescape is now far more popular than the more modern RuneScape (aka RuneScape 3). New features are only added to Old School RuneScape if 70% of its community votes for them.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/old-school-runescape-is-more-popular-than-ever-breaks-concurrent-player-record/1100-6533697/" data-ref-id="1100-6533697">Old School RuneScape is more popular than ever before</a>, and even broke player number records earlier this year with more than 241,000 concurrent players. The MMO's first new skill as voted on by the community, <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/sailing-launches-on-november-19th?oldschool=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sailing</a>, is set to release November 19.</p>

            <p>
Undoubtedly the only thing anyone in the PC world will be talking about for the next week is Valve's trio of hardware announcements, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machine</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-frame-is-real-and-valve-want-it-to-be-the-last-vr-headset-youll-ever-buy">Steam Frame</a>, and their new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-new-steam-controller-aims-to-entice-a-broader-field-of-pc-players-which-i-fear-already-includes-me">Steam Controller</a>. But don't forget about the old Steam Deck just yet! While Valve didn't announce anything handheld related today, they have commented on where they're at when it comes to anything like a Steam Deck 2.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-says-it-has-a-pretty-good-idea-of-what-steam-deck-2-is-going-to-be-explains-why-its-holding-off-for-now">IGN</a>, Valve software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais shared that there are plans for an upgraded version of the Steam Deck somewhere along the line, it's just that the technology just isn't there yet. "Obviously the Steam Deck's not our focus today, but the same things we've said in the past where we're really interested to work on what's next for Steam Deck… the thing we're making sure of is that it's a worthwhile enough performance upgrade to make sense as a standalone product," Griffais  said.
</p>
<p>
He noted how Valve isn't interested in marginal improvements of performance at the same battery life, and that they "want something a little bit more demarcated than that… and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be, but right now there's no offerings in that landscape, in the SoC [System on a Chip] landscape, that we think would truly be a next-gen performance Steam Deck."
</p>
<p>
Not that we should be encouraging hours upon hours of playing games, but battery life is one thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">even the Steam Deck OLED struggles with</a>. It does run better than the original Steam Deck, it just also isn't necessarily all that suited for taking on the go, which is kind of the point of these things. Hopefully Valve have plans bigger than just better battery life. I dislike that new generation of consoles offer uniformly the same experience as their predecessors but with slightly fancier graphics, and don't want to see that in a hypothetical Steam Deck 2.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-1-2-review-aaron-paul-critical-role-2000639678">Superhero workplace comedy game <em>Dispatch</em></a> has proven to be a big hit this year, already selling over a million copies since launching in October. And the fandom around the game is ravenous, with many players deeply invested in the narrative-driven adventure game’s romances. This caught the devs off guard, and might lead to some cut sex scenes returning in some form.</p> <p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dispatch-romance-deleted-sex-scenes-telltale-developers-exclusive-interview">In a new interview with <em>Inverse</em>,</a>&nbsp;<em>Dispatch</em> writer Pierre Shorette talked about how the game came together over the last few years and was asked about fans going wild over the few relationship and romance options in the superhero game developed by some former Telltale folks.</p>  <p>“I don’t know that I anticipated it to be as ravenous as it’s been,” said Shorette of the fan reaction. “It’s probably why we didn’t plan for more romance options, because we didn’t know it was going to be such a meaningful part of the experience for folks.” Shorette explained that he often defaults to romantic comedy when writing and has tried to resist this tendency, but romance was never an intentional focus of <em>Dispatch.</em> Rather, it was just one of the many parts of the game. Still, seeing the fans react to the romance and sex that exist in the game has Shorette wondering if they made a mistake.</p> <p>“We definitely cut some sex scenes. Which, in retrospect, we shouldn’t have,” Shorette told the outlet. “Maybe folks will get to see those one day.”</p> <p>“There isn’t anyone on the development team that wouldn’t have a laundry list of stuff they wish they could polish more or gotten into the game. On the writing side, our team has a bunch of darlings that had to be killed along the way. We’re still an indie studio, I think people forget that because it’s doing so well and looks so good. But because it looks good, it costs a lot per second to make this video game, and sometimes it costs things that often, with these games, is branching too.”</p> <p>Regardless, <a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-dialogue-options-chair-episode-3-golem-choice-2000640791"><em>Dispatch</em></a> has proven to be a big hit, with fans begging the devs for another season. And that might just happen. But for now, Shorette and the team at Ad Hoc Studios are just happy people like <em>Dispatch</em> so much.&nbsp; All eight episodes of <em>Dispatch</em> are out now on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

                <p>Even former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime was surprised by the somewhat sparse launch lineup of the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>"I wouldn't be completely honest if [I didn't say] from a business perspective, when I first saw that lineup, I scratched my head a little bit," said Fils-Aime--who served as Nintendo of America's president and chief operating officer from 2006 until he retired in 2019--during an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about?triedRedirect=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "But I think certainly what I underestimated was the enhanced performance, the enhanced Nintendo Switch 1 content, I think has been compelling. The stuff that you get for free as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, I think that has helped drive some of the momentum. And then certainly Bananza was a key driver for them."</p><p>When the original Switch launched in 2017, it was accompanied by The Legend of Zelda: Breathe of the Wild and joined later in the year by Super Mario Odyssey. Switch 2's big launch title was Mario Kart World in June 2025, followed by Donkey Kong Bananza a month later. But while many didn't consider those games to be system sellers, they were both hits with players and critics alike.</p><p>Fils-Aime attributed the success of the Switch 2 launch to Nintendo's global team and noted that "being able to successfully launch a new system after you've had historical success with the prior system is quite a challenge." He pointed to several examples of that, including Nintendo following the Wii with the less successful Wii U.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alum-reggie-subtly-roasts-switch-2-welcome-tour-price/1100-6530775/" data-ref-id="1100-6530775">Fils-Aime appeared to disagree</a> with Nintendo's decision to charge $10 for the Switch 2 Welcome Pack. As a contrast, he compared it to his decision to release Wii Sports as an included title for Wii consoles in North America. In 2022, Fils-Aime predicted that the large number of studio acquisitions by Sony and Microsoft would lead <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nintendo-of-america-boss-reggie-fils-aime-reacts-to-microsoft-and-sonys-acquisition-sprees/1100-6507374/" data-ref-id="1100-6507374">to senior designers breaking away</a> and launching their own innovative games. There have been some high-profile directors and designers that left larger companies, but Fils-Aime noted a lack of innovation during his new interview.</p><p>"I do hope that this industry doesn't stagnate," said Fils-Aime. "There are, at times, signs that the innovation isn't there. The breakthrough new type of content seems to be a little bit further and far between. That concerns me, and I hope that doesn't stop."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/as-arc-raiders-takes-off-developer-embark-defends-its-use-of-ai-tools">Embark caught some flak for this approach</a> (which was also used in the company's other major release, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/finals">The Finals</a>), to the extent that our friends over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Eurogamer</a> took a stand and marked the game down for its use of GenAI.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">Automaton Media</a>, ARC Raider publisher Nexon has now added its voice to the mix, with CEO Junghun Lee telling Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game*Spark</a> that "it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI."</p>

<p>While Lee goes on to clarify that human creativity is the key ingredient even in a world dominated by AI, his initial statement has triggered a frosty reception from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> developer Necrosoft Games.</p>
<p>"Not only do we not use AI we would rather cut off our own arms than do so," says the studio in a post on social media. "Demonschool is 100% human made."</p>
<p>Demonschool is a tactical RPG with a focus on swift combat that takes inspiration from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-persona-games-on-switch-and-nintendo-systems">Persona</a> series. It launches on November 19th. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hands-on-demonschool-is-a-love-letter-to-ds-games-and-italian-horror-movies">We previewed it back in 2022</a>, so give that a read if it sounds like it's up your street.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/16-cool-details-about-valve%E2%80%99s-new-steam-console-controller-and-vr-headset.1351885/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">Valve announced not one, not two, but three new pieces of video game hardware</a>: The console-like Steam Machine, the Steam Frame VR headset, and the Steam Controller. All of this stuff launches sometime in 2026 (<a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">price unknown</a>) and works together, alongside the Steam Deck, to create what is shaping up to be an impressive Steam ecosystem that rivals anything from Xbox, PlayStation, Apple, or Nintendo.</p>

 <p>But announcing three pieces of gaming hardware in one day means there are a lot of information and interviews floating around. So I’ve read through all of it, as well as all of Valve’s own posts, to narrow down 16 interesting, cool, important, and fun details about the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-controller-steamos-reaction-price-date-2000643563">Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller</a>.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Machine is bringing back Xbox 360-like faceplates</h2> <p>Valve’s new Steam console features a removable faceplate that reminds me a lot of the Xbox 360 faceplates from back in the day. Sadly, the company doesn’t sound committed to selling different plates, but they will be sharing all the files needed to 3D print your own. So I expect a lot of third-party plates will be available after launch. Oh, and Valve, you should totally sell this e-ink plate, please!</p>   <h2>Valve wants every game running at 4K60 on Steam Machine</h2> <p>“Our benchmark has always been that it should have enough performance to play every game on Steam at 4K60 when you do some sort of upscaling like FSR,” Yazan Aldehayyat, a Valve engineer working on the Steam Machine, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/steam-machine-specs-availability/">told<em> PC Gamer.</em></a> That’s a pretty big promise and likely will mean some newer, Unreal Engine 5 games will need to have their settings lowered a lot. But games from a few years ago, indie titles, and other similar titles should run like a dream on the device.</p>

 <h2>You can easily expand Steam Machine’s storage and even change the RAM</h2> <p>Valve has designed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine">Steam Machine</a> to let you add more SSD storage easily if you so desire. You can also slap in a fast, high-performance SD Card to add more storage. And for those willing to open the console up a bit more, you can even replace the RAM, though Valve says this will be tricky and likely not something most people do.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Machine is reportedly very, very quiet</h2> <p>According to <em>PC Gamer</em>, the Steam Machine is very quiet. Even while playing <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and standing close to the Steam console, it barely made any noise.</p> <h2>It’s also just a computer, if you want</h2> <p>Similar to the Steam Deck, Valve has designed the Steam Machine to be usable as a computer. Hook it up to a monitor, connect a mouse and keyboard, and you have a beefy little Linux-powered desktop PC that can run Steam and other software easily.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643621"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643621">©Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>You can wirelessly connect four Steam Controllers to the Steam Machine</h2> <p>Want to play a game with your pals on the Steam Machine? Well, good news: It supports four Steam Controllers at once without needing any extra dongles. Nifty stuff!</p> <h2>Steam Machine can run Windows, if you like that kind of thing</h2> <p>If you’re someone who prefers gaming on Windows, you can swap out SteamOS for Windows 11 and run that operating system instead. I wouldn’t recommend doing this, but hey, I’m not your dad.</p>

 <h2>The Steam Machine will be available in every country where the Steam Deck is sold</h2> <p>If you can legally buy a Steam Deck where you live now, you’ll be able to buy a Steam Machine, Frame, and Controller when they launch globally in 2026. Here’s the list of countries where the Steam Deck is currently for sale:</p> <ul id="658bd5bd-5531-4e7a-8de2-8daaef2adc91"> <li>USA</li> <li>Canada</li> <li>UK</li> <li>Germany</li> <li>France</li> <li>Australia</li> <li>Japan</li> <li>South Korea</li> <li>Taiwan</li> <li>Hong Kong</li> </ul> <h2>The Steam Deck, Controller, and Frame VR headset all work together</h2> <p>Valve is making a big deal about how all of these new Steam devices work together and connect in various ways. So you can, for example, stream a newer game from your Steam Machine to your Steam Deck. Or play a Steam Deck favorite of yours natively on the Steam Frame headset while using the Steam Controller completely wirelessly. And of course, all your Steam games and progress hop around seamlessly between every device.</p>

 <h2>Steam Controller’s thumbsticks sound very fancy</h2> <p>The Steam Controller includes <a href="https://tmrjoystick.com/">Tunnel Magnetoresistance (TMR) thumbsticks,</a> which are even better, more reliable, and more precise than Hall Effect sticks.&nbsp;“They’re super responsive, meaning that we’re able to lower the default dead zone by more than half. And super reliable. They’ll keep drift at bay much, much, much longer. These things are super great,” Steve Cardinali, an engineer at Valve, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/controllers/steam-controller-specs-availability-hands-on/">told <em>PC Gamer.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>The Steam Controller fully supports gyro aiming</h2> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/controllers/how-gyro-support-was-added-into-the-new-steam-controller-is-a-typical-valve-story/">Here’s a fun story:</a> The Steam Controller features full gyroscopic control because one person at Valve is way into gyro aiming and moved his desk into the same place the device was being designed to help get the feature in the gamepad. All you fans of gyro aiming should thank that person if you get the chance.</p> <h2>Steam Frame is basically a Steam Deck on your face</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000643622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643622"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643622">©Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While they don’t run on the same hardware, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamframe">Steam Frame VR headset</a> runs the same OS as the Steam Deck and should feel familiar to anyone who has played Valve’s portable PC. And because it’s a standalone device that runs SteamOS natively, all your Steam Deck games can be played on it in a big virtual theater.</p>

 <h2>The new VR headset is built for streaming, so no more wires</h2> <p>While you can plug a Steam Frame into a computer, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/vr-hardware/hands-on-steam-frame-impressions/">Valve has designed the device to be totally wireless</a>. It uses a dedicated 6 GHz connection via an included USB dongle to make sure your game is streamed perfectly to the headset. Those who have tried it out say it’s flawless, and the lack of cables is freeing in games like <em>Half-Life: Alyx.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>All Steam Deck Verified games will instantly be Steam Machine Verified</h2> <p>Valve is expanding its Verified program with the launch of all this new hardware. So now games can be Steam Deck, Steam Machine, and/or Steam Frame Verified. And because the Steam Machine is so much more powerful than the Steam Deck and supports a controller experience, Valve is automatically marking all Steam Deck Verified games as Steam Machine Verified. That means this device will launch in 2026 with a shit-ton of games that should, in theory, just play without issue on it.</p> <h2>You can stream games from the Steam Machine to the Steam Deck</h2> <p>While someone is watching TV, you can use the Steam Machine to play a newer, more taxing game on your Steam Deck wirelessly via streaming. It’s like the Wii U is back, but actually good.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Rogue Piece monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free Gems and Cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogue Piece is an exciting anime-based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monsterverze-codes-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that is based on the ultra-popular anime series One Piece, while also taking inspiration from various other anime shows. Players progress through the game by exploring various islands, defeating enemies along the way to get stronger and level up. The enemies that players will have to face get stronger as the game progresses, which makes grinding that much harder, and that’s where Rogue Piece codes can be of use to players. The codes will provide players with some much-needed resources, which can be used to get stronger weapons and upgrade existing abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-rogue-piece-codes">How To Redeem Rogue Piece Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rogue Piece Codes Redemption Page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Many Roblox games nowadays require players to complete certain steps before they’re able to redeem codes in the respective game. Some require players to follow the social media profiles of the developers, while others force players to join the game’s official Discord server before the code redemption feature gets unlocked for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogue Piece, however, doesn’t fall into the category. Redeeming codes in Rogue Piece is as simple as navigating through the menus and inputting one of the active codes given above into the correct text box. For newer players of the game who may be unfamiliar with the Roblox menu ecosystem, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide to redeeming codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Rogue Piece.</li>



<li>Click on the settings button on the left side of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down till you see the ‘code’ text box.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click the ‘Enter’ button to claim your reward.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-rogue-piece-codes">How To Get More Rogue Piece Codes</h2>



<p>The developers of Rogue Piece often drop new codes during updates or special events, which means that the next set of codes could be released very soon. However, tracking the release of these codes can be a hassle, as it requires players to comb through the game’s social media handles or Discord server regularly. Instead, the easiest way for players to stay up to date with the latest codes would be to bookmark this page. We update this article immediately after any new codes are dropped, making it your one-stop shop for all things Roblox codes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Congratulations to Pikachu.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The New York Videogame Critics Circle has unveiled the winner of its annual Andrew Yoon Legend Award ahead of the New York Game Awards in January. And unlike past years, it's not going to an individual luminary from the video game industry. It's going to...the Pokémon franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a first in the award's ten-year history, with past winners including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sam-lake-receives-andrew-yoon-legend-award-new-york-game-awards-alan-wake-control-remedy">Sam Lake</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-creative-head-neil-druckmann-to-receive-nyvgcc-legend-award">Neil Druckmann</a>, Phil Spencer, Tim Schafer, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/29/reggie-fils-aime-to-be-awarded-new-york-game-awards-legend-prize">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a>. That's not to say the award hasn't been flexible in its definition before, though. In its first year, 2016, the award was given to a studio: Rockstar Games. And in 2021, the award was given to four people: Jerry Lawson, Hideo Kojima, Brenda Romero, and John Romeo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's still unusual to see the Legend award go to a franchise. On its website and in past years, the NYVGCC has described the award as going to "a game changer in the video games industry" and "those who have propelled the gaming world forward, celebrating their profound impact on an industry that continues to captivate and connect people worldwide." This year, the press release describes the award's purpose as to "recognize industry icons and organizations that exhibited a significant, sustained body of work demonstrating exceptional artistic achievement and innovation."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Per the NYVGCC, Pokémon was chosen as "an iconic staple of global popular culture, breaking through to video game and mainstream audiences in the mid-to-late 90s with a unique combination of collectibility, strong and approachable RPG gameplay and unparalleled character design." The release cites its $12 billion in global retail sales in 2024, over 489 million game copies sold since 1996, and the fact that it's one of the highest-grossing media franchises. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">gave the most recent Pokemon game, Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, an 8/10, saying it "finally feels like Game Freak hitting its stride in Pokémon's 3D era, with a fun setting to explore, a well-written story, and a total battle system overhaul that works surprisingly well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How do you articulate the impact of a cultural phenomenon like Pokémon? ‘Legend’ is the only word that comes to mind,” said Harold Goldberg, the president and founder of NYVGCC. “For 30 years, the franchise has grown to become the most recognizable game series in the world and is beloved for its unique monster designs that have compelled players young and old to catch ‘em all. It is a tremendous honor to present the company with the Andrew Yoon Legend Award at our 15th celebration of the New York Game Awards.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The award will be accepted by The Pokémon Company at the awards ceremony on January 18, and The Pokémon Company will be in attendance with "two fan-favorite Pokémon" characters available for fan photo opportunities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to NYVGCC for comment on the decision to honor a franchise this year and received the following official statement:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Pokémon Company’s Legend Award heralds the second time the New York Game Awards has decided to honor an overall team over a single individual creator. The first was Rockstar Games in 2016. With their influence across entertainment, console and tabletop gaming for 30 years, we felt that the many people who work with The Pokémon Company deserve to share the prestigious Andrew Yoon Legend Award for our 15th anniversary." </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>After starring in multiple Naughty Dog games, actor Troy Baker continues his working relationship with the studio for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. The actor recently discussed working with director Neil Druckmann, what it feels like to not play the lead in a Naughty Dog game, and how he wants to have a career similar to Oscar-winner George Clooney.</p><p><a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/troy-baker-makes-first-comments-about-naughty-dogs-intergalactic-game-exclusive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to ComicBook</a>, Baker said one thing that's stayed the same working with Druckmann on Intergalactic after starring in The Last of Us series as Joel and as Sam in Uncharted 4 is that they still butt heads.</p><p>"Neil and I will always, it's our vibe," he said. "We just love to butt up against each other. We were doing a table read, and I was literally like, 'Why are you giving me shit right now? I'm asking you a question!' And everybody else is like, 'Our mom and dad are fighting, are we still going to Disneyland?' We're fine. We're fine!"</p><p>Baker didn't say exactly what he and Druckmann were clashing on, nor do we even know much about the character Baker plays in Intergalactic... or the story of the game, for that matter.</p><p>Also in the interview, Baker discussed playing a supporting role in Intergalactic after playing one of the leads in the Last of Us franchise. This time around, Baker said he's excited to sit back somewhat, with Tati Gabrielle's character, Jordan A. Mun, serving as the lead.</p><p>"I've had a hell of a career. This industry owes me nothing. What a ride. I don't think that I deserve or need any more," he said. "But I am enjoying it now, now that I understand more about game development, I enjoy the process more than I do the credit. So I'm enjoying the position that I have, which I still feel is a very important position with Intergalactic."</p><p>Intergalactic is in development now for PlayStation 5, and one of the things that Druckmann keeps saying about it is that it has the "deepest gameplay" ever for a Naughty Dog game, whatever that means. The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-wont-be-released-until-2027-at-the-soonest-report/1100-6530386/" data-ref-id="1100-6530386">not expected to release until 2027</a>. Naughty Dog may also be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p><h2><strong>"I want to be like George Clooney"</strong></h2><p>Baker also discussed his career ambitions on a longer timeline, saying he wants to "be like George Clooney," the Oscar-winning actor whose career has spanned decades and many different genres.</p><p>"I want to have my Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? and my Michael Clayton, and some of his directing work too," Baker said. "He's just an amazing person. The things that he’s able to create and the reason why he continues to be in things like Oceans 11, Up in the Air, or The American is because people just want to work with him."</p><h2>Baker's career</h2><p>Baker may be best known for his roles in Uncharted and The Last of Us, but he's done much more beyond those two Naughty Dog franchises. He also played the main character, Booker DeWitt, in BioShock Infinite and Rhys in Tales from the Borderlands. Baker also voiced Talion in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Agent Jones in Fortnite. Baker is also known for portraying the villain Pagan Min in Far Cry 4 and Higgs in the Death Stranding series, and has voiced Batman in some Lego projects.</p><p>More recently, he played the iconic character Indiana Jones in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Original Indiana Jones actor Harrison Ford <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harrison-ford-praises-troy-baker-and-the-lack-of-ai-for-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/1100-6529281/" data-ref-id="1100-6529281">praised Baker's performance in the game</a> and how he achieved it without AI.</p><p>In 2022, Baker partnered with a blockchain company called Voiceverse and was caught up in drama related to AI and plagiarism. He later <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/troy-baker-ends-partnership-with-nft-firm-and-says-sorry-for-hate-or-create-comment/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cut ties with the company</a> and owned up to what he described as antagonistic remarks he made when the collaboration was first announced.</p><p>Baker is also a musician and has released multiple albums. On TV, he appeared in HBO's The Last of Us in a Season 1 episode as the cannibal <a href="https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/James" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">James</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Valve has announced three major bits of new hardware coming in 2026, with a PC called the Steam Machine, a new wireless VR headset called Steam Frame, and a brand new controller simply named the Steam Controller. The hardware will allow you to play all of your games in your Steam library from indie titles to AAA titles. Additionally, the Steam Machine will let you install apps and different operating systems.</p>

			<p>Epic has released Unreal Engine 5.7 to developers. This new version of the leading commercially available game-making engine introduces several improvements over previous releases, as well as some new features. </p>



<p>For example, the MegaLights feature, which was previously tagged as Experimental in earlier UE5 builds, has now moved to Beta. With it, developers are allowed to inject a much greater number of dynamic, shadow-casting lights into the scenes of their games to achieve effects such as realistic soft shadows from complex light sources, like area lights. This more scalable lighting workflow enables them to work more intuitively and create larger, richer, and more intricate worlds than ever before.</p>



<p>Unreal Engine 5.7 also delivers a significant enhancement to visual fidelity, offering new support for directional lights, translucency, shadow casting for Niagara particles, and more accurate shading and shadowing on hair. Epic says developers can also expect better out-of-the-box performance, improved noise reduction, and reduced need for manual optimization of lights.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Another highlight of Unreal Engine 5.7 is undoubtedly Nanite Foliage (available as an Experimental feature). Previously, Nanite could not be used with foliage, but that's changed thanks to a new geometry rendering system powered by the so-called Nanite Voxels. These automatically and efficiently draw millions of tiny, overlapping elements that appear as a solid mass from a distance, such as tree canopies, pine needles, and ground clutter. This is achieved at stable frame rates, without cross-fades or pops, and without the need to author LODs. Nanite Foliage also uses Nanite Assemblies to reduce storage, memory and rendering costs, as well as using Nanite Skinning to determine dynamic behaviours such as wind response. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new Unreal Engine 5 also offers an updated Procedural Content Generation (PCG) framework. It's now production-ready, featuring improved GPU performance and a new Editor Mode for easier customization.</p>



<p>This build provides developers with a production-ready version of Substrate, the system designed for creating complex, high-fidelity, physically accurate layered and blended materials. Lastly, Unreal Engine 5.7 adds an AI Assistant that provides helpful guidance directly in the Editor. A dedicated slide-out panel lets the user ask questions, generate C++ code, or access step-by-step guidance without having to leave the Editor.</p>



<p>There are many more fixes and improvements to other systems, such as Metahumans and the animation toolset. Read everything <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-5-7-release-notes">on this page</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has released a <em>Riftbound: Spiritforged</em> preview. The second set in the official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> TCG will introduce new cards, new gameplay mechanics, and feature certain Legends from across the popular franchise.</p>



<p>The <em>Riftbound: Spiritforged</em> preview shows off a small handful of cards, some new prebuilt champion decks, and three new mechanics coming to the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-preview-card-artwork.jpg?itok=WRs6_P1y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-preview-card-artwork.jpg?itok=FAyIjFtp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Equipment is a new card subtype. Equipment can be attached to to units to make them stronger. Interestingly, equipment sticks around even if even if the unit is killed. Gold is a new resource that you can "spend" to get a new resource called Power, which is a required cost for certain cards. Lastly, there is Repeat. A spell with this effect can be doubled if you pay the card's cost a second time.</p>

<p>Some of the cards in the <em>Riftbound: Spiritforged</em> preview showcase some of these new mechanics. These include new Equipment cards such as <em>Guardian Angel</em>, <em>Dorian's Shield</em>, and <em>Sterak's Gage</em>. In keeping with his character, the cards featuring the Legend, Draven involves gaining and using Gold.</p>

<p>Notably, the assets in the preview do confirm at least two new champion decks. One will feature the dangerous duelist, Fiora. The other showcases the genius tinkerer, Rumble. As for how those particular decks will play is anyone's guess.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are 12 new Spirit Blossum-themed Overnumbered cards in the set. These cards are tied thematically to the set, which involves the lifting of the veil between the mortal and spirit realms.</p>

<p>Riftbound launched last month and, despite <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/riot-games-addresses-launch-issues-with-riftbound-origins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some launch issues</a>, has found its audience. It has entered a crowded space of other competitive card games such as <em>Magic The Gathering</em>, <em>Disney Lorcana</em>, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG</em></a>. The Spiritforged set will launch in December 2025 in China, and in English-speaking regions February 2026.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In its new Steam Frame VR headset, Valve put dual audio drivers on each side in the included head strap. That puts the audio near your ears while you’re wearing it, and in my brief time trying the device at Valve’s headquarters recently, I thought the sound was just fine. But the choice to have those dual drivers also helps reduce audio vibrations, which helps the headset with tracking while you’re playing games in VR, Valve hardware engineer Jeremy Selan tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>The Frame, like many other VR headsets, uses outward-facing cameras built into the main part of the headset for tracking. However, audio with good bass “induces vibrations into the headset,” which can affect that tracking, according to Selan. But on the Frame’s included head strap, the dual drivers per side are “mounted opposite to each other,” which creates “vibration cancellation inherent in the design.” That allows for “better tracking, even with good audio,” Selan says.</p><div><div><p id="we-answered-your-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>We answered your burning questions about Valve’s new hardware.</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We hosted a subscriber-exclusive AMA about the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller, and you can check out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818113/valve-steam-frame-machine-controller-vr-headset-pc-ask-us-anything-ama">our responses here</a>.</p></blockquote></div></div><p>Pretty cool!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A funny thing happens when you stir up enough trouble in the tiny, open-world portions of <i>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</i>. If you indulge in showing off your uber vampiric parkour abilities and wield your other powers too openly, the music intensifies and sirens, followed by the sound of a helicopter, surround you as you, hopefully, are trying to hide. At first, it instills a sense of urgency, a panic. You have to find somewhere in the not-so-sprawling map of Seattle to hide away. The need to run, to disappear into the shadows, it’s kind of fun.</p>

 <p>The thing is, there are no police cars with sirens blazing. Stop and look: There are no helicopters. You’ll reach a game over screen if you continue to violate the vampiric code of silence known as the Masquerade, but aside from cops on the streets opening fire on you (who are hardly a threat given that you’re literally a 400-year-old vampire), so much of the sense of danger around you is nothing more than a shallow facade. It makes an otherwise beautiful slice of Seattle in snowy winter feel completely hollow.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643612" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643612"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643612">© Screenshot: The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Equally deflating, there are no lasting consequences for feeding on humans, killing them quietly, or indulging in your violent vampiric side.</p> <p>In the tabletop roleplaying game on which <i>Bloodlines 2</i> is based, players whose characters are vampires have to balance the bestial nature of vampirism with their efforts to hang onto what’s left of their humanity. It’s a core game mechanic, with a “humanity” meter that can grow or shrink depending on your actions. But it’s also fodder for the central themes of <i>VtM</i>, which many come to the game for: at what point are you no longer human? How and when have you fully given into the monster inside you that hungers, eternally so?</p>

 <p>There’s no hunger meter in <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, at least not one that reflects the concerns you have in the tabletop roleplaying game where your actions have an impact on the world around you as well as yourself. In <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, you’ll need to feed on humans if you’ve used too many powers in combat, but never does the game require you to concern yourself with the ethics of how you satiate that hunger.</p>

 <p>And sure, those vampiric powers can be a lot of fun. You can zip around enemies, snap their necks, telepathically pick up their guns to fire back at your enemies, toy with their minds by instilling fear or a sense of self-destruction, or even summon blades of blood to shoot at your foes. That part can be very cool.</p>

 <p>But the fun of that loop is fleeting at best and you’re left with nothing but a hollow diorama set in the world of <i>VtM</i>’s rich lore.</p> <p>That’s why it’s even more disappointing that, despite that fake feeling of the world around you, despite a game loop that tires quickly, there’s so much that <i>Bloodlines 2</i> does well that it feels like an undead variant of a better game that somehow withered away in its developmental slumber.</p>

 <h2>The soul of something vibrant trapped in a lifeless husk</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000643609" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643609"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643609">© Screenshot: The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s sort of poetic that <i>Bloodlines 2</i>’s protagonist, Phyre, is a 400-year-old vampire only recently awoken from a deep sleep, unsure of the reality they now live in. <i>Bloodlines 2</i> itself had a rough previous life, and it seems equally unsure of itself. The original <i>Bloodlines</i>, released in a shoddy state in 2004, required the work of countless modders and <i>VtM</i> enthusiasts to mold it into something acceptable. It remains a wonky game to this day.</p>

 <p>The sequel, as you may know, saw its first developer, Hardsuit Labs, dismissed from the project. The remains were picked up by <i>Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture</i> developer The Chinese Room, as they used assets created by HSL and crafted an entirely new story set in a very small slice of Seattle.</p> <p>As we speak, those old assets and build materials from HSL’s work on the game have leaked out, and are leading many to speculate that something better was lost.</p>    <p>The speculation is fun, no doubt, but I think it also distracts from talking about the actual product that exists, what it fails to achieve and what it manages to do well. And going by the writing in <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, it’s clear that this could’ve been an excellent video game.</p>

 <p>There’s a lot to say about the story and writing of <i>Bloodlines 2</i>, how well it handles <i>VtM</i>’s themes and lore, how the Johnny-Silverhand-of-a-situation that Phyre and the co-protagonist who lives in their head find themselves in sparks great dialogue (and excellent voice performances) and narrative direction. But I often find myself thinking about a particular NPC named Patience, a Toreador clan vampire who I consider a brilliant take on the obsessed artist archetype.</p> <p>Patience is almost always found in the backroom of a pawn shop which is owned by another fascinating character, Niko Anelov. In most <i>VtM</i> media, Toreadors are portrayed as upper-class divas, obsessed with themselves and their objects of desire. There’s literally a mechanic for this in the TTRPG: a Toreador can become fixated on what they find beautiful to the point where their monstrous nature enables them to do horrible things in pursuit of having that beauty.</p>

 <p>It’s common enough that those beautiful objects are “high art,” or things that many would regard as conventionally beautiful or sexually attractive. Patience, as a Toreador, is very obsessed in a similar way, but it’s trash that calls to them, the trash left behind at a pawn shop specifically. They wish to collect it and work with it as a kind of found media, seeing beauty in the act of something left behind, forgotten, misplaced, discarded. On one hand, it’s refreshing to see a character like this. On the other, Patience could be viewed as an egotistical hipster scrounging up garbage to masquerade as art, not quite unlike the stuffy elite Toreadors holed up in art galleries and opera houses. Who are they really? I love that riddle about them.</p> <p>I tend to prefer Malkavian clan types myself, but this Toreador? One conversation with them sees Phyre ruminating over whether Patience’s art is about “mortality” or “individualism.” It’s the kind of moment I love in a good tabletop game of <i>VtM</i>. Yes, there’s the gory lore and the sex and the thrill of being powerful, but stopping to ask a vampire artist if their work, which they will continue to toil away with for eternity, is a statement of their own individuality or a commentary on the nature of death? That’s what I’m here for. Those are the deep, endless riddles that I love cracking open with the sharp object that is the vampire as metaphor.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000643608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643608"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643608">© Screenshot: The Chinese Room / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But alas, Patience, my beautiful trash Toreador, will just stand around in the world, lifeless, unless I talk to them. And the quest they give me? It’s just to collect some items which, while they’re connected to the story, feel like a Ubisoft-ified collect-a-thon. I’ve gathered all the items they requested, but these knickknacks don’t appear in their studio, or on their work. It was all just a checkmark on the game’s map.</p>

 <p>Lifeless, hollow, I leave Patience to do their work of…standing there, as I return to the equally lifeless sirens and helicopters of Seattle. The world will blare sirens at you that don’t exist, and Patience will speak of a vibrant, countercultural artistic practice you rarely see outside of what exists in a permanent, rigid state in their studio.</p> <p>I’ve yet to cross the finish line on <i>Bloodlines 2</i>’s story. I feel compelled to do so because the characters are excellent, and the way it’s using the lore of <i>Vampire: The Masquerade </i>and the thematic nature of the vampire has potential. But the execution, that’s the stake through the heart.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>You don't see a lot of coin pusher arcade machines anymore. <em>Raccoin: Coin Pusher Roguelike</em>, from developer Doracoon and<em> Balatro</em> publisher Playstack, is played within one.</p><p>The decline of coin pusher arcade machines came with increased restrictions on real-money prizes for largely luck-based games—i.e., gambling—and the closure of arcades themselves. A child of the '90s, I spent a lot of time in arcades putting tokens into coin pushers. The one at my local arcade was brightly lit with lots of vibrant colors, set up with six different stations so multiple people could play at once. No strategy in mind, I'd bounce between setups tossing coins into the machine at entirely random intervals, hoping one would eventually pay off.</p><p>The thing about the coin pusher is that its prizes—largely more coins, which equal tickets—always look tantalizingly close to the edge. Just one more coin! Coins or tokens are inserted into the machine and slide onto a moving shelf. The idea is that the new coins, laid flat behind the mess of coins in front, cause a chain reaction when the shelf moves. The coins closest to the edge fall off the shelf, onto another playing field with more coins. And then newly fallen coins then continue the cycle: When the shelf moves, coins at the edge of the machine fall into the prize slot. If you do it right, perhaps, you'll win a ton of coins—an avalanche of coins.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: Doraccoon/Playstack</span></figcaption></figure><p>A demo version of the game is playable now on Steam, and it's exactly the experience I'd always hoped a coin pusher would be. There are lots of coins—so, so many—and with a little strategy, you'll be raining coins into the prize slot repeatedly. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3784030/RACCOIN_Coin_Pusher_Roguelike/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Doraccoon lays it out quite plainly in its Steam description</u></a>: "It's a nonstop dopamine rush packed into one unpredictable, coin dropping ride."</p><p>From a moving chute, you'll drop coins into the game quickly and generously. Where <em>Raccoin</em> strays away from the traditional coin pusher is that it's also a roguelike with lots of different modifiers designed to create huge payouts. The different items, abilities, and coins combine to shift the playing field and enhance effects. These are unlocked gradually, as the goals of your runs get higher. You're able to get through the first through levels of the demo without much strategy, but you'll need one in the later levels. Some coins do things like create an explosion. One item creates a black hole that sucks coins in.</p><p>But <em>Raccoin</em>'s strategy can get pretty complicated when you start thinking about the ways coins can interact with each other, much like a <em>Balatro</em> run with its different joker cards. So, for instance, you can combine coins that represent seeds with water coins or with a fertilizer item to create coin trees. Spam that even more by using a special prize that rains down your most purchased coin—if you've done things right, that should be the seed coin—to take it even further.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: Doraccoon/Playstack</span></figcaption></figure><p>What you end up with is an absolutely constant cascade of coins overflowing into the prize slot, lighting up the machine with the satisfying sound of coins clinking around. Shaking the arcade machine won't get you kicked out of the arcade, either: It's just another way to hear that gratifying sound.</p><p><em>Raccoin</em>'s demo is available now on Steam, but there's no release date announced just yet. The demo is just a fraction of what will be available in the full game, allowing you to unlock two separate characters, 50 different coins, and 60 ability items. It's more than enough to keep me busy until the game's out; it's got the same sort of feel as <em>Balatro</em> in that it's hard to step away. Just like the coin pushers of my youth, I find myself saying: just one more coin.</p>

It’s called foveated streaming, and it means the headset requests a higher-quality image for the content that’s right in front of your eyes while lowering the resolution of your peripheral vision to reduce bandwidth and processing demands.</p><p>The headset relies on a couple pieces of hardware to make that happen. The first is a dedicated wireless streaming adapter that sends games from a PC to the headset. The second is a pair of eye-tracking cameras inside the headset that follow where you’re looking. If you’re familiar with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/22/12260430/nvidia-foveated-rendering-vr-graphics-smi-eye-tracking-siggraph">foveated rendering</a>, which headsets like Apple’s Vision Pro deploy for on-device processing, it’s a similar idea.</p><p>Valve tells <em>The Verge</em> that foveated streaming won’t be exclusive to the Frame. While it’s currently optimized for the Steam Frame, foveated streaming can work with “any headset that supports eye tracking” and that is “compatible with our Steam Link streaming app,” according to hardware engineer Jeremy Selan.</p><div><div><p id="we-answered-your-burning-questions-about-valves-new-hardware"><h2>We answered your burning questions about Valve’s new hardware.</h2></p></div><div><blockquote><p>We hosted a subscriber-exclusive AMA about the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller, and you can check out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818113/valve-steam-frame-machine-controller-vr-headset-pc-ask-us-anything-ama">our responses here</a>.</p></blockquote></div></div><p>I’ve seen foveated streaming in action myself, and it’s extremely impressive. While playing <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> on a Steam Frame streamed from a nearby PC with that dedicated 6GHz wireless streaming adapter, I honestly couldn’t tell that the game wasn’t running locally on the headset. While Valve hasn’t specified when foveated streaming might be available on other headsets or which might be able to use it, I’m glad to hear that owners of other VR headsets will be able to use the feature to play their games.</p><p>It doesn’t sound like Valve has plans for other VR headsets to be able to take advantage of the wireless adapter, though. “Supporting the wireless adapter is more difficult without lower-level OS support, as we have with SteamOS,” Selan says.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/817993/valve-vr-steam-frame-foveated-streaming-rendering-link]]></content:encoded>
