            <p>
Following last year's slam-dunk <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, the beloved survival horror sequel is being reinterpreted yet again, this time in the form of new movie adaptation Return to Silent Hill. And now, three years after its announcement, it's been given a release date of 23rd June 2026.
</p>
<p>
Return to Silent Hill was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-konamis-silent-hill-october-2022-showcase">originally unveiled in 2022</a>, alongside a variety of gaming projects including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-ascension-fails-to-impress-with-greedy-monetisation-and-cluttered-ui">unloved Silent Hill: Ascension</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">masterful Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, and No Code's still-mysterious Silent Hill Townfall.
</p>
<p>
Amid that flurry of gaming news, Return to Silent Hill was perhaps a little lost in the throng, but the key bit of information was that it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-detailed">see Christophe Gans take on directing duties once more</a>. Gans, of course, previously helmed 2006's Sean-Bean-starring original Silent Hill movie, which certainly captured the game series' atmosphere - even if it did all start to fall apart in the last stretch, when it suddenly decided it needed to explain itself in a ham-fisted exposition dump that even some high velocity barbed wire couldn't save.

<p>
Since Return to Silent Hill's initial unveiling, it's been confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-casts-war-horses-jeremy-irvine-as-james">War Horse's Jeremy Irvine will star as Silent Hill 2 protagonist James</a>, with Hannah Emily Anderson in the role of his "one true love" Mary (an early leak suggested the two won't be married in this version). More recently, Gans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-will-be-faithful-adaptation-of-silent-hill-2-distributor-promises">insisted his adaptation would be a "faithful" one</a> "created out of deep respect for a true masterpiece of a game, although a careful reading of the movie's synopsis does imply some potential significant changes:
</p>
<p>
"James, a man broken after his relationship with the love of his life, Mary, ends," reads the official synopsis. "When a mysterious letter from her calls him back to Silent Hill, he finds a once-recognisable town transformed by an unknown evil. While James desperately searches for Mary he encounters terrifying creatures and begins to unravel the mystery of what happened to the town. But as he descends deeper into the darkness the secrets he uncovers lead to a horrifying truth, and James finds himself struggling to hold on long enough to save his one true love."
</p>
<p>
We'll know if Return to Silent Hill does its source material justice when it <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/silent-night-deadly-night-return-silent-hill-release-dates-1236436030/">hits the big screen</a> on 23rd June next year. However, it ends up, Bloober's remake - which has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-passes-another-sales-milestone">sold over 2m copies</a> - is a fine way to experience a bonafide gaming classic. And the studio is about to do it all over again, as it embarks on its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-silent-hill-remake-has-been-revealed-during-konami-press-start-showcase">recently announced remake of Silent Hill 1</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-is-a-bigger-evolution-than-borderlands-3-says-gearbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With less than three months until the launch date of Borderlands 4, Gearbox is starting to share a lot more details. Yesterday, the game became <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-wont-cost-80/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for pre-order</a>, and fans learned the pricing and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC system requirements</a>. Now, Executive Producer Chris Brock has been <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/borderlands-4-interview-with-chris-brock-producer-and-taylor-clark-senior-writer-1559773/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> by Gamereactor. Among other things, he reckons that the new game is more of an evolution for the franchise than its predecessor was when it launched in 2019.</p>
<p><em>The time between Borderlands 2 and Borderlands 3 was about seven years. We had been gone for a while. We wanted to make sure that when we came back it was familiar. When people say it feels like more Borderlands, yeah, that was the goal. We wanted to make more Borderlands. We wanted to evolve, but we didn't want to change the formula so much that it didn't feel familiar.</em></p>
<p><em>But going from Borderlands 3 to Borderlands 4, one of the things we wanted to focus on was the traversal abilities and exploration. And that has led to the series evolving, I would say, more between 3 and 4 than it did between 2 and 3, for sure.</em></p>
<p>In the same interview, Senior Writer Taylor Clark explained why Borderlands 4 will feature a different brand of humor than previous installments.</p>
<p><em>The most important thing for us is to have a tone that feels like it makes sense in the world we're building and in the story we're trying to tell. On Pandora, like the Wild West, the shotgun approach made sense. Because this was a world where anything goes. A world where everything was trying to kill you and corporations were trying to cut each other's throats. And Handsome Jack always looked at you and was talking shit to you. The slightly nastier tone made sense in that world. On a totalitarian, dictatorial planet ruled by this person with an iron fist, it makes less sense.</em></p>
<p><em>It makes less sense to have a tone like that. It wouldn't feel appropriate (like firing jokes from a T-shirt cannon) when we are under a horribly oppressed world. We tried to find the humor. It wouldn't be a Borderlands game without humor.</em></p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is coming on September 12 to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, while the Nintendo Switch 2 version will be released at a later date.</p>

                <p>Warner Bros. Games has announced a major organizational change as it looks to focus on four major franchises going forward: Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and DC.</p><p>Yves Lachance, who was previously the studio head of WB Games Montreal, is now senior vice president of development, with his remit being overseeing the studios working on Harry Potter and Game of Thrones games. Shaun Himmerick, who previously was the boss at NetherRealm, is now senior vice president for development on all new Mortal Kombat and DC games.</p><p>WB Games New York boss Steven Flenory is now senior vice president for central tech and services, a role that sees him overseeing quality assurance, user research, game and publishing technology, and customer service.</p><p>These three executives will report to Warner Bros. Discover boss JB Perrette. In a statement, Perrette said the company is making these changes to "develop long-term franchise roadmaps" for Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and DC projects.</p><p>"We are very fortunate to have a strong stable of development and technology talent, and Yves, Shaun, and Steven are respected leaders with excellent track records in their areas of expertise. I'm looking forward to working closely with them and the team as we work to make the best games possible for our key franchises," Perrette said.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Variety</a>, this management shakeup did not lead to any layoffs or any executives leaving the company. Former WB Games top boss David Haddad left the company earlier this year, and it remains to be seen if the company is looking for a replacement.</p><p>Earlier this month, WB Discovery said it is breaking apart into two companies: WBD Streaming and Studios and WBD Global Networks. WB Games is part of the Streaming and Studios division, which is run by CEO David Zaslav.</p><p>In terms of upcoming releases, Batman: Arkham Knight developer Rocksteady is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">working on a new single-player Batman game</a>. WB Games Montreal is reportedly pitching a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">new Game of Thrones title</a>. Avalanche Software is expected to be working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">Hogwarts Legacy sequel</a>.</p><p>The Mortal Kombat series, meanwhile, is expected to continue from developer NetherRealm. As for other DC projects, studio boss James Gunn has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">some "really interesting" projects are coming</a>, but not soon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-donkey-kong-bananza-has-instantly-become-my-most-anticipated-game-of-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="DK Bananza 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ac54d4227a89c/dk-bananza-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>I have to admit, before the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it"><strong>Donkey Kong Bananza</strong> Direct</a>, I wasn't <em>massively</em> enthusiastic about Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2 platformer.</p>
<p>I played about 20 minutes of it at one of the Switch 2 Experience events back in April, and although I was charmed by the aesthetics and the ability to smash up pieces of the environment, I couldn't help but wonder if there was something more - that Nintendo was holding back a little bit.</p>
<p>It turns out I was wrong. It held back a <em>lot</em>.</p>
<p>This Direct was simply magnificent and my excitement has gone from about 45/100 bananas all the way up to about 98. That's a lot of bananas! Where are the remaining two, you ask? Well, King K. Rool isn't there, but we can't have everything now, can we?</p>

<p>My concern around the playable demo was that the game would amount to little more than smashing through the terrain to find collectibles ('Banandium Gems'). Surely there was more to it, right? Well, yes.</p>
<p>For starters, let's just touch on the wonderful bait and switch regarding Odd Rock and Pauline. We kinda knew something like this was in the works following a rather <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/did-donkey-kong-bananza-key-art-accidentally-leak-a-big-surprise">unfortunate leak</a>, but it's still an incredible move. I honestly couldn't click with Odd Rock from the earlier promotional material, so to learn that DK will instead spend his time with a young Pauline was an absolute delight.</p>
<p>You can keep your depressing father/daughter dynamic, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/last_of_us_part_i">The Last of Us</a> – this is much more up my street.</p>

<p>Pauline's not just there for show, either. With special Bananza Powers, she can burst into song and enable DK to transform into completely new forms. Kong Bananza looks absolutely awesome, but I'm sorry, Zebra Bananza? <em>Ostrich Bananza..?!</em> I'm gonna need plushies of those right now, thank you very much.</p>
<p>The transformations grant you extra strength, speed, and the ability to fly, and just these alone make the gameplay look infinitely more varied and compelling than what I saw in the early demo. I've a feeling there might be a few more transformations Nintendo hasn't revealed just yet too. How about Sloth Bananza? <em>Anyone..?</em></p>
<p>Quick glimpses of other gameplay features — including the Challenge Course Ruins, the skill tree, and collectible costumes — did a lot to boost my excitement too. Side-scrolling levels are back! Rambi is back! And I simply can't wait to experiment with the different clothing and colour options. Who knew that an ice-themed Donkey Kong would look so cool?</p>

<p>And of course, I have to give a shoutout to the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-channels-super-mario-64-energy-with-its-dk-artist-mode">DK Artist mode</a>. As someone who messed around with the 3D menu-screen Mario in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> longer than I care to admit, being able to chip chunks off DK's face or Bowser's hair and create some truly terrifying monstrosities makes me more excited than DK gobbling up a Banandium Gem. It looks absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p>It wasn't <em>all</em> for me, admittedly. Chances are I won't go into photo mode too much or jump into the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-features-two-player-co-op-and-you-can-even-gameshare-to-switch-1">co-op multiplayer</a>, and there's not a hope in hell I'm buying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-gets-a-new-amiibo-nintendo-details-how-they-work-in-dk-bananza">another amiibo</a>, but I appreciate their inclusion regardless.</p>
<p>I've got to be honest, though: after the incredibly disappointing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-mario-kart-world-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it"><strong>Mario Kart World</strong> Direct</a> in April, which basically just went over everything we already knew and did very little to move my excitement beyond about 70 blue shells out of 100, the DK Direct totally 180-ed me.</p>
<p>I was <em>mildly</em> excited before, but now it's my most anticipated game of the year. Bravo, Nintendo. Just don't tell Samus.</p>

<p><em>What are your thoughts on Donkey Kong Bananza after watching the recent Direct presentation? Has your excitement increased, or is it about the same as before? Give me a banana number!

Not everyone has that sort of time, but it’s an outlook that certainly takes the pressure off of actually feeling like you need to get better or show progress for all those failed attempts.

He’s previously espoused his love of FromSoftware’s uniquely esoteric brand of storytelling, likening it to an “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kti9si/alex_garland_on_why_he_loves_the_dark_souls_games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kti9si/alex_garland_on_why_he_loves_the_dark_souls_games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">existential dream</a></span>.” We’ll see how that translates to the big screen. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you fall once, it's only one pip on the bar; but by third death, you've got the whole radius covered in purple, and it can feel quite difficult to chip that much purple bar down while a Nightlord is attacking you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it turns out, there are some hidden mechanics that may be helping or hindering your efforts to pick your teammates back up. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZullietheWitch" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Zullie the Witch</a> has been on the Elden Ring Nightreign beat, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HUe7JUs8_M" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently put up new video</a> in which they try to understand how revives work. (Thanks for the spot, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/you-arent-just-imagining-things-elden-ring-nightreign-player-confirms-its-6x-harder-to-revive-someone-at-3-bars-when-compared-to-1-because-fromsoftwares-ui-is-basically-lying-to-you/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Per Zullie's investigation, the first time a player falls in battle, they get one bar at a total of 40 HP. But as they continue to fall, this escalates at a surprising rate, with 45 per bar at second death and a whopping 80 per bar at three, for a grand total of 240 HP total if you're on three bars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hitting the player who's downed chips away at those totals, but if they're left alone for 3.5 seconds, the death timer around their dial resumes (unless you're in a Night boss fight) and the gauge starts to refill. The fill time also speeds up as you gain more bars, going from 2-per-second at one bar to 40-per-second at three bars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's a lot of math to say: the more you fall, the harder it gets (exponentially so) to pick you back up. There is some good news though, as penalties gradually wear off over time or whenever one visits a Site of Grace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zullie also highlights some hidden math in how weapons work on the revive bars, too. It's about what you'd expect, compared to regular attacks; giant weapons, like Halberds, Reapers, and Greatswords have more impact on the revive bar than Claws, Daggers, Torches, or Fists on a per-swing basis. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, Revenant's Cursed Claws make for uniquely effective revival tools in this regard, as they have the same base numbers as a Greatsword. Revenant mains can effectively play both White Mage and Summoner, I guess?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Zullie's video goes into even more math around the revival numbers, but for the average Elden Ring Nightreign player, the solid takeaways are that higher bars get increasingly harder to clear as Nightfarers fall. Honestly, it makes certain characters like the Revenant even more valuable as teammates, when they have both summons to help out and an ultimate that will pick teammates back up regardless of their bar's status.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> History Of Five Nights At Freddy's</p>
      </div>
<p>This current crossover includes a new playable character, Five Nights at Freddy's Springtrap. His character brings over elements from his franchise, including shocking animations, spring doors, and security cameras that impact gameplay. The crossover also includes a new map, Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza.</p><p>“It goes without saying that Five Nights at Freddy’s and Dead by Daylight feature diametrically opposed gameplay,” shared Jay Guzzo, Springtrap’s Killer Designer in a statement to GameSpot. “In the former, you’re mainly sitting in one room and managing a single resource--your battery. Whereas in DbD, it’s much more action oriented, and sitting still will likely get you nowhere fast. Our challenge became finding a way to get those two things to coalesce. It came down to identifying what creates that incredible tension in Five Nights and Freddy’s and adapting it into a dynamic format for our own game.”</p><p>Behavior Interactive has built out an expansive roster of 39 killers and 46 survivors for Dead by Daylight. This includes original characters and a huge variety of other recognizable faces like Nicolas Cage, Hellraiser, the Demogorgon, and many more. It's a dream team of horror icons.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/shuhei-yoshida-says-sony-doesnt-really-consider-nintendo-as-competition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida is at it again, sharing thoughts and feelings about the gaming industry at large, including Nintendo. And this time, he's opened up on Sony's thoughts on Nintendo on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEdedQ9_zBQ&amp;ab_channel=Kit%26Krysta">Kit &amp; Krysta podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to the duo (thanks, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/06/17/shuhei-yoshida-says-playstation-only-really-views-nintendo-as-competition-in-japan/">My Nintendo News</a>!), Yoshida — who shares that he got "so many inspirations from Nintendo's games — admits that Sony's "perception of the competition" is focused on Xbox. At least, that's the case internationally (from around <a href="https://youtu.be/fEdedQ9_zBQ?si=JlW2oj_Z3J1jsVHi&amp;t=509">08:28</a>).</p>
<p>Yoshida puts this down to the similarities in hardware and performance for Xbox and Sony, and Nintendo focusing on "family-friendly" stuff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[Sony] see Microsoft being the competition because Xbox is very similar – performance, hardware. Like a high-end console, mature games and Nintendo is very, very different. Nintendo is family-friendly, games for everyone, and not about technology, it’s more about having fun with friends and family and always have multiple controllers, bundled with the hardware.</p>
<p>Inside Sony, even when they do a business analysis, Nintendo doesn't show up, so there's a competition market share between PlayStation and Xbox, and they don't include Nintendo. Not that they're ignoring Nintendo, but that they do not necessarily feel Nintendo is competition because Nintendo is covering a different audience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yoshida is full of praise for the Kyoto-based company throughout the podcast, saying that "we all think it's great to have Nintendo continue to be successful so that we can continue to grow the industry together".</p>
<p>But there is one market where, unsurprisingly, Sony <em>does</em> consider Nintendo as fierce competition: Japan. You've seen it on the weekly Japanese Charts where Nintendo Switch games (and now Switch 2 games) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/japanese-charts-capcom-fighting-collection-2-brawls-its-way-to-the-top">regularly</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/japanese-charts-fantasy-life-i-caps-off-the-switch-1-with-a-big-win">dominate</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">sales numbers</a>, so we're not surprised to hear the now-retired SIE Worldwide Studios president say this.</p>
<p>Yoshida-san talks about the perception in a bit more detail here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In Japan Nintendo is hugely strong, and Xbox almost doesn’t exist... I should be careful I may get hate messages! It's very hard to see where Xbox is, even though PC gaming is becoming a bit more popular in Japan.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>But it’s all about Nintendo versus Sony. So PlayStation people working in Japan see Nintendo clearly as competition, but outside Japan, PlayStation people clearly see Xbox as a primary competition.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there's nothing <em>too</em> surprising going on here — Nintendo is doing its own thing, absolutely dominating in Japan, while Sony is doing well elsewhere and competing with Xbox for the big powerhouse market share worldwide.</p>
<p>But the Switch 2 seems to be doing pretty darn well in its early days, so maybe Sony will need to reconsider? The new console has sold <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">3.5 million units in just four days worldwide</a>, and nearly a million of those are from Japan — at least <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">according to Famitsu's figures</a>.</p>
<p><em>You can watch the full interview up top, but let us know what you think of Yoshida's comments down below.</em></p>

That’s fun! Now let’s check the internet to see how people are reacting to the Direct... oh...oh no. Way too many of you care about <em>Donkey Kong/Mario</em> lore!

As a result, I’m very excited to play <em>Bananza</em>. It looks awesome, letting DK punch and destroy everything. It also co-stars a young Pauline, who is DK’s companion in the game, riding on his shoulder and using her singing ability to help the big ape solve puzzles and destroy more stuff. I think that inclusion alone wouldn’t have broken too many people’s brains, but at one point in the Direct we briefly see Donkey Kong and young Pauline interact with Cranky Kong. And that has caused <em>chaos</em> among Nintendo lore nerds.</p><figure id="" data-id="349d77c430ac9deebe35516ebaf943a8" data-recommend-id="image://349d77c430ac9deebe35516ebaf943a8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Screenshot of YouTube comments debating DK Bananza's place in the lore.

So seeing Pauline as a child hanging out with an aged Cranky Kong makes it hard for wiki editors and super fans to figure out how to connect <em>Bananza </em>to the other <em>Mario </em>and <em>Donkey Kong</em> games.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/YVUidGTR8xg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/YVUidGTR8xg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over on YouTube</a></span>, there are literally hundreds of comments from many people debating how to make the lore work. </p><p>Some speculate that <em>Bananza</em> is retconning the original game.

Some <em>DK / Mario</em> purists are denouncing the game as non-canonical. Some think Pauline is actually Pauline’s daughter. Still others are expecting this to be a prequel to <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and it will reveal the origins of New Donk City, where we meet an adult Mayor Pauline. </p><figure id="" data-id="f24fe3227c84434922a4e159de77b53c" data-recommend-id="image://f24fe3227c84434922a4e159de77b53c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a huge comment about DK lore.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I found one YouTube comment that was over 1,300 words long and dug deep into the canonical <em>Mario </em>and<em> Donkey Kong</em> games and <em>Bananza’s </em>place in that timeline and the problems it creates.</p><h2 id="h1059725"><a id=""></a>How A Young Pauline Can Meet Cranky Kong In <em>Bananza</em></h2><p>I want to help you all. So, here’s the answer you’ve been looking for. Here’s why and how Pauline, as a kid, is talking to Cranky Kong. You ready? Here you go: Nintendo doesn’t care about lore and just wants to make fun games. That’s it. Simple as that. </p><p>And honestly, that’s so nice. I love it so much. Truly, Nintendo devs couldn’t care less about canon, timelines, and <em>Donkey Kong</em> lore. They just make great games that make you smile. The company doesn’t let decades of backstory impede its ability to be creative and do new things. Pauline is a kid in this game because the people making <em>Bananza</em> thought it would be a fun idea, and Nintendo agreed. </p><p>Besides, the <em>Donkey Kong</em> lore is a mess anyway. Cranky Kong’s appearance in the Direct is seen by many as a smoking gun that reveals <em>Bananza</em> to be a reboot or a time travel story. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mariowiki.com/Cranky_Kong#Identity_confusion:~:text=Rareware%20initially%20created,List%20of%20appearances&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Cranky_Kong#Identity_confusion:~:text=Rareware%20initially%20created,List%20of%20appearances" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But on the <em>Mario</em> Wiki page for Cranky, you’ll find a nearly 800-word section</a></span> about how his connection to Donkey Kong has never been consistent. Sometimes he’s DK’s grandpa, sometimes he’s DK’s dad, sometimes he might not even be related. Sometimes Nintendo has acknowledged this nonsense; other times, they just treat the current Donkey Kong as the sole big ape that long ago kidnapped Pauline. None of this has <em>ever </em>been nailed down consistently, and acting like it has is silly!</p><p>Look, I get it. I love <em>Star Wars</em> lore. I get nerdy about it, too. I’m not trying to say people can’t have fun. But far too many of the comments I’ve seen about this <em>Bananza</em> lore debate seem to be taking it far too seriously, as if Nintendo is vindictively shitting on Rare’s legacy. That doesn’t make sense considering all the references to Rare’s<em> DK Country </em>games included in the Direct. </p><p>The thing about lore is that it’s fun to ponder and discuss, but it should never be allowed to completely derail anyone’s ability to tell a new story or make something cool with classic characters. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> seems like a blast. Don’t let the lore get in the way of that. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Yesterday, Microsoft confirmed that it's not abandoning the home console market just yet. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOCtRanwXrA">a short video teaser</a>, Xbox President Sarah Bond highlighted a "strategic multi-year partnership with AMD" that will include "our next-generation Xbox consoles in your living room and in your hands." But while we know that the "in your hands" part will include devices <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">like the Windows-powered ROG Xbox Ally</a>, there are still few specifics about what exactly Microsoft has planned for its future living room consoles (aside from what Bond calls "the next generation of graphics innovation").</p>
<p>Reading between the lines a bit, though, we wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft was getting ready to finally tear down the thinning wall separating gaming PCs and gaming consoles. A Windows-based, living room-focused Xbox capable of running generic Windows games could accentuate Microsoft's strengths in PC gaming while papering over many of the company's recent struggles in the home console market.</p>
<h2>WindowsBox</h2>
<p>The once-bright line separating PC gaming and TV-based console gaming has been deteriorating for years. On the hardware side, bespoke console chips and development environments long ago gave way to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps4-pc-like-architecture-8gb-ram-delight-developers">PC-like architectures</a> that are simpler and easier for developers to work with. And on the PC interface side, efforts like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/steam-comes-to-the-living-room-tv-with-big-picture-mode-beta/">Steam's Big Picture mode</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/steamos/">SteamOS as a whole</a> have strived to make playing on a PC with a handheld controller into a more console-like experience.</p>
<figure>
    <div id="caption-2099650"><p>
              If handheld players would dig this kind of Windows gaming experience, why not home console players?

      If handheld players would dig this kind of Windows gaming experience, why not home console players?

<p>Last week's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">announcement of the Asus Xbox ROG Ally</a> shows that Microsoft is leaning into this merger. The Windows 11-powered device promises to replace Windows' desktop icons and taskbar with a new full-screen "Xbox Experience for Handheld." The company says this will "minimize background activity and defer non-essential tasks" that take up RAM and computing resources on a full desktop Windows OS. That interface won't be exclusive to Asus' handheld, either; Microsoft has said it will <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/full-screen-xbox-handheld-ui-is-coming-to-all-windows-pcs-starting-next-year/">start rolling out to other Windows devices "starting next year."</a></p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>It's not ridiculous to think that the next Xbox console could be one of those Windows devices. A living-room-focused box running a modified version of that Xbox Experience for Handhelds (call it the "Xbox Experience for Consoles," if you like) would give living room gamers instant access to tens of thousands of games designed for Windows—plus thousands more coming out each year—with an interface and form factor familiar to living room gamers. That kind of software library would give a Windows-based Xbox an instant leg up on the more limited selection of ports available on competing consoles, especially if it also "maintains compatibility with your existing library of Xbox games," as Bond promised.</p>
<p>While Microsoft would likely build its own Windows-based Xbox hardware, it could also license its new console-ified Windows gaming interface to other hardware manufacturers interested in similar living room hardware. Microsoft is well-positioned to run a redo of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">Valve's abortive Steam Machines effort</a>, only this time without the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/ars-benchmarks-show-significant-performance-hit-for-steamos-gaming/">performance headaches</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/02/the-state-of-linux-gaming-in-the-steamos-era/">limited library of Linux ports</a> that plagued that effort.</p>
<p>True, a Windows-based Xbox console would mean Microsoft giving up the ability to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/as-epic-attacks-apple-and-google-it-ignores-the-same-problems-on-consoles/">charge third-party developers a 30 percent fee</a> for the privilege of offering software on its current walled-garden console marketplace. And competing gaming PC manufacturers that currently partner with Microsoft might not be too happy with the Windows-maker encroaching on their space. But that all might be worth it to help cement Windows—and, in turn, Microsoft—as a central part of the home console gaming space.</p>

<h2>Reviving the brand</h2>
<p>A Windows-powered living room Xbox is just the kind of thing Microsoft needs to turn around its struggling home console brand. The Xbox One was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/report-ps4-has-now-sold-roughly-2-5-times-as-well-as-the-xbox-one/">outsold handily by Sony's PS4</a>, and sales of the Xbox Series S/X hardware <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/xbox-console-sales-continue-to-crater-with-massive-42-revenue-drop/">have been cratering</a> in recent years. Seemingly acknowledging this, Microsoft has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-says-its-taking-four-unnamed-xbox-games-to-the-other-consoles/">started offering previous Xbox console exclusives</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/we-run-a-business-why-microsofts-indiana-jones-will-be-on-ps5/">other platforms</a>, giving up the potential of system-selling exclusive games for the prospect of more software licensing fees.</p>

<p>On the PC side, though, Microsoft is still a force to be reckoned with. Practically every desktop or laptop gaming PC runs Windows by default, despite <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/intensely-demanding-aaa-game-cyberpunk-2077-is-coming-to-the-mac/">half-hearted</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/gaming-on-apple-platforms-is-set-for-some-big-changes-here-are-a-few/">efforts</a> by Apple to turn MacOS into a serious gaming platform. And while Valve's Linux-based SteamOS has created <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc">a significant handheld gaming PC niche</a>—and is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-return-of-steam-machines-valve-rolls-out-new-powered-by-steamos-branding/">hinting at attempts to push into the gaming desktop space</a>—it does so only through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">a Proton compatibility layer</a>&nbsp;built on top of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/way-more-game-makers-are-working-on-pc-titles-than-ever-survey-says/">strong developer interest in Windows gaming</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft is already highlighting its software advantage over SteamOS, promoting the Xbox Experience for Handhelds' "aggregated game library" that can provide "access to games you can't get elsewhere" through multiple Windows-based game launchers. There's no reason to think that living room console players wouldn't also be interested in that kind of no-compromise access to the full suite of Windows gaming options.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been preparing the Xbox brand for this ultimate merger between PC and console gaming for years, too. While the name "Xbox" was once synonymous with Microsoft's console gaming efforts, that hasn't been true since the launch of "Xbox on Windows 10" <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/08/xbox-on-windows-10-what-it-is-what-it-isnt-and-whats-missing/">in 2015</a> and the subsequent Windows Xbox app.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, offerings like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/xbox-play-anywhere-buy-the-game-once-play-on-xbox-one-and-pc-multiplayer-too/">Microsoft's "Play Anywhere" initiative</a> and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/xbox-game-pass-is-coming-to-windows-10-but-many-questions-remain/">Xbox Game Pass for PC</a> have gotten players used to purchases and subscriptions giving them access to games on both Xbox consoles and Windows PCs (not to mention cloud streaming to devices like smartphones). If your living room Xbox console simply played Windows games directly (along with your Windows-based handheld gaming PC), this sort of "Play Anywhere" promise becomes that much simpler to pull off without any need for porting effort from developers.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of thoughts that ran through my mind when I heard Bond say yesterday that Xbox is "working closely with the Windows team to ensure that Windows is the number one platform for gaming" while "building you a gaming platform that's always with you so you can play the games you want across devices anywhere you want, delivering you an Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device." That could simply be the kind of cross-market pablum <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/xbox-chief-we-want-to-regain-trust-more-than-we-want-to-beat-sony/">we're used to hearing from Microsoft</a>. Or it could be a hint of a new world where Microsoft finally fully leverages its Windows gaming dominance into a new vision for a living room Xbox console.</p>

                <p>Today, PlayStation has launched Climate Station, an interactive app for PS5 and PSVR 2 designed to help educate users on the effects of climate change. Using real-world scientific data and produced in collaboration with research and policymaking organizations, Climate Station aims to make knowledge about meteorological systems and human-driven impacts more accessible to wider audiences.</p><p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/18/climate-station-launches-today-on-ps5-and-ps-vr2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, PlayStation shared that the app provides a number of different experiences to allow users to dive into different aspects of the global climate. Weather Year, for instance, uses global weather data to create a model of the Earth complete with a year's worth of storms, weather patterns, wildfires, sea-ice changes, human behavior, and other events. Climate Station also surfaces historic observations about global temperature, greenhouse-gas emissions, and sea level, in addition to visualizing projections for the next 75 years as produced by scientific models.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZatuxtL47Cc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZatuxtL47Cc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>PlayStation developed this app with an internal team in collaboration with the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading, Berkeley Earth, and the Playing for the Planet Alliance. It uses public data and research from the United Nations' International Panel on Climate Change, and the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</p><p>Climate Station is an important effort to address one of the core challenges to making meaningful progress in mitigating climate change's harmful effects. Climate change is a complex, non-linear process with impacts that differ across time and space, making communication and education time-consuming and expensive. Further complicating matters, the scientific community's understanding of anthropogenic (human-driven) climate change has evolved significantly over the past 50 years. This discrepancy between scientific consensus and popular narratives can drive distrust and conflicts with climate science, disrupting vital efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and, eventually, mitigate and reverse the effects of our rapidly warming world.</p><p>In addition, despite <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/scientific-consensus/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">overwhelming scholarly consensus</a> and <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/reports" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">consistent evidence</a> from <a href="https://antarcticrcc-network.org/climate-monitoring/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">worldwide research projects</a>, fundamental topics such as the existence of and threat posed by climate change have been repeatedly targeted by political polarization. The opposition to, marginalization of, and rejection of scholarly consensus and scientific research risks impeding or reversing climate-change mitigation. For example, the United States government has recently taken action to dismantle its climate change research capacity, including by <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/02/1117653/the-trump-administration-has-shut-down-more-than-100-climate-studies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">axing dozens of previously awarded grants</a>, removing <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/usda-orders-removal-climate-change-mentions-public-websites/story?id=118312216" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mentions of climate change from public websites</a>, and proposing <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-seeks-end-climate-research-premier-u-s-climate-agency" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the elimination of climate research labs at NOAA and NASA</a>.</p><p>PlayStation's creation of Climate Station presents one possible way to bring more dynamic, scientifically oriented, and engaging education to the broader public, but it may itself be vulnerable to the dismantling of climate science. As stated on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002901/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its product page</a>, and like countless other educational projects, Climate Station relies on data provided by NOAA and NASA. This data has long been collected and published as a public service by these agencies, but this may not continue, as <a href="https://nsidc.org/data/user-resources/data-announcements/user-notice-level-service-update-data-products" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some NOAA and NASA monitoring programs have already been cut</a>.</p><p>For now, Climate Station is operational and an amazingly detailed resource for people interested in learning more about our world. It is also provided completely free, giving an accessible entry point into climate science, as long as you have a PS5. You can download it through <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002901/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the PlayStation Store</a> right now.</p>

            <p>
Everybody loves palpating their turnips; just look at the success of Stardew Valley and its ilk for proof of that. But it turns out people <em>really</em> love some vegetable action, if the staggering success of Roblox game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grow-a-garden">Grow a Garden</a> is any indication, given it's seemingly smashed through <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s previous gargantuan record for most players at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Let's break out some numbers. According to <a href="https://romonitorstats.com/experience/126884695634066/">third-party monitoring tools</a>, Grow a Garden - the specifics of which we'll get to shortly - soared past 16m concurrent players this weekend on Roblox (16,411,769 to be exact). By way of comparison, Fortnite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-showstopping-marvel-finale-drops-a-huge-cliffhanger">announced record-breaking concurrents of 15.3m players</a> during its Marvel season finale event back in Covid-era 2020.
</p>
<p>
So what, you may be wondering, has garnered all this attention? Grow a Garden is, according to its <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/126884695634066/Grow-a-Garden">official description</a> from developer The Garden Game, very much what it sounds like. It's a game of buying seeds, shoving them in the ground, then waiting for your blueberries, coconuts, daffodils etc. to grow - which they'll happily do whether you're in-game or offline.
</p>
<p>
After that, you can sell your massive produce for profit, purchasing more seeds or temporary boosts you'll need to slowly craft in real-time, then start the whole cycle over again. Frankly, absolutely nothing about it sounds like the sort of thing that might capture the imagination of 16m players all at once, but then I'm not a 13-year-old looking to do something mindless online with my friends after school. Also, there're <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-grow-a-garden-pets-eggs-how-to-get">Grow a Garden pets</a>, so maybe that's the appeal.
</p>
<p>
As to how Grow a Garden's impressive 16m concurrent users stacks up with other games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> currently holds the Steam record for most concurrent players, coming in at a comparatively paltry 3.3m, while it's nearest rival, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, barely squeaks over the 2.4m player threshold. In fact, Steam itself recently saw a concurrent high of 40m players, so Grow a Garden's 16m looks positively gargantuan given we're talking about a single game.
</p>
<p>
Whether all those players <em>should</em> be playing Roblox is another matter entirely, of course, given the game continues to be embroiled in controversy amid ongoing accusations of child safety failures. Developer Roblox Corporation last year announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-announces-policy-changes-for-pre-teen-users-amid-ongoing-accusations-of-child-safety-failures">sweep of policy changes</a> - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adding-further-parental-controls-as-its-belated-push-to-improve-child-safety-continues">updated parental controls</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-banning-social-hangouts-for-kids-under-13-due-to-user-behaviour-that-can-potentially-pose-a-risk">banning of social hangouts</a> for children under 13 - in a belated effort to improve things. Currently, Roblox Corporation is being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-under-investigation-by-the-us-securities-and-exchange-commission">investigated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, possibly due to reports it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">previously misled investors by inflating player numbers</a>, although the reason hasn't been made public.

<p>A new month, a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> Booster Pack. That's a saying, right? It should be, because on 26th June 2025, we're getting another themed pack, and this time, it's all about Eevee.</p>
<p>Eevee Grove will be focusing on the adorable brown fluffy Pokémon and its eight evolutions — Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Espeon, Umbreon, Glaceon, Leafeon, and Sylveon. Depending on your timezone, this is when the pack will be available to rip open over and over:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 11pm (Wed) PDT / 12am MDT / 1am CDT / 2am EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 7am BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 8am CEST / 9am EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 3pm JST / 2pm AWST / 4pm AEST</li></ul><p><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>These are fan-favourite 'mons, so we're sure lots of you will be very happy and scrambling to get some of those beautiful cards (Espeon and Umbreon are two of this writer's favourites, so she's considering a redownload right now...).</p>
<p>While many of the cards make a brief appearance in the trailer up top, we've got a more detailed look at a handful of them, including an ex, from <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/its-a-cuteness-overload-in-pokemon-tcg-pockets-upcoming-eevee-grove-expansion">the official website</a>.</p>

<p>The cards aren't the only star of the update, either. Soon enough, a new binder cover and display board will also be available, featuring all nine of the Eevee family.</p>
<p>This Booster Pack follows on from last month's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-booster-pack-is-all-about-ultra-beasts">Ultra Beast-themed one</a>, which will still be around — just that Eevee is stealing the spotlight for now.</p>

			<p>Beat Saber developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/facebook-acquires-beat-saber-studio-says-this-is-just-the-beginning/">Beat Games</a> has announced that it will no longer be releasing new Beat Saber content for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 versions of the game, which are essentially the PSVR and PS VR2 versions.</p>
<p>The game will still be available to purchase, and any already purchased content for those who already own the game and a litany of songs for it will still be able to play everything they've bought, but June 18, 2025, (which is today's date) is the final date for new content for Beat Saber on PS5 and PS4. Lady Gaga's <em>Abracadabra</em> will be the final song to be added to the Beat Saber library on PlayStation.</p>
<p>"<em>As we look to the future and plan the next big leap for Beat Saber, we have made the decision to no longer release updates for PS4 and PS5 starting in June 2025,</em>" Beat Games began in a statement published to the <a href="https://x.com/BeatSaber/status/1935314587240276467">Beat Saber X account</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Our passion for VR remains unwavering. We are excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and what we can bring to Beat Saber fans who have been on this journey with us over the past 7 years</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We're grateful for the incredible support you've shown us over the years, and we're excited to share what the future holds for Beat Saber.</em>"</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>While no new content will be available for the game on PS5 and PS4 after today, players on PlayStation will still be able to play multiplayer from now until <strong>January 21, 2026.&nbsp;</strong>After that, multiplayer will no longer be available to PS5 and PS4 players.</p>
<p>For so many VR enthusiasts, Beat Saber has been the must-buy game with each new headset that has been released since the game first launched in 2018. It's arguably the most popular and recognizable VR game ever, and it only came to PlayStation's current generation of VR headset, the PS VR2, two short years ago in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/beat-saber-launches-on-ps-vr2-today-with-new-queen-music-pack/">May 2023</a>.</p>
<p>It's been no secret that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-vr2-production-reportedly-paused-until-sony-sells-current-backlog/">things aren't going amazingly well for PlayStation's VR efforts</a>, and it definitely isn't a good sign that what is arguably the most significant VR game to-date is turning away from the PS VR2 so quickly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/686651/roottrees-ai-original-illustrator-replacement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Robin Ward was recovering from a broken arm when he fell in love with <em>The Roottrees are Dead</em>, a free browser game hosted on itch.io, an indie games salesfront. He reached out to its creator, Jeremy Johnston, and told him, “This should be a bigger deal than it is.” At the same time, Ward says, he “knew why” it couldn’t be.</p><p>The browser version of <em>The Roottrees are Dead</em> used AI-generated art for its images, a central part of the puzzle game that tasks players with investigating dozens of people and filling out its complex family tree. At the time, Steam, the biggest platform for PC games, did not allow the use of generative AI in games released using the storefront. In addition, Ward and Johnston agreed that they felt it was “unethical to sell artwork created in this way.”</p><p>Johnston had originally released the game for free, despite spending 11 months building it up from what was originally a Global Game Jam project cobbled together in less than a week in 2023. In the jam’s tight time constraints, and in a time before generative AI was quite so well known, he reached out to a friend who was “super into” using Midjourney and asked if he’d be willing to generate images based on prompts he had come up with for his puzzles.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Left: the original AI-generated artwork with a photographic style. Right: the illustrated replacement.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The images were far from perfect. Both Johnston and Ward point out a warped, staring image of a young girl in the original version of the game (<a href="https://jjohnstongames.itch.io/the-roottrees-are-dead">which is still available for free</a>) — Ward calls it “demonic.” Other portraits have the twisted hands that were a telltale giveaway of generative AI at the time.</p><p>But despite expanding the game for almost a year, adding to the story and puzzle aspects, Johnston says he “never really thought” to replace the art. Not being an artist himself, he was focused on the photographic quality of the existing artwork, and he knew he would never be able to afford to hire models and a cameraperson to recreate it.</p><p>And although he was putting a lot of work into the expanded version, he wasn’t expecting the reaction it would eventually get. “I’ve released other things — not games, necessarily, but things that I spent a lot of time and energy on, and then they came out and no one cared,” he says. So although he spent a lot of time on <em>Roottrees</em>, he did not want to invest money he was never expecting to get back.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Left: a particularly cursed AI-generated child. Right: the vastly improved illustrated replacement.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>When he did release the itch.io version of <em>Roottrees</em>, though, it was surprisingly popular. It spread on forums and Reddit, and it received some attention in the games press. He did not charge for it, on account of the AI artwork, although he did include a donation link and says he made around $2,000-$3,000 from more than 10,000 players.</p><p>And one of those players was Ward. After reaching out to Johnston, they agreed that Ward would reprogram the game and hire an illustrator to replace the AI artwork and get it ready for a Steam release. The illustrator he brought on, Henning Ludvigsen, says he used the AI art as a kind of concept sketch. Ludvigsen then did his own research into the era and style the picture was supposed to evoke, eventually making almost 40 illustrations across nearly a year of work.</p><p>“I’m not a big fan of generative AI,” he says, saying his peers in the illustration industry have seen a reduction in work, particularly concept artists. “[Companies] kind of skip that step now [using AI], which I think is not great.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Left: a composite AI illustration of the Roottrees. Right: Ludvigsen could create more consistent characters who actually look like they’re in the same world.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>When it comes to finished products, though, he still sees generative AI as “not doing that well in general” among players. Large video game companies like Take Two Interactive have noted that players tend to not only avoid games that use AI but also react negatively to them online and in ratings,<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/take-two-review-bombs-gta-nfl-2k"> calling it</a> a potential avenue for “loss of players, revenues…and reputation harm.” Johnston mentions the case of Cyan Worlds, the developer behind Myst,<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/firmament-ai-generated-content/"> receiving backlash</a> for using “AI assisted content” like texture assets in its latest game.</p><p><em>The Roottrees are Dead</em> seemed to skirt these issues by being transparent about its use upfront, as well as releasing for free, Johnston says. Ward also points out that “in this case, it’s the case of ‘there would be no game’ versus ‘there is a game.’” Johnston agrees that without the use of AI-generated artwork, the initial version would never have been released, meaning the eventual full version with Ludvigsen’s work in it would also never have existed. Ludvigsen himself says he “really enjoyed” replacing the illustrations, given he’s “not a big fan of” AI art generation in general. </p><p>“I think some people would say, ‘Well, I would prefer that there is no game in this case,’ and I think they’re entitled to their opinion,” Ward says, citing the<a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/ai-has-environmental-problem-heres-what-world-can-do-about"> environmental concerns</a> and the scrapping of artists’ work for training corpuses as potential arguments for that approach. “But I ended up playing something that I really loved,” he says. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>Left: the AI-generated original. Right: the illustrated version more clearly reflects the setting of the photograph.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The game was released on Steam in January 2025. “The vast majority of people are like, ‘I’m very happy you got rid of the AI,’” Ward says. Although some have said they prefer the more photographic quality of the generated art, Ludvigsen’s work is undeniably an upgrade, from the untwisted fingers to the increased consistency in design for characters who appear in multiple photographs, which makes some puzzles more understandable.</p><p><em>The Roottrees are Dead </em>is now a critical and commercial success, which would not have happened without both generative AI and a human artist. Both Ward and Johnston note that the game took an unusual route to its current state. But with the increasing prevalence of AI tools, it’s possible more games will end up on the same path.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
