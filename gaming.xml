            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition</link>
            <guid>1384882</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>I'm not sure how many times I've played through the opening hours of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, but it's a lot, and it's been across a long period of time via various platforms.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that I've experienced this all-timer during phases of janky performance, and whilst it's a game that still shines, no matter the technical issues at hand, it's one that's all the more dreamy when it runs well and is, most importantly, easy to parse at all times.</p>
<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a busy old thing in how it utilises every inch of your screen to convey info about everything that's going on at any given time, you see. There's a lot to digest, and having a nice crisp resolution, coupled with a frame rate that's smooth, really brings it all home as a remarkable achievement in gaming that everyone should dive into.</p>
<p>I gave the Switch 1 port a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">9/10 in my review of that version back in 2019</a>, remarking that "beyond a quite understandable drop in resolution and texture quality, this is [...] running at a solid and dependable 30fps". Ah, yes, that's right, this one already ran surprisingly well, so we're on easy street. Sort of.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:91617 @ 1765904262 -->
<p>Yes, we can put an end to a streak of properly awful Switch 2 ports (that's right, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a>, I am talking about you guys) by rejoicing in the fact that Larian has delivered a free update that, whilst bare-bones, gives us a much-improved experience overall. And that's what actually matters.</p>
<p>Whilst it's definitely a disappointment that we've only got 30fps in portable, and with no mouse mode added in to boot (I mean...why?!), the handheld 30fps here <em>is</em> the smooth-feeling sort, and it's also not the type of game that critically needs to be at 60fps, at the end of the day.</p>
<p>In docked mode, it does now hit 60fps, though. Hooray! And it's stuck resolutely to 60fps throughout all of my time playing. It also — thanks to a resolution bump to 1080p — looks way clearer on-screen whilst benefitting from some lighting and shadow touch-ups. Oh, and loading times, thankfully, are way down here, so that's a very nice bonus. These are meaningful quality-of-life upgrades for players who've grown accustomed to long waits and blurry visuals on Switch 1 or anyone who's likely to pump a lot of time into this gem in the near future.</p>
<p>And so, overall, whilst this <em>is</em> as bare bones as these things get, it is free if you own the game already, and you can't argue that it ain't prettier, crisper, and better to play now, can you? Also, given that it's an all-timer for all times, well, they get away with it.</p>
<p>Now, where's Baldur's Gate 3? Didn't you guys know <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/xbox-series-x/baldurs-gate-3">I gave that a 10?</a> Make with the mind-flayers already.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty 2027 Will Introduce New Sub-Series Set In Late 90s/Early 00s, Says Leaker]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2027-introduce-new-sub-series-says-leaker/</link>
            <guid>1384879</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's no secret that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/">has not been the big blockbuster hit that Activision expects</a> from its marquee series every year. Its release has gone so poorly that Activision has <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">even promised to change how it approaches future releases in the series</a> to avoid what happened this year. At this point, something new, something that's not Black Ops or Modern Warfare, feels like what the series needs to survive, and according to X (formerly Twitter) user GhostOfHope, that's what we're getting with Call of Duty 2027.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/2000945365055394031">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, GhostOfHope, who has proven to be a reliable source of leaks regarding Call of Duty, claimed that the 2027 game will be made by Sledgehammer Games and that it will introduce a new sub-series to the annual shooter franchise. That means that, according to GhostOfHope, whatever the 2027 Call of Duty game is, it won't be a new entry in either the Modern Warfare or Black Ops sub-series of games.</p>



<p>A new sub-series also means a new set of characters, and a new setting, as this game is reportedly set sometime between the late 90s and early 00s. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>EXCLUSIVE: COD2027 made by Sledgehammer Games will be a new sub franchise with completely new characters set in the late 1990s/early 2000s. </p><p>- Omnimovement with NO Tac Sprint is currently planned for the game</p><p>- Pick 10 returning is a big discussion happening</p><p>- Zombies… <a href="https://t.co/2SbZ4ZlfVk">pic.twitter.com/2SbZ4ZlfVk</a></p></div>— Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/2000945365055394031?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The leaker also claims that this new entry will include some major gameplay changes, as it'll feature omnimovement but with no tactical sprint, but perhaps the biggest change claimed by GhostOfHope is that the 2027 game may not feature a Zombies mode at all.</p>



<p>Right now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">considering how stagnant Call of Duty has felt over the last few years</a>, even with recent releases having bright spots that some players might point to, all of this makes it sound like we're in for a very different kind of game in 2027. But with how formulaic the series already is, it's difficult to imagine Activision and its studios straying too far from what's been proven to be successful.</p>



<p>We'll see how it all shakes out, especially after how next year's Call of Duty game goes. At this point, Activision has no choice but to stick with what it already has planned for 2026, unless it wants to try skipping a year for the first time in over a decade of Call of Duty games being annual releases. It'll be interesting, to say the least, to see how players react to next year's game, and how much actually gets changed in 2027. In the meantime, we can all keep playing Battlefield 6.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/larian-divinity-turn-based</link>
            <guid>1384876</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Larian Studios has revealed more information about its upcoming <em>Divinity </em>game, and if you were worried that the studio would deviate from its recent spate of turn-based RPG successes, then worry no more.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, Larian head Swen Vincke confirms that the new <em>Divinity </em>game, which was revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">during the Game Awards last week</a> (and which still doesn't have an official title), will be a turn-based RPG.</p><p>Vincke also says that the game will represent his studio "unleashed", and that it'll feature many of the hallmarks you've come to expect from a Larian game "brought to the next level". I expect that means plenty of reactivity, lots of options in combat, and a dizzying amount of content in general.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Don't worry: Larian's new <em>Divinity </em>game won't betray the studio's turn-based strengths.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Boldly, Vincke says he believes that the studio's new <em>Divinity </em>game will be "way better" than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-has-way-over-10-million-players-mod-support-has-been-in-works-since" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6faddb2-01d3-46aa-a769-c7be021e6a4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">phenomenally successful <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Schreier, Vincke and Larian were originally intending to work on a new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>RPG with Wizards of the Coast before realizing there was no enthusiasm for such a project, hence the pivot to <em>Divinity</em>.</p><p>Vincke says that Larian wants to finish the new <em>Divinity </em>in less time than it took the studio to release <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>; he says that "three to four years is much healthier than six years", so it sounds like that's about as long as you can expect to wait for the game to launch.</p><p>Perhaps controversially, Larian is also using generative AI to make the new <em>Divinity </em>game. Vincke is quick to assert that <em>Divinity</em>'s actual content won't be AI-generated, but that the studio is using the technology for concept art, placeholder text, and exploring ideas during development.</p>
<p>Reassuringly, though, Vincke concludes by saying he intends to use the money generated by <em>Baldur's Gate 3 </em>for more experimentation and expansion in <em>Divinity</em>. He says the game will do "a couple of things that you haven’t seen in RPGs before".</p><p>We'll have to wait and see what Larian is intending to do with <em>Divinity</em>; we're probably a ways away from even a full reveal, let alone a release date. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie has announced a new release window for upcoming extraction shooter reboot <em>Marathon</em>, and we now know how much you can expect to pay for the game if you decide to pick it up as well.</p><p>In a new <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> entitled "Vision of <em>Marathon</em>", Bungie says that the game will launch in March 2026, although the studio stops short of committing to a specific date. When it arrives, you'll be paying $40 for it upfront.</p><p>Buying <em>Marathon </em>will give you "full access to the game", Bungie says, which means you'll get a slew of free updates that bring new maps, new Runner shells, and new gameplay elements, plus more.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Additionally, Bungie says it wants to make sure players log into <em>Marathon </em>because they "love the game", rather than because they're afraid of missing out.</p><p>That means previous seasons' battle passes will always be available for purchase, so you won't miss any rewards you're looking forward to. You can also rest assured that <em>Marathon </em>won't have any pay-to-win elements; Bungie says it wants to "preserve competitive integrity" in the game.</p><p>The blog post was accompanied by a more in-depth video development diary in which Bungie delves into some of the improvements it's made since <em>Marathon</em>'s last alpha test, including solo queues, proximity voice chat, and changes to the flow of gameplay to make things smoother.</p><p>You can check out that full video diary, which goes into some detail regarding <em>Marathon</em>'s maps, loot and progression systems, and more, right here.</p>
<p><em>Marathon </em>hasn't exactly had the best time of things since its announcement.

The QA team will also be moved to <em>Dead Island 3 </em>once <em>Dead Island 2</em>'s "Luna and Mac versions are complete".</p><p>According to the financial report, <em>Dead Island 3 </em>is in the early stages of development right now; "feature, character, world, and story design" are "moving at pace", Dambuster says.

<p><em>Dead Island 2 </em>had a lengthy and protracted development, which is probably partly why Dambuster wants to reassure fans that <em>Dead Island 3 </em>is very much in the works.</p><p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/e3-2014-dead-island-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a81e91d7-4004-4de5-ae3c-8bc56962c3e8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">originally</a> being worked on by <em>Spec Ops: The Line </em>studio Yager, before publisher Deep Silver <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-silver-drops-developer-dead-island-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a179414a-bc53-4112-843d-eb6c1a63b510" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">parted ways with the developer</a> in 2015.

<p>Hopefully, <em>Dead Island 3 </em>won't suffer from the same issues that plagued its predecessor during development, and we'll be able to get our hands on what will presumably be another open-world zombie-slaying extravaganza sooner rather than later.</p><p>In the meantime, you can check out <em>Dead Island 2 </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/934700/Dead_Island_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2047-PPSA03098_00-DI2MAINSIEAPS500" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dead-island-2/C3L4J3H7H12R" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a>.

            <p>
Larian's new Divinity RPG should spend a lot less time in development than their previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> - or at least, that's the dream. CEO Swen Vincke wants the process to take "three to four years" in total, which seemingly includes an early access period. 
</p>
<p>
For context, we first heard that Larian were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">officially working on a new game</a> (two, actually) back in April 2024. Here, let me run those numbers through Rock Paper Shotgun's in-house Mirror of Fate. Gosh. Assuming I have performed the rituals correctly, that means Divinity will launch out of early access in 2027 or 2028. In less positive news, Larian are reportedly making limited internal use of generative AI for tasks such as concept art development and internal presentations.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Announced in 2019, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> took about six years to develop in entirety, but some of that is owing to delays from Covid lockdowns. Still, shaving off a couple of years while still aiming to deliver <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-reveal-a-new-divinity-rpg-that-boasts-greater-breadth-depth-than-ever-before">"greater breadth and depth than ever before"</a> is no small endeavour, even when you allow for the effects of the Covid pandemic.
</p>
<p>
"I think three to four years is much healthier than six years," Vincke told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">Bloomberg</a>'s Jason Schreier in a new interview, conducted just before Divinity's announcement at Geoff Fest last week. One way they're hoping to speed things up is to develop quests and storylines in parallel. For this, they're enlisting a lot more writers and scripters - Larian currently employ 530 people across seven locations, including their recently founded Warsaw studio.
</p><p>
That said, Vincke feels that "the creative process itself actually is something you cannot accelerate", telling Schreier that BG3 was a much better game for giving the developers time to explore concepts and bin things off. "People underestimate how many times we're implementing something and realize in the middle that it's just not going to work," he said.
</p>
<p>
The less salubrious side of all this is that Larian have apparently been "pushing hard on generative AI", in Schreier's phrase, using generative AI tools "to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text". 
</p>
<p>
According to Vincke, the developers aren't using generative AI to make things that appear in the finished game. "Everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves." Apparently, some Larian devs have resisted the introduction of AI tools, but Vincke says that "I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we're using it."</p>
<p>While Vincke doesn't make this connection in the Bloomberg piece, I imagine the automating of certain tasks is related to the desire to get Divinity out faster. Still, Schreier also paraphrases Vincke as saying that there have been no "big gains in efficiency" as a result of the AI push. The utility of generative AI in the workplace at large remain heavily <a href="https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity">disputed</a>, and the technology continues to be associated with <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117">spiking electricity consumption</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">the mass-production of clone art and misinformation</a> in the name of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">oligarchal profits</a>.
</p><p>AI-generated art tends to get referred to as "slop". There's certainly a lot of literal slop in the Divinity announcement trailer, below - it's full of mud, blood and sick, but we can seemingly rest assured that all of that was hand-puked by humans rather than projectile-vomited by a generative AI. Somebody please resurrect the screaming ghost of Jean-Paul Sartre to explain to me what kind of nausea I'm feeling. No, you are not allowed to generate a clone of Sartre using ChatGPT.</p>

<p>
Elsewhere in the chat, Vincke expresses anxiety about Larian's current scale (yet more of that hot, delicious context: unlike many larger publicly owned game companies, Larian have not carried out any mass layoffs in the past couple of years).</p>
<p>"I think a lot of founders have the same problem," he says. "I have to be large, otherwise I can't make my video game. With growth suddenly comes a whole bunch of responsibilities that you didn't necessarily think you were ever gonna have, but you have them and then you make the best of them. Size exposes you to new problems that you couldn't imagine existed."
</p><p>
I spoke to Vincke myself this week, focussing more on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-talk-divinity-their-next-rpg-after-baldurs-gate-3-its-almost-as-though-its-the-first-in-the-series">the direction of the new Divinity RPG</a>, while finding time for some hard-hitting reporting about Larian's blatant swinophobia. Amongst other things, he confirmed that it's a turn-based CRPG successor to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, with a world that skews darker than you'll find in Baldur's Gate 3.

            <p>I can't believe it either, your majesty. While outlining their plans for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> in the new year, Paradox have teased a major expansion by turning around and revealing a work-in-progress donkey. They've also spilled the beans on some of the tweaks coming with yet another "realm maintenance" update as part of this <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/dev-diary-191-2025-in-review.1888979/">year-end dev diary</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Following 2025's chapter four additions, which culminated with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-largest-ever-crusader-kings-3-expansion-takes-us-to-china-japan-and-southeast-asia-this-october">October's All Under Heaven DLC</a> extending the courtly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategising</a> into medieval China, Japan and Southeast Asia, 2026 will be the year of chapter five. As has become the norm, that means two more major expansions.</p>
<p>What're they about? Well, here's the main hint Paradox are offering, at least when it comes to one of the pair:</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Either your next kingdom's Far Far Away, or something involving trading/farming is afoot. "If 2025 was the year of going wide (Nomads, all of Asia) then 2026 will be a year of depth," the studio scrawled above their ass. "We’re going to go back and revisit some parts of the game that’ll deepen the overall game experience. Just like how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-sorry-for-all-the-dead-bodies-i-left-behind-while-walking-from-ireland-to-china-in-crusader-kings-3s-brilliant-new-dlc">Roads to Power</a> set the stage for All Under Heaven, the All Under Heaven expansion is setting the stage for this future content. There are some central areas of the game that we’ve been itching to improve for a long, long time now."</p><p>Alongside those add-ons, 2026'll see CK3 get another free "realm maintenance" update aimed at revamping existing areas of the game or enacting less urgent changes based on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-have-a-direct-impact-on-crusader-kings-3s-future-and-get-a-few-hints-to-where-the-grand-strategy-is-heading-next">player feedback</a>. This update's being aimed at a release "early in the second quarter of the year". Among its tweaks will be a retooling of accolades to make them more rewarding and easier to pass on to a knight's squire, while attributes being made clearer and there'll be "more agency" around earning them. Also, Paradox wrote, "Glory will get a bit of a revamp, so it is no longer lost when the knights die in battle (it’s their job after all, and dying in battle can be quite glorious in these times…)."</p>
<p>The studio then went off to show off how some of the interfaces around these changes will look, with some panels showing off more in-depth visualisation for the various story cycles your ruler can be wrapped up in. If you get a pet cat or dog, there'll also now be a tab where you can read a bio for them, detailing facts like their age, fur colour, and whether they're a good boy.</p>
<p>None of the pet info slides shown off suggest you can get a pet donkey once the mystery ass expansion drops, but there's still plenty of time for that to be rectified once the calendar flips to next year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Update Allows You To Reset Your Skill Tree—For a Price]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-reset-skill-tree-after-update/</link>
            <guid>1384846</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders players everywhere have been asking for a function to reset their skill trees since the game came out. Mostly, it was because they were working towards Security Breach before Embark Studios nerfed the ability, leaving them with stacks of skill points in a path they might not have otherwise picked.</p>



<p>Following the recent rollout of the Cold Snap update, Embark Studios has finally implemented a function that allows users to reset the skill points, but it comes with a fairly hefty cost.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-reset-your-skills-in-arc-raiders">How to Reset Your Skills in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>If you navigate to your Raider menu and check out your skills screen, you’ll see that there’s now a function to reset the paths you’ve chosen. With the press of a button, you can pull back all your assignments and restructure your build as you see fit, all without carrying out an Expedition.</p>



<p>This change comes with a sizeable cost.</p>



<p>You’ll need to pay 2,000 credits <strong>per skill</strong> to withdraw your entire build. Given that you can assign a maximum of 75 skill points in ARC Raiders, it’ll cost you 150,000 credits to respec your entire character.</p>



<p>At this point, that’s a drop in the water for some players. But for the more casual players or those who perhaps don’t loot as well as the average ARC Raiders fan, it’s a sizeable stack of coin.</p>



<p>But it now means that you can wipe your entire skill selection and build something entirely new, which is great news for anyone chasing the now-nerfed Security Breach perk. Once upon a time, it was the most broken perk in the game, but following a change weeks ago, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-nerf-security-breach-perk/">made much weaker</a> by Embark Studios in a move to balance the skill tree.</p>







<p>Let us know on the Insider Gaming Discord server if you <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">plan to wipe your skills in ARC Raiders</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A Call of Duty leaker is making some big claims about the future of the franchise, specifically the 2027 version of the annual franchise.</p>



<p>According to TheGhostOfHope, developer Sledgehammer Games is planning some bigger changes for the game. Mainly in terms of what possible will be removed.</p>







<p><a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/2000945365055394031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostOfHope claims</a> that Zombies is <strong>“currently still not planned to return”</strong> in the game. They also say that <strong>“omnimovement with no tac sprint is currently planned for the game.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding removing Zombies, TheGhostOfHope speculated about the possible reason.</p>



<p><strong>“I think the idea is that they don’t want to burn out Treyarch who is gonna come off [two] back-to-back games and they don’t want to have too much zombies content overall so that way 2028 is more hype,”</strong> they said while adding that they believe the omnimovement will be the Black Ops 6 version without the tactical spring and wall jump.</p>



<p>As far as what could be returning, it was said that Get High is coming back and that Pick 10 being brought back is <strong>“a big discussion happening.”</strong></p>



<p>As with any rumor or claim, please take the information with a grain of salt until it is either verified by Insider Gaming or confirmed by Activision or Sledgehammer Games. It’s also worth noting that TheGhostOfHope’s last claim regarding next year’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/infinity-ward-debunk-recent-modern-warfare-4-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared to be debunked</a> developer Infinity Ward. Of course, until the game is announced next year, everything is purely speculative.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-30-first-impressions-of-the-switch-2-version</link>
            <guid>1384834</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">For the Animal Crossing fans looking for new dialogue or major overhauls to what exists in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, you may not want to hold your breath for the 3.0 Update or the Nintendo Switch 2 version. The announcement for anything new for the five-year-old game was already a delightful surprise (especially after Nintendo previously said they were done with major updates years ago), but there don't seem to be many secrets or surprises beyond what was shown in the reveal trailer. IGN was invited by Nintendo to get a hands-off look at what's coming to ACNH on January 15, 2026, and the roughly 25-minute demo confirmed certain ACNH fan factions' excitement and disappointment: namely, this one is for the decorators. That being said, as someone who does love decorating in Animal Crossing, this update is an exciting reason for me to play more regularly again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 version's three main features aren't all that interesting, though the speed and graphical updates are pleasing. In the demo, I saw and had it confirmed that the Switch 2 exclusive Megaphone tool is limited to calling residents who can actually hear. So, it won't impact anyone inside a building, which makes it less useful for tracking down a particular character. Then, the final major benefit to playing on Switch 2 is being able to play with up to 12 people total in multiplayer, though that hinges on <em>everyone</em> in the session playing on a Switch 2. I feel lucky I know even three people still playing, leaving this update as the least impactful.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The hotel is by far the biggest change out of everything. It was explained that, like other facilities in ACNH, the hotel is something you'll unlock. Since it's tied to the pier, it cannot be moved and getting it is not optional. I didn't see what's involved in building the hotel, but once it's there, it'll receive season-appropriate decor like other facilities. Inside is the welcoming site of Kapp'n's family. The main activity you'll do in the hotel is decorating rooms similar to the Happy Home Paradise DLC, with the key difference being that you have a list of room themes to choose from (such as Ranch Room, Skyscraper Room, and plenty more) and are free to do what you will with it… or skip using a theme entirely and freestyle the design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you use a theme, you're provided a selection of items that match. Though unlike HHP, you're not required to use any specific items even if you do opt to use a theme. Then, when you're done, you'll receive a reward of the new hotel currency, tickets, once per day. You can keep decorating the eight guest rooms, but you won't receive any extra currency. Tickets can then be spent at the hotel gift shop that has hotel-related items along with new furniture, most of which I did not get to see. The other way to earn tickets is by crafting requested items for Kapp'n. The new bulk crafting feature wasn't shown in my demo either.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/15/switch2-acnh-ns2e-announce-trl-guest-room-decor-scrn-02-1765828312788.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Tourists who stay in the hotel can roam your island in the customizable outfits displayed in the hotel, which helps to clearly identify them. Unfortunately, there wasn't much interaction with tourists in my demo. The one conversation with a tourist didn't make it clear whether or not they can be invited to stay on the island, though it was mentioned in the demo that if the visitor is convinced, they could potentially become a resident. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The four new characters coming to ACNH with 3.0 (two from Splatoon, two from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom) weren't present in the demo, though the items that get added to ACNH after scanning one of their respective series amiibo were. It was clarified that to get one of the new Splatoon or Legends of Zelda characters and the associated special items, all you need to do is scan any one amiibo from their respective franchise, rather than any specific amiibo. The items looked great peppered around the item, and it seems most of the items are interactive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those looking for even more decorating, Slumber Islands await. We unfortunately again didn't see much of the special Slumber Island space beyond what was shown in the reveal trailer. This feature requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. With that, you'll get access to three island save spots and can create a small, medium, or large island, with the large size being close to being the size of the normal island. The Animal Crossing community has come up with some amazing island designs over the years, and the Slumber Islands feature is primed to encourage even more of that. Whatever you've collected will be available on the Slumber Islands, and anything you do or use in the dreams won't impact your main island. It was confirmed during the demo that there won't be any new additional custom design save slots, though, so players will need to get creative with what's already available if custom designs are a key part of their island design process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our demo didn't show Resetti's new suite of cleanup services, all the new items coming with the hotel, or how much it costs to upgrade storage. There wasn't a chance to ask the developers questions either, so it's still unclear whether we should expect any other ACNH updates beyond this. I'm eager to see the patch notes whenever Nintendo releases them to see if there are any secret small quality of life updates or item updates for holidays (will we get a 2026 balloon arch for the New Year's event?), but, as I mentioned earlier, I'm skeptical we'll see any major changes other than what's been announced. Even still, I'm enjoying having a reason to return to my island and get it cleaned up for future tourists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Miranda Sanchez is the executive editor of guides at IGN and a member of </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Unlocked</a><em>.

Along with sharing his thoughts on that viral tease for Divinity ahead of The Game Awards 2025, he also spoke about the lessons learned from the success of Baldur's Gate 3, and why it was important for Larian to return to the series that built the developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.

Well, Geoff Keighley tweeted it, so we're not surprised by how it turned out after that. I mean, I actually thought we were gonna make it, that it wasn't gonna leak until the show. But yeah, bureaucracy was against us because it was too fast [and too close to the show]. Normally, it takes more time for something like that to be filed, and here they filed really, really fast.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/unnamed-17-1765885306252.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Hellstone teased the announcement of Divinity ahead of The Game Awards.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: After the success of Baldur's Gate 3, it seemed like you and the developers had a lot of options for what was next – especially continuing with that franchise. Firstly, was the plan to always return to the Divinity series right after BG3 was finished?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>No, we were working on something else for Baldur's Gate originally, and I think we've talked about that publicly. Eventually, we were going to go back to the Divinity series, but before we did, we were going to take more time away from it, and then we changed our minds, honestly. Our hearts weren't into the thing that we were making before this, so it was an instant decision to say, 'Okay, we have to make Divinity now. So let's start doing it.' But when we did, it took us a little while to set everything up because we didn't have anything ready. So it was quite a flip, for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How far along in development is Divinity right now?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>We've been working on it for over two years in development. We're now in full production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It can't be stated enough how massively successful Baldur's Gate 3 was for not just Larian Studios, but for how it renewed interest in the CRPG genre, the larger Dungeons and Dragons franchise, and also brought in new players for both of those. What were some key lessons you took away from that, and what do you plan to bring into the next Divinity?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>One of the biggest lessons was the success of cinematics – and how we present the story and choices. Obviously, we did a lot of things differently in BG3 than we did with Divinity: Original Sin 2, and that game was much better, I think. But the fact that, when people started seeing choices cinematically, what an impact that has on players, how they bond with the characters, and the attractions and choices in the game. So I think that was probably my biggest takeaway from everything, yeah, for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Does returning to the Divinity series feel different now following the success of BG3? Do you view this series differently now compared to how you felt about Divinity: Original Sin 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yeah, in a way. We learned the value of having a solid universe behind you, for sure. One of the first things we started doing was saying, 'Okay, we're gonna put a lot of effort into making this universe feel tidy.' That's also why we are just calling it Divinity, right? There's never been a game that's just Divinity first, because there were all kinds of versions with different names. So this is actually going to be Divinity, which is going to have a proper universe backing it. We're building everything as you would expect, with lots of surprises, so that we can build on top of it. We learned that from BG, because we spent a lot of time delving through all kinds of DnD books, so that's probably one of the biggest takeaways from that development process.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Divinity Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Divinity is also entirely owned by Larian Studios. You all have intimate knowledge of the lore, and without working with other agencies.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yeah, we also have the benefit of being able to do what we want with it, right? Other things do not bind us. I mean, D&amp;D, for all its glory, is a ruleset that is made for tabletop role-playing games. Here, we have the benefit of making something that's actually a video game first. So it's very different, but I think people who enjoyed Baldur's Gate 3 are gonna love what we're doing with this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: There must be a great freedom in being able to bend and even break the rules of your systems however you please.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yes, and we want you to break the systems in our games. That's our gameplay formula; we want you to break things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: That was a part of the fun of Baldur's Gate 3 for many people; you could come up with some wacky solutions to combat and quests. Would you say you're looking to elevate that even with Divinity?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yes [Laughs]. But I can't talk about the game's mechanics yet. I think you want to discover this aspect by seeing it. It's one thing to talk about it, but when you're gonna see it in action, you're gonna say, 'Ah!,' you're gonna be nodding. I think if you like BG3, this is gonna be great.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is the scope of this game bigger than Original Sin 2 and even Baldur's Gate 3?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Ah, smart question. I will say that it's bigger than BG3. I've actually never compared BG3 to Original Sin 2, so I don't know what the numbers are. I reckon BG3 is bigger for sure, yeah, but Original Sin 2 is pretty big as well. I can't compare Divinity to Original Sin 2 accurately, but I can say that it'll be bigger than BG3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: As you develop the Divinity universe further, do you feel more comfortable operating within this setting, and does it feel easier compared to BG3?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>I mean, it actually feels a bit harder because we have to create the entire universe. We really wanted to tidy up because the first Divinity games were made with little thought for universe-building, and it's only in Original Sin 2 that we started thinking more about it – but even then, not really 100% to what we did with Baldur's Gate 3. So now we're really thinking about it, and so that's a lot of work to make sure we get it right. Because it's the little things, right? I mean, what do people do when they go out to eat? What do they do when they go to sleep? What all of that has to be called out. So there's a lot of stuff to consider.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Shifting to a development question, Baldur's Gate 3 and Divinity: Original Sin 2 used the early access release model. Will Divinity be planned with a similar release model, including early access?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Most likely, but I don't want to commit to it right now, because we don't know how the games industry will change. We're not ready to do anything in early access yet, but I think it's worked well for us in the past. We had the player community and their feedback, and that has made all of our games that were in early access much better. So yeah, I think we would very much like to do that again. But that said, we don't want too many people playing in early access, because we do need to 'cook' and it's still a period of development. So that might be a little bit problematic, but we'll see. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Given that Baldur's Gate 3 and Original Sin 2 were still very much structured in traditional CRPG gameplay, do you feel the need to switch things up with mechanics to go for something different?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Well, we certainly want to innovate, yeah. But there are some core pillars that we don't need to change. It's going to be a single-player game, and it's also going to be a cooperative multiplayer game. Obviously, all within our formula, and there's still plenty of room for innovation. So you will see. There will be more agency for sure, more freedom for sure, more shenanigans that you can do for sure. So, in the combination of all these things, that's the thing that will surprise people the most.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It feels like we're in this renaissance period for role-playing games in the wake of Baldur's Gate 3, especially the CRPG-style of video games. As a developer and an admirer of the genre, do you feel optimistic about where this genre of games is going, especially in how they tell stories?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yeah, certainly for the genres of RPGs, I can't speak for other developers, but you see that there's way more interest and investment money available to put into RPGs. I mean, an RPG won the Game of the Year tonight at The Game Awards. We also have Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which was also nominated tonight, along with Hades 2, which has a lot of RPG elements, even though it's a roguelite. So, I think it's… normal, yeah? Because I think it's one of the best genres out there.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/65718f3be3efa-1765886424254.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Swen Vincke admits the pressure is on Larian to deliver. Image credit: Larian.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: On that note, did you play Expedition 33?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>I haven't finished it yet, but it's really good. I took an interest in it very early on because the art style instantly appealed to me. So yeah, I think it's a remarkable achievement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: When it comes to working on the next Divinity game after BG3, is there a sense of pressure on yourselves to deliver?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Yeah, the pressure is high. Pressure is high. Yes, for sure. We feel the pressure on our shoulders, yeah, especially because we set high ambitions for ourselves. But I mean the opposite of that would be that we say, "Oh, you know what, we'll just make a lesser game." That wouldn't be very motivating at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Well, it seems like you're feeling great about the current vision for Divinity and feeling good about what's to come.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Swen Vincke: </strong>Oh, no, we're in the middle of development – there's always anxiety, for sure [Laughs]. These are complicated things to make, so it's not like, "Oh, let's make the game." No, it's a mess [to make games], but we'll be fine eventually. The team is good, we have trust, and we know that they know what they're doing, that eventually we're going to get what comes out of it. But if you were to go and look now, it's as messy as a building that is under construction, right? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, we will figure it out. We will learn the language of the game and how to write in it to start making poetry. Eventually, it gets really good, but it takes time. It takes iteration, and every single time you take an extra step, you learn more things about your game, and then you improve it. And that's just a process that takes time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Kennedy, which look to feature an ominous-looking mark on his neck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The past week has been a rollercoaster for Leon fans, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-leon-s-kennedy-is-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-leak-reveals">leaked artwork</a> confirming the character's long-rumored presence in Requiem, followed by his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-finally-confirms-leon-s-kennedy-is-in-resident-evil-requiem-the-game-awards-2025-ign">official unveiling</a> in a trailer at The Game Awards last Thursday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But now there's concern for Leon's future — as fans analyse screenshots from Capcom's latest trailer that seemingly show a dark, bloodied wound on the hero's neck, and following a comment from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> producer Akifumi Nakanishi who stated that Leon is hiding "a big secret."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has revisited last week's official Resident Evil Requiem trailer that aired during The Game Awards, and enhanced the screenshots you can see below. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/resident-evil-requiem-3rd-trailer-00-03-12-2-1765890925558.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Leon in Resident Evil Requiem's latest trailer.

Image credit: Capcom/IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Could this be a zombie bite, or potentially another infection? The question has prompted furious debate among fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ResidentEvilCapcom/comments/1pl3v90/leons_neck/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> and <a href="https://x.com/neko_sougo/status/1999397917627736427?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a>, while others have suggested this would be an unlikely plot point for Capcom to explore again, after Leon was injected with Las Plagas during Resident Evil 4. Other fans, however, have said this mark could be a sign of Leon's older Las Plagas infection slowly recurring — as a neat way to tie Leon's story in Requiem back to the franchise's most popular entry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jokingly, some fans have suggested the mark is a nod to Capcom's non-canon Game Boy Color title Resident Evil: Gaiden, in which Leon is revealed to secretly be a monster when green blood oozes from a wound on his neck. Alternatively, one other fan claimed, it's a love bite from Ada. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The topic of whether Leon will die has long been debated by fans anticipating his appearance in Requiem, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-resident-evil-requiem-will-return-to-franchises-original-overarching-narrative-featuring-raccoon-city-and-umbrella">Capcom has suggested will conclude story threads from the franchise so far</a>. Will the passing of Leon — for many, the series' most popular character — be used to mark the end of Resident Evil's current era of storytelling, as it marks its 30th anniversary?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil: Requiem - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speculation has only intensified after remarks from Requiem producer Akifumi Nakanishi, who was asked by <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/2512124p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Denfaminicogamer</a> about the word "Elpis," which appears in the game's latest trailer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Although I can't reveal any details yet, Leon has a big secret, and Elpis is involved in that as well," Nakinishi said, "and it has an important meaning. I hope that as you play, you will be able to unravel Elpis' secret.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In ancient Greek mythology, Elpis is a symbol left behind in Pandora's Box, from which various disasters are said to have flowed," he continued. "It is generally interpreted as 'hope,' but in fact, some people also see it as 'disaster.' This is an important element in the story of Requiem."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Leon's fate ultimately be one of hope or disaster?

First, I want to thank you all for the patience and understanding you’ve shown thus far. Though we’ve been quiet, we haven’t been idle; this year has been productive and we’ve made important progress across all fronts, from world design and combat to narrative depth and atmosphere.</p><p>Our aim with <em>Terminator: Survivors</em> has always been to bring you an authentic and immersive <a title="Genres > Open-World [799 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> <em>Terminator</em> experience that recreates the harsh reality of Skynet’s uprising, and the resilience of humanity in spite of it.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You’ll be immersed in a bleak story where every machine patrolling the open world is a lethal threat, and the chilling sight of a T-800’s red eyes on the horizon means you run, you hide, or you die… Your journey will be one of desperation, as you explore, fight Skynet’s first prototypes, and help the resistance rise from the ashes of civilization. This isn’t just another <a title="Genres > Shooter [4,363 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a>. It’s a fight for the <a title="Genres > Survival [498 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> of all humanity from the moment you step out of the rubble. The start of the resistance against the machines, as seen through your eyes.</p><p>After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we came to the conclusion that to give you an authentic “<em>Terminator</em>” experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay, <strong>we would have to put aside the <a title="Genres > Co-Op [363 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative multiplayer</a></strong>. We know this may come as a disappointment, but we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day.</p><p>We’ve also had to overhaul our release plans, <strong>instead of launching in Early Access</strong>, we want your first steps into the wasteland to be a <strong>complete and polished experience</strong>. You might have guessed already, but that means <em>Terminator: Survivors</em> won’t be launching in 2025. We don’t have a new date locked in, but we’ll let you know when we’re ready to share a new release date.</p><p>Nevertheless, your feedback is a crucial part of our development process, and so we’ll be organizing several closed playtests (under NDA) as the launch window gets closer. If you’re interested in taking part and helping us shape the future of Terminator: Survivors, you can sign up here.</p><p>We know expectations are high, and we can’t wait to show you what we’ve been working on. For now, I can only thank you for sticking with us as we do our absolute best to create a game worthy of the <em>Terminator</em> legacy. We’ll be back with more news as soon as we can.</p><p>—Marco Ponte and the <em>Terminator: Survivors</em> Team</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/terminator-survivors-delayed-to-unannounced-date-no-longer-an-early-access-title]]></content:encoded>

While the dolls were out, we captured some exclusive video of each, giving you a close-up look of Reimagined's party members: Hero, Maribel, Kiefer, Ruff, Aishe, and Sir Mervyn.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside that, we spoke to Reimagined director Masato Yagi about the decision to create a doll-like visual style and the diaorama-esque aeshetic of Estard and the surrounding world. <strong>But before that, check out this exclusive video about the dolls:&nbsp;</strong></p><p url="https://youtu.be/kSBxpnOMQhk" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kSBxpnOMQhk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>When I ask Yagi how the team landed on these dolls, going so far as to pay a local Japanese doll studio, Studio Nova, to create them, he says it's about Akira Toriyama's art in the original game.&nbsp;</p><p>"The reason or factor [for] the doll-and-handcrafted aesthetics is that when you look at the original character designs from Akira Toriyama, when compared with other Dragon Quest character designs, the characters of Dragon Quest VII are drawn in a shorter scale," Yagi says. "I think that really matched the unique aesthetics of the storytelling of Dragon Quest VII. The doll [visual look] really meshed well together [with that art and aesthetic of DQVII]."</p><p>Yagi adds, "The original story of Dragon Quest VII involved, as you know, the protagonists – as they move forward with their progress and their adventures, more islands [to explore and visit] are revealed; there are more areas that they can explore. I think that system just kind of made sense and just fits well with the diorama aesthetic, too."&nbsp;</p><p>You can see firsthand how these doll aesthetics work in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined when it launches on February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet to access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.</p><hr><p><em>Do you like the doll aesthetic?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Raiders of Blackveil, a new co-op roguelite from Wombo Games, a studio founded by IO Interactive co-founder Janos Flösser, has launched into early access on PC. <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-co-founder-opens-new-studio-wombo-games-new-rogue-lite-raiders-of-blackveil-to-be-debut-project/">After announcing the studio</a> and Raiders of Blackveil back in April 2025, followed by the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/co-op-roguelite-raiders-of-blackveil-former-io-interactive-devs-early-access-release-date/">early access release date last month</a>, this new Copenhagen-based team has hit the ground running and already has its debut project in players' hands.</p>



<p>Wombo Games is composed of former IO Interactive and Square Enix developers who've worked on titles like Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Just Cause, and, of course, Hitman. It's clearly a very different kind of game compared to all of those titles, but it's always an exciting prospect to see seasoned developers go outside their comfort zone.</p>



<p>Raiders of Blackveil is a MOBA-inspired action RPG where you'll select your preferred champion and try to craft the best build possible across eight different classes, over 300 perks, and all of the best loot you can find. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Our journey to Early Access has been about one thing: refining the core experience and making sure the gameplay feels as it should,</em>" said Benjamin Flösser, executive producer at Wombo Games, in a press release. "<em>Now that this foundation is solid, we're excited to open Raiders of Blackveil to players once again. Early access is where Raiders of Blackveil truly starts to grow and we're looking forward to expanding Raiders of Blackveil in meaningful ways alongside players who have already shaped it so much</em>."</p>



<p>Wombo Games did not specify how long Blackveil is expected to remain in early access, but it did state that the game's 1.0 release will be out sometime in 2026.</p>

              <p>It’s pretty sad to see&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> already fading away just a couple of weeks on from its release. Slipping out of the charts already and failing to make much of an impact after an 18-year wait, it feels like something of a death knell for Samus’ 3D adventures. But if there’s any way to take my mind off the ennui this elicits, it’s to remember the NPCs talking at me while I was trying to play, and then perhaps be a bit glad. Although it could have been a lot worse: Astonishingly, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-want-me-to-build-rocket-skates-fans-uncover-30-mins-of-cut-metroid-prime-4-dialogue/">as <em>VGC</em> reports</a>, players have now discovered another 30 minutes of dialogue for its NPCs that was mercifully cut from the final game.</p> <p>Universally recognized as the game’s worst choice, the fourth installment in the splendid <em>Metroid Prime</em> franchise has incessant nattering from a range of NPCs, who seem to be there simply to irritate Samus as she tries to get on with her exploring, shooting, and scanning. Samus’ wordless responses start to feel like the most remarkable act of passive-aggression as her gabby companions refuse to take the hint. And it’s so incongruous! It’s incongruous to the entire <em>Metroid</em> franchise, given the usually solitary nature of the suited heroine, and it’s incongruous to&nbsp;<em>this game</em>, given its post-colony setting of ruins. Leave her be!</p>

 <p>So it really beggars belief that there was once an intention for there to be even more. YouTuber Bearborg, who will hopefully end up with more than 24 subscribers by the end of today, has uploaded all the conversations coming from the base camp during the game, which in the released version are mercifully limited to about seven-and-a-half minutes. There then follows a further 33 minutes of talking that was cut from the game, containing a whole lot of banality that’s supposed to be (scarequotes) “banter.”</p>  <p>The dialogue that’s been unearthed isn’t polished, with occasional moments of an old-school text-to-speech voice among the actors. All the performances are completely fine, and it was clearly intended to be background color when written and recorded, not plot-critical content. Thank goodness someone at some point realized this isn’t the right game for it. Were these comments optional extras in an RPG, or conversations from which you could walk away in an open-world, it would be harmless stuff. But the enforced nature of it all in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, amidst a series of games best enjoyed for their peace and quiet, remains such a weird choice.</p>

            <p>Larian is using generative AI as part of its game development process, but CEO Swen Vincke has confirmed the studio's new Divinity game won't include anything AI-generated.</p>
<p>Vincke discussed the topic of AI with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">announcement last week at The Game Awards of its new Divinity game</a>. It's the studio's next project following the hugely successful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which was a particularly expansive game.</p>
<p>As such, the studio is looking to AI with its follow-up, but Vincke confirmed it hasn't massively improved efficiency. Larian uses AI tools to explore ideas, expand on internal presentations, develop concept art, and write placeholder text, Bloomberg reported.</p>

<p>In Divinity, then, "everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves," said Vincke.</p>
<p>And while the use of AI has led to some pushback internally, Vincke believes "at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we're using it."</p>
<p>Larian is aiming to cut down on development time for Divinity, to complete production in less time than Baldur's Gate 3. AI is one potential tool, while another is developing Divinity's quest and storylines in parallel rather than linearly. The studio is also growing in size.</p><p>"I think a lot of founders have the same problem," said Vincke. "I have to be large, otherwise I can't make my video game. With growth suddenly comes a whole bunch of responsibilities that you didn't necessarily think you were ever gonna have, but you have them and then you make the best of them. Size exposes you to new problems that you couldn't imagine existed."</p>
<p>Back at GDC last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-larian-interview-swen-vincke-on-industry-woes-optimism-and-life-after-baldurs-gate-3">Vincke discussed the topic of AI with Eurogamer</a>. "So, we certainly don't see it as a replacement for developers," he said. "But we do see it as something that allows us to do more stuff."</p>
<p>He continued: "I do see it as an additional tool that you can put on top of the things that are in the game. And we're certainly doing experiments with that. But as I said, it's still far from being usable in that sense."</p>
<p>In the same Bloomberg interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">Vincke declared Larian's forthcoming Divinity game as "us unleashed"</a>, confirming it will be a turn-based RPG.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-after-larians-big-the-game-awards-announcement-2017s-divinity-original-sin-2-receives-current-gen-upgrade-for-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">current gen upgrade was released for Larian's previous game Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, available now on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<p>Sound familiar?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has recently confirmed the worst kept secret of 2025 by finally showcasing Leon Kennedy in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>.</p>
<p>However, the new trailer also contains a few lines of dialogue from another off-screen character, and fans are convinced that they know who it is. Ahead of Leon's reveal, we hear from a supporting character over comms, who provides information while asking questions regarding the events of Requiem.</p>
<p>Although it might be tempting to say that this is Ingrid Hunnigan, the agent who supported Leon over comms during the events of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">6</a>, comparisons to voiceover work in the latter entry have fans convinced that it's actually Sherry Birkin.</p>
<p>Sherry last appeared in Resident Evil 6 and featured prominently in Jake Muller's campaign, crossing paths with Leon during a bio-terror incident in China. She was voiced by Eden Riegel, and comparisons between her scenes in Resident Evil 6 and the voiceover heard in the Requiem trailer reveal that the voices sound <em>incredibly</em> similar.</p>

<p>In addition to the voiceover work, a very brief shot during the Requiem trailer shows someone viewing information on a screen whilst wearing a microphone – someone with very distinctive blonde hair.</p>
<p>It would make a lot of sense if this were indeed the case. Sherry became close friends with Leon and Claire Redfield during the events of Resident Evil 2, and later became an agent under the Division of Security Operations (D.O.S.), an entity that also happens to employ Leon.</p>
<p>So it seems likely, then, that Sherry Birkin will feature in Requiem. Will it stop there, though, or can we also expect to see more classic characters make their grand return? Heck, if Leon's in the game, then it's reasonable to assume we'll also catch a glimpse of Ada Wong.</p>
<p>Either way, we'll find out for sure when Resident Evil Requiem launches on Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arkane-austin-harvey-smith-redfall-dishonored-shutdown-2000653861</link>
            <guid>1384732</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been over a year since Arkane Austin, the Texas-based developer of </span><i><span>Prey </span></i><span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/redfall-arkane-review-impressions-roundup-score-xbox-pc-1850397601"><i><span>Redfall</span></i></a><span>, was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-closing-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-1851460685"><span>shut down as Microsoft sought to prioritize “high-impact” games</span></a><span>. The team was being led by Harvey Smith, known for his work on genre-defining games like </span><i><span>Deus Ex </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dishonored</span></i><span>, who took some time to reflect on the studio’s closure on the latest episode of </span><a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console"><i><span>My Perfect Console</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Smith’s episode of the interview podcast is two hours long and goes over his storied, three-decade career, but it begins with him and host Simon Parkin talking about one of the low points. Smith said he got a call the night before the fateful May 2024 day when Microsoft would shut down Arkane’s Austin studio informing him of the impending event, and spent the “stressful” night worrying about the Arkane developers who were still fairly new to the industry and had really only worked on a project or two before joining the studio to work on </span><i><span>Redfall</span></i><span>. He was also surprised the measure was being taken, he said, because Arkane had done “really good work.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Every company makes the decisions they make for the reason they make them,” Smith said. “I don’t agree with them often, but the main shock there was this studio made </span><i><span>Dishonored</span></i><span>, along with the Lyon studio, and then they made </span><i><span>Prey</span></i><span>. Then we were working on </span><i><span>Redfall </span></i><span>during the pandemic and everything else. The industry [was] exploring games-as-a-service games. It is what it is. Creative efforts are unpredictable.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Smith says he takes responsibility for the traps </span><i><span>Redfall </span></i><span>fell into as the studio director, but acknowledges that he is “privileged” in the grand scheme of things because he has had a long career to look back on with highs and lows, whereas some of the Arkane Austin team was just getting started in their game dev careers when the shutdown happened, or had only worked with the team on one project. He goes on to talk about how long </span><span>résumé</span><span>s in games are becoming more and more rare, and says that his experience of a career filled with both good and bad moments is much harder to come by.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I’m that rare person who has no complaints, but that’s a little bit of survivorship bias because things have worked out for me,” Smith said. “Even when they haven’t, I can look on a long track now and be like ‘Yes, there was a low point here, but look at this high point over here. This is incredible.’</span></p>

 <p><span>“If you have that luxury to look back on a bunch of highs and lows, it contextualizes things.”</span></p> <p><span>One time when I was getting laid off from a previous job, the HR guy tried to tell me and other affected workers that this was just a bump in the road, and that the average person has several jobs over the course of their lifetime, as if that was a comfort. However, as Smith illustrates here, there was a time when that was true, when a layoff from one job was probably not a disaster as you could likely find another one in a reasonable amount of time. In video games, that has never been less true than it is right now. Layoffs are at an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492"><span>all-time high</span></a><span> and are affecting even the most profitable companies in the space. Something like Arkane Austin’s closure might not emotionally affect a veteran the same way it will someone who felt like they’d finally “made it” by landing a job at the company that made </span><i><span>Dishonored</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Redfall </span></i><span>was not the next live-service hit everyone involved was probably hoping for, but it’s still a shame that a studio of such pedigree was caught up in the live-service rat race and shuttered after it didn’t work out. </span></p>
