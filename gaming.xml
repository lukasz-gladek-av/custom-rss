<figure data-uuid="f4a536c1e4e64"><a title="Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f4a536c1e4e64/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is back with preparations for another year of Black Friday discounts, as it has today detailed a bunch of Switch 1 games, amiibo and a MicroSD Express card that will be going on sale over the course of November. It has also reminded us all that Switch 2 bundles exist, because <em>of course</em>.</p>
<p>So, kicking things off with those games. From 23rd November, a lineup of select first-party titles will be dropping down to $29.99 or $39.99 at select US retailers, including the official Nintendo Stores in New York City and San Francisco. Here's the range of titles seeing a price cut this year:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lsiwxg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

</ul>
<p>These are all Switch 1 releases, of course, but there are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">free Switch 2 performance upgrades</a> available for the likes of Echoes of Wisdom, Odyssey and Splatoon 3, so those playing on the new system will at least see some benefits.</p>
<p>And while we're on Switch 2, no, there has not been a Black Friday bundle announced — which makes sense, given the system is still less than six months old. That said, Nintendo has reminded us all in its Black Friday listings that the console is still available both by itself for $449.99 and bundled with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for $499.99.</p>

<p>A select lineup of the system's new amiibo will be subjected to a discount, mind you, with the four <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> Sage amiibo (that's Tulin, Yunobo, Riju and Sidon) and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> series (Jamie, Kimberly and Luke, <em>and</em> the amiibo Card Starter Set) seeing a $10 discount at select retailers.</p>
<p>Finally, Nintendo has announced that it will be introducing a seasonal $20 saving on Samsung MicroSD Express Cards on 30th November. This one could be worth keeping an eye on if you're aiming to pick up more Switch 2 software over the holiday period.</p>
<p>For those simply after something digital, the usual Cyber Deals sale will be getting underway on 20th November and will be sticking around until 3rd December, so expect digital deals aplenty.</p>
<p>All in all, it's business as usual for Nintendo's North American Black Friday lineup this year. It would have been grand to see Switch 2 get some discounts, but it's hardly surprising that Nintendo is keeping the boat steady while the console continues to break sales records at its current price. Maybe next year we'll see some, eh?</p>
<p><em>Do you plan on picking anything up on sale this year? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendos-black-friday-offers-include-deals-on-switch-1-games-amiibo-and-more]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-collab-with-pillsbury-leaks-first-look-yoshi-super-mario-galaxy-movie/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-nintendo-collab-with-pillsbury-leaks-new-look-at-yoshi-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teases-another-new-character.1348966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the span of two months, we went from not knowing anything official about Nintendo's follow-up to its box-office smash-hit, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">to knowing the official title</a>, (The Super Mario Galaxy Movie), getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-president-says-movies-are-very-well-suited-to-nintendo-games/">more insight on how Nintendo sees its future adaptations</a>, and a very likely rumor that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-reportedly-appear-before-wicked-for-good/">film's first major trailer is days away from premiering</a>.</p>



<p>Today, the latest update comes in the form of an unfortunate leak from a collaboration between Nintendo and Pillsbury cookies. On the <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz">website for American grocery store chain TopsMarkets</a>, a box of Pillsbury Cookie Dough cookies shaped like Yoshi eggs features a big, bright look at Yoshi in the film on the front of the box.</p>



<p>This is technically our second look at the character design for Yoshi in the film, since the first look came from an <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2s-title-may-have-leaked-two-months-ago-in-a-photo-of-deodorant-cans/">Old Spice promotional collaboration</a> that also leaked the film's official title months before it was officially revealed. That said, this is definitely the best look at Yoshi in the coming film we've gotten so far.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Pillsbury via TopsMarket</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What's perhaps the more interesting aspect of this leak is what we see on the back of the box. It's not a full character reveal, but it does practically confirm that one of the new characters in the Super Mario Galaxy Movie will be Bowser Jr.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Pillsbury via TopsMarket</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You can see Bowser Jr.'s classic symbol on the top-left side of the box, which you can bet would not be included if he were not going to be part of the film in some way. So, it would seem that slowly, but surely, we're learning more about this coming sequel all the time.</p>



<p>We should, if the rumors are true, get a brand new trailer sometime before the end of the month, since a new trailer is allegedly slated to appear ahead of the theatrical showings of Wicked: For Good, the part-two to the box-office hit adaptation of the Broadway musical.</p>



<p>After that, it's a safe bet that the floodgates of pre-release information will open a little wider, as we get closer to the film's April 3, 2026, premiere date.</p>

Yet, on the day that sees <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ditch-any-fallout-4-mods-which-mess-with-the-main-menu-ahead-of-its-anniversary-edition-update-bethesda-warn">re-released in proabable mod-messing up fashion</a>, I'm sitting here looking at a different Fallout thing and thinkling it might be the one of the four I'm most interested in checking out. It's a beefy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> expansion mod called Fallout: Long 15 and it's set to release on December 12th.</p>

<p>As you might have gleaned from that new reveal trailer, the mod's a map expansion which takes the Lonesome Road location of the Long 15 highway - the trader-heavy road leading from Nevada back to NCR-held California - and builds it into a full expansion. It boasts over 30 fresh quests and a whole heap of new characters whom you can chat to or show your big iron. Wait, not in that way.</p>
<p>Aside from that trailer and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsFXdAs4jbE&amp;t=5s">hour-long showcase</a> from September, the latter of which contains some minor spoilers, the mod's got my attention because it's a bigger sequel of sorts to another mod from creator ToxicWhiteout and their team that's spent a little while top of the 'add to load order' I keep for whenever I inevitably find time for another New Vegas playthrough. That first one, dubbed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/88180?tab=description">Dry Wells - Legion Expansion</a>, is designed to offer about six hours of fun. Long 15, meanwhile, is aiming to offer 20 across a map ten times as big.</p><p>Sheer size obviously isn't the be-all-and-end-all, but the mod looks like it has plenty to fill that space. Towns like Baker and Kelso are in line for a visit, while a villa called Casa Stanton run by a guy everyone calls Frick has intrigued me as I've flicked through the showcase trying to get a good sense of the thing, but not have it all spoiled for me.</p>
<p>Plenty of choice and consequence is promised by this trip to California, which sounds like it's designed to be done mid-playthrough, before you're then offered the option to nuke either or both of the Long 15 and Dry Wells at the conclusion of the Lonesome Road DLC. Getting started with Long 15 also looks like it'll fit nicely into your usual New Vegas journey, with the gate at the back of Mojave Outpost being the way in after you've talked to a new character hanging out near that hard-to-miss giant statue of two rangers shaking hands.</p>
<p>Long 15'll be available via Nexus Mods once it releases. Judging by Dry Wells, all you'll need to run it is a copy of the game with all of its DLC, plus maybe a couple of performance-related mods to help it run extra smoothly.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/valves-new-steam-controller-leak-looks-big-chonky-2000642426</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve%E2%80%99s-new-steam-controller-leaks-and-looks-very-chonky.1348945/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning and welcome back to yet another Monday. I’m so sorry. I don’t control the days of the week. But I do control this post, and so I can say: I’m rooting for you. Anyway, welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we take a peek at a controller leak, get some advice from a veteran game maker, and hear what Hideo Kojima thought of <em>Predator: Badlands</em></p>

 <h2>The new Steam Controller looks big and chonky</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The new Steam Controller will look like this when it launches</p> <p>Im told that it can also detect how far your hands are from the handles using a simple capsense feature</p> <p>Similar to the index controllers, but not full finger tracking in the grips <a href="https://t.co/loIqpJb0YZ">pic.twitter.com/loIqpJb0YZ</a></p> <p>— Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1987644108765380813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Fans of the Xbox Duke controller will likely be happy to hear that Valve’s next Steam Controller will reportedly be similarly large and in charge. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1osxuwk/sadlyitsbradley_the_new_steam_controller_will/">On Sunday, reliable Valve insider Brad Lynch shared an AI-generated image</a> of what the not-yet-officially-announced new Steam controller will look like. And yeah, it’s big, complete with two touch pads, like the Steam Deck, and even does some basic finger tracking. Leaks and info about this controller and other Valve hardware keep happening, and rumors are swirling that a reveal of something from the company is coming soon.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Modern Warfare 2 Remastered</em> likely coming to Game Pass soon</strong></h2> <p>2020’s <em>Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2: Campaign Remastered</em> will likely be added to Xbox’s Game Pass service, according to a leaked ad that was spotted by fans. It’s hard to make out, but it does seem like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1ory64g/mw2_coming_to_game_pass/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><em>Modern Warfare 2′</em>s cover art is included in a dashboard ad</a> that appeared on one player’s screen. It’s possible this was just a mistake, but Xbox and Activision have been regularly adding <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-mw3-july-xbox-1851601479">old<em> Call of Duty</em> games to Game Pass since 2024.</a></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Mega Man</em> designer Keiji Inafune wants devs to stop clinging to the past</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/articles/406514">Over the weekend, as reported by<em> This Is Game,</em></a> <em>Mega Man</em> character designer and <a href="https://kotaku.com/mega-mans-creator-quits-capcom-update-5676403">former Capcom producer Keiji Inafune</a> appeared at the Console Game Developer Conference in South Korea and advised attendees not to rely solely on sequels and established franchises.</p>

 <p>“To be clear, it’s not that games that continue a series or build off an existing famous genre are bad,” said Inafune via Google Translation. “What I mean is that <em>only</em>&nbsp;that is not enough.”</p> <p>“If you make a hit, yes, you’ve succeeded, but it can also place a tremendous burden on you. Does success always seem like a good thing? It is good. You can’t succeed when you’re in a state of anxiety. You need confidence, and that confidence requires a foundation. A past success can provide that foundation. But few people who succeed once go on to succeed again. Success brings positive effects, but it also brings side effects. I’ve seen many people who cling only to past success. They cling to how things were done at that time and adopt a defensive attitude.”</p>

 <p>“In the games industry, many people have succeeded once and that’s it, haven’t they? How often did their sequels succeed too?” asked the veteran developer. “I don’t want to boast, but I take pride in having many representative works – not just <em>Mega Man</em>, but <em>Lost Planet,</em> <em>Onimusha</em>,<em> Dead Rising,</em> and so on. The genres were diverse, too. Because I didn’t rest on past successes.”</p>

 <h2><b>Kojima suffered through a back injury to watch the new <em>Predator</em> movie</b></h2> <p>Hideo Kojima has seen the new <em>Predator</em> movie and <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1987437583430045778">really liked it, despite a painful back injury</a>. Thankfully, Kojima brought a “secret weapon” to the theater: an inflatable lumbar pillow.</p> <p>“[<em>Predator: Badlands</em>] represents a new direction for Hollywood entertainment led by a new generation of filmmakers who have inherited the global ‘memes’ of manga, anime, and gaming culture,” said Kojima on Sunday. “I especially hope young anime fans who usually steer clear of live-action Western films will give this one a try. Even with Dek’s ‘ugly’ face, you’ll find yourself emotionally invested from the opening scene. You’ll definitely get hooked.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><strong>Check out our excellent review of <em>Arc Raiders</em></strong></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-no-more-updates-operation-halo-studios-xbox-2000642195"><strong><em>Halo Infinite</em> is officially going on life support</strong></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/ball-x-pit-vampire-survivors-balatro-roguelike-2000642155"><strong><em>Ball x Pit</em> creator thinks y’all are being too nice</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Star Wars collectibles rarely go on sale, especially character-driven sets like this one that often remain desirable well after their initial release. But right now, the LEGO <strong>Star Wars Grogu with Hover Pram</strong> set is bucking that trend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5425/">selling for an all-time low of just $62 on Amazon (down from its typical $99).</a> This buildable display model <strong>includes 1,048 pieces</strong> and almost never gets discounted, which makes this 37% off sale a really exceptional offer. LEGO’s website still sells the set at retail price, so Amazon’s deal is far and away the best way to get this Mandalorian merchandise without having to pay premium collector prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5425/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Mandalorian Magic</h2>
<p>The engineering behind this buildable figure shows just why LEGO can command premium prices in the first place.<strong> Grogu’s arms move through dial-operated mechanisms</strong> buried within the body, in a manner that allows you to pose those small hands into gestures that capture both the innocent curiosity and mischievousness of the character.</p>
<p>The head rotates smoothly through an entire range of motion while the oversized ears articulate independently, yielding a wide range of expressions and moods. These parts turn what is otherwise a display model right into an interactive one, whereby one is able to change Grogu’s pose to their favorite scenes from The Mandalorian or create entirely new moments. The level of detail extends to a subtle texture in the robe, facial features that genuinely look like the on-screen character, and proportions that manage to feel accurate despite being constructed completely out of rectangular plastic bricks.</p>



<p>The hover pram itself is more than just a figure base, with its spherical design accurately depicting the protective pod that Grogu rides around in throughout the series. Opening panels showcase the interior space where the Child sits, and you can display Grogu inside with the canopy closed for that iconic traveling look or open everything up to show off the figure a bit better. It’s got a stand to provide stable support while still keeping up the illusion of hovering for a dynamic display that looks more interesting than figures on flat bases.</p>



<p>Accessories add a lot of storytelling possibility to increase the appeal of this display. The brick-built Sorgan frog references the memorable episode where Grogu hunted local wildlife despite Mando’s disapproval, and you can position it in Grogu’s hand as if he’s about to enjoy a crunchy snack. The shifter knob from the Razor Crest cockpit represents one of Grogu’s favorite toys throughout the series-a simple object which the Child finds endlessly fascinating. The cookie is another food accessory that captures Grogu’s constant appetite and childlike enthusiasm for treats.</p>
<p>The<strong> 1,048-piece count is that sweet middle ground</strong> where the building process remains engaging without being tedious. You’ll be able to work through the construction in several hours and find that meditative flow state that makes LEGO building so appealing for adults as a means of screen-free relaxation. The building techniques range from simple stacking for structural elements to smart solutions for curved surfaces and mechanical linkages.</p>
<p>With <strong>hundreds of reviewers giving it 4.9 out of 5 star</strong>s, there’s confirmation that it certainly does deliver on its promise.&nbsp;At $62, this is the lowest price this set has ever reached and puts it within the budget of a fanbase that might have found a $99 retail price harder to justify.</p>

<p>It seems like Silent Hill f might be coming to Switch and Switch 2, as well as previous-gen consoles, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. </p>



<p>Silent Hill f was off to a spectacular start, with Konami announcing that the game’s cumulative worldwide shipment volume has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-f-has-already-sold-over-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceeded 1 million units</a>. It seems like they want to get this number even higher by bringing the game to new as well as previous-gen platforms. </p>



<h2 id="h-silent-hill-f-might-be-coming-to-switch-switch-2-xbox-one-and-playstation-4">Silent Hill f Might Be Coming to Switch, Switch 2, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 </h2>



<p>If you head over to Konami’s <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/us/en/products/silenthill_f/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> right now, click on their Games tab, and then select Silent Hill f. You will see the Switch and previous-gen port mentioned on that page. These details are mentioned twice, once in the ‘Platform’ section, which lists ‘Switch, Xbox One, Steam, PS4’. The second time in the ‘Games’ section, which lists PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, iOS, Android, and for some reason, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG’ as well. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those unaware of the title, Silent Hill f is a new instalment to the series, which blends psychological horror with a haunting Japanese setting. It is set in the 1960s, in the fictional small mountain town of Ebisugaoka; the characters and story were also created specifically for the game. Players have to embody the role of Shimizu Hinako as they explore this town, solve complex puzzles, and confront the distorted monsters. </p>



<p>The title features a “grotesque yet aesthetic world” with immersive 3D audio that enhances the tension and uneasiness. The title also features multiple endings where your choices shape your outcome. There are five endings that you can explore in total, and the store was written by the renowned author Ryukishi07 and features music by Akira Yamaoka. </p>

I don’t want fans to feel anxious.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced">The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement became as old as predecessor Skyrim was when The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced</a>.

But we wanted to do something new with Starfield. We needed a creative reset.” Bethesda is currently playtesting The Elder Scrolls 6, Howard revealed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Elder Scrolls Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So when will it actually come out?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Video games are synonymous with the name Nintendo. But which of the hundreds of incredible games that have graced the legendary Japanese company’s numerous home and handheld consoles are the best? Well, here at IGN, we’ve teamed up with our friends at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Life</a> to try and answer that question. What follows is the 100 best Nintendo games of all time, based on a combination of each site’s expert opinions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From iconic Nintendo in-house series such as Super Mario, Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda, to third-party heroes who have made their home on everything from the NES to Switch 2, narrowing down the field was no easy task.

Over the course of this week, we’ll be steadily revealing our picks, with 20 being revealed each day until the full ranking is complete on Friday, November 14. So, without further ado, here are the top 100 Nintendo games of all time:</p><p id="picks-100-81"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Picks 100-81">100. Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/eternal-1762440216844.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">More than 20 years on, there’s still nothing quite like Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem (which, yes, is probably due in part to Nintendo's now-expired sanity system patent). Not only did it have the temerity to jump between wildly distinct time periods, but it also went to great lengths to mess with your mind should you get spotted by enemies too much. Whether it’s an unsettling noise, a slightly skewed camera angle, or the game straight up simulating a ‘blue screen of death’, it made for one of the most memorable experiences in the horror genre. The Lovecraftian aesthetic still sings to this very day, and a certain bathtub scene is just as sure to give you the willies now as it did back in 2002. A remarkable game that deserves a second chance in the spotlight.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">99. GTA: Chinatown Wars</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/gta-1762440272145.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A GTA game releasing exclusively (until its later PSP arrival) for a Nintendo handheld seems like an incongruous proposal. But, in 2009, Rockstar gave the DS Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, a standalone story of Triads and tribulations in GTA 4’s modern Liberty City setting. This top-down ode to the series’ roots miraculously converted the open-world cinema we’d come to expect, adapting to its handheld confines through smart touchpad mechanics and a stylised, cell-shaded comic-book-like aesthetic to stunning effect. What could so easily have been a misguided experiment between Rockstar and Nintendo instead became one of the DS’s most essential games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">98. Star Fox</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/starfox-1762440315739.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">From the days when the word “polygon” was exclusively found in math textbooks comes Nintendo’s 3D evolution of a mainstay arcade genre: the SHMUP. Taxing the SNES hardware so much, even the Super FX chip included inside the cartridge couldn’t get the action to run even at a targeted 12 frames per second, Star Fox followed the linear stage setups of R-Type and co., but played from a behind-the-ship and first-person perspective. The “talking” animals are here to remind you that you’re playing a Nintendo game, but in the end, Star Fox is a highly technical and experimental harbinger of the future. Far from being just a tech demo, it’s also a really fun game, however, thanks to challenging players to play again and again to perfect their runs and experiment to discover alternate paths.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">97. Super Castlevania IV</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/castlevania-4-1762440382804.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's effectively a re-thread of the original Castlevania, this fourth mainline instalment in the series really does elevate things to an entirely different level of quality. Sure, Castlevania 3: Dracula's Curse might be the better game overall, but Super Castlevania IV reimagines Transylvania through a 16-bit lens; the visuals are stunning, with Mode 7 effects adding a new dimension to proceedings, while the music is so good you'd swear it was being streamed from a CD. Subsequent entries would arguably take the franchise to the next level of brilliance, but one thing is clear: Super Castlevania IV remains a masterpiece.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">96. 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/999-1762440449087.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo DS became a haven for visual novel fans; an interactive storybook device that could ease you into a deep night’s sleep. 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors was far more likely to keep you up all night, however, with its twisted game of life and death. Chunsoft’s first entry into the Zero Escape series, 999 placed you alongside eight other potential victims inside a sinking cruise liner that tested your puzzle and deduction skills as you unraveled the web woven by a mysterious mastermind. It’s twisted, clever, and a great example of handheld experimentation that he console would become known for.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">95. Fire Emblem Three Houses</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/three-houses-1762440512155.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Three Houses is a Fire Emblem game that got it all so right; it's been hard to readjust to the series in its aftermath. You see, Three Houses gives us the turn-based strategy we're all fiending for, yes, and it does so with style to spare. However, the real draw here, and the thing that makes this one so worthy of note overall, is the focus and effort that’s been placed on the socialising, customisation, relationships, and all that good stuff that happens between scraps. It's a game you could quite happily live in for a bit.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">94. Professor Layton and the Unwound Future</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/layton-1762440564926.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">What does Professor Layton hide under that huge hat? Perhaps, a towering cylindrical head of a shape unlike any other in human history. He’d certainly need one to house a brain big enough to solve all of the puzzles thrown his way over the course of his many DS and 3DS adventures. A consistent quality of cosiness mixed with Sherlock Holmes-esque yarns can be found across the Layton series, but we’ve gone with The Unwound Future as our pick of the bunch. Its time-traveling tale, full of memorable twists and turns, thrills just as much as solving one of its dozens of conundrums does, satisfying brains of all shapes and sizes to great effect.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">93. WWF No Mercy</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/wwf-1762440600703.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">25 years later, WWF No Mercy, the THQ-published wrestling game released on the Nintendo 64, is not only still considered to be the pinnacle of the N64 wrestling game boom, but it's also widely thought of as the greatest wrestling game of all time. Since its release, it's been the benchmark for what any wrestling game, with or without the WWE license, has aspired to be. It's developed a cult-like following, with fans still playing (and modding) No Mercy to this day, updating its 25-year-old roster with modern superstars when the latest 2K game doesn't live up to its standards. It's not often a game still stands strong after a quarter of a century, and it's even rarer when it's a sports game. All of this makes WWF No Mercy not only the greatest-ever wrestling game, but perhaps Nintendo's greatest-ever sports game that doesn't include Mario.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">92. Kirby: Planet Robobot</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/kirby-robot-1762440684724.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby: Planet Robobot, a truly astonishing little game for the Nintendo 3DS that encapsulates all that is best and beloved about the pink puffball. Robobot has everything: a deep roster of unique and useful copy abilities, colorful and creative levels, an interesting one-off gimmick in the robot armor, silly minigames, and a plot that starts with Kirby taking a nap and ends in a giant galactic battle against a superintelligent, planet-sized being.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to all this, Kirby: Planet Robobot is one of the very few games to really make effective use of the Nintendo 3DS's 3D capabilities. While the game itself takes place on a 2D plane, it features a number of levels that have depth as well as length, and look absolutely fantastic with the 3D turned on, as cars drive directly at the player and giant ice cream cones tip over and spill on the camera. While Kirby has since gained other new copy abilities, minigames, and even his first 3D adventure in the years since, most of them struggle to hold a candle in our hearts to Planet Robobot's breadth, depth, and pure charm.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">91. Diddy Kong Racing</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/diddy-kong-racing-1762440752385.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Apart from Nintendo itself, Rare was the N64’s most important developer, and one place the UK-based studio actually outpaced Nintendo was in the kart racer category. Mario Kart 64 is an undeniable classic, but Diddy Kong Racing just inches ahead as our pick for the best kart racer on the 64. In addition to chaotic split-screen kart racing, Diddy Kong Racing drove the genre forward with three vehicle types (your friend could be in a plane flying alternate routes during the same race you were in a car!), an adventure mode complete with boss battles, and an amazing soundtrack from Donkey Kong Country composer David Wise. Plus, it was the first appearance of Banjo and Conker ahead of their solo platformer outings – and it’s the forgotten, cute, family-friendly version of Conker well before he started drinking, smoking, and swearing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">90. The World Ends With You</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/world-ends-1762440864188.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Though it's been ported and remade several times, none of the more recent versions of The World Ends With You has managed to capture how excellent this game was back when it first released on Nintendo DS. We could go on all day about what makes it great: the art style, the deep fashion mechanics, its accurate portrayal of Shibuya and Japanese youth culture, its unusual story with multiple wild twists, its incredible cast of characters, the MUSIC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But maybe the best element of TWEWY that we've lost in subsequent editions is its battle system, which made unique and brilliant use of both the system's dual screen and its touch controls simultaneously with its D-pad to effectively simulate two different characters synchronizing their attacks with one another in two different realms. Combined with a wide variety of "pins" that could be activated with different types of touch attacks, there was endless room for creativity and growth through multiple playthroughs. Which you definitely wanted to do, if only to hear Calling and Three Seconds Clapping one more time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">89. Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/captain-toad-1762440906371.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After years of being relegated to supporting roles, our little mushroom-headed friend Toad finally got his own game in Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. Nintendo, over the years, has done a brilliant job of designing games fit and tuned perfectly to the personalities of each of its mascots, and Captain Toad is no exception. The cute, diorama-like levels proved to be magnificent puzzles for our intrepid explorer to navigate one by one, presenting a slower and cozier pace from other Nintendo challenges, yet still being perfectly, whimsically Nintendo. It's a shame we never got another one of these.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">88. Golden Sun: The Lost Age</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/golden-sun-lost-age-1762440966390.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We could’ve gone with either Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age as our entry on this list, but we’ve settled for the second part of Camelot's two-act RPG adventure, as it is ultimately the better half. Golden Sun was already an absolute feat, with its creative Psynergy and Djinn systems, gorgeous environments and music, and surprisingly robust open world. In the sequel they quadrupled the size of that world, added even more Psynergy and Djinn and classes, came up with more banger songs and environments, and opened the second act with a wild party switching twist that would go on to be subverted further in a triumphant march to the final battle. Golden Sun and The Lost Age are nuts in the best way, The Lost Age even more so, and are among the best GBA games of all time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">87. Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/mario-golf-1762443474955.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario has tried his hand at a lot of different sports over the years, but few have had the staying power of golf. Originally driving off on the NES, before approaching the 3D world of the N64, it’s Toadstool Tour on the GameCube where the plumber really nailed the action on the green. Its sizeable roster of characters and compelling courses offered a great round of multiplayer fun for those looking for a more laid-back time away from the hectic rush of Smash Bros. and Mario Kart, and the furious consequences of Mario Party.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">86. Super Monkey Ball 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/super-monkey-1762443539892.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Monkey Ball’s brilliance lies in the fact that you’re tilting the stage to roll your monkey around rather than directly moving the character itself, and its table maze concept has never been more finely tuned than in Super Monkey Ball 2. The 2002 GameCube sequel is stuffed with 140 stages to clear – ranging from fun and simple courses perfect for laughing at the silly monkeys on family game night to downright brutal challenges that’ll make you go bananas as you lose hundreds of lives trying to clear them. Mastering everything it has to offer is extraordinarily satisfying, and its physics, momentum, and controls are so pinpoint that a study found that surgeons who warm up by playing Super Monkey Ball 2 are more efficient and precise in simulated surgeries compared to the surgeons who didn’t play. Video games really can save lives!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">85. Viewtiful Joe</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/viewitful-joe-1762443584954.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Viewtiful Joe practically attacks your eyeballs with its standout art direction and frantically fun combat. It’s unfiltered Hideki Kamiya at an exciting career crossroads, melding his Devil May Cry action with a colourful paintbrush palette that would later evolve into the likes of Okami and The Wonderful 101. A wholly original side-scroller that threatens to burst out of its purple cube confines if your fingers don’t keep up with its cell-shaded antics, it's an exciting combo of 2D and 3D platform action that felt fresh in 2003, with an intoxicating style that few have come close to matching since. It spawned sequels, but none truly reached the heights of the original, which has stood the test of time as one of the GameCube’s very best.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">84. F-Zero GX</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/f-zero-gx-1762443720093.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">F-Zero is about cheating death to go faster, and F-Zero GX’s uncompromising difficulty and incredibly high skill ceiling represent a peak of the futuristic racing genre. Like F-Zero X before it, GX forces you to sacrifice your machine’s health bar to get a boost, resulting in tense risk-reward scenarios that get your blood pumping every time. And if you fall off the track while trying to shave off an extra split second, Lakitu won’t swoop in to save you – you’re dead. You must master GX’s tight mechanics and memorize its radical track designs to even stand half a chance against its toughest CPUs, and you hit a high most video games can’t reach when you finally cross the finish line in first place. The cold-blooded challenge only works because GX runs perfectly at 60 fps and looks fantastic with strong art direction that rivals the GameCube’s best, like Metroid Prime and Rogue Leader. F-Zero GX is a masterpiece, and probably the most hardcore Nintendo game since the NES.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">83. Ring Fit Adventure</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/ring-fit-1762443812379.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Ring Fit Adventure is one of the best-selling Nintendo Switch games, thanks largely to a global pandemic making indoor exercise briefly appealing. Unfortunately, like many other exercise programs, most people who started Ring Fit fell off the game before they could discover how much more than just an exercise game it really is. Ring Fit Adventure is genuinely one of the most unique RPGs of the generation. It has a colorful cast of characters, bolstered by surprisingly good writing, a battle system revolving around your own physical movement, complete with skill trees, elemental weaknesses, and even healing items you can craft through more exercise. Plus, its soundtrack is straight work-out bangers, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">82. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/phoenix-wright-1762443881507.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly every moment of Phoenix Wright’s original courtroom adventure is iconic. From Phoenix’s debut trial against Mr. Sahwit (Or should I say... Mr. Did It!) to cross-examining a literal parrot, the first Ace Attorney fully commits to its completely unhinged world and never looks back. Exposing witnesses’ lies and uncovering the truth of each case is exhilarating, largely because of its excellent soundtrack and lively character animations, and the way Ace Attorney balances its unabashed silliness with genuinely serious, heartfelt moments is nothing short of masterful. It’s also an essential game in its genre, as Ace Attorney’s surprisingly successful sales paved the way for more visual novel and puzzle games to find a footing in the West.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">81. Castlevania 3: Dracula’s Curse</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/06/castlevania-3-1762444015514.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Considered by many to be the apex of the 'classic' Castlevania entries, Dracula's Curse remains a wonderful example of a talented group of developers pushing aging hardware to its maximum potential. By the time it arrived in 1989, the 16-bit era was already in full swing and the NES was looking very old-fashioned. However, despite the humble nature of the host hardware, Konami created a stunning action platformer, boasting multiple playable characters and optional routes through Dracula's castle. Indeed, many consider this to be superior to the first 16-bit entry in the series, Super Castlevania IV, which arrived just a short time later in 1991.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Come back tomorrow when we'll be revealing numbers 80 to 61...</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-100-best-nintendo-games-of-all-time]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Where Winds Meet, an upcoming open world action RPG, has reached 10 million pre-registered players. This comes as the game nears its 14th November release date.</p>
<p>Pre-downloadable starting the 12th November, Where Winds Meet was announced last year and has since gained a passionate following of players keen to experience its interesting blend of martial arts and wuxia combat. It helps the game is totally free-to-play too, with fiscal support coming from cosmetic micro transactions.</p>
<p>The game itself is split into two parts, interestingly enough. There's a giant single player component in which you progress through the majority of the story on your own or in co-op. There's also a large multiplayer half to the game, in which you can join guilds, take on dungeons, raids, PvP battles, and more. So it's got a bit of that MMO juice in it, something that'll certainly help set it apart from other action titles.</p>

<p>The game has professions, various different combat styles, parkour, character customisation, and all manner of exploratory features that should keep you keen for a while. It's a game that's not getting a huge amount of discussion in this slam-packed season of game releases, but as the pre-registration figures show, there's a lot of excitement around it.</p><p>As part of hitting that 10 million pre-registration figure, players will receive an in-game thank you gift on-launch which is a nice touch. After it releases Where Winds Meet will be supported with seasonal updates, the first being dubbed "Blade Out" and expanding on the main narrative.</p>
<p>Where Winds Meet is the latest in an ongoing string of Chinese game development studios releasing big budget titles globally. It follows the road set out by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">which changed the game for developers in the region</a>. Others are coming alongside it, including Phantom Blade Zero, and Tides of Annihilation which are yet to be released.</p>

			<p>Bethesda's next major internal project for the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Fallout series</strong> is reportedly the long-rumored Fallout 3 remaster, a title that has been a sort of open secret since internal documents leaked in 2023.</p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">In a new interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview">GQ magazine</a>, <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Todd Howard, Bethesda's Director and Executive Producer, discussed the need for a&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"creative reset"</em>&nbsp;in the</span> The Elder Scrolls and </span>Fallout series. While the next entry in The Elder Scrolls series was formally announced years ago (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">though it is still a long way off</a>), the next Fallout game has yet to be confirmed.</p>



<p>Still, the franchise is very much alive. <em>"Hundreds"</em> of people at Bethesda are working on Fallout right now, and some of them are working on "some other things", according to Todd Howard.<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/7-years-after-it-was-announced-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/"> As reported by VGC</a>, one of these other things is a Fallout 3 remaster, similar to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-3-remastered-a-project-long-in-the-works">Fallout 3 Remastered: A Project Long in the Works</h2>



<p>Although a Fallout 3 remaster has never been officially announced, we have known for quite some time that it is in development. In September 2023, files attached to an FTC investigational hearing held remotely with Phil Spencer were leaked online,<a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/"> revealing Bethesda's internal plans from 2020 to 2024</a>. Among the projects listed for a tentative release from April 2024 to March 2025 was a remaster of Fallout 3. </p>



<p>As this scheduled predated the COVID-19 pandemic, plans significantly shifted, and most of the projects such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> released later than originall intended, so it's no surprise that even the remaster of the third entry in the post-apcalpytic series has yet to be released.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-new-coat-of-paint">A New Coat of Paint</h2>



<p>As the Fallout 3 remaster is reportedly similar to this year's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, it will likely utilize the Unreal Engine 5 for rendering and the original engine for gameplay, a trend that has become increasingly common in both remasters and remakes such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-campaign-evolved-comparison-massive-visual-improvements/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>. If this is indeed the case, the gameplay of the remaster will be virtually left untouched, which should make those looking for an authentic recreation of the now-classic role-playing game happy.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dont-buy-your-ipad-at-an-apple-store-amazon-just-dropped-the-base-wifi-model-to-pocket-change-2000642394</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-buy-your-ipad-at-an-apple-store-amazon-just-dropped-the-base-wifi-model-to-pocket-change.1348903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tablets have become essential tools for everything from streaming shows to taking notes in meetings but finding one that delivers premium performance without premium pricing remains a challenge. Apple dominates the tablet market because of the tight ecosystem integration and refined hardware; the 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip is the most affordable entry point into that experience. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">Currently priced at $299 on Amazon after its standard $349 retail price, this 2025 WiFi 128GB model</a> delivers the core iPad experience at the lowest this configuration has ever reached<strong>. Apple’s own website still sells this exact model at full price</strong>, which makes Amazon’s discount genuinely noteworthy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>The Sweet Spot for Most Users</h2>
<p>The A16 chip powering this iPad comes straight from Apple’s iPhone lineage and brings smartphone-class efficiency and processing power to tablet computing. This processor nudges along multiple running apps with ease: You seamlessly flip between Safari tabs, respond to messages, edit photos, and stream video without the sluggish performance that plagues cheaper Android tablets. The neural engine within the A16 Bionic greatly accelerates machine learning tasks, including photo recognition, voice processing and augmented reality applications.</p>



<p>The 11-inch Liquid Retina display strikes an ideal balance between portability and usable screen space. The 2360 x 1640 resolution delivers sharp text that remains readable even at smaller font sizes, making this iPad viable for extended reading sessions or document work. <strong>True Tone technology automatically adjusts the color temperature in the display based on the surrounding light</strong>&nbsp;and reduces eye strain when you move from bright outdoor environments into warm indoor lighting.</p>
<p>The <strong>camera system is actually far better than what most would expect from tablet cameras</strong>: The 12MP rear camera captures surprisingly good photos and 4K video, making this iPad capable of documenting events, scanning documents, or recording video content when your phone isn’t handy. The front 12MP camera, finally situated in a landscape orientation, puts the lens where it should be for video calls, centering you in frame when the iPad sits naturally on a desk or in a stand.</p>



<p>The 128GB of storage handles normal use patterns without requiring constant file management. You can have a good library of Netflix shows downloaded for offline viewing, store thousands of photos, install dozens of apps, and keep important documents locally accessible. Of course, cloud storage integration through iCloud allows you to easily expand beyond local storage for files you don’t need immediate access to. Having 128GB on board eliminates the anxiety that comes with 64GB models, which fill up frustratingly fast. This capacity hits that sweet spot whereby most users never feel constrained but aren’t paying extra for storage they’ll never use.</p>
<p>WiFi 6 connectivity itself offers faster wireless speeds and better performance in crowded networks compared with older WiFi standards which makes a noticeable difference when you download large files, stream high-resolution video, or use the iPad in environments with many competing devices on the same network. Furthermore, the increased efficiency means better battery life on network-intensive tasks as the WiFi 6 radio can transmit data faster and return to low-power states more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>The iPad is better integrated into the ecosystem of Apple devices</strong>, and creates great continuity between them. You can start typing something in an email on your iPad and then just finish it on your iPhone or Mac. Or copy text or an image on one and paste it into another using Universal Clipboard, start something on one device and pick it up where you left off with Handoff. It works so transparently that you stop thinking about which device you’re using and focus instead on what you’re trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>A rating of <strong>4.8 out of 5 stars based on over 12,000 reviews</strong> shows real end-user satisfaction in this iPad’s performance and reliability. That feedback comes from real buyers who use the device daily, providing confidence that the experience matches Apple’s promises.</p>
<p>At $299, this is Apple’s most accessible premium tablet offering to date, and bringss the iPad experience within reach of buyers who previously considered it too expensive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you were hoping for a release of The Elder Scrolls 6 anytime soon, you may want to sit down for this one. According to Bethesda’s Todd Howard, the latest game in the franchise is still “a long way off”.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GQ</a> to talk about Fallout 4’s 10th anniversary and other Bethesda happenings, Howard admitted that the game isn’t close to being ready for players.</p>



<p><strong>“I’m preaching patience,”</strong> he said. <strong>“I don’t want fans to feel anxious.”</strong></p>



<p>Howard said after raising money for Make-A-Wish that would see a character made in The Elder Scrolls 6, they had a three-hour play test of the game. He wanted to make clear though, that it wasn’t to signal that anything was close and that, if he has it his way, the announcement strategy would be a bit different.</p>



<p><strong>“I like to just announce stuff and release it,”</strong> Howard said. <strong>“My perfect version –&nbsp;and I’m not saying this is going to happen – is that it’s going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear.”</strong></p>



<p>When asked if he wanted it to be like The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remaster where it was shadow dropped in April, Howard didn’t rule it out.</p>



<p><strong>“You might say that was a test run,”</strong> he said. <strong>“It worked out well.”</strong></p>



<p>When do you think fans will get to play The Elder Scrolls 6, and do you think they would do a shadow drop release for such a highly anticipated game?

<p>Use these Roblox Strongman Ultra monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Energy and Energy Gain Potions. </p>



<p>Strongman Ultra is a gym-based simulation experience on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-invincible-showdown-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a>. To build a more muscular and toned avatar, you’ll need to lift weights, boost your cardiovascular fitness, and perform various exercises. Energy is the core resource that powers the gameplay. It determines how much your avatar can lift and how long they can keep training. Instead of grinding for hours to unlock new gym areas, you can easily redeem active codes to claim free Energy and Energy Potions. Use these rewards, hit the gym, and turn your gym rat into a full-fledged gym monster. &nbsp;<br></p>

<p>They say all roads lead to Rome, and that is certainly the case as anticipation for the release date of Anno 117: Pax Romana rapidly approaches, and we’ve got all the important timings you need to dive in.</p>



<p>The first entry in the long-running series in six years, Anno 117: Pax Romana is deploying as the latest city-building simulator, thrusting you in control of a crucial point of history, and excitement for the title continues to rise.</p>



<p>Release dates and start times vary, so it’s worth noting exactly when Anno 117: Pax Romana is available in your region.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-anno-117-pax-romana-coming-out">When is Anno 117: Pax Romana Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>All roads lead to Rome. Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Anno 117: Pax Romana is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on November 13, and will also be available as part of a Ubisoft+ subscription.</strong></p>



<p>The eighth instalment in the Anno series, and the first since Anno 1800 in 2019, Anno 117: Pax Romana continues the trend started by its predecessor of releasing on consoles—with the last release being the first time that has occurred in the main series.</p>



<p>Excitement for the title rose during the Steam Next Fest, when a demo of the game was available to play, and there isn’t too much longer to wait until the full release.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-anno-117-pax-romana-start-time">Do We Know The Anno 117: Pax Romana Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Anno 117: Pax Romana’s start times have been confirmed by Ubisoft, though the exact timing depends on your location in the world and your platform.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S have a staggered global release, becoming available to play from 12 AM local time, while PC has a global release at 3 PM PT on November 12—which means, for some players, the actual release date will be a day earlier than advertised.</p>



<p>The table below shows the start time on PC and consoles for Anno 117: Pax Romana in major time zones across the world.</p>

Karel Kolmann announced his move to the famed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and Witcher studio in a message <a href="https://x.com/Kadlosaurus/status/1987792793477976342?s=20">shared on social media</a>, appending it with a simple, "Things are happening!". Kolmann, if the name isn't immediately familiar, was part of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 studio Warhorse for eight years, where he variously served as writer, scripter, and senior game designer.
</p>
<p>
More recently, Kolmann took on the role of lead gameplay designer for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's Hardcore mode, which arrived back in April as part of a free post-launch update. As for what Kolmann is doing at CD Projekt, he'll be working as a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7392266619995189252/">senior quest designer on The Witcher 4</a>.

<p>
Work on CD Projekt's latest Witcher instalment was confirmed to have begun back in 2022, but it wasn't until last November that it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-confirms">officially entered "full-scale production"</a>. Since then, a smattering of details have emerged, including confirmation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">Ciri is taking over from Geralt of Rivia as the game's protagonist</a> (although Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle has hinted his character will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">be "part of" the new game</a>), and we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">got a small taste of its action</a> earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
The bad news for Witcher fans, though, is there's still a long wait until its eventual arrival. CD Projekt previously confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">won't be launching until after the end of 2026</a>, suggesting it might even be a next-gen game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Enshrouded, the popular survival game currently available on PC in early access, has just received its biggest update yet ahead of its 1.0 release due to arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2026. It's latest Wake of the Water update is available now, and adds highly requested features like voxel-based, dynamic water, a new biome, balance tweaks to combat, and more.</p>



<p>Developer and publisher Keen Games debuted two new trailers alongside today's update, one that's more of a cinematic showcase for the new Wake of the Water update, and another that goes into more detail about what's coming in this new update.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Enshrouded - Wake of the Water | Official Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KEYXq29Nj0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Some of the key features Wake of the Water adds is a whole new water biome with full underwater exploration and dynamic voxel water, which has been one of the most-requested features from players that Keen Games is finally making good on.</p>



<p>The new update also adds new bosses and enemies for players to face, an overhaul to combat with balance tweaks, the introduction of greatswords, new weapon skills, and armor sets. The new update also adds fishing as an activity for players to catch food and adds a new layer to the survival mechanics in Enshrouded, and several more quality-of-life improvements.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Wake of the Water is Enshrouded's seventh major update during the game's early access period and is the latest showcase for just how much the game has changed and evolved since its initial early access launch in January 2024.</p>



<p>In its initial four days in early access, Enshrouded <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-reaches-over-a-million-players-after-four-days-on-steam-early-access/">was able to reach one million players</a>.  It reached <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-hits-30-million-players-since-january/">three million players by August 2024</a>, and in April 2025, i<a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-shows-off-new-thralls-of-twilight-update-as-it-celebrates-surpassing-4-million-players/">t celebrated over four million players</a>. The growth Enshrouded has had since its launch is incredibly impressive, and it'll be interesting to see if it can continue the momentum it has seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-celebrates-1-year-of-early-access-confirms-1-0-launch-in-spring-2026/">early access through to its 1.0 launch next year</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Despite <span>being largely an interview about Fallout 4 (the </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Anniversary Editio</span>n</a>, which celebrates the game's tenth birthday, launches today), the article published today&nbsp;on GQ,&nbsp;featuring a conversation with Todd Howard, actually begins with The Elder Scrolls VI.</p>



<p>The game designer obviously knew that questions about the most anticipated game in Bethesda's pipeline would abound and prefaces the whole interview with the notion that the next iteration in The Elder Scrolls franchise is 'still a long way off', before adding that he's preaching patience to fans. Howard then admits that it's been too long since Skyrim, which launched in November 2011, but adds that the team as a whole needed a 'creative reset', which they tried to accomplish with Starfield and its different setting.</p>



<p>Later in the interview, after talking a bit about Fallout and the upcoming second season of the Amazon Prime Video TV series, Howard returns to TES VI. Apparently, there was a large playtest session just yesterday at Bethesda Game Studios:</p>



<p><em>We did a big play test yesterday for The Elder Scrolls VI, and you have to really look at the screen and say, “What is this? What does this need? Where are we at?” Great games are played, not made. The screen doesn’t lie.</em></p>



<p>Apparently, the team showed The Elder Scrolls VI to some fans who pulled funds via Make-A-Wish to commemorate a friend of theirs in the upcoming game. It's not the first time Bethesda has done something like this: they also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/uesp-wiki-met-bethesda-design-character-the-elder-scrolls-vi-excited/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed the game to some folks from the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages</a>, who left excited about the upcoming title.</p>



<p>In the GQ interview, Howard then says his perfect way to release the massively anticipated roleplaying game would be that, after 'a while', the game 'just appears'. He doesn't guarantee it will go this way, but when asked about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadow-drop of Oblivion Remastered</a>, the developer remarks:</p>



<p><em>You might say that was a test run. It worked out well.</em></p>



<p>Honestly, though, I doubt that will be the case. Microsoft will likely want to give the game, which was formally announced at E3 2018 alongside Starfield, at least some lead time. More likely is a scenario akin to Fallout 4, where Howard unveiled the game at E3 2015 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-4-review-a-welcoming-wasteland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released it</a> five months later on November 10, 2015. That would still be a relatively short lead time for a triple-A game of this hype.</p>



<p>Our best estimate at this point puts the game in a tentative late 2027 launch window at the earliest, although the first half of 2028 is even more likely. It wouldn't be the first time for an Elder Scrolls launch, either, as Oblivion was released in March 2006. Meanwhile, we'll report on any noteworthy The Elder Scrolls VI rumors.</p>

            <p>Sit down. "I’m preaching patience." Stay calm. "I don’t want fans to feel anxious." There's no need to hide underneath a chest of drawers. Some of those are things I've had to tell my firework-averse cat around Bonfire Night time here in the UK. Some of them are things Todd Howard has said about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> in a fresh interview that's also about Bethesda's imminently to be released again radioactive golden goose, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Elder Scrolls 6 is "still a long way off", according to the Bethesda bossman, speaking to <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview">GQ</a> from an office that has shelves (ooh, fancy). "I like to just announce stuff and release it," he added. "My perfect version – and I’m not saying this is going to happen – is that it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear."</p>
<p>I mean, technically it would be reappearing, given we all famously saw some its hills, ruins, and shrubbery <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-announced">back in 2018</a>. Well, assuming that E3 trailer actually showed a landscape that resembles anything like one that we'll be exploring all these years on. I personally can't wait to try and climb the exact rock you can see in the foreground on the right, at the 14 second or so mark. Sure, it's not one of the big mountains, but you've gotta start somewhere.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to cleanliness is next to Toddliness. He was also asked in light of his comment about the game just appearing whether Bethesda could shadow drop The Elder Scrolls 6, as they did with Oblivion Remastered. "You might say that was a test run. It worked out well," was his answer. If Oblivion Remastered's anything to go by, in that case we can look forward to at least six months or so of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">leak and report-inspired chatter</a> in the run-up, to make sure this game Bethesda confirmed they were making about seven years ago really catches everyone off guard.</p><p>In news I'll adopt a less snarky tone for, Howard also spoke a bit about meeting the folks from series wiki the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages when they popped by to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-elder-scrolls-6-memorial-character-moulded-by-tamriels-finest-internet-lorekeepers-is-now-set-in-stone">design a character for the game</a> as a memorial to a forum user whose mid-2000s roleplay campaigns have some interesting connections to proper Elder Scrolls lore.</p>
<p>The dev was also asked whether he'd drink toilet water to survive during a real nuclear apocalypse, which was the point at which he drew the line on a series of hypotheticals based around that scenario. He thinks he'd "do ok" if the world ended, which is all the proof I need that he's probably never watched the 1984 film Threads. Or, at the very least, he's somehow managed to forget about it. We'd all be fucked, fella.</p>
<p>Maybe he's got a plan to install his head on an immortal mech body or something, and he'll come hunt me down for chatting shit once the bombs drop. Now that would be a shadow drop with the element of surprise unquestionably on its side.</p>

              <p>Bethesda creative director Todd Howard knows the wait for the next <em>Elder Scrolls</em> RPG has been “too long.” But in a new interview, he once again asked fans to be patient, and hinted that maybe <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> or some other Bethesda game in the future might shadow-drop without warning.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview">In an interview with&nbsp;<em>GQ Magazine</em></a>&nbsp;mainly focused on the 10th anniversary of<a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-the-kotaku-review-1743410637"><em> Fallout 4,</em></a> Howard talked about the studio’s next game: <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-vi-6-tes6-update-release-date-bethesda-1851363646">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>.</em> First announced officially in 2018 via an E3 teaser, this next entry in the RPG franchise will be the first sequel since 2011’s <em>Skyrim</em>. And while Howard admits working on Starfield after <em>Fallout 4</em> was a nice “reset” for the team, he also acknowledges that the gap between sequels is too big.</p>

 <p>“I do like to have a break between them, where it isn’t like a ‘plus one’ sequel,” said Howard. “I think it’s also good for an audience to have a break – <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>&nbsp;has been too long, let’s be clear. But we wanted to do something new with&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em>. We needed a creative reset.” Howard also made it clear that <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> is still a “long way off.”</p>

 <p>“I’m preaching patience. I don’t want fans to feel anxious,” Howard told the outlet. Previously, the creative director suggested that Bethesda had announced the new RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-elder-scrolls-vi-6-2018-e3-teaser-early-1850770820">too early.</a></p> <h2><em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> (or something else…) might get shadow-dropped</h2> <p>Elsewhere in the interview, after admitting that <em>Fallout 4</em>‘s dialogue system wasn’t well received by fans, Howard talked about letting some folks who donated to Make-A-Wish play<em> Elder Scrolls 6</em> early via a recent playtesting session. And yes, Bethesda is playtesting the RPG a lot now as it’s the studio’s next big project. But it seems like Howard isn’t a fan of spending years and years teasing and talking about Bethesda’s next game.</p>

 <p>I like to just announce stuff and release it,” said Howard. “My perfect version–and I’m not saying this is going to happen–is that it’s going to be a while and then, one day, the [<em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>] will just appear.”</p>

 <p>When the interviewer pointed out that Bethesda shadow-dropped <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesdas-oblivion-remaster-is-out-now-on-xbox-ps5-an-1851777265"><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> earlier this year</a>, and it was a big hit, Howard vaguely teased: “You might say that was a test run. It worked out well.”</p> <p>Now, I don’t actually think Bethesda and Xbox will just launch the next mainline <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game without a marketing push. That would be wild. But I do think <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> proved that many of Bethesda’s past games are popular enough already that you don’t need to do much marketing to get people excited about a new version of a past classic. And over the last year or two, we’ve heard rumors and reports of a <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_3_remaster"><em>Fallout 3</em> remaster</a> being cooked up. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/7-years-after-it-was-announced-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/#google_vignette">And <em>VGC</em> reports that a <em>Fallout 3 r</em>emaster is in development.</a> Is Howard’s answer here alluding to that rumored remaster dropping without warning in the near future? Perhaps. <a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-bethesda-fallout-day-fallout-5-tease-event-remaster-2000638661">We know more <em>Fallout</em> projects are coming</a>. Just what those are and when we should expect them are still officially unknown.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bose-offloads-its-27-inch-dolby-atmos-soundbar-now-selling-at-a-new-record-low-on-amazon-only.1348843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Modern flatscreen TVs give you crystal-clear pictures but their razor-thin designs leave almost no room for decent speakers, so you end up with tinny audio that degrades your viewing experience. The B<strong>ose Dolby Atmos soundbar remedies this basic problem</strong>&nbsp;and makes your TV’s sound go from underwhelming to truly immersive, and<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5419/"> right now it’s just $399 at Amazon, down from its usual $499</a>. That’s a n<strong>ew all-time low</strong> on Bose’s compact all-in-one soundbar that crams theater-quality audio into a 27-inch frame.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5419/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>How Bose Packed Theater Sound Into 27 Inches</h2>
<p>The acoustic engineering inside this soundbar defies what you’d expect from such a compact unit: <strong>Bose squeezed five separate transducers into the frame</strong>&nbsp;including two upward-firing drivers that bounce sound off your ceiling to create height channels for Dolby Atmos content. This upward projection simulates the overhead audio effects you’d get from ceiling-mounted speakers in a proper home theater, making helicopters sound like they’re flying above you and rain feel like it’s falling from the sky. The <em>TrueSpace</em> technology takes this further by analyzing non-Atmos content like standard stereo or 5.1 surround mixes and intelligently upmixing them into immersive multi-channel experiences. That means even<strong> older movies, regular TV shows, and music benefit from spatial processing</strong> that adds depth and dimension to the soundstage.</p>



<p>AI Dialogue Mode addresses one of the biggest beefs with modern content: mumbly dialogue mixed too low beneath music and effects. This <strong>smart processing evens out vocal frequencies against background noises</strong> which brings conversations to the front of the mix without making the dialogue sound artificially separated or processed. You’ll finally catch every word of dialogue on those prestige dramas when the actors are whispering dramatically, and you won’t miss any plot-critical conversations during action sequences.</p>



<p>The streaming capabilities baked into this soundbar make it <strong>more than just a device to improve your TV audio</strong>. Bluetooth allows you to stream music directly from your phone, while Apple AirPlay 2 offers higher-quality wireless audio if you’re using an iOS device, along with multi-room audio if you have other AirPlay speakers. Spotify Connect lets you start music on your phone and then hand off playback to the soundbar, so you can use Spotify’s app as a remote control while the soundbar pulls audio directly from the service for better quality than Bluetooth streaming.</p>



<p>Setup simplicity makes this soundbar approachable even if you are not particularly tech-savvy: A single HDMI connection to your TV handles both audio from the TV and pass-through for connected devices like game consoles or streaming boxes, eliminating the tangle of cables that usually comes with traditional surround sound systems. The soundbar automatically detects when you’ve turned on your television and powers up accordingly, providing a seamless experience where you’re not thinking of the audio system separately from your television. The <strong>compact width of 27 inches fits comfortably in front of most televisions</strong> without blocking much of the view or overwhelming smaller entertainment centers and the low profile maintains a clutter-free aesthetic in your living space.</p>
<p>The<strong> sound quality this bar produces competes with multi-speaker setups</strong> costing considerably more. The bass response reaches surprisingly low for a soundbar without a separate subwoofer, offering enough low-end impact for most content without adding another box to your room. The clarity across the frequency range ensures instruments remain distinct in complex musical passages and that sound effects maintain their character rather than blurring together.</p>
<p>At $399, it’s the most affordable way into premium TV audio from Bose with the brand’s signature sound at the lowest price this model has ever seen. It checks off all the boxes that include Dolby Atmos support.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-black-firday-sales-2025-mario-zelda-2000642413</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-reveals-its-black-friday-deals-and-they-aren%E2%80%99t-great.1348840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I guess it’s that time of year again already. Nintendo just announced its sales for Black Friday 2025 and they are…not that impressive. Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">the Switch 2</a> remains full price. But there’s also no discounted Switch bundle in sight, and the slate of Switch games that are on sale for up to $30 off aren’t exactly the cream of the crop.</p>

 <p>Let’s start with which deals the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251110046253/en/Nintendo-Announces-Holiday-Offers-for-Black-Friday-and-Cyber-Monday-2025">Nintendo Black Friday 2025 sale</a> does include. First, Samsung MicroSD Express Cards for Switch 2 will be $20 off at select stores starting November 30. Second, a handful of <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Street Fighter</em> 6 amiibo will be $10 off. Finally, here are the Nintendo games that will be discounted starting November 23:</p>

 <ul> <li><strong><i>Princess Peach: Showtime! </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Luigi’s Mansion 3 </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe</i></strong> – $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Super Mario Odyssey</i></strong> – $30 (50 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Nintendo Switch Sports </i></strong>– $30 (50 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door </i></strong>– $30 (50 percent off)</li> <li><i><strong>Splatoon 3</strong> </i>– $30 (50 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>Most of these are either B-tier releases or came out quite a while ago. There’s no <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> or <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, and <em>Mario Kart</em> is MIA as well. Other retailers might run their own discounts on physical Nintendo games, but it seems pretty clear the company is treating much of its back catalog as functionally brand-new releases for potential new Switch 2 owners this holiday.</p>

 <h2>RIP Switch Black Friday bundles</h2> <p>While Walmart, Target, and other retailers could still do their own deals, it’s disappointing that Nintendo seems to have retired the Switch bundles that it had been hauling out every Christmas for <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-black-friday-2024-deals-mk8-zelda-totk-1851696187">the last couple years</a>. There’s no <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle for the OG Switch or Switch OLED, and no returning Switch Lite sale. Combined with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-inflation-tariffs-2000614220">price increases over the summer</a>, the older hardware will actually be more expensive this holiday than last.</p> <p>The lack of any special Switch 2 deals from Nintendo isn’t surprising at all. In fact, the $500<em> Mario Kart World</em> bundle the console launched with was essentially already that, giving you the hardware and game for $30 below the regular MSRP. I guess fans should just be thankful that Nintendo hasn’t raised the price of the Switch 2 yet and has plenty of stock for the end of 2025. The company said it doesn’t <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-sale-discount-2000642086">foresee any more price hikes</a> in the immediate future, unless another unexpected trade war erupts.</p>
