		<p>If you like the future Western aesthetic then Paradark Studios’ ExeKiller is one to keep an eye on. Described as a retro future Western, ExeKiller is set in a dystopian future where a catastrophic event has turned Earth into a scorched desert planet. But an apocalyptic event won’t get in the way of the darker side of human nature, meaning a bounty hunter is needed to find some criminals.</p>
<p><iframe title="ExeKiller - Gameplay Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dEeUzd4nAmQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the new gameplay overview, Paradark Studios shows different aspects of the world which you inhabit as Denzel Fenix, aka the bounty hunter known as ExeKiller. He works for the Helion company and as the story progresses revelations about the world and himself make Denzel a target for different factions. That means players have to be on the lookout for danger everywhere.</p>
<p>ExeKiller is set in a semi open world with one of the central locations being The Tower. Here Denzel can upgrade and purchase gear, gather information, and pick up some bounties to hunt. It is a generally safe area, a stark difference to the world outside. Denzel travels across the world in a car that has been designed to withstand things like severe weather and radiation, but you cannot avoid such dangers all of the time. Out of the car, Denzel has to be aware of both enemies and the environment which could turn to make things difficult. Players have full autonomy on how missions are resolved with no set linear paths. You can choose to go in all guns blazing, sneak around, talk your way through situations, or a mixture of all of these approaches. Whatever approach is chosen will impact how NPCs and factions react to Denzel, and the game’s ending. There is no XP to earn in the game with Denzel’s skills reliant on player skill and the mods and augments that are installed in Denzel.</p>

<p>A release date for ExeKiller has yet to be confirmed and so far it has only been confirmed for PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When <strong>Larian Studios</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/">announced <strong>Divinity</strong></a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, it likely did not think what would follow would be swarms of backlash targeted at the studio and its chief executive officer, <strong>Swen Vincke</strong>. Not because it had announced a new Divinity game, but because Vincke had made it clear that Larian had <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/">been experimenting with using GenAI tools in its development process</a>.</p>



<p>Those comments came with considerable backlash, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/">to which Vincke responded fairly bluntly</a> before trying a more measured statement, but that did not stop players and other game developers in the industry who are entirely against the use of GenAI tools from hurling more vitriol towards Larian Studios. Game writers and some former Larian developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-writers-call-out-larian-studios-for-poor-hiring-practices-amidst-genai-backlash/">even took the opportunity to pile on Larian more with the airing of grievances</a> around the studio's poor hiring practices and how it introduced GenAI in the first place.</p>



<p>Other members of the industry, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/">Warhorse Studios founder and creative director Daniel Vávra stood up to defend Larian</a>, but it seemed that Larian's critics would not be satisfied with anything short of Vincke entirely denouncing the use of GenAI tools and admitting he and the team were wrong to even try using them. To cap off his comments on the topic in 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">Vincke said "<em>a lot has been lost in translation</em>"</a> on the topic, and promised that he and the team would do a Reddit AMA to let players ask whatever questions they want to provide a clear and final word on the topic.</p>



<p>Well, that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">Reddit AMA has been happening today</a>, and it should be no surprise that t<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">he first question was all about GenAI tools</a> and their role in Divinity's development, and within Larian Studios overall.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Vincke was the one to answer it, and while he did not provide the answer that would satisfy the biggest GenAI critics, he did clear up one element of the studio's generative AI use.</p>



<p>"<em>So first off - there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity</em>," Vincke began. "<em>I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration. We already said this doesn’t mean the actual concept art is generated by AI but we understand it created confusion.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>So, to ensure there is no room for doubt, we’ve decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development.</em> <em>That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art.</em>"</p>



<p>But Vincke didn't stop there. While the studio will "<em>refrain from using genAI</em>" for concept art, other areas are still on the table, as a means of trying to speed up development where possible.</p>



<p>"<em>Having said that, we continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out. The more iterations we can do, the better in general the gameplay is.</em> <em>We think GenAI can help with this and so we’re trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>The important bit to note is that we will not generate “creative assets” that end up in a game without being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data. If we use a GenAI model to create in-game assets, then it’ll be trained on data we own</em>."</p>



<p>In a follow-up question, Larian Studios' writing director <strong>Adam Smith</strong> confirmed that the approach to GenAI tools in concept art applies to writing as well, even when it comes to just using generative text as a placeholder. "<em>The stance applies to writing as well. We don't have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity</em>," Smith wrote.</p>



<p>"<em>To answer your second question, 'how does generated placeholder text benefit development over simple stub text'"- it doesn't. We had a limited group experimenting with tools to generate text, but the results hit a 3/10 at best and those tools are for research purposes, not for use in Divinity. Even my worst first drafts - and there are a LOT of them - are at least a 4/10 (although Swen might disagree), and the amount of iteration required to get even individual lines to the quality we want is enormous. From the initial stub to the line we record and ship, there are a great many eyes and hands involved in getting a dialogue right.</em>"</p>



<p>So it's not the answer that the studio's biggest critics would like, but it's clear that the needle has moved on Larian Studios' use of GenAI. For now, the use of generative AI tools in game development will continue to be a controversial topic, whichever side of the aisle you're on.</p>

            <p>This is proving to be one of the worst weeks of my life, for various reasons (no, not because Jason Schreier is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-may-not-yet-be-content-complete-and-another-release-delay-is-possible-claims-jason-schreier">mad at me</a>). In my time of need, I open the magic portal of escapism and find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-3">Pathologic 3</a> looking back at me like a poison toad.</p><!--more-->
<p>Hello, Pathologic 3! You are that game about saving a town of butchers from the grandfather of all plagues. You are the Stoppardian fantasy about interrogating the bodies and souls of tricksters, oligarchs and killers. You are the inner wobble between mania and apathy. You are the doomed mayoral enterprise in which players impose quarantines and roadblocks, while trying to maintain the trust of some powerful factions. You are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/">out now-ish on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve got a time-rewinding feature these days, so that players can reverse their foolish decisions without starting afresh? You're giving players the ability to clear away miasma using some kind of refillable doohickey? Generous of you, Pathologic 3, but I can see the rusty meat cleaver in your other hand.</p>
<p>RPS has an ancient, fraught relationship with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a> series. We are beloved among the elder Pathologgers for Quintin Smith’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/butchering-pathologic-part-1-the-body">three-part essay on the original 2005 game</a>, and we are also... disliked, to put it gently, for being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-2s-easy-mode-lets-you-soak-in-the-dread-of-an-unwell-town">somewhat ambivalent about Pathologic 2</a> – the sequel-turned-remake dedicated to just one of the original game’s three playable protagonists. I’m likely going to be reviewing Pathologic 3, and I’m already dreading the fallout if I conclude that I am Not Keen. Still, duty calls. Something's calling, anyway. I hear it in the basement. It sounds like it has a voicebox made entirely of teeth.</p><p>Where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a> concerned the doings of the Haruspex, a returning local son who fights the plague using a mixture of surgery and steppe lore, Pathologic 3 focuses on the Bachelor, an academic doctor who is pursuing a rumoured immortal man. While it has similar rancid geography, and the same atmosphere of phantasmagorical confusion and despair, it’s a very different and perhaps an easier game in many respects, as Brendy found when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-quarantine-drops-the-hunger-meters-so-you-can-play-doctor">playing the demo last year</a>. </p>
<p>The often-exhausting open world format is gone. You don’t have to worry as much about the bare necessities of survival, either, and the time-jumping feature allows for some trial and error, though this isn’t exactly routine savescumming – as Brendy summarised, “you earn time travel gunge by playing a euthanasia minigame where you ease the passing of dying people in the street by administering morphine or other drugs”. A Tardis powered by human souls? How very pathological of you, Pathologic 3.</p>
<p>Developers Ice-Pick Lodge appear to be in a difficult place at the moment. Last year, founder Nikolay Dybowski left the studio after players <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ice-pick-lodge-founder-nikolay-dybowski-departs-pathologic-dev">discovered allegations of abuse and kidnapping</a>. The remaining staff have yet to really comment on these reports. It’s not clear they ever will. I can imagine the painful legalities that may be involved.</p>
<p>Ice Pick are Russian-founded, and you may wish to avoid their games if you’re concerned about indirectly funding Russia’s vicious, zealous and cynical attack on Ukraine. They are currently based in Kazakhstan, however, who appear cautiously supportive of Ukraine’s independence and are calling for peace (I am no expert on the geopolitics here). The developers have also spoken out against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, commenting back in 2022 that "a crime is being committed in our name”. </p><p>If Pathologic 3 is a success, Ice-Pick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-devs-keen-to-avoid-premature-promises-about-bringing-back-the-changeling-in-pathologic-4">will hopefully make Pathologic 4</a>. This will star the Changeling, a young girl who can restore life or take it away through touch. Pathologic aside, Ice Pick are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-pathologic-devs-are-making-darkwood-2-with-acid-wizards-blessing-in-a-frankly-outrageous-piece-of-horror-synergy">partnering with Hooded Horse and Acid Wizard to make Darkwood 2</a>.  </p>

            <p>Larian CEO Swen Vincke has provided an update as to how the studio are planning to go about handling the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-want-to-release-divinity-in-three-to-four-years-and-theyre-making-limited-use-of-generative-ai">use of generative AI</a> in the making of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-larian">Divinity</a>. In an effort to alleviate concerns, the newly decided plan is to avoid using it in any capacity as part of the concept art development process. In general, Larian are aiming to ensure any in-game generated assets in their games come from models "trained" on data Larian already own, rather than risking the charge of creative theft or actual copyright breach.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Vincke revealed these plans in an answer to a question about the studio's Generative AI use submitted to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">public AMA session</a> the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-announce-plans-to-let-folks-ask-anything-about-their-generative-ai-use-asserting-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation">have hosted today</a>, January 9th. The exec kicked off by stating that "there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity", though he seemingly isn't ruling it out for future games.</p>
<p>"I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration," he continued. "We already said this doesn’t mean the actual concept art is generated by AI but we understand it created confusion. So, to ensure there is no room for doubt, we’ve decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development. That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art."</p>
<p>Further on in his response, he outlined the studio's current plan when it comes to using generative AI to make art in games at large. "We will not generate 'creative assets' that end up in a game without being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data," Vincke wrote. "If we use a GenAI model to create in-game assets, then it’ll be trained on data we own."</p>

</span></p><p>In between those two points, the CEO made clear that Larian still plan to experiment with generative AI in other areas.

"We think GenAI can help with this and so we’re trying things out across departments.

"There is currently one example of machine learning generated assets that end up in the game and that is within our cinematics and animation pipeline," he wrote. "In this pipeline we try to capture the actor's performances as best as we can, so we use machine learning models to clean, retarget and even add motion when it's not motion captured. These models are trained exclusively with Larian data."</p>
<p>In my eyes, the changes outlined by Vincke are generally positive, though the matter of controlling and knowing definitively where every bit of data a model has pulled from originates feels like something which could be tough to pull off in practice. I'm no expert, though - perhaps the solution is as simple as locking your herd of generative AI models in an isolated room that only contains internal data. In the long run, there's also the question of whether 'acceptable' usage of generative AI like this might lead to more wholesale and unregulated adoption down the road.</p>
<p>For now, at least there'll be no weird AI portraits in whichever dungeons Divinity sends you to investigate.</p>

              <p><span>Nintendo, a company that </span><a href="https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/70994/nintendo-releases-2024-25-fiscal-earnings-and-projections-for-first-year-of-switch-2"><span>regularly brings in billions of dollars each year</span></a><span>, could have easily afforded to set up a real photoshoot to promote its upcoming line of </span><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/my-mario/"><span>My Mario</span> <span>toys</span></a><span> coming to its New York City and San Francisco stores in February, but it looks like it might have used genAI instead. At least, that’s what people think after looking at the photos of parents playing with their kids and the </span><i><span>Mario </span></i><span>toys.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I admit, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-season-7-gen-ai-tim-sweeney-latata-2000649103"><span>AI witch hunt</span></a><span> has gotten out of hand, so when I looked at the supposed AI images, I had several moments of doubt. Maybe some people’s hands and fingers just look like that, and the growing fear that AI art is infecting everything around me has completely distorted my idea of what hands look like? Maybe it’s possible for a thumb to twist like that, or for a child’s hand to squish into their mother’s like we see here.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658445"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658445">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I caught myself looking at my own hands multiple times while writing this just to make sure I know what hands actually look like, just to test the limits of my mind as I wondered if an image of a woman’s fingers looking almost twice as long as her palms to hold a tablet was out of the realm of reality. I’ve got tiny hands, so maybe I’m not the best judge.</span></p>

 <p><span>Whatever the case, fans have already run with the assumption that these images are AI-generated in the replies to Nintendo’s social media posts on </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/NintendoAmerica/posts/pfbid02fPQ2Jr4GHpvW19uvHJgrWejxt3XMRWWF3yAjMtvi18VQsL8HjMiCgiTtp3rfQpVJl"><span>Facebook</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/NintendoStoreUS/status/2009280600608268620"><span>X</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing My Mario, a collection of products, games, and experiences inspired by Mario and his Mushroom Kingdom friends, designed for young children and their parents.

<p>Larain has revealed that they will refrain from using GenAI tools for concept art or dialogue text generation for Divinity following recent community blowback.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Larian Studios was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under fire</a> from the community recently after the CEO stated that “everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it” regarding AI. The CEO later confirmed that the dev team will hold an AMA to clear up confusion about AI usage and address other aspects of the game, and that day has finally arrived. </p>



<h2 id="h-divinity-will-not-feature-any-genai-art-or-text-generation">Divinity Will Not Feature Any GenAI Art or Text Generation</h2>



<p>Revealed through Larian’s Divinity AMA on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games</a>, Larian CEO Swen Vincke has confirmed that “there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity.” Vincke then addressed the discussion around “AI tools as part of concept art exploration”, explaining that it didn’t mean the concept art was generated through AI; however, to avoid any confusion in the community, they have decided to “refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development.” </p>



<p>At the same time, the development team has been constantly working on speeding up the development process and feels that GenAI can help with this process. GenAI can help in refining ideas faster, “leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.” </p>



<p>However, the CEO has confirmed that Larian “will not generate ‘creative assets’ that end up in a game without being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data.” If GenAI ends up being used to create in-game assets, it will be trained on the data Larian owns. The Writing Director for Divinity confirmed that the same stance applies for the writing as well, and they “don’t have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity.” </p>



<p>In other news, Larian has confirmed that players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-says-players-dont-need-to-play-older-divinity-games-for-the-new-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t need to play older games</a> before the upcoming Divinity title. Additionally, the game will follow the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-plans-to-follow-the-same-early-access-format-as-other-larian-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same early access format</a> as the previous titles.

            <title><![CDATA[There’s A 4th Game Coming During The Xbox Developer Direct]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/4th-game-during-xbox-developer-direct/</link>
            <guid>1401604</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On Thursday, Microsoft confirmed three games would be appearing at the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct later this month. When the three games were announced, many fans were left wondering if that would be it for the event. Well, according to a new report, there’s at least one more game.</p>



<p>First mentioned by Shinobi on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot36-oops-all-obsidian.1310962/page-215#post-149812867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reset Era forums</a>, Xbox is planning to show a “secret fourth game” during the Developer Direct. Shortly there after, another outlet corroborated those claims.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-this-fourth-game-at-xbox-developer-direct">What Is This Fourth Game At Xbox Developer Direct?</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-xbox-developer-direct-will-feature-a-secret-unannounced-fourth-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, the fourth game not only exists, but it’s reportedly a <strong>“promising indie title from a third-party publisher”. </strong></p>



<p>No other details on what this game could be was mentioned by either Shinobi or VGC. </p>



<p>Despite the reliability of both sources, it’s important to note that plans can change and that everything should be taken with a grain of salt until either the show airs, or it can be confirmed by Insider Gaming.</p>







<p>As far as what is guaranteed to be there, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-games-confirmed-for-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox confirmed</a> that Forza Horizon 6, Fable, and Game Freak’s Beast of Reincarnation will be shown. Forza Horizon 6 will get its first gameplay reveal, Beast of Reincarnation will see details of the game’s protagonist Emma’s plan manipulation abilities, and Fable will get its first extended look. </p>



<p>Last year’s show featured games like Doom: The Dark Ages, Ninja Gaiden 4, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 3. There was even a surprise Ninja Gaiden 2 Black shadow drop announced.</p>



<p>What are you looking forward to the most from the Xbox Developer Direct this month? Leave your thoughts down in the comments and join the discussion in the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

Regarded as one of the best entries in the entire franchise, Path of Radiance will be available for all Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers.</p><p>First released in 2005, Path of Radiance earned critical acclaim for its dark storyline, mature themes, and for being the first 3D Fire Emblem game. Set on the fictional continent of Tellius, the game follows the mercenary Ike and his companions as they set out to rescue a princess and save the kingdom of Crimea from the invading nation of Daein.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo GameCube Classics – Official Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p>Like previous Fire Emblem games, Path of Radiance is a turn-based tactical RPG that features permadeath: Any character who falls in battle is permanently lost for the rest of the game. A sequel--Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn--was released for the Nintendo Wii in 2007.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/">GameCube Classics library has </a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/">slowly grown</a> since its launch last year and now includes games like Super Mario Strikers, The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, and F-Zero GX. Each game benefits from a higher resolution than the original releases, and for an extra touch of authenticity, Nintendo sells a wireless controller designed after the original GameCube controller.</p><p>While it doesn't have a concrete release date yet, Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave is expected to arrive later this year. The game was revealed in September 2025, and the debut trailer hinted that it could be set in the same continuity as 2019's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-three-houses/">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a>.</p>

                <p>The extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> has proven to be one of the top hits of 2025, which has in turn attracted some unscrupulous players who aren't above cheating to win. After the rule-abiding Arc Raiders players became vocal about their displeasure, Embark Studios has announced that new anti-cheat measures are on their way to the game.</p><p>"We've seen the discussion around the topic of cheaters in Arc Raiders," reads the message shared on Arc Raiders' Discord server via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-has-a-cheater-problem-but-embarks-says-significant-changes-are-coming-to-detection-and-ban-systems/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "Please know that we are taking this issue very seriously and are listening to, and acting on your feedback. Over the next few weeks, we are implementing significant changes to our rulesets and deploying new detection mechanisms to identify and remove cheaters. This includes updating our Anti-Cheat systems for improved detection and bans, as well as applying client-side fixes specifically addressing the 'out of map glitch.' Furthermore, we are introducing tools for streamers to help mitigate stream sniping."</p><p>A firm timetable for the anti-cheat measures wasn't disclosed. However, Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund recently revealed that Arc Raiders has quietly introduced "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-now-features-aggression-based-matchmaking-dev-confirms/1100-6537178/" data-ref-id="1100-6537178">aggression-based matchmaking</a>." Söderlund went on to clarify that matchmaking is still skill-based, but it will also match players "based on how likely you are to engage in fights with fellow players."</p><p>Earlier this month, Arc Raiders hit a new peak of daily active users <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">with 3.2 million players</a>. Over the two-week holiday period, Arc Raiders also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/arc-raiders-and-more-dominated-steams-holiday-sales-chart/2900-7387/" data-ref-id="2900-7387">outperformed every other game on Steam</a>. Outside of the game, an Arc Raiders player shared that their in-game cries for help were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-player-screaming-for-help-gets-frantic-visit-from-real-life-neighbor/1100-6537173/" data-ref-id="1100-6537173">answered by a concerned neighbor</a> who tried to kick down the door to assist them.</p>

            <p>Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin would probably be quite surprised by how the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> - which he helped developer FromSoftware create a backstory for - actually turned out in the end.</p>
<p>That's according to Elden Ring game director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a>, who has said that while Martin was part of the game's development in terms of laying foundations for its world-building and such, it was the studio's own narrative team that actually took what Martin devised and then built upon it. And, there are some cases where the team and Miyazaki built upon it so much, that Martin himself may not actually recognise it.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/12/16/the-soul-of-soulslike">Game Informer</a>, Miyazaki said "as a player walks through this world, [...] they have a very fragmented understanding of the lore, the surroundings, and the type of monsters, whereas I don't" (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/game-of-thrones-author-george-r-r-martins-starting-point-for-elden-ring-evolved-so-drastically-that-hidetaka-miyazaki-reckons-hed-be-surprised-how-the-open-world-rpg-turned-out/">Games Radar</a>).</p>
<p>As Miyazaki knew the world of Elden Ring in its entirety, the director therefore wanted to ensure that the important moments for those who did not have the same level of knowledge didn't get "lost". This saw the director bringing "the map and level design" of Elden Ring together, so it could "serve as a guide" which would "help players pick up more information and piece together what they think that world is", he explained.</p><p>But while Martin may be perhaps be surprised by how some of his lore building efforts evolved for the final release, Miyazaki doesn't have any regrets about the necessary changes which made Elden Ring an all-round experience for players. In fact, the director said Elden Ring even now remains "in a league of its own".</p>

<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/george-r-r-martin-admits-he-hasnt-played-elden-ring-as-people-seem-to-want-this-winds-of-winter-book">Martin admitted he hadn't played Elden Ring</a>, despite providing backstory. Before its release, though, the author did say <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2021/12/18/long-long-ago/">he thought Elden Ring looked pretty incredible</a>.</p>
<p>As for expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, Martin didn't provide any new material for FromSoftware. "Essentially it is the same as it was with the base game," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-fromsoftwares-largest-expansion-ever">Miyazaki told Eurogamer ahead of the DLC's release in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>"The DLC Shadow of the Erdtree is based on one part of that original mythos that he penned for us. It's not a brand new mythos that he's written specifically for Shadow of the Erdtree, he has not created something new which informed the design of the DLC. It's simply another part of the original story that we thought fit to tell as a new expansion."</p>

<figure data-uuid="1165974a982f9"><a title="Switch 2 - Dbrand" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1165974a982f9/switch-2-dbrand.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>When Nintendo announced the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-reveals-first-new-joy-con-2-colours-for-switch-2">new alternative colour Joy-Con controllers for the Switch 2</a> this week, one thing became adamantly clear: it's quite possible that we'll never get any solid colour Joy-Con. Those little accents around the analogue sticks are likely all you'll see when the Joy-Con are attached to the console. And that's fine, y'know?</p>
<p>But if you're not especially pleased about this, then accessory manufacturer Dbrand might have you covered. The company has revealed that it is launching 'ColorMatched' skins that will effectively take the accented colours of the new Joy-Con and apply the same colour to the entire controllers. The result, provided to apply them properly, is pretty neat.</p>

<p>Now, we've never really been fans of Dbrand's 'edgy' humour, since it often borders on being completely unprofessional, but there's no denying its quality when it comes to controller skins. So if you're in the market and you want your Joy-Con controllers to look a bit more like the OG Switch, then it might well be something to look into. They cost <strong>$19.95</strong> directly from <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/skins/nintendo-switch-2-skins">Dbrand's website</a>.</p>
<p>As for the new 'Light Purple / Light Green' Joy-Con, these will launch very soon on <strong>12th February 2026</strong>. They'll set you back <strong>$99.99</strong> in the US and <strong>£74.99</strong> in the UK.</p>

  </picture><h2>Fifth Place - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><p>Developer: Team Cherry | Release Date: September 4th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Otton</p><p>Everything about <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> just feels right. The movement, the animations, the frenetic pace to combat, the wonderfully weird world to explore... It's no surprise to see this rank on our list.</p><p>Sometimes <em>Silksong </em>can feel unfairly hard, but there is a certain ethos to most of the game. There's always an advantage to be found, a pattern to be learned. It's never cheap deaths, but certainly punishing ones as you learn new enemies or boss encounters (though I could do without some of those delivery quests).</p><p>As one of the most highly anticipated games in the last few years, I think <em>Silksong </em>lived up to expectations. There's a lot to love for action platformer fans, metroidvania fans, those that love the lore of the series, and just generally gaming fans as it's just solid through and through.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Fourth Place - Ghost of Yotei</h2><p>Developer: Sucker Punch Productions | Release Date: October 2nd, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>I got around to <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> in December, a couple of months after it was initially released. Maybe it’s because I was trying to avoid spoiling myself, but I didn’t see a great deal of talk about <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. At least, not when compared to other PlayStation exclusives.</p><p>Nonetheless, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> deserves your attention. It took TechRaptor’s top spot for Best Visual Design of 2025, and well, go figure. Take one look at the game and you’ll see why: It’s jawdroppingly gorgeous. The world is large but densely-packed, so it’s very easy to find yourself going off course and completing various quests or side objectives, though it also doesn’t feel like a collect-a-thon, a common pitfall many open world games fall into.</p><p>Outside of visuals, though, we get to see the journey of Atsu as she sets out on a journey of revenge many years in the making. She’s out to kill the Yotei Six, a group of evildoers that killed her family and now threaten to control all of Hokkaido.</p><p>In this quest for revenge, gameplay is a standout. Combat is smooth but weighty, as Atsu delivers devastating blows with her varied arsenal, including katanas, spears, and shinobi weapons. Atsu is more in-your-face than <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>’s Jin Sakai, so while you can resort to stealth, there’s a larger focus tackling your foes up front and in their face.</p><p>For a game as long as <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is, one would think combat gets stale after a while, but that never happened. Enough new weapons and enemies are introduced to make encounters feel fresh, and man, the feedback from that DuelSense is really somethin’ else.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Third Place - Hades II</h2><p>Developer: Supergiant Games | Release Date: September 25th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Hades II builds on its predecessor in arguably every department, both in terms of quantity and quality. There are twice as many levels, even more bosses, and a nearly doubled soundtrack. All that centers around the already-impeccable gameplay loop that Supergiant built in the previous game.</p><p>It would be so easy to say<em> Hades II</em> is just its predecessor but bigger, and that captures a majority of it. It's a classic case of not breaking what worked so well while iterating to make parts of it fresh.</p><p>Playing as a witch instead of a warrior comes with some nuances, like how Melinoe has to play it safe at the start. But usually by the end of a run, you're melting entire rooms of enemies with a chaotic chain of curses and effects.</p><p><em>Hades II </em>features a satisfying combat gameplay loop peppered with narrative moments from characters in the Crossroads and out in the wild. Even the bosses all have their own stories, making the world feel that much richer.</p><p>So yes, <em>Hades II</em> is just <em>Hades </em>but better—but the first game didn't win our GOTY in 2020 for no reason, after all.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><p>Developer: Sandfall Interactive | Release Date: April 24th, 2025&nbsp;</p><p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p><p>Sandfall Interactive's <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> was a major success by all accounts for the studio. Their debut title managed to gain a spotlight in the gaming community thanks to its modern blend of stunning visuals, gripping character performances, and impressive symphonic musical score.</p><p>The biggest secret to its success is how <em>Clair Obscu</em>r manages to put a new look and feel on familiar turn-based RPG gameplay. While the individual elements aren't new to veterans of the genre, the distinct mix presented helped lower the barrier for many who were dismissive of the genre's merits.</p><p>For those accomplishments, this title deserves its spot.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Blue Prince</h2><p>Developer: Dogubomb | Release Date: April 10th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p><p>There hasn't been a game that I've thought about more this year. Stepping into Blue Prince you're met with an entertaining puzzle roguelite experience of trying to build your way through a house of ever-changing rooms. This simple plan gets bogged down as suddenly you need to learn how to unlock a door, or reach a basement, unlock a side gate or get into an orchard.</p><p>Blue Prince does a fantastic job of starting simple, with a clear goal for the player to complete, while simultaneously seeding in other mysteries and puzzles. By the time you are at the end of one thread, there are four or five other threads that have come up. Simple mechanics get iterated upon until you complete the game, and this serves as a fine point to step off the ride, but for those wanting further puzzles to complete the game doubles in length.</p><p>Blue Prince is a true indie development story of how time and a single great idea were able to capture the minds of thousands and leave us wanting just one more puzzle to complete, even after it's all over. Blue Prince joins the ranks of many other meta puzzle games that I'll be recommending to friends for years to come.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/divinity-gen-ai-larian-bg3-reddit-ama-2000658429</link>
            <guid>1401550</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke has now shared more details about how the acclaimed RPG studio will be approaching the use of generative AI tools for developing its next game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845"><em>Divinity</em></a>. Speaking to fans in an AMA on Reddit, the director walked back a previous statement that Larian would use generative AI to help with references for concept art, but did say that <em>Divinity</em> could include gen-AI assets in the finished game as long as the studio is “100 percent sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data.”</p> <p>The gaming veteran landed in hot water last month <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912">over comments in an interview with<em> Bloomberg</em></a> about how Larian was experimenting with AI tools in the production of its next game, including generating references for concept art, producing PowerPoints, and other early production work that could help speed up the prototyping trial and error phase. At the same time, the CEO doubled down on the idea that no AI elements would appear in the finished game and stated that the studio wasn’t turning to the controversial tools to try and cut its headcount.</p>

 <p>In today’s AMA, which was promised in response to the prior backlash, Vincke said that AI will no longer be used at all in the concept art phase, but did suggest the studio is looking at ways to use gen-AI tools trained exclusively on the company’s own material. Here’s his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">full statement</a>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>So first off – there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity.</p> <p>I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration. We already said this doesn’t mean the actual concept art is generated by AI but we understand it created confusion.</p> <p>So, to ensure there is no room for doubt, we’ve decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development.</p> <p>That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art.</p> <p>Having said that, we continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out. The more iterations we can do, the better in general the gameplay is.</p> <p>We think GenAI can help with this and so we’re trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.</p> <p>The important bit to note is that we will not generate “creative assets” that end up in a game without being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data. If we use a GenAI model to create in-game assets, then it’ll be trained on data we own.</p></blockquote> <p>Larian’s new position addresses two of the chief criticisms of generative AI tools. The first is that they’re used by companies to undercut and replace human creatives. The second is that they produce content stolen from the millions of people whose work they were trained on. A set of gen AI tools trained entirely on Larian’s own proprietary game assets could potentially side-step that second critique, though it also suggests that <em>Divinity</em> could include at least some assets that were generated with the help of AI.</p>

 <p>Developers have long used machine learning and procedural generation to help create pieces of a game that humans can then go and tweak as needed. It would be impossible to craft the beautiful cosmos of <em>No Man’s Sky</em> by hand. The bulk of its universe is generated from algorithms designed by the team at Hello Games. But as technology advances, algorithms have been able to produce more and more of the stuff that players might find in a finished game, leading many fans to balk at things like sloppy gen-AI loading screen art and even at the use of algorithms to generate spoken performances for NPCs, a subject of some controversy for <em>Arc Raiders</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"It's shaping up to be a monster."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Over two years after it was announced, Ubisoft is still working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-3">The Division 3</a>. And while it has yet to show off the game, its chief developer has said he thinks it will have as big an impact as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division">The Division 1</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Division 1 was announced at E3 2013 with a trailer that went down as one of the most talked about of the show. After a series of delays, The Division released on March 8, 2016, breaking sales records for Ubisoft. The Division 2 followed in 2019, although it failed to make as big a splash at launch as its predecessor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there’s no release date for The Division 3, the hope is Ubisoft will show it off at some point this year. Now, Julian Gerighty, executive producer of The Division franchise at Ubisoft’s Massive Entertainment, has provided a brief but tantalizing update.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking during the New Game+ Showcase 2026, Gerighty said: “So, The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret. It's been announced. It's shaping up to be a monster. I can't really say anything more than that. But this is, within these walls in Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will be as big an impact as Division 1 was.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not much to go on, but clearly Ubisoft is hoping that The Division 3 will rekindle memories of The Division 1, which was certainly a hot topic when it was announced and enjoyed huge sales when it eventually came out. The pressure is on to deliver, especially with Ubisoft’s recent high-profile struggles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, support for The Division 2 continues with various updates, and a team in Paris is putting the final touches of a The Division mobile game. The Division Heartland, a free-to-play spin-off, entered development in 2020 but was canceled in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two months ago, Massive Entertainment introduced what it called a 'voluntary career transition program,' (the studio asked its staff to volunteer to be laid off) as part of a move to focus on The Division franchise and its Snowdrop game engine. It came as part of significant restructuring at Ubisoft that has seen multiple studio closures and rounds of layoffs. Massive Entertainment's Star Wars Outlaws, released in 2024, was a big sales disappointment for Ubisoft, despite significant development and marketing costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Now, Krafton has announced that Blindspot is getting an early-access release on February 5.</p><p>This title differs from its predecessor by embracing a top-down perspective and focusing on 5v5 battles in a tactical showdown. Attacking teams are tasked with making their way through a building in order to break into a vault and install a device called the Decrypter. Specific weapons like grenade launchers and explosive hammers can break down the walls standing between the players and their goal. Defending players can set up barricades to slow down their adversaries, but these are battles that ultimately come down to gunplay.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PUBG: BLINDSPOT | Early Access Announcement Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The newly released trailer shows off some of the improvements coming to the early-access build, including enhanced visuals and UI, as well as balance adjustments and control refinements. Krafton describes it as a "launch-ready level of quality" in support of ongoing development.</p><p>"Early access will allow players to directly participate in the development process," said the game's production director, Seungmyeong Yang, in a statement. "Through free-to-play, open development, we aim to communicate closely with the community and complete PUBG: Blindspot together."</p><p>For now, PUBG: Blindspot will only be available on PC. The game is free-to-play, and Krafton has announced plans to support the game through monthly updates while incorporating player feedback via the game's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/pubgblindspot" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord channel</a>.</p><p>Krafton has previously shared its desire to see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/krafton-wants-pubg-to-become-a-platform-similar-to-fortnite-and-roblox/1100-6533550/" data-ref-id="1100-6533550">PUBG become a platform like Fortnite</a>. The company has also taken some heat for its stated goal of becoming an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">"AI-first" company</a>. PUBG creator Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene has gone on record as saying that he is "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-says-he-is-really-heartened-about-the-backlash-to-ai-in-gaming/1100-6536304/" data-ref-id="1100-6536304">really heartened</a>" by the backlash to AI in the gaming space.</p><p>Greene is still affiliated with Krafton, but he is working on new titles including his open-world survival experience <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prologue-go-wayback/" data-ref-id="5000-505925">Prologue: Go Wayback</a>, which debuted in early access last year.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/" data-ref-id="5000-483376">Starfield</a> has had a somewhat divisive response from players since it debuted in 2023, but there is a Star Wars mod that transforms it into a more rewarding experience. The Star Wars: Genesis mod was released in 2024, but this year, it's adding lightsabers and a more immersive experience for Starfield PC players who want to take the plunge.</p><p>Star Wars: Genesis was created by a modder who goes by DeityVengy, and it's available for free on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/11114" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>. The mod features an original story that's set between the prequel and original Star Wars trilogies. There is an update coming before the end of January that adds even more content to the mod, and DeityVengy showed off some of those new features in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmMqk-PvEak" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmMqk-PvEak" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the video, DeityVengy notes that using a lightsaber forces players into a first-person perspective because Starfield's melee animations weren't up to the challenge of depicting lightsaber combat. The story featured in this clip also focuses on the player's character confronting one of the Nightsisters of Dathomir before letting them decide whether to spare or slay her.</p><p>On the <a href="https://genesismodlist.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mod's official site</a>, DeityVengy states that Lucasfilm provided "express permission" for the Star Wars music used in this mod, which is sourced from Star Wars games like Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2, The Force Unleashed, and Star Wars: The Old Republic. DeityVengy also acknowledges that the mod uses "licensed AI-generated voices" as well real voice actors.</p><p>Star Wars: Genesis is only available for players who have Starfield on PC. Bethesda has previously confirmed that Starfield will get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-getting-a-second-story-dlc-and-more/1100-6534318/" data-ref-id="1100-6534318">an additional story DLC</a>, and some of its new features were recently disclosed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-second-dlc-reportedly-pushed-back-because-of-gta-6-delay/1100-6537116/" data-ref-id="1100-6537116">during a closed-door preview</a>.</p>

              <p>Following <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheaters-ninja-shroud-embark-patch-2000657708">a number of high-profile streamers stating they had had enough of a new plague of cheating</a> in extraction shooter hit&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, developers Embark have responded with word that “significant changes” are coming to try to address the issues.</p> <p>Posting to the official Discord for the game, Embark’s community lead OssenJ assured players that the developer was aware of the conversation, and “taking this issue very seriously.” Assuring that feedback was being heard, she continues, “Over the next few weeks, we are implementing significant changes to our rulesets and deploying new detection mechanisms to identify and remove cheaters.”</p>

 <p>It seems Embark was a little slow in responding to the growth of cheating due to much of the team being away for winter vacation, and having to play catch-up on their return. However, with everyone back hopefully things will start changing. The plans include “updating our Anti-Cheat systems for improved detection and bans,” and speaking directly to one of the main sources of complaint, “applying client-side fixes specifically addressing the ‘out of map’ glitch.” There are also plans to bring in measures and tools for streamers to “help mitigate stream sniping”—the issue where players can see where streamers are on a map and what they’re doing, and using this to the sniper’s advantage.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658426"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658426">© Discord / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s not clear if these measures will be enough to address the concerns of some of those who’ve previously spoken out. Alongside the likes of Ninja and Shroud yelling at Embark to improve things, Nadeshot argued that the only hope he sees is for the studio to put into practice the tactics of Epic, where legal action is threatened (and carried out) against those who supply cheating software and aids. Others pointed out Epic is a multi-billion dollar company with the <em>Fortnite</em> infinite money machine, whereas Embark is a small-ish Swedish developer on their second game. However, Embark is a subsidiary of Korean firm Nexon, which itself is worth around $20 billion, so it’s not&nbsp;<em>impossible</em>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My experience on Arc Raiders over the last week has been hell. Just to be clear, I love this game and think it’s already moved in to my personal top 10 all time.</p> <p>But the egregious amount of cheating genuinely might be worse than peak Call of Duty. I’m not trying to bring…</p> <p>— 100T Nadeshot (@Nadeshot) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nadeshot/status/2007926647295492467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Given the anti-cheating measures are due “over the next few weeks,” we won’t immediately know how much improvement they bring. And for the less violent players, it’s likely you are being matchmade with other PvE-orientated players, and as such completely avoiding any cheating altogether.</p>

<p>A new Born In Chaos Battle Pass accompanies the arrival of South Park to Fortnite. As with all passes, it comes loaded with customizable items and conditions that need to be met. This guide looks at the South Park and Fortnite Battle Pass’ end date, and more.</p>



<p>Everyone is goin’ down to South Park to have themself a time. If you didn’t know, it’s full of friendly faces everywhere, humble folks without temptation. Non-South Park fans might struggle to get the joke, but rest assured, many of you will. The cartoon series has left an indelible imprint on society and culture.</p>



<p>It’s still incredible to think that a child-friendly game like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> has crossed over with South Park, but it’s better for it. The new Born In Chaos Battle Pass is at the heart of the collab’s progress.</p>

<p><strong>All Fortnite players have until February 5 to wrap up every challenge and complete all the content in the South Park Born In Chaos Battle Pass that was brought in alongside the mini-season update.</strong></p>



<p>If you go to the Born In Chaos pass screen and look in the top-left corner, you’ll see a live timer that says ‘Event Ends In.’ This is a constant reminder of how long you have to enjoy the South Park drop.</p>



<p>Eventually, it will hit zero, and it will be on February 5. After this, the AWESOM-O content and pass will be gone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GTA 6 Devs Fired Over Leaks Sent to Influencers, Rockstar Says]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-devs-fired-over-leaks-sent-to-influencers-rockstar-says/</link>
            <guid>1401511</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rockstar has stated that GTA 6 employees were fired in 2023 and 2025 after leaking confidential information to third parties, who were reportedly influencers. </p>



<p>Rockstar, the developer of GTA 6, is under investigation for alleged union-busting. However, the company firmly denies these claims, stating that the recent firing of 34 employees was due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-game-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaking of features</a>. This situation has prompted the community to speculate about the nature of these leaks.</p>











<p>A Rockstar spokesperson has shared additional details about the recent firings in a statement to <a href="https://in.ign.com/grand-theft-auto-vi/250412/news/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, remaining firm that leaking was the only reason for the decision. The statement comes in response to IWGB’s claims, which state that Rockstar “broke the law” when it fired these employees, who were “organising for better conditions.” </p>



<p>The GTA 6 developers state that they took action against employees from the UK and Canada for sharing “highly confidential information”, including revealing game features from upcoming and unannounced titles, in an “insecure and public social channel.” This action was considered “a breach of long-standing and well-understood confidentiality policies.”</p>



<p>Rockstar adds that the channel that these employees were using consisted of “25 non-Rockstar employees”, including devs from competitor teams, a video game journalist, and other unidentified members. Employees who posted “union-supportive messages” and didn’t breach their policies weren’t fired. </p>



<p>It was revealed that a Rockstar employee in Lincoln, UK, was fired in April 2025 for sharing information with a third party, who then posted it to social media. Additionally, an employee was fired in November 2023 in the US and in November 2025 in India for two more acts of leaking GTA 6 information. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Rockstar has pointed to its well-established zero tolerance approach to leaks, highlighting that it dismissed a Rockstar employee in Lincoln, UK in April 2025, who it alleged disclosed confidential information about GTA 6 to a third party who published the information to social…</p>— ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/2009055571190653411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-community-speculates-leaks-from-2023-and-gameroll-could-be-true">GTA 6 Community Speculates Leaks From 2023 and Gameroll Could Be True</h2>



<p>Since the November 2023 firing was revealed, a Reddit post from the same year has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q775cn/potential_gta_6_plot_leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">come into the limelight</a>, with players speculating that it could be the information that led to the employees’ firing. The leak itself talks about the plot and some new game mechanics. Players are also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1q6xoma/gamerolls_leak_basically_confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">suspecting</a> that the leaks from Gameroll, who accurately predicted Jason and Lucia’s last names, could be true as well. </p>



<p>However, players should note that this is just speculation, and there is no official confirmation that these were the GTA 6 leaks that led to the employees being fired. </p>







<p>In other news, GTA 6 might not be content complete, and it is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-might-not-be-content-complete-hard-to-say-if-it-will-be-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hard to say</a>” whether the game will be delayed again. Additionally, we almost received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-tokyo-almost-happened-says-former-rockstar-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Tokyo</a> title.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’ve been ill. Wallowing in a horrible flu-ridden morass, and sleeping a hell of a lot. I have had some companions through this Lemsip-flavoured fog, though, and I’ve especially loved my time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/07/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-review/">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>. This is a football game that doesn’t feel like a football game, and it’s just a cracking JRPG that happens to feature kicking a ball. Besides that, I’ve been playing the demo for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/06/a-surprise-dragon-quest-7-reimagined-demo-is-coming-this-week/">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>, and that’s just lovely, while I’ve been balancing things out with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontier of Pandora’s</a> bombastic newest expansion, From The Ashes.</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> was first up this week, and he’s played Ghost of Yotei, Borderlands 4, and also delved into Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, though he worries, “I’m trapped beneath countless open-world games!”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been revisiting a couple of his favourites after wrapping up his playthrough Mafia: The Old Country (which was also a great game). He says, “For the first time in many months, I stepped back into the sandbox realm of Calradia for Mount &amp; Blade 2’s War Sails expansion. As the name implies, this DLC is all about naval gameplay, having also introduced a Viking-influenced faction. I’m learning the ropes of how to run my own ship while making lucrative trade runs between cities, hoping to save enough to buy a big ‘ol warship.”</p>
<p>He continues, “I’ve also been playing Warhammer 40,000: Darktide after picking up the post-launch character DLCs. The nimble, punk-styled Hive Scum is fun to play as though I’ve decided to main the Arbites class, channelling my inner Judge Dredd as I dole out justice beneath the Undercity.”</p>


<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Aran</strong> has played a bit of Star Wars Outlaws, but most of his time has been split between Big Hops and MIO: Memories In Orbit for review.</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> “thinks” he finished Hades 2 this week. That’s not due to some Roguelike dementia, but rather the difficulty level, saying, “There’s a few challenges remaining but they are well beyond my abilities. All in all, what an incredible game!” He also played ‘real-life’ games, telling us, “My son and I had an epic battle of Warhammer 40k down our local games shop. His Tyranids versus my Battle Sisters, pretty much everyone died after an epic battle, with us drawing on victory points. It was great fun and we’re booked in again for a rematch next week!”</p>

<p>And finally for this week, <strong>Tef</strong> has been having fun with skirting board in his free time, so hasn’t really carried on from his holiday Switch 2 gaming. And the thing that he has played? He can’t tell you about it until Monday.</p>
<p>What about you? Have you played any New Year games?</p>

            <guid>1401481</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>Note. At the time of publication, the Switch 2 update is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/psa-stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-update-and-european-release-on-the-way">not yet live</a> on European eShops. However, it is accessible from the North American eShop if you have a Nintendo Account from that territory.</em></p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:195779 @ 1767970453 -->
<hr>
<p>I’ve spent close to 300 hours with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> since it landed on Switch in 2018. That feels like rookie numbers compared to other people, but even with the portability, the Switch version has always been <em>slightly</em> behind other versions in the multiplayer department, which is where ConcernedApe’s surprise Christmas treat comes in handy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley</a> on Switch 2 is almost the best way to play the game (without mods) – just a few bugs, <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2004474989119160737">which the developer is currently working on</a>, hold it back from perfection.</p>
<p>I’ll start with the Iridium-quality stuff: Mouse Mode. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-oh-no-im-not-a-fan-of-switch-2s-mouse-mode-at-all">I don’t really like Mouse Mode</a>, but here, it's perfect for two aspects of Stardew Valley that were always a bit finicky with a controller: decorating and inventory management.</p>
<p>The former is now effortless, as with the click of a button and drag of the Joy-Con 2, you can move or pop down furniture without relying on your character’s positioning. I no longer need to block out multiple days of in-game time to decorate my house. The latter also eliminates the need to use the shoulder buttons to shuffle through pages, making my speedy Skull Cavern dives a breeze.</p>
<p>I thought Mouse Mode would be good for farming, but this still only works if you’re right next to whatever you need to till or hoe. Not a big deal, but the other two uses make it a vast improvement over solely relying on the controller, which makes tabletop play a dream.</p>
<p>Online multiplayer now supports up to eight players; this was bugged on launch day, but quickly fixed. Five of us got together on a brand new co-op farm and, after a few days of running around, fighting over where to plant seeds, buying and selling random junk, fishing, and ganging up on the same trees to chop them down, it was pretty flawless, save a few little pauses and stutters when others moved between areas.</p>
<p>Improved split-screen co-op is another huge boon, as you can now play with up to three other people on the same farm on the same screen. The magic of better processing power! Or you can GameShare with up to three others to Switch 2 <em>or</em> Switch 1 – this works perfectly in handheld mode, but docked, the bottom half of the screen gets distorted.</p>
<p>There’s also a <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2006086790311272546">crafting bug</a> at the time of writing which causes some items to disappear; most of the recipes affected are pretty easy to avoid for me, but it’s something to be aware of.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this is Stardew Valley as you know it. Between three different farms and playing on friends' and families’ save files, I can safely say that this is one of my favourite games ever, and the best farming sim of all time. And once it's fully up-to-date, Switch 2 might rival PC as the best place to play it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

  </picture><h2>Fifth Place - Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</h2><p>Developer: The Game Kitchen | Release Date: July 31st, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>It’s been a hot minute since we’ve seen <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> in 2D (it’s been, well, decades) so it was about time we saw this coveted series go back to its roots with <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>.</p><p>With <em>Blasphemous</em> developer The Game Kitchen at the helm of this project, we’re met with a hard-as-nails, fast-paced 2D platformer that feels like a faithful homage to <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> of yesteryear.</p><p>Ryu Hayabusa takes the bench as two new characters get some time to shine: &nbsp;. These two become fused together and have a wide range of exciting powers at their disposal. The player feels like the ultimate badass, slashing through demon enemies like butter and avoiding obstacles with the finesse only a shinobi can accomplish.</p><p>Furthermore, the two ninja’s personal dynamic holds a lot of promise too, so here’s hoping The Game Kitchen brings us a sequel!</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Fourth Place - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><p>Developer: Team Cherry | September 4th, 2025</p><p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is an experience that can easily be overshadowed by the fervent attitude of its fans. There was an almost zealous anticipation for Team Cherry's follow-up to the critically acclaimed <em>Hollow Knight</em>. That anticipation continued to grow in excitement as the developers went radio silent over years of development.</p><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> releasing this year wasn't just a release, it was an event. An event so momentous it crashed all major digital game storefronts; a feat no other release this year pulled off.</p><p>As for the game itself, it is a remarkable achievement of an action-platformer. It builds upon the foundation of its predecessor, pushes the limits of exploration and difficulty, interweaving it with a narrative about the dangers of organized religion.</p><p>For that achievement, Team Cherry's sophomore effort deserves its praise.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Third Place - Ball x Pit</h2><p>Developer: Kenny Sun | Release Date: October 15th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Every now and then, an indie game comes around and mashes a couple well-known genres together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. That's exactly what<em> Ball x Pit</em> does. It takes the tried-and-true formula of <em>Arkanoid </em>and twists it into a roguelike, with a dollop of city building and pinball to round it all out.</p><p><em>Ball x Pit</em> has that classic "just one more run" hook to it, especially since each run only lasts a couple minutes. Punctuating each run is a little bit of base building, which slowly snowballs into arguably the more important part of the game.</p><p>The <em>Arkanoid</em>-style gameplay starts out pretty fun, and it only evolves into something more clever as you unlock more characters, items, and abilities. You'll find different strategies based on specific builds, and the endless combinations and low-stakes gameplay makes it so easy to lose hours to what was supposed to be one or two runs.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Dispatch</h2><p>Developer: AdHoc Studio | Release Date: October 22nd, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>When<em> Dispatch</em>’s main character, Robert Robertson gets defeated by a villain, leaving his mechanical suit in shambles, he’s out of a job and rent is due. He still wants to make a difference with his strong sense of justice, and as fate would have it, he’s given an offer he can’t refuse: dispatch heroes for Torrance, California’s Superhero Dispatch Network, and they’ll help him get back on his feet and repair his suit.</p><p>While at first glance <em>Dispatch </em>plays like any other “choose your own adventure” type of deal, where your choices have impacts on the outcome of the story, this game innovates by fusing a strong narrative with the interactable dispatching mini-game.</p><p>With <em>Dispatch</em>’s lovable cast of villain-turned-heroes, Robert will send them from job-to-job in order to fight crime. Take into consideration if a hero is suited for the job, or else you might experience failure; though, failure isn’t always a bad thing as the writing leads to some pretty funny outcomes. In between your dispatching job, the narrative that gradually amps up over eight strong episodes is sure to capture your heart as much as it did for us at TechRaptor.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Blue Prince</h2><p>Developer: Dogubomb | Release Date: April 10th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p><p>In a world of AAA titles and never-ending sequels and remakes, it's always incredible when such a unique indie experience comes along. <em>Blue Prince</em> is an outstanding game with a simple idea that gets iterated upon, and iterated again, and used in ways that will break your brain to try to interpret.</p><p>Tonda Ros' story of creating <em>Blue Prince</em> is one that perfectly embodies the spirit of Indie game development. After enjoying games and seeing documentaries like <em>Indie Game The Movie</em> came the realization 'Yeah, I can probably do that'.&nbsp;</p><p>Eight years later, <em>Blue Prince</em> released as a game that you can "complete" in what you can consider a normal amount of time, rewarding players' interest and lateral thinking. Though, for those who are as interested in puzzle solving as Ros is for putting puzzles together, you'll get rewarded time and time again as you dig deeper and new discoveries teach you about an incredible larger world without leaving the grounds of the mansion.</p><p><em>Blue Prince</em> has truly infected my mind and the mind of many other gamers wanting to scratch just that little bit deeper. It more than deserves it's place as the Indie GOTY.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-invicta">Terra Invicta</a> publishers Hooded Horse are imposing a strict ban on generative AI assets in their games, with company co-founder Tim Bender describing it as an “ethics issue” and “a very frustrating thing to have to worry about”. </p>
<p>“I fucking hate gen AI art and it has made my life more difficult in many ways… suddenly it infests shit in a way it shouldn’t,” Bender told <a href="https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179">Kotaku</a> in a recent interview. “It is now written into our contracts if we’re publishing the game, ‘no fucking AI assets.'” I assume that's not a verbatim quote, but I'd love to be proven wrong.</p>
<p>The publishers also take a dim view of using generative AI for “placeholder” work, or indeed any ‘non-final’ aspect of game development. “We’ve gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don’t use any gen AI anywhere in the process because some of them might otherwise think, ‘Okay, well, maybe what I’ll do is for this place, I’ll put it as a placeholder,’ right?” Bender went on. </p>
<p>“Like some, people will have this thought, like they would never want to let it in the game, but they’ll think, ‘It can be a placeholder in this prototype build.’ But if that gets done, of course, there’s a chance that that slips through, because it only takes one of those slipping through in some build and not getting replaced or something.” As an example of this slipping-through, see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner">the accidental presence of a generated placeholder in The Alters</a>.

</p><p>Hooded Horse employ two artists for marketing, and Bender feels “it would be a betrayal of them to work with anything that is using gen-AI art, like, I wouldn’t be able to face them if we had that right. And we’re absolutely committed ethically, for all the reasons you know, against this.”</p><p>As with much discussion of generative AI, the difficulty of Hooded Horse’s position is pinning down what they're trying to ban. Does an artwork count as generated if somebody used the tech to make a base image of some kind, then fleshed it out and finished it off at length by hand? In general, genAI has become pervasive and hard to quantify across the divisions of game development, thanks not least to the deliberately imprecise, all-enveloping language of the companies selling it. There’s the gloomy underlying reality that a lot of genAI tools are being forced into operating systems and search engines in order to artificially boost “uptake” - it's hard <em>not</em> to use genAI, at this stage. </p>
<p>I write all this not to suggest that bans are useless, but that they need to be more detailed and specific. In general, whether they favour the tech or not, companies need to start talking in-depth about their usages of generative AI. As a small and slightly weird example from the world of education, James Allen’s Girls School in South London recently unveiled an <a href="https://www.flipsnack.com/jamesallensgirlsschool/jags-ai-charter-and-curriculum">AI charter</a>, stipulating what they consider fair game both for teachers and for pupils.</p>
<p>I’d love to see similar documents from publishers, though I’m not expecting miracles in a world where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">the largest PC storefront’s approach to generative AI disclosures is practically useless</a>. But still, perhaps Larian will surprise me at their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-announce-plans-to-let-folks-ask-anything-about-their-generative-ai-use-asserting-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation">imminent Q&amp;A about generative AI usage in the forthcoming Divinity</a>.</p>
<p>Bender acknowledged the trickiness of policing generative AI when working with external partners, while reiterating the need for a blunt ban. “The reality is, there’s so much of it going on that the commitment just has to be that you won’t allow it in the game, and if it’s ever discovered, because this artist that was hired by this outside person slipped something in, you get it out and you replace it. That has to be the commitment. It’s a shame that it’s even necessary and it’s a very frustrating thing to have to worry about.”</p><p>As an example of the difficulty of policing generative AI usage by third parties, consider the discovery of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/publisher-reveals-and-immediately-cancels-new-postal-game-after-fans-accuse-it-of-using-ai-generation">AI-generated material in trailers for Postal: Bullet Paradise</a>, which has now been cancelled - developers Goonswarm have attributed this oversight to external artists.</p>
<p>The minutiae of different genAI applications aside, the broad cultural or political case against generative AI has, IMO, remained pretty consistent (yes, this is the point in the 'news post' where I deliver the customary lecture, please skip to the comments if you are weary of such things). The biggest bots operate by parasitically appropriating and undermining the work of theoretically any and all human workers, whether or not you define this as actual theft or copyright infringement. Their actual utility beyond the grand promises is broadly unproven, and in some cases, obviously non-existent.</p>
<p>Being companies, the companies pushing them aren’t following the public interest: they are helping to drive up energy usage and emissions, and saturating daily life with “companion” technologies that may distort online discourse and in some cases, contribute to mental illness. Within the games industry, the tech is viewed by many executives and shareholders as a quick fix for unsatisfactory profit margins, and a tacit excuse for cutting staff.</p>
<p>That doesn’t make every usage of generative AI abominable – I can understand the appeal for smaller devs with minimal resources, and I am myself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">interested in art that makes genuinely imaginative and substantial use of generators of all kinds</a>, rather than just calling on them to “enhance productivity” - providing those technologies are responsibly operated.</p>
<p>But generative AI needs to be understood as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">a form of class war</a> that will principally benefit the already-filthy-rich, and which is fundamentally anti-social in encouraging greater reliance on profit-driven corporate tools rather than solidarity with coworkers and peers.</p>
<p>Lecture over! For a more open-ended and nuanced discussion of generative AI in games, here's Sam Horti's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horrible-boring-and-cheap-experts-pan-new-chatbot-npcs-but-some-leave-room-for-optimism">recent excellent catch-up</a> with a brace of developers, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/80-days">80 Days</a> and Thirsty Suitors writer Meghna Jayanth and Failbetter's narrative director Chris Gardiner.</p>

<p>Use these active Roblox Fireworks Playground monthly redeem codes to get your hands on free rewards like coins and more.</p>



<p>Fireworks Playground is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-walk-or-die-codes/">Roblox</a> experience that drops players into the middle of a vibrant world of pyrotechnics and explosive celebrations. Players can immediately begin lighting various fireworks upon launch, and from there, progress through the game to unlock the best pyrotechnic displays available. With over 2,163 different fireworks to collect and launch, ranging from simple firecrackers to elaborate multi-shot aerial displays, pyrotechnic enthusiasts will have a fantastic time playing Fireworks Playground.</p>



<p>Having been released in beta during 2023, Fireworks Playground has gradually gained traction over the course of the following years and now boasts a dedicated player base with over 360,000 members. The game, developed by Pseudo Studio (specifically by creators PseudoDaemon and YuckMaster), offers a unique experience where players can enjoy realistic firework sounds and visuals year-round without annoying their neighbors.</p>







<p>Although simply lighting fireworks is enough for players to earn coins to unlock more spectacular displays, using redeem codes to get some extra rewards is never a bad idea.</p>

<p>Redeeming Fireworks Playground codes is a fairly straightforward matter, and they have made sure that even newer players to the game can navigate to the codes section and claim their rewards without too much fuss. Here’s how:</p>



<ol>

<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-fireworks-playground-codes">Where to get more Fireworks Playground Codes</h2>



<p>Fireworks Playground codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official Pseudo Studio Discord server, which has a dedicated codes channel where all new codes are posted first, and the developer’s social media accounts (specifically the PseudosStudios X page) where they announce updates and milestones for this popular pyrotechnic-inspired game.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself.</p>



<p>This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Anime Auto Chess monthly redeem codes to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Dice, Fragments and much more.</p>



<p>Anime Auto Chess is all about collecting Units to increase your Power, improving your squad composition, getting Upgrades, and boosting your Rank.

That’s when you should redeem the active Anime Auto Chess codes, as they can be redeemed for Medals, Gems, and Power Fragments.</p>







<p>New <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-walk-or-die-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> players will quickly get access to powerful Units within a few minutes after beginning their anime-based auto chess journey.
