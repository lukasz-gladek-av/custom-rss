			<p>It’s Jackbox Party Pack time once again, and can you believe we’re on Jackbox 11 now? How time flies. It feels like it was only last year that the JPP was barely learning to walk. , this time around brings five brand-new games into the fray, and while they do all feel familiar, it’s one of the strongest Party Packs in recent years, thanks to some really good execution.</p>
<p><iframe title="GAMEPLAY TRAILER | The Jackbox Party Pack 11 | Available OCT 23" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8IwlJvXhgk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Doominate is this time around’s writing game. It has you and your friends trying to ruin different phrases, people, or things by putting a spin on them. This can be very clever, and it was for the most part, but it is also the game most likely to end up with you and your friends sending yourselves to hell as fast as possible by exposing your sins. The execution here is a lot of fun though, and while the Death character in this is a little unfunny, the overall presentation is really good.</p>



<p>Hear Say is my standout, but it’s also the most awkward of the bunch. You and your mates need to make stupid sound effects for this one, with prompts including things like trying to make a sound like gargling mouthwash, to doing a Miss Piggy vocal warm-up. This is about as close to Dropout’s Make Some Noise as we’re going to get in video game form, and it’s a blast online. The mini-games are bad in it though, and the game would be better without them.</p>

<p>I do also think that there’s a divide between playing online and in-person. You can mute your online mics when playing online, which means you can keep all of your sound effects that you’re making a surprise, which feels preferable to everyone being in the same room and already hearing what others are doing, and potentially also ending up in the background of each other’s takes. For as boisterous as it wants you to be, there’s also that awkwardness of public performance.</p>

<p>The obligatory drawing game comes in the form of Cookie Haus, which&nbsp;has you all glazing cookies in different shapes and naming them. The commitment to icing physics adds to the entertaining feeling of the whole affair, and pandering to the weird requests of the customers is a good time all around. Trying to work around the weird shapes you end up with really helps boost your creativity as well.</p>

<p>Suspectives bring a little social deduction to the table, as between four and eight people try to fool each other and catch the criminal among you. You start off having to answer a slew of survey questions, which then provide the basis for back and forth of interrogation, evidence, debate and voting phases, as you try to narrow down the main suspects. It’s a fun time, but it definitely helps to be pretty close friends and family through this, though you could obviously fib during the initial surveys. It’s also potentially the trickiest mode to organise and play. It really benefits from having the higher player count, but game nights are difficult to organise when everyone in your friend group now has kids to argue with over whether it’s bedtime or not.</p>

<p>Finally, we’ve got Legends of Trivia, which is easily the best trivia game we’ve had in ages. This has you all working cooperatively to defeat all manner of beasts in RPG-alike combat, and eventually find the legendary Bookwyrm. The questions are varied in topic, delivery, and style, and there’s an extra strategic layer of being able to split your answers if you’re uncertain, and item management that helps make this an absolute blast to play. I normally dislike the trivia games, but Legends of Trivia sets an entirely new standard for them all.</p>

		If Jackbox Party Pack 11 is anything to go by, then the second decade of Jackbox is going to be great. There's a familiar feel to the pack as a whole, but it's really well put together and there's a great injection of noisy new ideas.	</p></div>

			<p>Ukrainian developer Frogwares announced that its next project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-announcement-ue5-horror-frogwares-deliver-ukraine-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sinking City 2</a>, is being moved to the first half of 2026. The first and most tragic reason is the continued assault on Ukraine by the Russian Federation, with the developers having to deal with power loss on top of the constant worry for their own safety. Sergiy Oganesyan, Head of Publishing at Frogwares, stated:</p>



<p><em>Developing a game during a war isn’t something you can ever really prepare for, but something you need to keep adapting to. At one point, we were losing power for days as drones and missiles hit our power grid. When that tactic stopped working, it became mass drone swarms every other night, going from midnight until dawn. You work all day, then spend the sleepless night listening for explosions, and somehow still need to function the next morning… These things all slowed us down regularly to the point where it just doesn’t make sense to try to rush what we have left to meet a date that we no longer feel is worth chasing. How Moscow’s tactics to terrorize civilians will change again as winter comes is anyone's guess, so we’d rather be ready to adapt again, knowing we’re able to take our time. </em></p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>The development of The Sinking City 2 is also going slower because Frogwares is shifting the sequel's genre from the first installment's action/adventure to survival horror. Lead Game Designer Alexander Gresko explained:</p>



<p><em>Switching to survival horror for the first time has been a whole new kind of challenge for us in itself, too. We’ve been making investigation adventures for more than twenty years, but survival horror asks for a completely different kind of design thinking. Tension, pacing, combat, etc. We’ve always loved the genre as fans, but once you start building it yourself, you realize how much you still have to do. It’s exciting, but it definitely makes development slower.</em></p>



<p>The studio has committed to sharing more gameplay and information in the coming months.

            <title><![CDATA[Dispatch Episode 1 & 2 Impressions - A Tale to Tell]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dispatch-episode-1-2-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-episode-1-2-impressions-a-tale-to-tell.1330498/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Telltale Games created a formula for adventure games that, when done well, is a near-perfect way to absorb a narrative interactively. So many have failed to do it right since their heyday, even Telltale themselves, that releases in that episodic choice-driven style have been few and far between. From what I can tell, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/dispatch-is-episodic-workplace-comedy-first-iterating-where-telltale-refused-to" rel="nofollow"><em>Dispatch </em>has taken all the right lessons</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dispatch </em>is set in a world of superheroes, where they are so abundant they even solve the world’s pettiest problems and crimes, like de-escalating an argument over someone cutting in line.</p>

<p>You play as Robert Robertson, a former hero who does not have superpowers, who gets a job at a dispatch center for superheroes. You’re tasked with managing a team of still-reforming supervillains to fight crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At its core, <em>Dispatch </em>is a classic workplace comedy set in an absurd world. Weird powers lead to weird personalities, and powerful people will have powerful egos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re familiar with the style of Telltale adventure games, <em>Dispatch </em>will be readily familiar to you immediately. There are some QTEs during scenes (which you can turn off), and many dialogue choices will be met with a “so and so will remember that” in the corner of your screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest deviation, and I suppose this may change in future episodes, is that there’s no roaming around or character control. It’s all cutscenes, dialogue, and then some other added gameplay elements I’ll get into with specific episodes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Really, large chunks of <em>Dispatch </em>are like an interactive TV show, which bears out in the playtime with each episode being about an hour (so far anyway). There’s still some interesting gameplay going on, however.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Episode 1 – Pivot&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The first episode gives you all the setup for the world and the character you play, Robert Robertson. He is the third generation of Mecha Man, both his father and grandfather dying as heroes as they served the Southland area of Los Angeles. They were well-beloved, leaving quite the legacy for Robert to live up to.</p>

<p>As the episode starts with the history of the world and your character, we get to see Mecha Man in action. Hot on the tail of Shroud, the villain that killed Robert's father, we infiltrate a steel mill full of his goons.</p>

<p>Things don’t go well, and Robert survive,s but his Mecha Man suit does not. Without that, he can’t be a hero anymore, as he has no powers. And as you see his apartment in the opening minutes of the game... Robert's not exactly flush with cash for repairs.</p>

<p>The story goes on from there, but I don’t want to go into the plot too much to let you experience it yourself. Robert's motivations and personality come through from the opening seconds of the game, and the history of Mecha Man does a great job of showing just how important being Mecha Man is to him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One scene is a perfect example of why the episode works and sets up what we're in for with <em>Dispatch</em>.</p>

<p>The scene takes place in a bar for superheroes, which does a great job of showing you the world of <em>Dispatch</em>. Heroes are so mundane, so numerous that this isn't some elite club -- just a bar in a normal neighborhood. The decor looks like it'd be a decent stand-in for a bar just about anywhere.</p>

<p>In the scene prior, we're introduced to Blonde Blazer, who rescues the suitless Mecha Man from some thieves who were beating the hell out of Robert until she got there. She takes him to the bar for Robert to unwind and get to know him.</p>

<p>Blonde Blazer works for Superhero Dispatch Network, and you eventually learn that she's there to learn a little about Robert to evaluate whether he'd be a good fit for the company. Considering the name of the game, he turns out to be a pretty good fit.</p>

<p>The scene is pretty short but efficient and effective. The quick interactions with Blonde Blazer and a couple of other characters in the bar and just the setting of the bar itself set up the main thrust of the story, introduce hugely important characters, give you a great sense of the world, and shows you the exact sort of tone and humor to expect from the game.</p>

<p>Of the humor, there's one specific joke I want to talk about in this episode. I think the humor mostly sort of works this episode, but some fall flat for similar reasons as this next one.</p>



<p>The thieves Blonde Blazer helped Robert with were all wearing different colored beanies, so Robert jokingly refers to them as skittles. At the bar, Blonde Blazer laughs, saying she hadn't even noticed that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Robert replies, “you know what they can taste the rainbow in jail.” Fine enough joke that mostly works. Decent setup, decent payoff.</p>

<p>Then Blonde Blazer says, “What do you mean? Like different colored dicks?”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ah, so close. This sort of wink-wink, nudge-nudge moment comes up a few times in Episode 1. They just don't end up working and feel like a prude's attempt at crude humor sometimes. Having played some more of <em>Dispatch</em>, particularly the next episode, I think it falls into a better groove where the irreverent humor lands most of the time.</p>

<p>If you’re reading a few impressions or reviews on <em>Dispatch</em>, I imagine there’s going to be a lot of <em>The Boys&nbsp;</em>comparisons. The crude humor with shocking visuals is somewhat in <em>Dispatch</em>, but at a much lower level. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Very early on, you fight a guy who is naked with penis flapping in the wind throughout the fight. Because it happens so early, you'd think there would be more things like it. There's really not, though.</p>



<p>It feels like <em>Dispatch </em>wants to dip its toes in every so often, coming across like its a kid getting away with something than embracing the joke. So, the inevitable <em>The Boy</em>s comparisons don't work for me, as <em>The Boys</em> commits to its identity fully and forcefully. <em>Dispatch </em>just wants to be naughty every so often.</p>

<p>Overall, I think Episode 1 does a great job setting up the world of Dispatch and introducing some of the major characters.</p>

<h2>Episode 2 - Onboard</h2>

<p>I'm glad Episode 2 is coming out at the same time as 1, as there's still a whole lot more of the world to learn and characters to meet.</p>

<p>Here, Robert finally gets to work as a dispatcher, and you’re introduced to the team of heroes you’ll be working with. "Hero" may be overstating how to describe them, as they're a bunch of still-reforming villains. Nicknamed the Z Team, they're not the easiest to work with.</p>

<p>One is a man who looks like a bat but can turn more bat-like at times -- he's smart and a former finance criminal. One's a hothead who controls fire, another an arrogant gal who turns invisible -- the list goes on, but suffice to say they are all very vocal and have some loose morals.</p>



<p>Episode 2&nbsp; is where some more gameplay elements enter as well, as you will be dispatching your team to various calls, from fights, to kaijus, to security details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Team members have unique stats, with some better at fighting, others who are smarter, etc. They can level up and you can put to improve stats as you see fit, and there are even some unique abilities they can gain too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each call for dispatch will give you some keywords and descriptions to give you a hint as to what stats may be better suited for a job. Depending on what you choose, you’ll see a graph like the above where the orange area shows what the hero or team of heroes covers on that graph, and the white area shows what you need to cover. The white part is revealed after you choose, of course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the time, you won’t cover it all, so you’re at the whims of a bouncing ball in the white area that you hope eventually ends in the area you have covered, or you'll fail.</p>



<p>Sending heroes to calls, them handling the call, and then returning to base from calls all take time, making you have to juggle a lot of things at once. Calls are on the board for a limited time before you automatically fail them, and you don't want to be caught out with no one to send. Or worse, having only one or two to send that are obviously not suited for the call.</p>

<p>It’s all pretty simple, so don’t expect anything too crazy.&nbsp;<em>Dispatch </em>will just throw a lot of choices and timers at you at once. It's engaging the entire time, and it’s certainly never boring.</p>

<p>While all that is going on, there are a lot of entertaining conversations on the team, whether it's a comment on the call they're sent to, who they're paired with, or just some random conversation as everything is going on. It really lets the all-star cast of incredible voice acting shine.</p>



<p>The other bit of gameplay is how Robert can more directly help the team through hacking. These are presented as little puzzles where you open up pathways to move around and collect information or codes you need.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hacking is simple at first, but they do add some more elements, like some of them being timed, virus protection that chases you around the pathways as you try to quickly input a code, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Depending on how you feel about some quick, simple puzzling, I think your mileage will vary. There’s nothing there to wow you, but there are a few standout ones that directly involve members of your team that ratchet the tension nicely. Like quickly hacking some water tanks that may douse you're fire-powered hero on the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For me, Episode 2 is where everything started to gel completely. The cast of characters is fun, and dispatching is totally engaging, making the time fly by. Episode 2 is great at making the huge cast shine, and that's where the game's greatest strength lies.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p>Overall, I’m extremely pleased with the opening of <em>Dispatch</em>. While it may be less interactive than the Telltale games of old, <em>Dispatch </em>streamlines how you interact with its narrative and makes the gameplay elements intrinsic to the game itself. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As a one-two opener, it's a great opening. Episode 1 spends a lot of time with Robert, the main character, and the second episode sets up the gameplay and huge cast of characters, putting its "secret sauce" of incredible voice talent front and center.</p>

<p>This is a style of game that I think people yearning for more of that Telltale goodness from years ago will be very satisfied with. I can't wait for more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/disney-killed-adam-drivers-cool-star-wars-movie-for-the-dumbest-reason-2000637628</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kylo Ren/Ben Solo actor Adam Driver recently revealed that after working on the sequel trilogy of <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-new-jedi-order-writer-replaced-rey-delayed-1851747797"><em>Star Wars</em> films</a>, he and acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh pitched a new <em>Star Wars</em> movie to Lucasfilm. But because the movie was set after <a href="https://kotaku.com/well-okay-lets-talk-about-star-wars-the-rise-of-skyw-1840561224">2019’s<em> Rise of Skywalker</em></a> and starred Ben Solo, who dies at the end of that film, Disney allegedly passed on the project, which was tentatively named <em>The Hunt for Ben Solo.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/adam-driver-star-wars-soderbergh-jarmusch-4e08164d0419759f1b5b50d69864975d">In a new interview with the <em>Associated Press</em>,</a> Driver talked about his career, his love of working with talented filmmakers, and the struggle to get projects funded and approved. And during this conversation, he talked about a previously unknown<em> Star Wars</em> film that he and Soderbergh were pitching to Lucasfilm and Disney around 2021.</p>

 <p>“I always was interested in doing another <em>Star Wars</em>,” Driver told the <em>AP</em>. “I had been talking about doing another one since 2021. [Lucasfilm] had reached out. I always said: With a great director and a great story, I’d be there in a second. I loved [Kylo Ren] and loved playing him.”</p>

  <p>So Driver teamed up with director Soderbergh and Rebecca Blunt to create an outline for a film that would star Ben Solo, the son of Han Solo, who in the sequel trilogy has fallen to the Dark Side and become Kylo Ren. However, by the end of <em>The Rise of Skywalker,</em> Solo has redeemed himself, turned good, and eventually sacrifices his life to save Rey’s. Apparently, according to Driver, Lucasfilm execs loved it. So the group hired Scott Z. Burns to write a full script, which Driver told the <em>AP</em> was “one of the coolest (expletive) scripts I had ever been a part of.” Next, it was time to pitch the movie to Disney. And that’s when it all fell apart.</p>

 <p>“We took it to [Disney CEO] Bob Iger and [Disney co-chairman] Alan Bergman, and they said no,” said Driver. “They didn’t see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that. It was called <em>The Hunt for Ben Solo,</em> and it was really cool. But it is no more, so I can finally talk about it.”</p>

 <p>The AP reached out to Soderbergh, who confirmed Driver’s story and added, “I really enjoyed making the movie in my head. I’m just sorry the fans won’t get to see it.”</p> <p>According to Driver, the plan was to be “judicial” and “economical” with the proposed film’s budget, and for it to be in the “same spirit” <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311">as older <em>Star Wars</em> movies</a>, which are “handmade and character driven.” But sadly, Disney didn’t want to bring back Ben Solo. Meanwhile, remember when Disney brought the fucking Emperor back to life because it gave up on the sequel trilogy’s main villains halfway through? We live in the worst timeline.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-october-22-864/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Wednesday, but don’t let a little midweek madness stop you from continuing your NYT Connections streak with another successful puzzle. I’ve got the hints and solutions you need to get through today’s puzzle as quickly as possible. Don’t forget to leave a comment or join the Insider Gaming Discord server to let us know how your streak is going!</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections hints you need today! </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warner-bros-discovery-announces-sale-bid-potentially-impacting-game-divisions.1330480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery has announced it is officially up for sale, following the suspected breakdown of a deal between the firm and Paramount Global, which has dropped into the rearview. The news broke today that the board of directors at WBD has kick-started a ‘review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.’</p>



<p>In a press release, the firm revealed it had received ‘unsolicited interest from multiple parties for the entire company’. Earlier this year, Warner Bros. Games started <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-restructures-around-its-core-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a restructuring effort</a> to focus on core franchises including Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, Gme of Thrones, and the DC Universe, and if WBD <strong>is sold</strong>, those efforts will come into question.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-will-happen-if-warner-bros-discovery-is-sold">What Will Happen if Warner Bros. Discovery is Sold?</h2>



<p>If Warner Bros. Discovery is sold, the stock price will become volatile, content licensing deals and studio operations will be reshuffled, and brands might have their faces changed. This is all just as likely to impact Warner Bros. Discovery’s television and movie arms, such as HBO and Discovery+, as it is the <strong>gaming </strong>arms.</p>



<p>Under the Warner Bros. Discovery header sit multiple studios, all of which could be up in the air if a mega-sized corporation swoops in and buys the company. We could see studios shut down or split off, fragmented, or have their operations altered drastically.</p>



<p>This would be the natural course after the evaluation and review of spending, costs, and the portfolio under Warner Bros. Games.</p>



<p>Time and again, we’ve seen large companies swallowed up by <strong>even larger companies, </strong>and the action is almost always followed by project cancellations, layoffs, and studio shutdowns.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-potential-alternatives-maximize-shareholder-value" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from Warner Bros. Discovery reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While&nbsp;Warner Bros. Discovery (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:&nbsp;WBD) continues to advance its previously announced separation of Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, its Board of Directors today announced it has initiated a review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, in light of unsolicited interest the Company has received from multiple parties for both the entire company and Warner Bros.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>This suggests the previously reported split has now evolved into an outright sale.</em></p>



<p>CEO and President, David Zaslav, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today’s evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally. We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.</p>



<p>It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think there will be drastic changes thrown into the mix if WBD is sold? What do you think this means for the studios under the WBD label? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

However, the team determined that it needed more time to finish the game on its own terms, citing the ongoing war in Ukraine and the significant genre shift of the sequel compared to their previous titles as reasons for the delay.</p><p>“Developing a game during a war isn’t something you can ever really prepare for, but something you need to keep adapting to,” Frogwares head of publishing Sergiy Oganesyan said in a press release. “At one point, we were losing power for days as drones and missiles hit our power grid. When that tactic stopped working, it became mass drone swarms every other night, going from midnight until dawn. You work all day, then spend the sleepless night listening for explosions, and somehow still need to function the next morning… These things all slowed us down regularly to the point where it just doesn’t make sense to try to rush what we have left to meet a date that we no longer feel is worth chasing. How Moscow’s tactics to terrorize civilians will change again as winter comes is anyone’s guess, so we’d rather be ready to adapt again, knowing we’re able to take our time.”</p><p>Frogwares lead game designer Alexander Gresko added, “Switching to survival horror for the first time has been a whole new kind of challenge for us in itself, too. We’ve been making investigation <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,633 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s for more than twenty years, but survival horror asks for a completely different kind of design thinking. Tension, pacing, combat, etc. We’ve always loved the genre as fans, but once you start building it yourself, you realize how much you still have to do. It’s exciting, but it definitely makes development slower.”</p><p>Oganesyan continued, “We don’t have an exact date set for 2026 yet, but we thought it was better to at least share what we do know. We’d rather be certain than announce something now only to move it again. Rest assured, we’re currently aiming for the first half of 2026, so it’s a matter of months, not years.”</p><p>Frogwares also shared 13 new screenshots showcasing the game’s setting, enemies, and atmosphere, as well as promised that it will be “showing a lot more gameplay over the next few months.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

        <p><strong>Abolished Systems for Fair Competition / Mouse Controls</strong></p><p>“Next, I’d like to explain some of the systems we decided to remove in order to ensure fair competition across all platforms,” LEVEL-5 CEO Akihiro Hino explained. “First were the features we had originally designed specifically for Switch—switching between portrait and landscape modes, and stylus controls. These would be difficult to implement on other platforms, so we decided to remove them in consideration of the game’s cross-play specifications.</p><p>“Instead, the game will support mouse controls. At launch, mouse controls will be supported across Switch 2 and PC. Mouse controls will be added to the PlayStation 5 version via an update. Mouse controls will not be available on Switch and PlayStation 4. On Switch 2, the mouse controls are supported via the packed-in Joy-Cons.”</p><p><em>(Editor’s Note: It is likely the Xbox Series version will also receive the mouse support update. Hino never specifically mentions the Xbox version in the broadcast, even when talking about the system specifications above when the information was listed on-screen.)</em></p><p><strong>Player Bank / Potential Sequel</strong></p><p>“The game will feature over 5,400 characters, but collecting them all won’t be easy,” Hino said. “We don’t know how long it’ll take to collect them all—it could take an absurdly long time. So we’ve added the ability to carry over your save data to the next game.”</p><p>Hino continued, “To explain in greater detail, the characters you collect can be stored in a save area called the Player Bank. You’ll manage your players by transferring them between the Player Bank and your main save data. That being said, it’s not complicated, and isn’t much different from leaving your characters at a tavern in other <a title="Genres > RPG [17,718 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a>.</p><p>“However, there are alternate versions of the same characters with different abilities, so there’s a chance that even storage for 5,400 characters might not be enough. In that case, you may have to delete some characters as you progress—but I don’t think you’ll be able to collect that many right away anyway.</p><p>“The important thing is, the Player Bank can be carried over to a potential sequel, so even if you only manage to collect around 700 characters in this game, you’ll be able to continue collecting them in the next one.”</p><p><strong>Inagle: Official Player Search System</strong></p><p>LEVEL-5 will launch an official player search system called “Inagle” on October 22, which will be accessible via PC or smartphone browsers. Inagle can be used to search and view player stats, although some information will remain hidden until the game’s official launch. Plans are also in the works to allow users to create and share their own teams.</p><p><strong><em>Inazuma Eleven</em> New Era Kickoff Eve Festival: Four-Hour Special Broadcast</strong></p><p>LEVEL-5 will host a four-hour special broadcast called “<em>Inazuma Eleven</em> New Era Kickoff Eve Festival: Four-Hour Special Broadcast” on November 10. The contents of the broadcast are currently under wraps, but Hino suggested that various people involved with the series will appear.</p></blockquote><p><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2799860/INAZUMA_ELEVEN_Victory_Road/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on November 13 worldwide.</p><p>Watch the videos below.</p><h2><span>Final Trailer 1: Story</span></h2><p><iframe title="『イナズマイレブン 英雄たちのヴィクトリーロード』ファイナルトレーラー 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s9UO6I9qSQs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Final Trailer 2: Chronicle</span></h2><p><iframe title="『イナズマイレブン 英雄たちのヴィクトリーロード』ファイナルトレーラー 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3LcMY6e8Voo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Final Trailer 3: Endless Fun</span></h2><p><iframe title="『イナズマイレブン 英雄たちのヴィクトリーロード』ファイナルトレーラー 3" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1n8XcE8HZL4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>Music Video: “Guidepost (Ending Theme)” by Hinano Iwasaki</span></h2><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="【MV】岩﨑ひなの「道標」/『イナズマイレブン 英雄たちのヴィクトリーロード』EDテーマ" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7X7RQ-F7JHM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span>INA-DAI: October 21, 2025</span></h2><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="発売直前！イナズマイレブン特別公式配信番組「イナダイ」" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DCbzPJUh02o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-final-trailers-ending-theme-song-music-video-and-latest-details]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Lovecraftian survival-horror game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sinking-city-2/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sinking-city-2/">The Sinking City 2</a> has been delayed to 2026, as Frogwares says that the ongoing war in Ukraine and its ambitious design goals for the sequel will have necessitated more development time. While a concrete release date hasn't been set yet, the studio says it is aiming to have the game out in the first half of 2026.</p><p>"Developing a game during a war isn’t something you can ever really prepare for, but something you need to keep adapting to," Frogwares head of publishing Sergiy Oganesyan said in a press release. "At one point, we were losing power for days as drones and missiles hit our power grid. When that tactic stopped working, it became mass drone swarms every other night, going from midnight until dawn. You work all day, then spend the sleepless night listening for explosions, and somehow still need to function the next morning."</p><p>Lead game designer Alexander Gresko also added that The Sinking City's 2 shift toward a full-fledged survival-horror direction has also slowed the team down, as it has to learn a "completely different kind of design thinking" for the game. To make up for the delay, the studio revealed 13 new screenshots for The Sinking City 2, showing off more of the game's setting and enemies that players will encounter. Frogwares also plans to reveal a fresh look at the game soon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

                <p>A new report has shed light on Electronic Arts' use of AI, revealing a company that's implementing the technology in everything from game development to performance reviews. EA's position? Employees should view AI as a "thought partner."</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the report from Business Insider</a>, EA's top brass over the past year has urged its nearly 15,000 workers to use AI for everything from coding and concept art to scripting conversations around performance reviews and promotions. Internal documents Business Insider obtained showed some workers are not just expected to take multiple AI training courses, but also use AI daily to expedite work, with the idea that the tech is a "thought partner."</p><p>The company's in-house chatbot, ReefGPT, is one of the tools EA is pushing onto its workers. However, people Business Insider spoke to on the condition of anonymity said this chatbot produces flawed code and other hallucinations, creating more work that clogs production. Other people Business Insider spoke to said EA is expecting creative staff to train AI on their work, instilling a fear that the company may then facilitate a downsizing that could cut talent such as artists and level designers.</p><p>A laid-off Respawn Entertainment senior quality-assurance designer told Business Insider that AI basically did his job--reviewing and summarizing playtesters' feedback--which is why he believes he was cut from EA this spring, along with nearly 100 others.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ea-warn-of-reputational-risks-involving-ai/1100-6531814/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/" data-ref-id="1100-6531814">EA warned of "legal and reputational" risks</a> around the industry's mass adoption of AI, saying consumers could "lose confidence in our business and brands" if the technology isn't managed appropriately.</p><p>The company was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">purchased (pending regulatory approval) by a consortium including Saudi Arabia and Trump's son-in-law</a> for $55 billion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">one of the largest sales in the business sector</a> that--much like EA's AI use--raises some ethical questions.</p>

"We want&nbsp;to give you money, and we want to help you make a fun game," it wrote on its website. There is one caveat, however: Pocketpair won't be handing over bundles of cash if your project leverages generative AI.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer at Gamescom Asia about the company's stance on generative AI, Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John Buckley explained the company simply "doesn't believe" in the polarizing technology. He also wonders, given the fact that Pocketpair is regularly accused of deploying generative AI within </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, whether people will actually believe him.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"People are going to say I'm lying, but these are just the hard facts. We don't believe in it. We're very upfront about it. If you're big on AI stuff or your game is Web3 or uses NFTs, there are lots of publishers out there [who'll talk to you], but we're not the right partner for that," he says.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, he doesn't expect one publisher's stance to prevent AI-made titles from making headway. In fact, he feels the floodgates are already creaking open. "I think over the next two or three years we're going to get into this weird era—and you can see it slowly happening now on Steam—of really low quality, AI-made games.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mediatonic-founder-launches-new-group-of-studios-skeleton-crew" target="_self" data-discover="true">Mediatonic founder launches new group of studios under the banner Skeleton Crew</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's something that has plagued other stores but Steam had been good at keeping them out. But it's happening. This wave is coming, and I think we're going to enter this kind of authenticity market where people are going to slowly say 'no, these guys are really trying to make something special' to fight back."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="AI content under a microscope">AI content under a microscope</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He believes the influx of AI titles will result in consumers and developers putting games under the microscope in a bid to determine which leverage human ingenuity—and which rely on machine-generated outputs. That is going to create its own challenges, especially if you're a studio—like Pocketpair—that is falsely accused of deploying AI.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Buckley explains those claims are difficult to quash because you're ultimately relying on people to trust the word of a company they have already decided is untrustworthy. That means, in some instances, it's best to simply ignore the noise. But, there are some claims that require a response, such as a recent exchange on social media in which Pocketpair was accused of using machine translation tools to localize </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Palworld</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for the Vietnamese, Indonesian, Turkish, Polish, and Thai markets.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-knee-jerk-leadership-decisions-doomed-mindseye" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: 'Knee-jerk' leadership decisions doomed Mindseye</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Buckley says that simply wasn't the case and explains those accusations were based on an incomplete list of credits (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/developers-anonymous-the-normalisation-and-impact-of-miscrediting-in-games">miscrediting is, of course, a prevalent issue</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) that have now been updated. Even so, fighting those battles is often akin to pushing Sisyphus's fabled boulder uphill.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You know, I can't just come out and start fighting with these people [who make the AI accusations] because that just fuels what's going on," says Buckley. "[Regarding the translation accusation], one of their biggest pieces of 'evidence' was that because we hadn't published the individual names of the translators it must be AI. Well, no, this is just poor Japanese culture in general. A lot of Japanese games, the credits will say localization was handled by a company.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm not saying [that it is] right. It's unfortunate. We don't like it as much as anybody else. But it's how a lot of these companies want to operate. So, we reached out to out to a localization company and we said 'hey look, this thing is happening and it's kind of a headache for us. It would be great if you could just release all the names. They had to contact each person one by one. Eventually they got their approval. And then we released them all. Then, I made a quick comment to say 'hey, thanks for pointing that out, we released [the credits].&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-s-about-global-success-gamescom-asia-x-thailand-game-show-director-outlines-vision-for-new-look-event" target="_self" data-discover="true">'It's about global success:' Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show director outlines vision for new-look event</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A lot of the people in that thread said 'we appreciate you taking the time' but of course there are still some people in that thread who say 'it's not enough, it's AI.' That's when I feel there's nothing more we can do here. I can say 'it's not, we made it' and they can say 'it is, you didn't make it' and what are we going to do? Just go back and forth forever."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Buckley admits it's situation that, despite being frustratingly common, still stresses him out. He accepts there are legitimate reasons for people to make public accusations when they believe they've unearthed undisclosed AI usage.

            <p>Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto is "disappointed" the now defunct Ridgeline Games was not credited in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, despite its contribution being "the foundation of the game".</p>
<p>EA's Ridgeline Games, which worked on Battlefield 6's story campaign, was led by Lehto, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-game-director-marcus-letho-leaves-ea-and-ridgeline-games">he departed in February 2024</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-studio-closure-a-gut-punch-marcus-lehto-says">the studio closed</a> shortly after. "Gut punched to see EA lay off my team," he said at the time. "So many very talented devs who were incredibly valuable to the Battlefield franchise."</p>
<p>Now, following Battlefield 6's release, Lehto has commented on the lack of inclusion for Ridgeline in the game's credits. "I'm disappointed to see that many of my former teammates from Ridgeline Games were not properly credited in the recent release of Battlefield 6," he wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcus-lehto-7378b31_im-disappointed-to-see-that-many-of-my-former-activity-7386081189645885440-Q38B">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>"These talented developers worked tirelessly for one to 2.5 years, building the foundation of the game, before I left voluntarily and the studio was subsequently shuttered. Despite their significant contributions, most who were laid off were relegated to a 'Special Thanks' section at the very end of the credits - and several were omitted entirely, including myself."</p>
<p>Lehto embedded an image in the post crediting his colleagues at Ridgeline "as I would have preferred them to appear in the credits".</p>
<p>He concluded: "Game development is a team effort, and every contributor deserves fair acknowledgment."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has requested comment from EA, to ask if staff will be added to the credits in a future patch.</p>
<p>Since release, Battlefield 6 has been regularly updated with tweaks. In particular, EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-developers-u-turn-on-a-multiplayer-adjustment-following-community-feedback">U-turned on an adjustment to the game's multiplayer Conquest mode</a> following criticism from players.</p>
<p>Following his departure from Ridgeline Games, Lehto - who previously worked extensively at Bungie on the Halo series - revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-battlefield-director-doesnt-have-anything-positive-to-say-about-ea">he didn't "have anything positive to say about EA"</a>, in particular due to "industry sweeping layoffs".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Starbreeze Entertainment is passing the torch of maintaining Payday 2 onto Sidetrack Games, so that Starbreeze can focus more on Payday 3. Sidetrack Games will take over future updates for Payday 2, including fixing any bugs that may come along, adding quality-of-life updates, and just overall keeping the game running and live for players to enjoy.</p>



<p>"<em>Sidetrack (formerly known as the M.U.G. Team) is a talented team with deep roots in the Payday modding community</em>," Starbreeze writes in its <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/218620/announcements/detail/553504715299620867">announcement on the Payday 2 Steam page</a>. </p>



<p>"<em>Their work on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/414740/RAID_World_War_II/">RAID: World War II</a> showed that they have the skill and perseverance to deliver quality updates over a long time. They know the Payday 2 engine inside and out, and they've already gotten started</em>. <em>The first update goes live this Thursday, October 23, and is focused on the stability of the game and improving the overall player experience</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Collaborating with Sidetrack Games allows Starbreeze to maintain full focus on Payday 3, while Payday 2 continues to deliver value for all players with the dedicated, expert support they deserve</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We've partnered with Sidetrack Games to support PD 2 on PC! They have roots in the modding community, and we have trust they'll bring the game back to life!</p><p>Starting Oct. 23 the first update will come out, and they'll be focusing on QoL updates to start: <a href="https://t.co/JjEpneo71b">https://t.co/JjEpneo71b</a> <a href="https://t.co/USU6I0lU2H">pic.twitter.com/USU6I0lU2H</a></p></div>— PAYDAY 3 (@PAYDAYGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/PAYDAYGame/status/1980620480500383832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Starbreeze also states that it'll host a live stream on Thursday, where it will delve further into the details around its collaboration with Sidetrack Games.</p>



<p>This is the latest update for Payday 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month/">since the DLC subscription service</a> that Starbreeze introduced, and later had to apologize for due to Starbreeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-admits-mistake-payday-2-subscription-infamous-collection-bundle/">also decreasing the discount on the Infamous Collection</a> for Payday 2. Basically, it made the previous avenue for acquiring all of Payday 2's DLC more expensive, to make the subscription service more appealing. Starbreeze restored the Infamous Collection discount to where it was before the subscription service was released.</p>



<p>As for where Payday 3 fits into this, it's clear that Starbreeze wants to focus its efforts on making Payday 3 more appealing for Payday fans, since many of them still haven't moved off of Payday 2. The studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-co-op-game-project-baxter-canceled-starbreeze/">cancelled its Dungeons &amp; Dragons-based co-op game</a> in order to focus more on Payday 3, and now it has passed off maintaining Payday 2 to put more time into Payday 3.</p>



<p>However, even with the extra space to work on Payday 3, it'll still take years for it to be anything close to what Payday 2 is. The sheer quantity of DLCs available to Payday 2 players will take years to match, never mind just hitting the same quality bar as the ones players love in Payday 2. Payday 3 also, as far as we know, still won't include everything that players want from it, now that Starbreeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-no-longer-developing-payday-3-offline-mode-not-feasible-for-studio/">has confirmed it won't be working on an offline mode for the game</a>.</p>



<p>In any case, Starbreeze seems committed to making up for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/payday-3-bringing-the-big-buck/">the abysmal launch that Payday 3 had</a>, which was plagued by scores of technical and server connection issues, and a gross lack of content. We'll see where Payday 3 stands a year from now, and if Starbreeze has begun to make inroads in their journey to make Payday fans play Payday 3, which, two years after release, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/#1y">struggles to get more than 3K concurrent players on Steam</a>.</p>

              <p>If you’re rushing to grab the latest round of free-ish games included in October’s PS Plus Extra or Premium bundle, you might want to slow your horses slightly and double-check that you aren’t about to accidentally lose your ownership of one of the games forever. Due to an ongoing bug with the PlayStation’s current subscription service, if you previously picked up PS Plus Essential’s giveaway of <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em> in 2022, downloading it again today will erase your license to own it completely!</p> <p aria-label="Post Title: Fun fact: The Crew 2's &quot;Offline Mode&quot; still requires the Internet, and is unplayable during the AWS blackout. (As well as Settlers and probably 90% of Ubisoft's singleplayer games)" aria-describedby="feed-post-credit-bar-t3_1obfk0e">This issue is pointed out by <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2025/10/21/ps-plus-extra-essential-yakuza-like-a-dragon-game-license/"><em>PlayStation Lifestyle</em>‘s Zarmena Khan</a>, who has been trying to raise awareness of this hefty problem ever since Sony relaunched its PS Plus service three years ago. It boils down like this: Back in the day, when you downloaded the monthly freebies from PS Plus Essential, they were yours to keep for so long as you maintained your subscription. It was a great deal, and made logging in at the start of a month—well—essential. However, in 2022 this changed, with PS Plus shifting to be more like Microsoft’s Game Pass, such that the games are only accessible to play so long as they remain a part of the PS Plus catalog. Once they’re gone from there, you can no longer play them without paying for the full version. The problem is, if you picked up a game via the Essential service and then re-download it via the modern PS Plus, your original license is permanently overwritten and you’ll lose access to a game you previously owned once its time on the sub comes to an end. And that’s pretty bad!</p>

 <p aria-label="Post Title: Fun fact: The Crew 2's &quot;Offline Mode&quot; still requires the Internet, and is unplayable during the AWS blackout. (As well as Settlers and probably 90% of Ubisoft's singleplayer games)" aria-describedby="feed-post-credit-bar-t3_1obfk0e">This month makes this issue particularly relevant, with <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, which was originally given away as part of PS Plus Essential in August 2022, now available in the catalog. Reddit user kabirsingh84 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1obn64b/reminder_if_you_claimed_the_ps_plus_essential/">first raised the concern yesterday</a>, reminding people that the PS Plus Extra version that arrives today will delete your license.</p>

   <p>So before you grab it—and indeed any other game added to the PS Plus subscription—make sure to check your library to see if you picked it up any time before 2022. It’s so easy to have grabbed all three games in any given month, forgot you ever did, and then too easily lose your ongoing right to play it.</p> <p>Of course, this all shines a bright light on the degree to which <a href="https://kotaku.com/california-ab-2426-digital-games-the-crew-new-law-psn-1851659641">we increasingly don’t own the majority of the games we play, or even buy</a>, as consumer rights are eroded by deeply dubious digital licenses.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-quietly-clears-out-galaxy-s25-edge-512gb-before-the-black-friday-rush-while-apple-sticks-to-full-price.1330426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As the name implies, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is slim. It measures in at under a quarter inch thick. Beyond that, you’re getting the quintessential Samsung Galaxy experience with this phone.&nbsp;The Samsung Galaxy S25 family of phones come in a few different storage capacity options plus a whole slew of colors, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4899/">but right now the Edge model with 512GB is deeply on sale. You’ll save 40% on the specifically the titanium silver and titanium jet black options</a>. They normally go for $1,220, but the discount brings them down by $490. That makes it so you only have to pay $730 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Just because this model phone is extra thin, doesn’t mean it’s sacrificing any toughness. Each is made with a durable titanium build along with a Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 face.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Superior Photography</h2>
<p>Despite how thin the phone is, the S25 Edge is still able to pack in Samsung’s powerful 200MP camera. You can capture every stunning detail with the highest resolution camera on any Galaxy phone. It also includes and ultra wide auto-focus 12MP camera plus the 12MP selfie camera on the front.</p>
<p>One of the more practical uses of Galaxy AI integration in the S25 Edge is when it comes to the camera. The Samsung smartphone employs a feature called Best Face. You ever set up to take a group photo, snap a bunch in a row, then look back through them only to see there’s something wrong with each of them? Maybe Jolie blinked in the first, then Daniel got distracted and turned his head in the next. None of them are post-worthy. Well, Best Face can intelligently take everyone’s best look across all the photos and stitch them together into one perfect shot. It only takes a few seconds and can provide results for group photos of up to five people.</p>



<p>Selfies are also elevated when taken on the Galaxy S25 Edge. Galaxy AI can recognize your environment’s lighting and capture accurate skin tone, balancing the levels on the fly without any extra editing.</p>
<p>Finding photos through your camera roll has also been made easier. If you’re trying to find a specific pic you took, you can just describe it in your search to have Galaxy AI dig through your photos to bring you to it. Like maybe you dress your dog up as a Dracula for Halloween but you don’t remember what year that was. Just type in “vampire dog” and it should come up.</p>

              <p><span>The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise</span></a><span> is an excellent propaganda machine. Thanks to the anime focusing so heavily on the powerful bond between </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>Ash and his starter Pokémon, Pikachu</span></a><span>, everyone feels like they </span><i><span>have </span></i><span>to love their first partner in each game. These cute little guys are typically given to you by a professor, and they serve as an early foundation for the rest of the team you’ll build out over the course of the game. But sometimes, you’ll boot one of these games up and realize you don’t like any of your options. Then you’re stuck with this hangnail of a Pokémon you don’t really care about. Friends, what if I told you that there’s another option? One that most trainers, chained down by sentimentality, never even consider? Put that little shit in the box and catch your actual fave.</span></p> <p><span>Every time a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game comes out, fans decide which of the three starter monsters they’ll be taking out on their adventure. These fire, water, and grass-type Pokémon are meant to give new players a sense of the series’ rock-paper-scissors-style types and weaknesses, and usually end up being faces of the franchise for a few years until the next game comes out. The </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>games, however, have handled this a bit differently. Instead of three new critters to start your journey with, these experimental spin-off RPGs bring back old starters from previous games, but with a new twist. </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>gives Rowlet, Cyndaquil, and Oshawatt’s final stages regional variants, and </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>gives Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile Mega Evolutions.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>, however, has gotten a bit of flak for its starter choice which includes Chikorita and Tepig, arguably two of the least popular starters in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>history even though they are both my special babies who have never done anything wrong. So if you fire up a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game only to find yourself greeted with three Pokémon you’re not particularly thrilled about, are you just forced to use them for several dozen hours? No, my friend. That’s just what Big Pokémon Company wants you to think.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000005417" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005417"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005417">The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>While I’ve never boxed a starter during my initial playthrough, I’m no stranger to treating my game-sanctioned first partner like any other Pokémon on my team. That’s because the second I boot up one of these games, I’m looking for my real starter: a Pichu or PIkachu. My favorite Pokémon is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>Raichu</span></a><span>, and because it’s the evolved form of the series’ mascot, my basic ass has the wonderful privilege of knowing my favorite boy is going to be in most games (we don’t talk about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/only-three-pokemon-are-catchable-in-every-game-but-not-1850461272"><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i></a><span>). So every time I pick a starter in these games, I know they’re going to end up playing second fiddle to my electric rat. I learned at an early age that I don’t have to believe the lie that my starter has to be my best friend, because they’re often just a placeholder for the little yellow guy in my mind. That was true in </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>. I picked Chikorita, and when he evolved into Meganium, he was a surprise MVP of my playthrough thanks to the new grass/fairy-type Mega Evolution. But even though my time in Lumiose City began with this Pokémon, he didn’t </span><i><span>have </span></i><span>to be in my party any longer than it took me to catch another critter. In fact, most games barely acknowledge the starter after you initially get one.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, we have one of the more underwhelming starter line-ups ever, at least for people who hate good and cute babies like Chikorita and Tepig, with Totodile being far and away </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/over-half-of-you-are-picking-totodile-as-your-pokemon-legends-z-a-starter"><span>the most popular of the trio</span></a><span>. What if you don’t need a water-type Pokémon in your party because your favorite is Gyarados? Did Totodile’s ugly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>Mega Evolution after it becomes Feraligatr</span></a><span> put you off the blue dude altogether? The secret no one at Game Freak wants you to know is that you can put that little guy in a box and make a party that has no starters in it at all. Hell, take it a step further and release that red-headed stepchild back into the wild. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-crossdress-clothing-options-gender-2000637336"><span>Taunie and Urbain</span></a><span> don’t have to know you sent their Pokémon down the street with a bindle. Break free of the chains of decades of Ash and Pikachu brainwashing and write your own story.</span></p>

              <p>Dating isn’t easy. Especially if you happen to be a poor female soul cursed with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/magazine/men-heterofatalism-dating-relationships.html?utm_source=newsshowcase&amp;utm_medium=gnews&amp;utm_campaign=CDAQspWt0aOL99lsGPeQp6Hnw_mspQEqDwgAKgcICjCO64oDMJavPA&amp;utm_content=related&amp;gaa_at=g&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAj2070ceV5niWLiExz7RE6uqIscvHvFTwlASZjfdaIZDJ2TwX8FRRCWk55LxUyicaxQPQ25azo74ocH5pU8rHhCmNd0l0SrXjkLvZyd&amp;gaa_ts=68817188&amp;gaa_sig=FDeQQB0pPPY6GmEQ04nFWesgmVcQDaCT4UAJeHrOWle61WGf2D-tp0pqldaLrNruTgZ6mi9JxAvwOFLYbm0xWQ%3D%3D">wanting to date men</a> (it’s me, I am poor female soul). When they don’t seem checked out, they’re busy telling you the elaborate details of how their marriage collapsed over intimacy issues. Or confiding in you about their secret plans to make everyone in their polycule very unhappy. Maybe they won’t stop talking about video games (which can go either way, really). Or, as upcoming indie narrative game <i>DateBoy</i> simulates, maybe the guy you’re dating won’t stop <i>playing</i> video games. Ugh, my eyes are up here, buddy.</p> <p>Developed by brothers Anton and Henri Pätsi, <i>DateBoy</i> casts you in the role of a boy on a date at an Italian restaurant who is Checked Out™, too busy playing video games under the table while his off-screen date struggles to carry on a conversation. It’s a free narrative game out on Steam and Itch.io next month and it looks delightfully amusing. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/Ezkq3qqwUu4">the trailer here</a>:</p>

  <p>Essentially you play as a dude on a date, trying to play a platformer that bears a passing resemblance to <i>Gimmick!</i> on a device that’s probably legally distinct from a certain beloved late ‘90s handheld console. While hopping around in the platformer, you’ll have to try and keep up with the usual, tired dating conversational topics such as “How was your day?” with opportunities to deliver those one-word answers that us girls <i>love </i>hearing on a night out.</p> <p>Oh well. At least there’s pizza.</p> <p>The game promises to be no longer than half an hour. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4022300/DateBoy/">The Steam listing</a> makes for an amusing read, too. So if you’re looking for what seems to be a cute narrative joint, maybe mark this one on your calendar and try not to stand it up.</p>

                <p>Silent Hill has once again cemented itself as one of the biggest survival-horror franchises, thanks to critically acclaimed releases like Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake in 2024 and the recent launch of Silent Hill F. Both games--and an interactive streaming series called Silent Hill Townfall--were first announced in a 2022 livestream, and series producer Motoi Okamoto recently spoke about how this was a deliberate move on Konami's part to show fans of the franchise that it was committed to reviving Silent Hill.</p><p>"Three years ago, in 2022, we announced three titles--Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill F, and Silent Hill: Townfall," Okamoto said in a <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1979174851308032466" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media post</a> (via an <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-series-producer-says-publishers-cant-expect-players-to-get-serious-about-an-ip-with-just-remakes/" rel="nofollow ">Automaton</a> translation). "We didn't want to just announce a single remake to 'test the waters.' We wanted people to feel how serious we were about reviving the series. Developing a remake and a new title simultaneously naturally involves risks, but we wanted to convey our commitment first and foremost. Only when a new game is announced can the future of a series be seen."</p>

<p>Okamoto added that players would not feel motivated to give a new game in a long-running series a chance if the company behind it was adopting a "wait-and-see" approach, and only by approaching the IP with a serious intent could it get the fanbase for that game to engage with it.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/">Silent Hill F</a> have been critically acclaimed entries in the franchise, and there's still more to come.

			<p>I’m not really convinced that we, as a species, are capable of learning from our mistakes. Whether that’s because of real-world events making satire completely redundant, or the fact that people keep building theme parks full of monstrous, toothy reptiles and being surprised when they’re found meandering around with the leg of a guest hanging out of their maw, it’s hard to say. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> continues as the digital incarnation of that theme, but there’s more emphasis on the wellbeing of these creatures than ever before, while giving you the most advanced customisation tools the series has ever seen. Don’t worry, though, because the dinosaurs still get out, and Jeff Goldblum will continue to berate you for it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jurassic World Evolution 3 | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I3VojIHYpDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Most people will use the Campaign to get a foothold on JWE3’s revised park building, and Cabot Finch returns as the slightly bemused head of a new dinosaur conservation organisation, the Dinosaur Integration Network. After the more fast-paced, action-oriented campaign of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/05/jurassic-world-evolution-2-review/">JWE2</a>, this time out sees you returning to a more traditional park-building campaign setup, with a series of rundown parks and specific scenarios to work your way through. While I definitely enjoyed the change of pace last time out, the Campaign here is a real return to form, with a well-tuned level of difficulty, more longevity and more emphasis placed on the Contract system to drive you forward.</p>


<p>I can see people really digging in for the long haul with it and bringing every park up to 5-star level. As an introduction to the game’s systems, with some enjoyable narrative drive provided by the fully-voiced cast, it’s perfectly weighted, even if it feels like we’re swinging away from the celluloid timeline in the process.</p>


<p>The park-building has had some thoughtful upgrades made to it, with many of the controls and customisation options bringing JWE3 more in line with Frontier’s other, more realistic, park builders. That means that you can now build more organic enclosures, utilising scenery, such as mountains and crevasses, to form walls and barriers, while the new building blocks of scenery can also form part, or whole enclosures, giving everything a more personal and unique feel.</p>
<p>That personality extends to the updated customisation options for all the different building types in the game. There’s a host of building designs for each building type, and you can now change almost every aspect of a building’s appearance, from the colours of individual panels to the type of lights hanging outside. You can also add a vast number of decorations or create new ones, and because buildings are modular, you can construct unique structures.</p>
<p>There’s an incredible number of possibilities, and with a little thought and artistic flair, you can make your park look truly distinctive. If you love to tinker, this is the park builder for you, and once you have, you can share your designs with the community in the Workshop. If you’re less creative, you can already download a bunch of designs created by game reviewers and Jurassic World Evolution streamers, and I can only imagine how quickly the library will blossom once the game is out.</p>

<p>Alongside the islands created for this game, and a selection of legacy islands from its predecessor, Jurassic World Evolution 3 adds a new island generator to the Sandbox mode, allowing you to bring all your borderline-dangerous visions to life. Sliders let you alter the shape of your creation, the amount of water, the number of mountains and the level of trees that grow across it. This framework is then shareable, via a unique DNA code, if you want to try out a friend’s layout, or have a go at your favourite YouTuber’s creation.</p>
<p>Not every island immediately looks perfect. The mountains, in particular, seem a little off if you maximise the number to include, and open spaces can feel a bit barren at first, but this is just a starting point, a blank canvas to help you unleash your inner John Hammond. It’s more than possible to create a great-looking island footprint, and it really helps to give you a true sense of ownership over your lovingly created park when you’ve had a hand in every aspect of it. Alongside the power of terraforming, and being able to create features like waterfalls, JWE3’s islands and parks are more diverse, detailed and deep than ever before. It’s exactly what we wanted from another Jurassic World Evolution sequel.</p>

<p>We’re here for the dinosaurs, of course. Jurassic World Evolution 3’s biggest addition to the formula is juvenile dinos, with younger members of a herd having a different set of needs and accommodations to make, while you’re still balancing all the other desires of a herd of Triceratops. You can help to tailor more positive genes, starting from the parents, and filtering those down to their offspring, and it adds to the sensation that these younger dinosaurs are wholly yours, creating the environment for breeding, and then nurturing and raising them after they’re born.</p>
<p>With differentiated male and female dinos alongside the juveniles, this adds some further variation to your paddocks, and the dinosaurs as a whole look even more realistic and extraordinary than before. One of the greatest joys of Jurassic World Evolution is just zooming in on a single Gallimimus or T-Rex, and watching them go about their business, and that’s better than ever in JWE3, with revised behaviours and dinosaurs that feel more realistic than before.</p>

<p>As a whole, the visuals have seen a mild bump in detail and definition, while performance on PS5 is largely very good, remaining smooth through most situations. You can start to make the occasional hit to the frame rate as your park grows bigger, especially if you play around with water, but the team have found a good balance between dynamic resolution and the pop-in of ground details and scenery as you get closer, to keep things feeling reliable. It does feel as though there should be a choice between fidelity and graphics modes on PS5 – all you’re getting is toggles for Depth of Field and Motion Blur – but I can live without it.</p>

            <p>
Publishers Slitherine and developers The Artistocrats have launched one of those high-fadoodling "2.0" updates for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starship-troopers-terran-command">Starship Troopers - Terran Command</a>, their violently arachnophobic real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> from 2022. It introduces Territory Mode, which sees you defending three planets featured in the base game and two expansions, and brags of "a level of personalization and replayability never before seen in Terran Command".
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Basically, its reshuffles the game into more of an open-ended roguelite thingy. "Instead of following one scripted mission after another, players now decide where and how to strike the Bugs and wipe out their nests in an open strategic campaign," Sky Marshal Rosco J. Press Release bellows in my ear. "Battles can be fought across the galaxy, with each planet offering its own distinct set of maps, objectives, and unique Arachnid threats--ensuring that no two campaigns ever feel the same."
</p>
<p>
In Territory Mode, you'll have to secure and defend Territory Points that generate income of a new resource that is used to recruit units, reinforce squads, and unlock new techs. The opposing Arachnids, meanwhile, will grow in power as the campaign goes on.
</p>
<p>
Territory Mode also divides the existing base game and DLC units, turrets and abilities into Battle Groups, which "function like specialized factions" and add "character-based elements and super innovative tactical options to every deployment".
</p>
<p>
It all sounds reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon 2</a>'s post-release Kingdom Mode, albeit not quite as lavish in its reframing. The requirement that you own the DLC to get full use of Territory Mode is obnoxious - there are 11 maps in the base game, nine maps in the Raising Hell DLC, and seven maps in the Urban Onslaught DLC. All the units for each Battle Group are split across the DLCs as well.  
</p><p>
Still, we liked the original Terran Command, with Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starship-trooper-terran-command-review">calling it</a> a "solid, slightly chaotic RTS that nails some satisfying tactical stand up bugfights, but could use a little more bite". The original game and DLC are on discount till October 28th. You can buy the whole lot for £39.13, €45.47 or $46.77. Would <em>you</em> like to know more? Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202130/Starship_Troopers_Terran_Command/">Steam</a> page, then.
</p>
<p>
Slitherine are calling Terran Command's second com(mand)ing the heart of an "RTS Renaissance", which also apparently includes their Cameron-era roboherder Terminator: Dark Fate - Defiance and Steel Balalaika's recent Broken Arrow, which I hadn't heard of till now, and which doesn't appear to have John Travolta in it.</p>
<p>"Slitherine has truly become the essential home for all RTS enthusiasts, and our continuous free support is how we repay the passion of this community," beams publishing director Marco Alessandro Minoli. "We are here to ensure that the genre thrives." Inspiring! Do you feel like we're in an RTS Renaissance? I am declaring this the Renaissance of overcompensatory PR.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Not a fan of bulky, tower desktops but still want something powerful enough to handle everyday work and play with ease? The Acemagician M1 mini PC does all that and more, and you can now grab it without paying the full price at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4898/">The retailer has slashed 35% off this compact powerhouse, bringing the price down to just $299</a>. That’s a solid deal for a model this packed, but it won’t be around for long. Get your orders in before the price shoots back up, or the stock ends for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4898/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>No-Fuss Build, But No Compromises on Performance</h2>
<p>The size is small, but don’t let it fool you. You’re getting an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor with speeds up to 4.7GHz. It features Hyper-Threading technology, so using creative, resource-intensive applications and running multiple programs at once won’t be an issue. Expect around 8–11% better CPU performance and up to 50% improved GPU performance compared to the previous-gen Ryzen 7 5800H.</p>
<p>For memory, there’s a nice 16GB of DDR5 RAM. It’s enough to keep the PC running smoothly during most everyday tasks, but you also have the option to expand it up to 64GB if your needs grow. Storage comes in the form of a 512GB PCIe SSD, offering ultra-fast load times and sufficient capacity for all your essentials. Keeping all your favorite movies and important documents in a single place won’t ever be a problem. Need more room? Add a 2.5-inch SSD and expand storage up to 4TB.</p>



<p>Port-wise, you’ve got five USB 3.2 ports, plus a USB-C Gen 2 port that supports 10Gbps transfer speeds, PD charging, and 4K display output via DP1.4. There’s also a 2.5G RJ45 Ethernet port for blazing fast wired connections, alongside Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 for when you want to keep things wireless. In total, you can add up to three 4K displays simultaneously using the HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C outputs. Graphics are handled by AMD Radeon 680M Graphics, so you can expect exceptional 4K visuals across all screens, whether you’re working or playing a game.</p>
<p>In short, this is an excellent option for anyone looking for solid power in a compact build. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4898/">You’re getting a powerful processor paired with impressive RAM and storage</a>. Even better, your purchase will come with a 12-month assurance for some extra peace of mind. Grab it for less while the offer is live.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dispatch Episodes 1 & 2 Spoiler-Free Review]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-episodes-1-2-spoiler-free-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-episodes-1-2-spoiler-free-review.1330378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Imagine a superhero game where you’re not the one flying into danger in a cape or a suit. Instead, you’re stuck behind a desk. That’s the vibe of Dispatch, an episodic adventure game where each episode lasts roughly an hour. You play as Robert Robertson (voiced by Aaron Paul), better known as Mecha Man, whose mech suit has been destroyed. Now, he finds himself managing a squad of, let’s say, unique, reformed villains at the Superhero Dispatch Network (SDN).</p>



<p>Available on PC and PlayStation 5, Dispatch is part strategy, part narrative, part workplace comedy. I like to think of it as a primetime office drama with superpowers. You’ll choose who to send where, dealing with egos the size of Los Angeles, and try to pull off heroics from the sidelines. But how does it all work, and does developer AdHoc Studio manage to capture the charm that had people fall in love with games like The Wolf Among Us, The Walking Dead, and Batman: The Enemy Within?</p>



<h2 id="h-dispatch-spoiler-free-review-episodes-1-amp-2">Dispatch Spoiler-Free Review: Episodes 1 &amp; 2</h2>



<p>The first thing you notice with Dispatch is just how beautiful the game looks. It gives off Invincible vibes, but with a bit more polish to the environment, shadows, lighting, and more. It’s not going to appeal to everyone, but, to me, it’s one of the best-looking games of the year.</p>



<p>At the start of Episode 1, you find out who Mecha Man is and why you end up losing your suit. From a gameplay standpoint, things are a slow build. The first episode is more about getting you into the feeling of how things will go as opposed to diving into the full experience. You’ll meet important characters like Blonde Blazer, Chase, and the group of “heroes” you’ll be managing. </p>



<p>From the get-go, you feel the weight of everything in front of you, from the emotional state of Robertson and the loss of identity to what the SDN is trying to accomplish. Part of a government project known as Phoenix, this <s>Suicide Squad</s> Z-Team of former villains all have unique track records and abilities that you need to learn. There are five different stats to be aware of with your team: Combat, Charisma, Intelligence, Strength, and Vigor. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The core gameplay loop is simple but satisfying: dispatch your team of “reformed” villains to handle a variety of situations. You’ll need to decide whose skills and abilities are the best fit for the job. Some are as simple as helping someone across the road, while others require you to try and put out blazing infernos. Each character has their share of strengths and weaknesses, with some even working well together on multi-person dispatches. </p>



<p>At the end of your shift, you get a recap of how successful your dispatches were and how the team improved.</p>



<p>Dispatch includes quick-time events (QTEs) during cinematic sequences, though thankfully, they can be toggled off. Personally, I recommend it because it can get a bit distracting to deal with during the game. If I had to find one main complaint, it’s that the QTEs just feel like something that was added for the sake of putting more in the game. They don’t really add anything to the experience.</p>



<p>Another area of the gameplay is the hacking minigames. Through two episodes, they are few and far between, but still provide a nice break during various moments of the story. As the game moves forward, the hope is that not only will there be more instances of them, but they’ll actually provide a challenge.</p>



<h2>A Story Worth Loving With Great Acting To Boot</h2>



<p>With this being a game from a studio of former Telltale Game employees, it’s no surprise that Dispatch leans heavily into branching choices and dialogue. It’s hard to talk more about the choices you make without spoiling anything, so I won’t go into what the options you get are. </p>



<p>What I will say, however, is that you don’t get to the point where they all matter too much just yet through two episodes. Every choice you make—the game tells you that various characters will remember what you say and do—sets up something, and it feels like we’re left waiting a bit longer for what that something is. And that’s not a complaint because some decisions do impact what happens immediately after, but you can tell when the bigger ones are being made. It adds to that feeling of wanting more that Adhoc is clearly going for here.</p>



<figure><figcaption>In the early stages of Dispatch episodes 1 &amp; 2, you get a quick introduction to most of the characters.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you listen to the dialogue and watch scenes unfold in each, it’s easy to tell that Dispatch is a game that knows when to be serious while at the same time bringing in a nice blend of sarcasm and humor to it all. It didn’t even take half of the first episode to realize how perfect Paul’s casting was for the role of Robertson.</p>



<p>In fact, every voice actor fits their character so well. Jeffrey Wright nails the crass attitude of Chase, while Charles “MoistCr1TiKaL” White’s voice captures the arrogance of Sonar, who might be one of my favorite characters so far, despite limited screentime through two episodes. Hell, even the seemingly harmless scene with Royd in the bathroom shows the personality of Dispatch at every level.</p>



<p>Of course, things can go off the rails over the next six episodes, so a follow-up review and final verdict—with some spoilers—on Dispatch will come after the final episodes are released on November 12. Until then, I can’t wait to see how the rest of Robertson’s story unfolds.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/edenspark-war-thunder-devs-gaijin-entertainment-open-source-ai-assisted-game-making/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/war-thunder-devs-reveal-edenspark-an-open-source-ai-assisted-game-making-platform.1330354/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Gaijin Entertainment, the studio behind games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-tracing-qa-fsr4-omm-ser-support-coming-soon/">War Thunder,</a> Modern Warships, Aces of Thunder, and MWT: Tank Battles, has announced EdenSpark, a new open-source platform where, along with an AI assistant, users can create games and make them accessible "<em>to console users hassle-free</em>" and "<em>truly own the code of their creations</em>."</p>



<p>The trailer frames EdenSpark as the platform that simplifies the game-making process with "<em>easy 3D modelling</em>," whatever that's supposed to mean, and that, with the help of its simplified toolset and AI assistant, you can "<em>create a game, and play it instantly on consoles</em>." </p>



<p><a href="https://gaijinent.com/news/edenspark-will-open-a-new-path-for-indie-developers-on-consoles">A blog post</a> on Gaijin Entertainment's official website speaks a little more clearly about EdenSpark, though the framing is generally the same, as EdenSpark is described as a new platform "<em>designed to lower the barriers to game development</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EdenSpark — Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J8JN9lKh5V4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>EdenSpark gives individual game creators an easy access to consoles, even without a registered company or costly legal paperwork. Anyone will be able to turn their idea into a game and share it with friends on PC, PlayStation, or Xbox</em>," Gaijin Entertainment writes. </p>



<p>"<em>At the same time, unlike closed ecosystems offering similar experiences, EdenSpark developers will retain full ownership of their games. This means that creators can keep their projects inside EdenSpark's community or, if they wish, self-publish independently, taking their work anywhere. This combination of accessibility and freedom is unique: major engines might offer professional flexibility, but they either don't help you [bring your game] to console audience fast and easy or are not available under FOSS, or neither. EdenSpark bridges the gap</em>."</p>



<p>Essentially, it seems like EdenSpark is a platform that users will be able to create games on their PC or console, and begin playing the game they just made, something akin to MediaMolecule's Dreams. It seems to go further, though, because it's not all one stylistic look, and if you wanted to take that game and properly publish it on the PlayStation or Xbox store, you'd be able to do just that.</p>



<p>So, if all you wanted to do was make a game and have people play it on their consoles, EdenSpark purports to be able to do that. But it's unclear if users will be able to monetize their games on EdenSpark, or if they'd have to self-publish in order to make money selling the games they made with EdenSpark. It's also unclear if, even with Gaijin Entertainment repeatedly saying that users will "<em>own</em>" the code their games are built on, Gaijin Entertainment would still ask for a cut of any profits made from games created on its platform.</p>



<p>It also seems like the AI assistant is a huge part of EdenSpark achieving its goal to "<em>lower the barriers to game development</em>." </p>



<p>"<em>Experienced</em> <em>programmers can dive deep into code, while complete newcomers can rely on AI-assisted tools to generate art, sound, and gameplay logic, or simply build worlds using plain prompts. It's even possible to create games using a retail console</em>,<em> with a keyboard being the only extra accessory you'll need</em>. <em>EdenSpark is powered by Gaijin's Dagor Engine, the proven technology powering blockbuster titles such as War Thunder, Enlisted and Active Matter, ensuring professional-grade performance for projects of any scale</em>."</p>



<p>At some point in November 2025, Gaijin Entertainment will host a closed beta where users in the beta can take a look at several "<em>game prototypes</em>" and play around with EdenSpark before it launches into its 1.0 version sometime in Summer 2026, according to the <a href="https://edenspark.io/en">roadmap on the platform's official website</a>. The AI assistant for EdenSpark will also only be available in its 1.0 launch.</p>



<p>"<em>EdenSpark is more than just another game creation kit,</em>" added Anton Yudintsev, Gaijin Entertainment's co-founder. "<em>It’s the first platform that truly opens consoles to solo developers, while guaranteeing they remain the owners of their games. Whether you want to share a funny prototype with friends or build a real career as an independent studio, EdenSpark gives you both the tools and the freedom.”</em></p>



<p>At this point, it's too early to say with confidence if EdenSpark will be anything of note in the games industry or not. There are already free game-making platforms that let people jump into game development with plenty of tutorials and assistance to help make it as easy as possible. EdenSpark claims to be a new level of ease-of-use, partly because you can use it on any PlayStation or Xbox console you'd grab at your local retailer, instead of having to swing for a development kit.</p>



<p>It's not a bad concept, realistically, there are just a lot of variables left unanswered, like if EdenSpark will let users monetize the games they make within the EdenSpark ecosystem, whether Gaijin Entertainment would ask for a cut of profits for games made with EdenSpark that do get self-published, and perhaps most importantly, how easy to use EdenSpark really is, and if users really could create games that hit the necessary quality bar that makes players want to pay for them. Or, if EdenSpark becomes the new home for anyone looking to make the kinds of AI-slop games we already see filling digital storefronts, only now they get churned out even faster than before.</p>

If missed out on this two-day sales even hosted by Amazon to save on some cool things you didn’t know you needed, you’re not out of luck just yet. Some select deals have extended past the sale and are still discounted right now. Take a look at this Anker USB-C docking station. It’s not just a docking station as it doubles as a stand to put your monitor on. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4158/">For the time being, Amazon still has it going for 32% off. That discount brings the price down from $250 to just $170. You’re saving yourself a solid $80.</a></p>
<p>What we’re looking at is a 12-in-1docking station that can turn your messy and clutter-filled desk into an organized space that feels good to sit and work at. It can hold up your monitor with it’s shelf-shaped design while leaving enough room below to fit your keyboard when it’s not needed. Push it underneath when you’re leaving your desk or if you’re like me and you’ve just grabbed yourself some lunch while watching a long YouTube video.</p>

<p>Raising your monitor can also promote better posture while seated, even if just by a few inches. It encourages you not to hunch yourself over at your desk, keeping the screen at eye-level.</p>

<p>Tucked underneath the docking station is a sizeable compartment which you can funnel cables into, helping to eliminate clutter caused by disorganized cables just laying where they fall.</p>
<p>Designed with tough aircraft-grade aluminum, the docking station proved durable. Beneath the legs are some anti-slip silicone pads which keep it firmly in place. All and all, the work station measure in at 21.26 inches by 8.66 inches by 3.54 inches<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4158/">. That’s wide enough to comfortable hold most monitors available on the market.</a></p>
