<p>For long-time fans of the survival horror genre, we’re living in something of a renaissance. We routinely receive high-quality remakes and remasters of our favorite old-school horror games. Then, you have upcoming AA and AAA horror titles and the indie horror gaming scene. It’s an excellent time to be a horror gaming fan. But what about the Silent Hill 2 Remake release date? That’s what we want to know more about!</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-silent-hill-2-remake-release-date">Do We Know the Silent Hill 2 Remake Release Date?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there is no word yet as to an official release date for Silent Hill 2 Remake. That said, Konami recently announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-transmission-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill Transmission</a>, an upcoming showcase in which they’ll reveal more about their survival horror remake. We might even see a few other projects from within the series.</p>



<p>While unconfirmed, we may see additional gameplay from Silent Hill 2 Remake and a potential release date or window during the upcoming showcase. The publisher announced the survival horror remake in October 2022; by then, development had been ongoing for an unknown period. By now, the remake should be nearly finished, so we’re hoping for a fall release window, perhaps around Halloween.</p>



<p>Once we have an official release date, you’ll be the first to know right here on Insider Gaming!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-silent-hill-2-a-remake-or-remaster">Is Silent Hill 2 a Remake or Remaster?</h2>



<p>There’s a difference between “remake” and “remaster,” despite some developers and fans confusing the two terms. A remaster is simply an update to an existing game that enhances the graphics and sound while retaining much of its original gameplay elements. It’s a way to ensure you can still enjoy your favorite classics on modern hardware.</p>



<p>A remake, however, completely redoes the entire experience from the ground up in—often—a brand-new engine for modern times. It features enhanced gameplay elements for the contemporary player, better graphics, occasionally new content, and plenty of quality-of-life tweaks to the core experience. It’s the best way to play an old-school classic!</p>



<p>Well, you’ll be excited to know that the upcoming Silent Hill 2 is a genuine remake, built for the modern audience!</p>



<hr>



<p>While it’s fantastic that we’ll see more of the Silent Hill franchise soon, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-isnt-coming-anytime-soon-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 9 isn’t so lucky and may not launch anytime soon</a>. For more about your favorite games, we recommend signing up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

Resident Evil Zero originally came out on Nintendo GameCube in 2002 and then received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-0-hd-remaster-review/1900-6416332/#:~:text=The%202002%20remake%20of%20the,lighting%20and%20new%20camera%20angles." data-ref-id="1900-6416332">an HD remaster in 2016</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-mortefi-build-in-wuthering-waves-%E2%80%93-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions.882963/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-mortefi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-mortefi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="271" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Considered the best offensive support in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, Mortefi is capable of massively buffing the Heavy Attacks of his companions with his Outro Skill. He also shines through his ability to deal a fair amount of coordinated damage after triggering Burning Rhapsody. </p> <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false">True to that, building him is a must for all looking to both awaken his true potential and that of some of the game’s best damage dealers. Here’s the best Mortefi build in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-best-weapons-for-mortefi" data-injectable="false">Best Weapons for Mortefi </h2> <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">The best weapon for Mortefi in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is the 5-star Static Mist. The weapon fits him like a glove by providing a total of 24.3% Crit Rate when at level 90. Static Mist will also boost his Energy Regen value by 12.8% and will allow Mortefi to provide even more buffs by increasing the ATK of the resonator taking the field after him by 10%. The values are referent to the weapon at Rank 1.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Best 4-star Alternatives</h3> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">As a support/sub-DPS whose kit revolves around using his Resonance Liberation, the best 4-star weapon for Mortefi is Cadenza. The pistol is my main pick, given its 51.8% Energy Regen stat at level 90. To help make rotations easier, Cadenza will also provide Mortefi with Concerto Energy after he performs his Skill. The effect can only be triggered once per 20-second intervals. </p> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="737" data-injectable="true">If you are looking for damage over utility, Novaburst will be my main pick. Keep in mind that although the weapon offers a massive increase in ATK, the lack of vital secondary stats like Crit and ER will be felt. To add to the above, here’s an overview of our main 5 and 4-star picks, as well as a 3-star weapon sure to excel in Mortefi’s hands. </p>
 <figure data-found-rows="4" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Best Weapons for Mortefi / Main Stat</th><th data-align="center">Reasons Why</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Static Mist (Best in Slot by a large margin) / Crit Rate</td><td data-align="center">Provides a massive amount of Crit Rate, while also buffing his ER value and allowing him to buff your DPS with an extra 10% ATK. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Cadenza (main 4-star pick) / ER</td><td data-align="center">Offers a great Energy Regen sum and allows him to gain Concerto Energy by performing his Skill.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Novabuirst (Best 4-star for those looking for damage above utility) / ATK</td><td data-align="center">Boasts a high overall ATK value and will allow him to further enhance his Attack by up to 12% by dashing and dodging. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pistols of Night (Best 3-star) / ATK</td><td data-align="center">Provides a high amount of ATK when at R5. Capable of rivaling that of our 4-star picks.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Mortefi in WuWa</h2> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">The best Sonata for Mortefi is a 5-piece Moonlit Clouds. Once active, the Sonata will buff his ER by 10% and allow his Outro Skill to also boost the ATK of the character taking the field by 22.5%. The ATK boost will last for 15 seconds or until the affected unit leaves the field. </p> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true">For the Echoes, I recommend that you go with Impermanence Heron as your main in a one Overlord, two Common, and two Elites composition. Impermanence Heron is vital in the main slot given its ability to enhance the buff provided by Mortefi’s Outro Skill with a 15-second 12% Damage Bonus effect.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Best Echo stats and substats for building Mortefi</h3> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Best-Mortefi-Build-in-Wuthering-Waves-Best-Echoes.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true">Go with Crit Rate as the main stat for the Impermanence Heron. This is a must, as Mortefi needs to be able to perform frequent criticals to excel as a sub-DPS. For the other echoes, I recommend going with a Fusion DMG pair, followed by Energy Regen and ATK. If using an ER weapon, change the latter to double ATK. </p>
 <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="163" data-injectable="false">Focus on Crit Rate, Energy Regen, Crit DMG, and ATK when talking substats. Lastly, try to get his Rate and ER values to at least 60 and 130% for optimal results. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Are Mortefi’s Resonance Chain Nodes a must?</h3> <figure data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">Although not a must, unlocking Cathartic Waltz (his fourth Resonance Chain Node) will massively boost Mortefi’s potential. When unlocked, the node will increase the uptime of Burning Rhapsody by seven seconds for a total of 17. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best teams for Mortefi in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">As Mortefi’s flames burn the brightest when paired with DPSs reliant on Heavy Attacks, the best team for him will feature <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-jiyan-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jiyan</a> as its main DPS and Verina as its healer/sub-DPS. This composition will rely on using Mortefi to massively buff Jiyan’s Qingloong Mode damage. Apart from her healing, we will also have in Verina a secondary source of off-the-field damage and buffs. </p>
 <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">Thanks to their ability to perform enhanced Heavy Attacks within low intervals, Rover (Havoc) and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-danjin-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Danjin</a> can also work well in the main DPS role. For the healer spot, Baizhi can fill in extremely well for Verina.</p>

<p data-characters="307" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re looking for a strong weapon in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, there’s a couple of places to find them without entering into the gacha system. One, the Dauntless Evernight (a Broadsword), can be found at the top of the skyscraper where you battle Inferno Rider, and another can be purchased using Lampylumen.</p> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">Lampylumen is an ore resource which can be found in various places around Jinzhou, but it’s most heavily concentrated in the area where you battle Lampylumen Myriad in the tunnels beneath Tiger’s Maw Mine, accessed through the core of the tower in the middle of the mine itself. However, getting your hands on this 4-star weapon isn’t straightforward, and comes with a couple prerequisites to unlock the vendor you need.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="104" data-current-count="104" data-injectable="false">Namely, you’ll need to complete the first two acts of the Tiger’s Maw Exploration quests, which are:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false"> <li>Tiger’s Maw Act I: Hidden Dangers in Peaceful Life</li> <li>Tiger’s Maw Act II: Shadows of the Past</li> </ul> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">It’s worth noting that, <strong>between these two quests, you will need to wait for 24 hours of real time to pass</strong>. Xiaoyu will not contact you before at least 24 hours have passed, so it’s a good time to get some side quests and some sleep in.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve completed these two quests, you’ll unlock a brand new vendor within Tiger’s Maw named Shilang, who will show up as a padlock shaped marker on the map.&nbsp;To access his wares, speak to him and select Tiger’s Maw Ore.</p> <h2 id="h-items-available-from-shilang-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false"><strong>Items available from Shilang in </strong><strong><em>Wuthering Waves</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">There’s a number of items available from Shilang in exchange for Lampylumen, but the biggest star here is the ability to purchase a 4 star weapon of your choice. The Originite Weapon Supply Chest costs 80 Lampylumen and contains one of the following weapons, depending on the choice you make when purchasing:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true"> <li>Broadblade</li> <li>Sword</li> <li>Pistols</li> <li>Gauntlets</li> <li>Rectifier</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="42" data-current-count="42" data-injectable="false">The other items available to purchase are:</p> <figure data-found-rows="10" data-current-count="742" data-injectable="false"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Item</strong></td><td><strong>Cost in Lampylumen</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Medium Energy Core</td><td>2 each</td></tr><tr><td>Advance Energy Core</td><td>5 each</td></tr><tr><td>Premium Energy Core</td><td>10 each</td></tr><tr><td>Shell Credit (2,000)&nbsp;</td><td>1 each</td></tr><tr><td>Reactive Metallic Drip</td><td>3 each</td></tr><tr><td>Waveworn Residue 226</td><td>3 each</td></tr><tr><td>Extracted Phlogiston</td><td>3 each</td></tr><tr><td>Cadence Bud</td><td>3 each</td></tr><tr><td>Adagio Helix</td><td>3 each</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

The units available are as follows:&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true"> <li>Verina</li> <li>Encore</li> <li>Lingyang</li> <li>Jianxin</li> <li>Calcharo</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="112" data-current-count="112" data-injectable="false">Players can also choose a 5-star they already own to get a node unlock on the character’s Resonance Chain.</p> <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">Players don’t have to&nbsp;make the decision&nbsp;immediately, as the voucher is good through May 22, 2025. That said, for new or free-to-play players&nbsp;the&nbsp;free pull is more than worth using ASAP. I suggest pulling Verina to get the best-in-class support in the&nbsp;game,&nbsp;or Calcharo for&nbsp;very solid&nbsp;DPS, but each player is free to make a decision that best fits their party needs.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">Players will also receive&nbsp;10&nbsp;free Radiant Tides if they have reached Union Level 2 or higher, allowing them to roll for more chances at Jiyan. Between the free 5-star, these rolls, and the rest of the Lustrous Tides players receive throughout the game, no&nbsp;one should have trouble getting a solid team together for their journey in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="156" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A guaranteed pull in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, Baizhi shines as a support capable of providing massive amounts of continuous healing when both on and off the field. </p> <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">But there’s more, as her title as the only 4-star (and second overall) true-to-form healer in the game makes knowing how to build her just as vital as mastering your main DPS. To help you do that and awaken her full potential, here’s the best Baizhi healer build in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Weapons for Baizhi</h2> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">Thanks to her high Resonance Liberation energy cost, the best weapon for Baizhi is Variation. The 4-star rectifier is my main pick, given its ability to offer a 51.8% increase in Energy Regen (at lv.90). While at R1, Variation will also provide her with an extra 8 Concerto Energy following her Resonance Skill. <br></p>

Although its other passives won’t help Baizhi a lot, the weapon will provide the same amount of ER as Variation. To recap, here’s an overview of the best weapons for Baizhi in <em>WuWa</em>, as well as the best overall 3-star pick as an extra.</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Best Weapons for Baizhi</th><th data-align="center">Biggest Reasons Why</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Variation (Best in Slot)</td><td data-align="center">Will offer a 51% increase in Energy Regen and provide her with a handy amount of Concerto energy. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rectifier#25</td><td data-align="center">Offers a 51% increase in Energy Regen.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rectifier of Voyager</td><td data-align="center">Will provide a 32% increase in Energy Regen and allow her to restore an extra amount of Resonance Energy after performing her Skill.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h2 id="h-best-sonata-and-echoes-for-baizhi" data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Baizhi </h2> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">The best Sonata for Baizhi in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is a full 5-echo Rejuvenating Glow. The Sonata will provide her with a 10% increase in healing and allow her to provide the team with a 15% boost in ATK after each heal (cannot stack). I don’t recommend using any damage-oriented Sonata on Baizhi, as her set’s nature will cause you to waste it.</p> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="777" data-injectable="true">For the echos, go with Bell-Borne Geochelone as your main and pair it with two Elites and two Common class ones. Bell-Borne Geochelone is a must here and will allow you to grant the team both DMG and DMG Reduction buffs. When talking about the main stats for each echo, we will be prioritizing Healing Bonus, ER, and HP —the latter thanks to her set’s universal scaling. Here are the recommended stats for each pick. </p>
 <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Echo Name</th><th data-align="center">Desired Main Stat</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Bell-Borne Geochelone</td><td data-align="center">Healing Bonus</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Any Elite-class</td><td data-align="center">Energy Regen</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Any Elite-class</td><td data-align="center">HP or Energy Regen</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Any Common-class</td><td data-align="center">HP</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Any Common-class</td><td data-align="center">HP</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">For substats, prioritize Energy Regen and HP so that you can further enhance her healing and maximize her Resonance Liberation availability.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Are Baizhi’s Resonance Chain Nodes a Must?</h2> <figure data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">No, Baizhi can excel in her role in all stages of the game at R0. On another note, her fourth and fifth nodes are game-changers. The fourth node will increase her Remnant Entity number by two and boost their healing by 10%, while the fifth will allow her to revive one fallen teammate with full health per ten minutes. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Baizhi Teams in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">As a healer, Baizhi can fit all teams in the game without exception. Her ability to offer a 15% increase in Resonance DMG Deepen will also allow you to keep your damage up even when forced to change your premier rotation. </p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">Given her Resonance, however, she shines the most when paired with a Glacio DPS. That is even more true if on R6, as she will be able to provide them with a 12% increase in Glacio DMG. Her ability to heal your on-field character per Heavy Attack dealt also makes her a premier pick for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-jiyan-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/">Jiyan</a>. </p> <p data-characters="117" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="false">Now that you know how to build Baizhi, don’t forget to also check out <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-calcharo-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/">how to build Calcharo in Wuthering Waves</a>.</p>

If you ever wondered what they are, this is the whole list of current Ubers in the game so far.</p> <h2 id="h-all-uber-uniques-in-diablo-4" data-injectable="false">All Uber Uniques in <em>Diablo 4</em></h2> <p data-characters="105" data-current-count="105" data-injectable="false">The following are all the Uber Uniques in<em> Diablo 4</em>. They’ll be broken down by which class can use them.</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true"> <li>Ahavarion, Spear of Lycander – Druid, Sorcerer</li> <li>Andariel’s Visage – All classes</li> <li>Doombringer – Barbarian, Necromancer, Rogue</li> <li>Harlequin Crest – All classes</li> <li>Melted Heart of Selig – All classes</li> <li>The Grandfather – Barbarian, Necromancer</li> <li>Ring of Starless Skies – All classes</li> <li>Tyrael’s Might – All Classes</li> </ul>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Where to get Uber Unique items</h2> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="201" data-injectable="false">To get Uber Uniques in <em>Diablo 4,</em> you have to farm Andariel or Duriel. They are both Uber bosses encountered at level 100, when you have the proper materials to summon them in their respective dungeons.</p> <p data-characters="63" data-current-count="264" data-injectable="false">&nbsp;To summon Andariel, these are the following items needed:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false"> <li>2 Pincushioned Dolls <ul> <li>Sources: The Beast in the Ice, World Bosses</li> </ul> </li> <li>2 Sancscorched Shackles <ul> <li>Sources: Lord Zir, World Bosses</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p data-characters="55" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">To summon Duriel, these are the following items needed:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true"> <li>2 Mucus-Slick-Eggs <ul> <li>Sources: Echo of Varshan, World Bosses</li> </ul> </li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-shard-of-agony-to-fight-duriel-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2 Shards of Agony</a> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-summon-grigoire-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sources: Grigoire,</a> World Bosses</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="175" data-injectable="false">If you wish to fight the Tormented version of these bosses, you will need to triple the resource count and use two Stygian Stones to summon them at their respective locations.</p> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">In the case that you get an Uber Unique, but not the one you are looking for, you can <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-resplendent-sparks-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break this down to get Resplendent Sparks</a>.

They tend to have stats that are versatile among many builds for certain classes in <em>Diablo 4</em>. For example, if you are a Sorcerer, The Ring of Starless Skies can work with any kind of elemental or ability-specific build you’re going for. The same also goes with the Harlequin Crest.</p>
 <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="176" data-injectable="false">Drop chances are abysmal for these items and it will take you several runs to finally see one, so don’t give up. Group up with others in public lobbies to do a key share run.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166235/legend-of-zelda-lego-great-deku-tree-link-minifig<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="704a0a"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24094572/lego-super-mario-kart-king-boo-bowser-peachs-castle-sets-pre-order-buy-details">Nintendo</a> and Lego’s Great Deku Tree set is a two-in-one homage to two incredible Zelda games: <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>. The $300 kit includes 2,500 pieces that allow you to build a Great Deku Tree scene from either of the iconic games.</p>
<p id="AcOxhB">“In addition to the Great Deku Tree, the set comprises iconic sceneries from the video games including the Master Sword pedestal from<em> Breath of the Wild</em>, as well as Link’s House from <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, allowing enthusiasts freedom to customise their display,” Lego said in a news release. “The build is elegantly mounted on stands, providing an effortless showcase of the set.”</p>
<p id="WXnI0O">Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma said Nintendo wanted the Deku Tree as the first Zelda set represented in Lego. Here’s how Lego and Nintendo describe the duality of the set:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="L0xaFt">Notably, both builds offer interactive features. In the <em>Breath of the Wild</em> rendition, the Great Deku Tree’s face can be animated with the simple press of a lever, while the <em>Ocarina of Time</em> Great Deku Tree version boasts a captivating mechanism: when activated, its mouth opens, revealing a cleverly designed Skulltula (a spider-like enemy from the games) that descends into its depths.</p>
<p id="Ojwk9U">In the <em>Breath of the Wild</em> version, enthusiasts will marvel at the Great Deku Tree adorned in vibrant pink blossoms, accompanied by the iconic Master Sword pedestal. Notably, this rendition boasts an engaging feature: the ability to animate the tree’s expressive eyebrows and mouth, adding depth to the build.</p>
<p id="8QFHE6">Meanwhile, in the <em>Ocarina of Time</em> version, builders will encounter a lush green foliage-adorned Great Deku Tree. This version includes Link’s House, a pivotal element tied to the <em>Ocarina of Time</em> narrative, adding an extra layer of nostalgia and authenticity to the set. It’s worth mentioning that regardless of which version you choose to build, you will have the ability to construct both the Master Sword pedestal and Link’s House as smaller models.</p>

  <p id="c1wQae">Making a Hollywood prequel is often seen as a studio grasping for profits or audience recognition, years after an initially successful project. There have been plenty of maligned examples over the years, like the three<em> </em>Star Wars prequel films — which are now being reconsidered as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/5/18/18629598/phantom-menace-star-wars-prequels-expanded-universe-best-books-tv-series-comics">enjoyable parts of a larger-than-ever galaxy</a> — or Ridley Scott’s return to the Alien universe in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/26/15442036/alien-covenant-prometheus-dr-shaw-david"><em>Prometheus</em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/6/15569458/review-alien-covenant"><em>Alien: Covenant</em></a>.</p>
<p id="x79w4H">The newest player in the ever-ongoing prequel IP landscape is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em></a>, which transports viewers back to George Miller’s Wasteland for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163561/furiosa-mad-max-original-1979-george-miller-movie">the origin story of the titular young warrior</a>, and her journey to becoming the fierce, fearsome Imperator we saw in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>. The movie is a strange, successful journey through the Wasteland that earns its place as a necessary addition to the series — and to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23969917/best-movie-prequels-indiana-jones-alien-planet-of-the-apes">small canon of Hollywood prequels that are worth your while</a>. Let’s talk about why this prequel is valuable to fans, among so many that add little to nothing to a franchise. </p>

<p id="Le8Zty">Something that immediately marks <em>Furiosa</em> out from its fellow prequels is the fact that the story and screenplay were written before <em>Fury Road</em> even came out. “This movie was written when we were preparing <em>Fury Road</em>,” Miller explained at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152155/furiosa-anime-vs-movie-george-miller-explains">an early screening of the film in Los Angeles</a>. “We realized that because that’s a story that basically happens over three days and two nights, all the content, all the subtext, all the exposition has to be done on the run. So in order to tell it cohesively, we had to know everything that happened before, so we wrote the story of Furiosa.” </p>
<p id="f2UMt3">The screenplay that became the final film was shared with all the creative team who worked on <em>Fury Road</em>, setting up a continuity that most prequels lack, as well as an origin story that was decisively connected to the film that came before it. That’s a far cry from most modern prequels, which are usually late-stage cash grabs. <em>Furiosa</em> was always part of the <em>Fury Road</em> world, and we see that in the way the world seamlessly continues from one film to the next, and the way <em>Furiosa </em>is filled with characters and locations from <em>Fury Road</em>, like the Citadel and Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme). </p>

<p id="abTh90">Furiosa’s origin didn’t move directly from behind the scenes of <em>Fury Road</em> to the new film we’re receiving this year. It was developed as a potential anime series, and the live-action movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152155/furiosa-anime-vs-movie-george-miller-explains">still carries some detail from that version</a>. It’s a great example of how the film has grown and shifted over the years, and how Miller is willing to <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Mad_Max:_Fury_Road_(Collected)">envision his stories in different mediums</a>.</p>
<p id="oaFZmC">It’s worth noting that alongside that original <em>Furiosa</em> screenplay, Miller also wrote one about Max’s life leading into the film. While that story might seem like the obvious one to turn into a prequel, at the LA screening he revealed it instead became a novella called <em>The Wasteland</em>, whereas his origin about Furiosa became a full screenplay with concept art. That creative journey’s current final result is highly efficient about what Miller and co-writer Nico Lathouris choose to show us, focusing on major emotional turning points in Furiosa’s life without dwelling too long on any one moment. </p>

<p id="aQoAQE">Charlize Theron’s performance as Furiosa was so game-changing that it reframed a decades-old franchise, revitalizing it and putting a story about a heroic woman and her quest for vengeance and justice at its center. Because we only got to spend three days with her rampaging across the Wasteland in <em>Fury Road</em>, plenty of viewers wanted more. While we’d already met Max in his three previous films, there were no other tales of Furiosa to revisit, which singles out the film as something different from, say, <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em>, a prequel where we already knew a lot about the main character when he was young, thanks to the original<em> </em>Star Wars trilogy. </p>
<p id="TO53in"><em>Furiosa</em> also doesn’t sweeten the character or soften her edges — unlike, for instance, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23998867/wonka-movie-review-timothee-chalamet">Paul King’s prequel <em>Wonka</em></a>, which erases all the danger and strangeness that are part and parcel with a character who’s willing to torture children to teach them moral lessons. That film recast <em>Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</em>’s infinitely creepy chocolatier as a sweet, charming, whimsical fellow who would be lost in the original text of Roald Dahl’s often horrifying kids’ books.</p>
<p id="8in5CP"><em>Furiosa</em>, on the other hand, isn’t aimed at kids. Its R rating and its brutal approach puts its lead through the paces, allowing her to be full of rage, fury, and violence in a way women in action cinema often aren’t afforded. </p>

<p id="AinSoC">With Hollywood’s increased reliance on VFX to alter actors’ appearances, it’s surprisingly refreshing to see Miller rely on great casting to depict Furiosa’s early years. Like River Phoenix in <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em>, Alyla Browne remakes an iconic role in a convincing, memorable way, delivering fantastic scenes full of emotion.</p>
<p id="vrF63r">It’s even more impressive considering Furiosa’s notoriously sparse dialogue, with growls, grunts, and expressions telling more of Furiosa’s story than her words do. Miller pays strong attention to continuity here, with Browne as child Furiosa and Anya Taylor-Joy as young adult Furiosa clearly on the same page when it comes to how to depict the title character. The result is a seamless transition for the character from stage to stage of life, keeping the suspension of disbelief fully intact as Miller immerses us in Mad Max’s wild world.</p>
<p id="gcWIZQ">Miller has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/furiosa-director-why-he-decided-against-de-aging-charlize-theron-mad-max-prequel?utm_source=facebook%2Cthreads%2Ctwitter">referenced films</a> like <em>The Irishman and</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/10/2/20893933/gemini-man-review-will-smith"><em>Gemini Man</em></a> as the reasons he chose not to cast Theron in the role and use VFX on her face. Both of those films’ use of de-aging arguably distract from the story at hand, and the choice to cast Taylor-Joy keeps Furiosa from falling into the same trap. There are no surface distractions from the central story, which is lucky, as it’s stuffed with action set-pieces, unusual characters, and an emotional engine it’s not afraid to rev. </p>

<p id="HaEQCZ">Lackluster prequels often leave fans wondering, <em>Did these new details really add anything worthwhile to this world?</em> — cough, midi-chlorians, cough. But Furiosa’s brutal backstory doesn’t suffer from this predicament. Instead of defanging or overexploring Mad Max’s Wasteland, <em>Furiosa</em> expands on the long-running lore that provides intriguing new insights into different corners of the world.</p>
<p id="2SHrkO">Miller’s 1979 series launcher <em>Mad Max</em> was a tight slice of the lore and world he was introducing, and each film that came after it slightly widened that slice of the post-apocalyptic pie. In <em>Fury Road</em>,<em> </em>he expanded the world with a new set of characters and a new villain, Immortan Joe, but still kept the efficient scope of just a single wild journey over three days. With <em>Furiosa</em>,<em> </em>Miller widens the lens on the entire world over multiple years, showcasing the fragmented origins of the Wasteland and teasing just how the world ended up like this. We’re also introduced to multiple new characters and factions without any overexplanation, and they all feel like they could be ripe to explore further. </p>
<p id="CBXRIm">There’s an added contextual weight here, too, with future viewings of<em> Fury Road</em> permanently changed by the events of <em>Furiosa</em>. Glimpsing the idyllic utopia of Furiosa’s youth provides a bright spot of hope in an otherwise bleak landscape. And better understanding the Citadel’s high-stakes “guzzolene” runs gives us a unique look at both the culture and business of the terrifying desert community. <em>Furiosa</em> leaves us with a more holistic impression of life in the Wasteland and of Mad Max’s reality. </p>
<p id="zGa7b8">As Hollywood battles to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24144727/2024-movie-release-schedule-blockbusters-2025-box-office">understand and predict</a> what its audience wants in 2024, perhaps it can learn something from <em>Furiosa</em>. While it could be hard for some IP-based adaptations to go as wildly off-road as Miller does with the fifth entry in his Road Warrior franchise, they’d benefit from at least adopting some of his courage. If other prequel-makers dared to step out of the boxes they’re often squashed into — maybe introduce new characters, new eras, even a new tone to their movies, anything to make those movies matter — then “prequel” would stop being such a dispiriting word for fans of unique, innovative movies. </p>

  <p id="UnnzfD"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, the next major entry in Activision’s enduring military shooter franchise, will be available as part of Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/best-games/22372750/best-game-pass-games-xbox">Game Pass subscription service</a> from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23911151/call-of-duty-game-pass-release">day one</a>, a new trailer for the game confirms. While said trailer does not appear to include any actual gameplay from this year’s Call of Duty, it does offer the promise of much more info, which is coming on June 9.</p>
<p id="uiYlfY">That’s the Sunday when <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23915545/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-close">Activision’s new owner Microsoft</a> will hold its 2024 Xbox Games Showcase — which will be followed by another presentation, the <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> Direct. Activision promises an “in-depth look at gameplay in this dark new chapter of the Black Ops series” as part of that Call of Duty livestream.</p>
<p id="GDhleA">For now, Call of Duty fans will have to settle for uncanny lookalikes and soundalikes of former U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush, former secretary of state Colin Powell,  former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and former president of Iraq Saddam Hussein. Those political figures will play an important role in the setting of <em>Black Ops 6</em>, which takes place during the Gulf War.</p>
<p id="U79V8v">Previous Black Ops games have featured real-world U.S. presidents, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/23769879/jfk-assassination-video-games">John F. Kennedy</a> and Richard Nixon in the original <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/call-of-duty/2020/8/27/21404151/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-footage-ronald-reagan-trailer">Ronald Reagan</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/11/17/21570340/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-campaign-review"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em></a>. How players will interact with those early ’90s politicians remains to be seen, but we’ll find out more about the next Call of Duty soon enough.</p>
<p id="hk3vF4">Activision and Black Ops developer Treyarch have been teasing their new Call of Duty in recent days, primarily with ’90s nostalgia-laden videos that set the stage for the Gulf War-era setting of <em>Black Ops 6</em>. </p>

<p>If you’ve been sitting and hoping for an announcement on Resident Evil 9 to happen soon, you may want to sit down for this. According to known insider Dusk Golem, the game is pretty far out.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1795075373727613065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thread on Twitter</a> over the weekend, Dusk Golem say that people should “wipe the expectations of [Resident Evil 9] being announced this summer period.” He then went on to say that the game’s announcement is further away with a full release not likely until 2025 or 2026.</p>



<p>Originally, he claimed that the game was being targeted for a January 2025 release with a reveal coming “soon”. That seems to no longer be the case, and it’s something he apologized for.</p>



<p>“Sorry for the back-and-forth on that, that’s my fault,” he said. </p>



<p>As far as other games in the franchise, Dusk Golem says there’s no truth to rumors of a Resident Evil 1 or Resident Evil 5 remake being in development. The only remakes in development, he said, are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Veronica and Zero</a>.</p>



<p>“[Resident Evil 5] is not actively in dev now either,” he said. “It’s been funny seeing this.”</p>



<p>Despite the game’s announcement and release not coming soon, there are some things that he’s claimed about the game, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-location-to-be-set-on-an-island-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that it’ll be set on an island</a> in Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>As always with rumors like these, until they are either confirmed by the studio or independently verified by Insider Gaming, please take them with a grain of salt.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-xdefiant-hits-around-8-million-unique-players-in-1-week.882918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-8-million/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that XDefiant has hit just shy of 8 million unique players in its first week of release.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, XDefiant has approximately 7.6 million unique players, and multiple sources expect that number to reach 8 million by the end of today.</p>



<p>Late last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported</a> that XDefiant had seen 1 million unique players in its first 2.5 hours, making it Ubisoft’s fastest title to reach the milestone. 48 hours after launch, the game had 3 million unique players.</p>



<p>It’s understood that a ‘unique player’ means that the player has downloaded the game and opened it for the first time. The internal goal was to hit 5 million unique players within the game’s first month – a goal that has quickly been surpassed.</p>



<p>As many from our original report pointed out, unique player numbers don’t mean much in the grand scheme of things. Speaking with sources, several developers working on the project have also expressed the same sentiment, but they [developers] have said that it’s being actively addressed, with netcode being the main priority. </p>



<p>Concurrent player data, arguably the most critical metric, has reached a high of around 700,000 players, achieved on Monday, May 27th, a holiday day for many countries. But whether or not XDefiant can maintain such high player numbers remains to be seen—one thing is for certain, though: It’s an impressive statistic. </p>



<p>XDefiant is available on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

<p>The next game coming from Capcom in the Resident Evil franchise won’t be Resident Evil 9. Instead, the studio is working on remakes of Resident Evil Code Veronica and Resident Evil Zero.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1795075373727613065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notable leaker Dusk Golem</a>, both titles have been in development and will be the next games to release.</p>



<p>“I’ve talked to many others behind the scenes about this at this point, it’s something I heard over a year ago, think it was going to get out whether I was the one to say it or not, &amp; that’s about it,” they said.</p>



<p>Released originally for the Sega Dreamcast in 2000, Code Veronica was the first game in the series to release on a different platform before coming to PlayStation. Zero also released on a different platform first, launching in 2002 for the Nintendo GameCube as an exclusive. It eventually made it’s way to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC in 2016.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Capcom on the reports, and will update this story should a response be received.</p>

There it will share more details on the game, with a first in-depth look at gameplay “in this dark new chapter” of the Black Ops series.</p><p>Microsoft made the announcement alongside the release of a live-action reveal trailer called 'The Truth Lies'. In it we see world leaders including Bill Clinton, Margaret Thatcher, George H. W. Bush, and Saddam Hussein, delivering cryptic speeches. Black Ops 6 is reported to be set during the events of the Gulf War during the early '90s.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Live Action Reveal Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>News of Black Ops 6's release into Game Pass doesn't come as much of a surprise. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-exec-suggests-call-of-duty-2024-will-launch-straight-into-game-pass">Xbox president Sarah Bond</a> recently indicated all Microsoft games, including those developed by the recently acquired Activision, would launch straight into Game Pass.</p><p>Microsoft has faced tough questions around the potential cannibalization effect of Game Pass, particularly on games that launch on the service day-one. While Xbox executives have insisted sales can be boosted by a game’s presence on Game Pass, some publishers remain unconvinced. Former Activision boss Bobby Kotick, for example, was always against putting Call of Duty into subscription services. Unlike Microsoft, console rival Sony does not release its new exclusives straight into its subscription service.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-potentially-bringing-call-of-duty-and-other-activision-blizzard-games-to-game-pass">an interview with IGN</a> last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer was asked how he’d handle his and Kotick’s different ideologies after the deal to buy Activision Blizzard closed. "Well, there's a different person making the decisions," Spencer laughed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>New Call of Duty games sell for $70 and usually shift around 25 million copies, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. By releasing this year’s Call of Duty straight into Game Pass, Microsoft potentially risks cannibalizing those sales. Of course, Activision will also launch Call of Duty across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC as a game that can be bought outright. But with Game Pass subscriber numbers failing to grow meaningfully Microsoft is under pressure to attract new customers. Adding a mainline Call of Duty game at launch will no doubt help with that. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24158934/microsoft-call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a> has reported Microsoft is considering raising the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate again.</p><p>Microsoft is in the process of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">cutting 1,900 staff from its gaming business</a>. Earlier this month, the company shocked the video game world by announcing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">the closure of Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin</a>. There are fears more cuts are to come.</p><p>Microsoft is yet to announce a release date, pricing, or platforms for Black Ops 6, but it will reportedly launch across PC, last-gen and current-gen consoles.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Check out images and photos of the set in the slideshow below:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Legend of Zelda Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 LEGO Set Images</h3></div></output><p>Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>This 2,500-piece set encapsulates the essence of adventure and nostalgia whilst featuring meticulous details. Fans can build a selection of their fondest moments from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time or from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild through building and exploring the depths of the Great Deku Tree. In addition to the Great Deku Tree, the set comprises iconic sceneries from the video games including the Master Sword pedestal from Breath of the Wild, as well as Link’s House from Ocarina of Time, allowing enthusiasts freedom to customize their display. The build is elegantly mounted on stands, providing an effortless showcase of the set.</blockquote><blockquote>Notably, both builds offer interactive features. In the Breath of the Wild rendition, the Great Deku Tree’s face can be animated with the simple press of a lever, while the Ocarina of Time Great Deku Tree version boasts a captivating mechanism: when activated, its mouth opens, revealing a cleverly designed Skulltula (a spider-like enemy from the games) that descends into its depths.</blockquote><blockquote>In the Breath of the Wild version, enthusiasts will marvel at the Great Deku Tree adorned in vibrant pink blossoms, accompanied by the iconic Master Sword pedestal. Notably, this rendition boasts an engaging feature: the ability to animate the tree’s expressive eyebrows and mouth, adding depth to the build. </blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile, in the Ocarina of Time version, builders will encounter a lush green foliage-adorned Great Deku Tree. This version includes Link’s House, a pivotal element tied to the Ocarina of Time narrative, adding an extra layer of nostalgia and authenticity to the set. It’s worth mentioning that regardless of which version you choose to build, you will have the ability to construct both the Master Sword pedestal and Link’s House as smaller models.</blockquote><p>Eiji Aonuma, producer of The Legend of Zelda series at Nintendo, commented: “I’m really thrilled that The Legend of Zelda is joining the world of LEGO bricks, which has spurred the creative impulses of so many people of all ages.</p><p>“The Deku Tree was the first element from The Legend of Zelda we wanted to represent using LEGO bricks. This set allows you to build two different versions of the Deku Tree from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild with unique features that are a great fit for the nature of the series. I can’t wait for everyone to get the chance to build this part of The Legend of Zelda world with their own hands.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>The latest GamesIndustry.biz Microcast is now available in both podcast and video form, and can be watched below.</p>

<p>This week, we discuss (to the extent that we can, given how early into the transition period we are) our change of ownership with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more">IGN parent Ziff Davis acquiring Gamer Network Ltd</a> and its brands, which includes <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> and our sister sites Eurogamer, VG247, Rock Paper Shotgun and more.</p>
<p>We also talk about the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo">new leadership at Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Games</a> as well as the studio's ambitions for the future, which you can <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard">read more about in Chris' interview on the site</a>. </p>
<p>Finally, we reflect on the impact of the other acquisitions announced last week; namely, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-acquires-switch-port-specialist-shiver-entertainment-from-embracer">Nintendo taking Shiver Entertainment</a> off Embracer Group's hands, and Atari ending the first console war by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games">snapping up the Intellivision brand</a>.</p>

        <p>Money raised will fund development of its forthcoming VR combat title</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Toronto-based Sinn Studio has raised $2.5 million in a funding round led by Hartmann Capital.</p>
<p>The funds will go towards building technology to support its next real-time PvP VR combat game, which is currently in development.</p>
<p>The studio also received contributions from Boost VC, Republic, Alumni Ventures, Mana Ventures, MetaVision, and other angel investors including Uken Games CEO Chris Ye.</p>
<p>"We spent seven years surviving the ups and downs of VR as a bootstrapped company, waiting for that industry-defining moment, and the right partners to commit to our first fundraiser," said Sinn Studio co-founder and CEO Alek Sinn.</p>
<p>"We're incredibly grateful to Hartmann Capital and everyone else who joined our seed round for their belief in our mission to redefine the future of combat in this exciting new era of spatial computing."</p>
<p>Sinn Studio was co-founded in 2017 by Alek Sinn and Almir Brljak, and has since grown to become a team of 30 employees.</p>
<p>It launched its first title Swordsman in 2020 on Steam, which was later released on Quest, Pico, and PSVR 2.</p>

This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/09/xbox-reportedly-debating-putting-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-alongside-price-hike">while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch</a>, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/28/play-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-game-pass/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one</a>.</p>

<p>We don't know much about the game yet, but <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/23/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-featured-at-xboxs-summer-showcase">two live-action teasers</a> have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say,&nbsp;"The truth lies." The second, released today, can be seen below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGnCArMHE58" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>It features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/30/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-followed-by-a-secret-direct-for-a-beloved">the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase</a>.</p>

The 2-in-1 aims to satisfy both old-school and new-school fans and is set to go on sale in January.</p>

<p>The 2,500-piece set lets owners build two scenes modeled after the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild. In terms of characters, it includes both versions of Link, BOTW Zelda, and the maraca-shaking Hestu. Smaller details include the cooking pot, a Skulltula, treasure chests, and a Korok tucked away on the treetop.</p>



<p>The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 costs $299.99 and can be pre-ordered now on Lego's <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/great-deku-tree-2-in-1-77092">website</a>. It will arrive in stores on January 9, 2025. It joins other sets based on Nintendo properties such as <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/10/animal-crossing-lego-sets-and-pricing-revealed">Animal Crossing</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/04/28/donkey-kong-lego-sets-join-the-super-mario-lineup">Donkey Kong</a>, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2022/07/07/lego-reveals-largest-super-mario-build-yet-and-its-none-other-than-bowser">Mario</a>.&nbsp;</p>

PDT. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/10/19/konami-announces-silent-hill-2-remake-silent-hill-f-a-new-movie-and-more">The last Silent Hill Transmission</a> happened in 2022 and revealed a surprising amount of Silent Hill news including the reveal of the remake of Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill f, a new Silent Hill movie, and more.</p>

<p>The post announcing the event reads, "Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill. ✉️ Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we'll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch."</p>

<p>The safe bet is a teaser trailer for the movie and hopefully new details about the Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f, the latter of which seems like the franchise's next big original entry. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2023/10/31/ascension-takes-place-before-the-originals-but-isnt-quite-a-prequel">Silent Hill Ascension</a>, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it's possible we may learn what's next for that game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-new-mech-is-a-hotly-contested-topic/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=helldivers-2s-new-mech-is-a-hotly-contested-topic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="325" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following a short but effective delivery of targeted democracy where it counts the most, <em>Helldivers 2</em> players have successfully unlocked <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-getting-new-dual-autocannon-exosuit-but-gotta-earn-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Emancipator mech</a>. With a quad-autocannon weapons platform in tow, you’d expect the Emancipator to be the most popular <em>Helldivers 2</em> item ever, but there are some issues with that.</p> <p data-characters="603" data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true">Certainly, <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s exciting new mech (it’s yellow!) is the talk of the town, but not in the way anyone expected it to be. Notably, the community appears to be unsure what to make of the Emancipator, generally speaking, as the mech has inherited all the issues <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-patch-fixes-the-paper-mache-mechs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its oft-forgotten predecessor</a> has had since day one. The biggest concern, generally, is that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-mock-the-games-fragile-mechs-and-manufacturer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s mechs are made of plywood and glue</a>, but the vehicle’s autocannons aren’t all they’re made out to be, either, which has resulted in some players being fairly disappointed with the whole ordeal.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-the-helldivers-2-emancipator-mech-has-a-troubled-road-ahead" data-injectable="false">The Helldivers 2 Emancipator mech has a troubled road ahead</h2> <p data-characters="528" data-current-count="828" data-injectable="true">Even though the Emancipator comes with <em>four</em> full-sized autocannons by default, it would seem that this variant of the weapon is a fair bit weaker than the one Helldivers can lug around on their backs. Specifically, its munitions deal a great deal less durability damage (60, as opposed to the support autocannon’s 260), which leads to situations where it takes 25 perfect Bile Titan headshots to take it down using the Emancipator. The mech autocannons are, in other words, far less useful when dealing with large targets.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="730" data-current-count="1030" data-injectable="true">It’s not all grim, mind. The Emancipator is, from the looks of it, purpose-built to deal with <em>medium</em>-sized enemies. When properly supported by a full squad of Helldivers (<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-may-not-be-a-solo-game-but-its-how-i-like-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t be like me, folks</a>) that will deal with the more exotic threats, such as the aforementioned Bile Titan bugs, the Emancipator will make <em>very</em> short work of Chargers and the like. It’s particularly useful on the bot front, in fact, where engaging the clankers from afar with quad-explosive rounds will inevitably lead to efficient territory gains. As suggested before, though, as soon as the bots can engage your Emancipator without interference, it folds like a stack of cards, which is a problem with <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s mechs at large.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true">As long as you can stay on top of <em>all</em> of the bot reinforcements before they get to shoot at your mech, then, you do have the opportunity to do some serious damage with the Emancipator. Sadly, its 10-minute cooldown with a two-unit cap per mission mean that it’s hardly the type of force multiplier that it could be, if it was either more accessible or slightly more tanky.</p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">It’s not hard to see why the community might be confused as to what to make of this new mech, then. Some are having lots of fun with the Emancipator in its current configuration, whereas others see the sheer potential of the mech vehicles in <em>Helldivers 2</em> and wish that Arrowhead would choose to deliver upon this fantasy.</p> <figure data-current-count="627" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="false">For what it’s worth, the former Arrowhead Games CEO does agree that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/former-helldivers-2-ceo-says-time-to-kill-too-high-promises-balance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s time-to-kill is a fair bit too high</a>, which suggests some big changes are ahead for the game’s meta. Making <em>some</em> enemies less tanky would certainly help elevate the Emancipator’s usefulness in the long run, but at least it’s being used a lot now that it serves as a free fifth Stratagem, right?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-like-the-way-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-thinks.882873/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/lorelei-laser-eyes-puzzles-logic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After writing about<a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-laser-eyes-tips-steam-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em></a>last week, a friend and I have been playing it obsessively, cramming in the hours until the phrase “<a href="https://x.com/A_i/status/1792999471418318918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s locked</a>” appears in our dreams. As I predicted, the game is a lot more fun with a buddy–one who can bring a new perspective but doesn’t have to bring new knowledge, because of the excellent design choice to put everything you need to solve the game’s puzzles in the game itself.</p><p><em>Lorelei</em> is crammed with books, notes, posters, and signs, all of which get saved in your character’s memory. This stashed stuff, as far as I can tell, contains all the information you need to solve the puzzles the game throws at you. There’s a document about Roman numerals, and one explaining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strobogrammatic_number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strobogrammatic numbers</a>, and one explaining astrological signs, and one explaining the Greek alphabet, all concepts you’ll need to know. If you need to know a name or a date, you’ll find something inside the hotel with the answer or a clue to it.&nbsp;</p><p>I appreciate this for a couple reasons. For one, it means that when my friend and I felt like a puzzle was referencing something we didn’t understand, we knew we’d find it somewhere along the line, instead of assuming it was some gap in our own knowledge. We knew not to rush to Google like many other puzzle games assume you will or require you to. <em>Lorelei</em> drives this idea home in a couple of pivotal puzzles I won’t spoil for you, both of which require knowledge about the game and its environments. It subtly tells you how to think about and pay attention to the game, while also making <em>Lorelei</em>’s strange hotel feel like its own unique, contained world.&nbsp;</p><p>This design also gave us some guardrails when trying to figure out what a puzzle wanted. The other night, we were attempting to solve a puzzle with a list of numbers and some blanked-out spaces, and we weren’t sure what it was asking us to do. My friend thought she’d seen a similar type of puzzle before in her own life, but I’d never heard of that kind of thing; it seemed like an obscure, specialized kind of math, or at least not one commonly encountered. Because of this, we figured that it was probably not what the game wanted us to do; we tried it anyway (or, my friend did some wild thing with numbers in our notebook while I watched), and sure enough, it wasn’t the solution.</p><p>In a similar vein, from what I’ve seen so far, puzzles follow a certain consistent internal logic that I also appreciate. Puzzles seem to fall into certain categories: all the movie posters near locked doors require referring to a certain piece of information; all these [spoilers] fit into [spoilers]; all these safes are opened with clues from nearby documents. (What do I do with the things in the safes? No idea!) This has helped my friend and I know where <em>not</em> to look when trying to solve something, or kept us on track when we’d start spinning wild connections between disparate pieces of information. This can be maddening–there’s one puzzle we’ve been staring at for hours, having no idea how to translate its clue into action, but we <em>know </em>it’s in there–but it’s also comforting–from what I’ve seen so far, the game isn’t going to throw a curveball at us by changing up the logic of a category of puzzle. Puzzles seem like they stay in their lanes, as it were; despite how overwhelming all these puzzles felt when I first encountered them, now that I understand the basics of what they want, they feel far less stressful. (Again, this doesn’t mean I have any idea how to <em>solve</em> many of them!)&nbsp;</p><p>The more my friend and I have played, the more I’ve come to see and appreciate how <em>Lorelei </em>thinks, to see how fair and reasonable it is even when it drops something in my lap that makes me yell “what the fuck?!” and throw my pen across the room. Don’t get me wrong, the game is positively maddening, but I know when I’m stumped that it’s a question of how I’m thinking about a puzzle, not because I’m not so great at math or because there’s some trick. Many solutions have been surprising, but they haven’t felt illogical or like they came out of nowhere.&nbsp;</p><p>We haven’t finished the game yet, though it feels like we’re heading toward the end of its narrative. There’s still a host of puzzles that we have no clue how to solve or if we even <em>need</em> to solve them to finish, so it’s possible there’s something I haven’t seen yet that will throw this blog out the window. (If you’ve finished it and I’m wrong about all this, let me know!) But <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> has gone from a game that intimidated and frustrated me at first glance to one whose world and logic I can’t get enough of, whose puzzles I take pictures of on my phone to stare at when I’m not at my desk. I’m both excited to solve its biggest puzzles and find out how it ends, and one of those games I feel like I never want to be done with.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The June 2024 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games have been confirmed, with Sony offering up a trio of games for all PS Plus subscribers – Essentials, Extra and Premium. Headlining this month’s selection is Streets of Rage 4, the retro revival of the classic beat ’em up series.</p>
<p>The announcement has come with the big Days of Play 2024 promotion launch, which will bring big discounts to subscriptions, hardware, and across the PS Store. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/day-of-play-2024-adds-psvr-2-games-to-ps-plus-premium-kicks-off-huge-ps-store-sale/">Head here for more details</a>.</p>



<p>The following three&nbsp;games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, 4th June.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</strong></li>
<li><strong>AEW Fight Forever</strong></li>
<li><strong>Streets of Rage 4</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Streets of Rage 4 is a modern classic, for side-scrolling beat ’em up fans. Published by DotEmu, whose reputation for retro revivals was already well established, it was another big success story. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">9/10 Streets of Rage 4 review</a>, Aran said, “The fighting is great, the visuals are great, and the soundtrack is great. Lizardcube and Guard Crush have managed to capture the essence of those classic games and upgrade it for the modern age.</p>


<p>The same can’t really be said of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/07/aew-fight-forever-review/">AEW Fight Forever</a>, which thoroughly disappointed our resident wrestling head, Ade. So let’s move right along.</p>
<p>Rounding things out, SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake was a solid if unremarkable new platformer based on the incredibly popular cartoon series. “SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is a decent 3D platformer filled with all the SpongeBob humour you’d expect, but it feels like a step back when compared to the far more imaginative Battle for Bikini Bottom: Reheydrated,” Steve said <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/30/spongebob-squarepants-the-cosmic-shake-review/">in our review</a>.</p>

<p>What do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the May 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab May’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 6th June, but with the Euros just about to get going, you’ll be able to get EA Sports FC 24 through 18th June. What a nice surprise for inattentive football likers?</p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>EA Sports FC 24</strong> (PS4 | PS5)</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Ghostrunner 2</strong> (PS5)</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Tunic</strong> (PS4 | PS5)</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Destiny 2: Lightfall</strong> (PS4 | PS5)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/01/the-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-may-have-been-revealed-and-theres-a-bonus-fourth-game/">Head here for more details.</a></p>

There’s been pent-up demand: Lego has rejected fan-submitted ideas for a <em>Zelda</em>-themed set for years, going so far as to outright ban <em>Zelda </em>submissions back in 2022 due to “license conflict.” However, rumors regarding an official <em>Zelda</em> Lego set <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/1/23581768/legend-of-zelda-lego-leak-jean-grey-forever-promobricks">started popping up</a> in February of last year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It would be nice if this led to Sony supporting the series further with a fifth entry to resolve 2013’s <em>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</em>’s devastating cliffhanger, but PlayStation will never give me that relief.</p><figure id="" data-id="7ecac186cca97bdae00f54b1638ed1e8" data-recommend-id="image://7ecac186cca97bdae00f54b1638ed1e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1800" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sly jumping from a roof." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sly jumping from a roof." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sucker Punch Productions</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ecac186cca97bdae00f54b1638ed1e8" data-recommend-id="image://7ecac186cca97bdae00f54b1638ed1e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1800" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sly jumping from a roof." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All of these games are being added to the PS2 section of the Classics catalog as part of Sony’s Days of Play sale.

<p data-characters="250" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Oh, look. It’s been a picosecond since the last Steam sales event. No doubt many of you took advantage of the last one – the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/balatro-stellaris-and-more-are-in-steams-endless-replayability-fest/">Endless Replayability Fest</a>. Well, don’t put your money away just yet, as we’re already onto the next one.</p> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">Beginning yesterday, the Steam Open World Survival Crafting Fest (and breathe) offers discounts on a series of well-known and slightly less well-known games from, well, Open World Survival Crafting games. You’ve got until Monday, June 3 at 10 a.m. PT to choose from what I would say is a pretty good list of titles.</p> <figure data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Steam Open World Survival Crafting Fest 2024: Official Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Q-LiQqpPww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Take a quick look on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/open_world_survival_craft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales page</a> to see for yourself. Want 30% off <em>Sons of the Forest</em>? Of course you do. How about 33% off <em>Project Zomboid</em>? An odd number, but sure! Or maybe you want to get <em>Stranded Deep</em>, <em>Valheim</em>, or <em>Subnautica</em> for 50% off each. Even <em>Palworld</em> is there, at 10% off the regular asking price.</p> <h2 id="h-summer-lovin" data-injectable="false">Summer lovin’</h2> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true">These events seem to come around more often these days. However, we’re not quite at the big <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-the-steam-summer-sale-2024-begin/">Steam Summer Sale</a> just yet. That begins in a few weeks. You can keep an eye on the <a href="https://steamdb.info/sales/history/?event=160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a> countdown if you really want to see exactly when it’s scheduled to begin.</p>
 <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false">Crafting and survival games feel like they shouldn’t be as popular as they are. But as we can see here, there are still so many offerings, largely from more independent studios. A lot of them are pretty decent as well, in my experience.</p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="438" data-injectable="false">There are definitely more than a few in the sale that I’m keen to try out; <em>Sons of the Forest</em>, <em>Project Zomboid</em>, maybe even <em>Enshrouded</em>. Can I afford all these games? Check back with me later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-now-out-in-early-access-from-the-makers-of-dead-cells/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-now-out-in-early-access-from-the-makers-of-dead-cells<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="272" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It hasn’t taken long for the <em>Dead Cells</em> developer, Evil Empire, to settle on an exciting new project. Its title? <em>Prince of Persia</em>! But not any regular old <em>Prince of Persia</em>; <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-real-and-coming-to-early-access-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em></a>, and it’s pretty easy to tell what makes it special.</p> <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">Notably, Evil Empire and Ubisoft have launched the first <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2717880/The_Rogue_Prince_of_Persia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Early Access build</a> of the <em>Rogue Prince of Persia</em>, and though it is still early to say whether it’s a slam dunk, it sure is a whole lot of fun. There are some really interesting tidbits about this game, mind: firstly, even though it is being published by Ubisoft, <em>Rogue Prince </em>does not necessitate a Ubisoft Connect login. Secondly, the game both is, and is not, reminiscent of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dead-cells-is-about-to-get-its-final-major-content-update-after-many-many-years-of-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the classic <em>Dead Cells</em></a>, which results in a fresh and exciting gameplay loop, even this early in its development.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Evil Empire</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-evil-empire-s-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-off-to-a-good-start" data-injectable="false">Evil Empire’s Rogue Prince of Persia is off to a good start</h2> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true">With just under 200 reviews written at the time of writing, and a “Mostly Positive” review rating, <em>Rogue Prince of Persia</em> already enjoys some amount of acclaim. The game itself is a relatively straightforward acrobatic platformer that doesn’t even try to hide its <em>Dead Cells</em> pedigree.</p>
 <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">On top of delightfully rotoscoped animations and character models, albeit delivered in a slightly different style than what we saw with <em>Dead Cells</em>, <em>Rogue Prince</em>‘s core gameplay loop consists of basically the same elements. A few tweaks here and there, granted, but anyone who’s spent any amount of time with <em>Dead Cells</em> will feel right at home here. </p> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="817" data-injectable="true">Once again, players need to collect resources dropped by enemies to research new gear and gadgets. The Prince does so by repeatedly attempting to wall-run his way through hordes of magic-infused Huns, with the familiar choice of levels coming up every so often. The current build of the game has two boss encounters in tow and about half a dozen unique levels, which all comes together into a lovely proof-of-concept for what’s to come in the future.</p>
 <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">“We plan to be in Early Access for around a year, probably a little bit longer,” says Evil Empire on the game’s Steam page. “We plan to add all the good stuff – more levels, weapons, features, enemies, bosses, story acts and meta progression. Along the way we want to find out if there’s anything we can add to the core gameplay too. In fact, our plan is to double the amount of content from Early Access launch to 1.0.”</p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">A solid plan, then. Given Evil Twin’s track record and what’s already on show with the <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>, I can say I’m very much looking forward to what comes next. And don’t forget: if you’re not a fan of Early Access, there’s that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other, equally delightful version of <em>Prince of Persia</em></a> that launched earlier this year.</p>
