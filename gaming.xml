<p>If you spend time on the Steam forums, you probably know by now that people aren’t too excited about the system requirements for The Forever Winter. They’re beastly, requiring a potent gaming computer to run successfully. Here’s what you can expect from the minimum and recommended requirements for the extraction shooter!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-forever-winter-pc-system-requirements">The Forever Winter PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>As you’ll soon see from The Forever Winter’s system requirements, the game requires a monster of a gaming computer to run its recommended systems. The GPU and CPU will certainly set most people back a significant amount. It’s definitely going to limit the number of people playing the game with the graphics maxed out!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super (8 GB) / Radeon RX 5700XT (8 GB)</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: Unknown (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5700X</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti (12 GB) / AMD Radeon RX 6800XT (16 GB)</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: Unknown (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<p>While we don’t yet know how much storage space is necessary, you definitely want to install this one on an SSD to ensure you load into a raid promptly. You could lose a lot of gear, like in Escape From Tarkov, by loading in late.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-content-is-available-in-early-access">How Much Content is Available in Early Access?</h2>



<p>When The Forever Winter launches at the end of September into Early Access, it will do so with:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Four complete maps</strong></li>



<li><strong>Five playable characters</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dozens of unique weapons</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>You can customize those weapons, by the way!</p>

<p>It’s uncommon for extraction shooters to launch on consoles, though that’s seemingly changing. Hunt: Showdown is the big one available on PS5, and Delta Force is on its way, but if you want something more niche and hardcore, you’re out of luck. Of course, never say never! But is The Forever Winter coming to PS5?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-the-forever-winter-on-ps5">Can You Play The Forever Winter on PS5?</h2>



<p>Currently, <strong>there are no official plans to bring The Forever Winter to PS5</strong>. However, it’s not out of the realm of possibilities. When asked about a PlayStation 5 launch—or a console launch altogether—the studio said they’ll initially launch exclusively on PC, but depending on how successful they are and the community feedback, they may consider a “platform expansion” sometime during the game’s development.</p>



<p>Of course, developing for PC is a bit different than developing for a console. If the team intends to launch on PS5 later, optimizing the game for the system will take time. But hey, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-ps5-pro-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Pro is supposedly on its way</a>, and that console will likely handle anything developers throw its way!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-the-forever-winter-free-to-play">Is The Forever Winter Free-to-Play?</h2>



<p>If you were hoping for a free-to-play game to keep your attention this fall, The Forever Winter isn’t the one. It’s not a free-to-play title and will come with a premium price tag on day one. The studio wants to launch at an MSRP of <strong>$29.99</strong>, with a launch-day discount bringing it down to $27.99 for a short period.</p>



<p>It’s certainly not the most expensive title to launch these days, and with potentially hundreds of hours of gameplay, it’s a welcome sight!</p>



<hr>



<p>To keep you busy until The Forever Winter launches on PC, why not check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-campaign-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space Marine 2 campaign length</a>? Everyone’s excited about the latest Warhammer game, and rightfully so!</p>

Its start was good for fifth overall on Steam's charts despite only being able to players who purchased the Gold and Ultra editions of the game.</p><p>But it wasn't an entirely flawless victory for the anticipated sequel. Players soon reported problems with joining the server, including members of the IGN staff. Fans quickly took to X/Twitter and other forums to express their frustration with the experience.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fix the servers. "Joining server" is killing all of us. And being stuck on "joining server" after completing a mission isn't fun.

Our teams are currently working to fix them.Please keep providing feedback and make sure your read this note on the most common issues."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Focus Entertainment (@Focus_entmt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Focus_entmt/status/1831803796776685611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The full post lists some of the most common issues, including crashing on the first cinematic, controller problems, and infinity loading. It also notes that linking Steam and Epic accounts is not required to play the game, saying that the Epic Online Services installation was implemented to "support optional cross-play between Steam and Epic players and to synchronize friend lists between the two stores."</p><p>Otherwise, we were generally positive in our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">review of Space Marine 2</a>, writing, "Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a terrific third-person shooter with a compelling story, loads of weapons that are a blast to use, and a healthy variety of enemies to use them on. It once again borrows many of its ideas from the Gears of War series, but they’re good ideas, and Space Marine 2 does a fine job of making them its own. And while the Operations PvE mode that accompanies it doesn’t currently offer enough to keep me coming back, the deep customization options for your Space Marine do look promising if it’s supported in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-post-launch-roadmap-includes-new-maps-a-horde-mode-and-more">post-launch updates</a> as planned. Besides, when you’re eviscerating aliens on planets as pretty as these, it’s hard not to leave satisfied."</p><p>Space Marine 2 is slated to fully launch on September 9 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.  </p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

If you've been holding out for a sale, now might be the time to strike: GOG is offering <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fbaldurs_gate_iii&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-baldurs-gate-3-from-gog-for-the-lowest-price-yet%2F1100-6526314%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Baldur's Gate 3</a> for $48, the lowest price yet for the acclaimed RPG. Yup, Baldur's Gate 3's price has behaved more like a Nintendo game than most AAA releases. The 20% discount is only available until September 9 as part of a weekend sale on Larian games.</p><p>An isometric, turn-based RPG, Baldur's Gate 3 puts you in the universe of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The game is particularly impressive because of the huge amount of choice it often presents you with. You can do some pretty wild stuff with your party of heroes based on the route you decide to take through the game and how you build your character. And famously, you get a whole lot of romance options, including a character in bear form.</p><p>GOG's discount takes 20% off the list price of $60, so while it's not a huge drop price, it's still a fairly significant reduction. Steam is also offering the same price of $48 on Baldur's Gate 3, if you'd rather keep yourself in Valve's walled garden. Baldur's Gate 3 is Steam Deck-verified, so if you're a fan of the handheld, that'd be a good reason to grab it here--but you'll have to deal with Valve's digital rights management, while GOG games are all DRM-free. It only takes a few minutes to get GOG games up and running on Steam Deck with the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heroic Games Launcher</a>. The launcher also supports Amazon Games and Epic Games Store, so you can play a lot of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-games-epic-games-store/1100-6476419/"

You've been warned!</strong></p><p>Larian Studios dropped <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3s-long-awaited-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-alongside-massive-patch-notes">its highly anticipated Patch 7 on PC today</a>, and with it comes a slew of new cinematics for players doing evil runs. While fans hop back into the RPG and discover the new content, one origin character's new evil ending is getting a particular amount of attention.</p><p>If you're wondering why Karlach, everyone's favorite tiefling Barbarian, was trending on X/Twitter today, that's why. One fan showed her new evil ending, which you can watch below, and it's going viral just by virtue of being "absolutely metal."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Gali | Currently playing DA2 (Blind) (@gali_le0) <a href="https://twitter.com/gali_le0/status/1831725884174172231?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In the clip, we see Karlach, if you're playing her as an origin character, after she's taken control of the The Netherbrain, essentially making all of Baldur's Gate her pawns. No longer the golden retriever of the group, Karlach is fully embracing her newfound control as she gives a menacing monologue to the citizens in front of her before summoning a hoard of enemies from Avernus. </p><p>And, in a <em>truly</em> metal twist, the clip ends with her yanking her infernal heart out of her chest. About time she got rid of that dang thing.</p><p>In addition to just how badass the whole cinematic is, fans are also praising voice actor Samantha Beart's new voice lines. Beart even took the liberty of highlighting one fan's, uh, <em>passionate</em> response to the new ending.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So the last patch of BG3 has been implemented, the evil endings are out (careful of spoilers, Karlach enjoyers), and I'm framing this 👇🏼 <a href="https://t.co/yPzwzosbI4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/yPzwzosbI4</a></p>— Samantha Béart is Karlach ❤️‍🔥 (@SamanthaBeart) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamanthaBeart/status/1831746675574239675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Other fans talked about how the new scene displays the anger and darkness that Karlach has, as she also talks about Gortash, her friend/employer-turned-betrayer, in the clip. "THIS is the Zariel-brained anger filled darkness she has, absolutely unleashed," <a href="https://x.com/sailorgundam308/status/1831743513597506044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan wrote</a>. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HOLY SHIT this is utterly insane??? Woah,,,,, my heart aches for the path that would lead to this but DAMN THAT WAS AMAZING!?!?! <a href="https://t.co/QTuTlcZgTE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/QTuTlcZgTE</a></p>— Captian Mewonweyonweyon (@MellonWellon) <a href="https://twitter.com/MellonWellon/status/1831777271826542761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HOLY SHIT i don’t know how to feel about this one <a href="https://t.co/G1QiF01AQh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/G1QiF01AQh</a></p>— Dumbass (@slut_dumbass) <a href="https://twitter.com/slut_dumbass/status/1831772326524023143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>It's somewhat ironic, too, that a Karlach ending is at the center of a Baldur's Gate 3 conversation yet again. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/put-those-baldurs-gate-3-karlach-romance-playthroughs-on-hold-shes-about-to-get-a-better-ending">In a previous patch</a>, Larian tweaked the ill-fated character's non-evil ending to give her story "better closure."</p><p>Karlach isn't the only one getting a new evil ending, however, and Larian already previously <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-new-dark-urge-ending-gets-first-look-from-larian">revealed a dark new cinematic for a Dark Urge origin character</a>. As for the console players waiting to dive into the Baldur's Gate 3's massive Patch 7, which also includes official mod support, <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1831689163898302757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Larian said earlier today</a> that it should arrive on consoles sometime this October. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-acer-gaming-laptop-concept-has-built-in-controller/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Acer recently showcased its newest gaming laptop concept during IFA Berlin 2024, one of the world’s largest tech conventions, and this baby had some impressive features. Two of the most notable takeaways from this laptop concept were the fact that it had a built-in controller and detachable speakers.</p>



<h2 id="h-gaming-laptop-concept-by-acer-has-built-in-controller">Gaming Laptop Concept By Acer Has Built-In Controller</h2>



<p>The built-in controller was easily the biggest takeaway from the showcase. While many gamers stand by the fact that keyboard and mouse is the best way to play, there are still quite a few people who prefer a controller. In fact, some keyboard and mouse players prefer to take a break from their desks and just sit back and utilize a controller.</p>



<p>Gaming with a controller also appeals to more casual gamers, which could be a big selling point for this laptop.</p>



<p>The way the computer is designed, the mouse pad is actually detachable with two joysticks and buttons on the side. This means you can use the controller as just a mouse or you can use it as a gaming controller. Either option is pretty cool.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The computer even allows for dual controllers, as the company showcased the feature by having two people play Street Fighter 6 against each other on the system.</p>



<p>Although, the device does have a smaller battery and cooling system to give it more room for the controller. This has led to many questioning whether or not the computer will be able to handle high-end gaming.</p>



<h2 id="h-acer-laptop-showcases-detachable-speakers">Acer Laptop Showcases Detachable Speakers</h2>



<p>Another fancy little feature showcased at the event was the Acer laptop’s detachable speakers. Want your speakers facing a different way? Maybe you would like to have them facing directly at you instead of upwards? Well, this newest feature allows gamers to customize their gaming space with the new detachable speakers.</p>



<p>So, will Acer implement all of these ideas? As of now, this is just a concept, meaning Acer could completely scrap it. </p>

Rather than being a choose-your-own-adventure story or a tabletop RPG, LitRPG books are prose novels where the characters interact with the world in a game-like way--often because they are transported into an alternate video game reality or because outside forces morph the real world into a game-like setting.</p><p dir="ltr">In Dungeon Crawler Carl, aliens have turned Earth into a 10-floor mega-dungeon, and each book in the series represents a different level of the dungeon with its own environmental identity, characters Carl meets, and objectives he completes in hopes of saving humanity.</p><p dir="ltr">If that sounds like a series you'd like to read, you're in luck--the first three Dungeon Crawler Carl books are getting print editions for the first time. The franchise began as an audiobook and ebook series, but now you can grab a h<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-Crawler-Carl-Matt-Dinniman/dp/059382024X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ardcover copy of the first book at Amazon</a> for just $20 (was $30).

            <p>
Among the many questions observers had following this week's shock shutdown of PlayStation 5v5 shooter Concord (albeit not necessarily at the top of their list) was if the now-defunct live-service title would still make an appearance in Amazon's upcoming animated video game anthology series Secret Level - and the answer, according to a new report at least, is yes.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level, if you haven't been following along, is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">15-episode series from the creators of Love, Death &amp; Robots</a> that'll feature original stories set in the world of games. More specifically, it'll include episodes centred on Armored Core, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, PAC-MAN, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>, Warhammer 40,000, and a number of PlayStation Studios games.
</p>
<p>
More pertinently, though, it was also due to include an episode based on Concord - a decision made well before the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled from sale just two weeks after launch</a> amid less-than-stellar player numbers. And while developer Firewalk Studios has suggested Concord may one day return, many wondered if its Secret Level episode would get the chop given it was essentially envisaged as an advert for a game that, currently at least, effectively no longer exists.

<p>
While Amazon is yet to officially comment on the matter, IGN - citing a "source close to production" - has now reported Concord will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-will-remain-in-prime-videos-secret-level-despite-games-sudden-cancellation-source">remain a part of Secret Level despite its recent closure</a>. That's perhaps not entirely surprising given the significant investment Amazon has likely made in the episode, but it'll certainly hit differently knowing what we now know.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level is currently due to make its Prime Video debut on 10th December this year, if you want to pour one out for Concord as its episode airs.

<h2 id="h-veno-signs-to-xset-going-into-fortnite-globals">Veno Signs To XSET Going Into Fortnite Globals</h2>



<p>The Fortnite Global Championship is an annual event, where teams who qualified during the year’s various FNCS tournaments come together and compete against each other for a massive $3 million prize pool.</p>



<p>Many of the biggest names in Fortnite qualify for this event, with quite a few of them represented by large organizations. XSET, who has some massive Fortnite names on their roster, recently acquired Veno.</p>



<p>Veno has already gone down in history as one of the best Fortnite players of all time, with more than one FNCS first-place title and a second-place title from the FNCS Invitational back in 2022.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Veno acquired quite a bit of fame back in 2022 after he and the European player, Queasy, dominated in various FNCS Majors and the FNCS Invitational. The player really took the spotlight, though, after he and Queasy attempted to land second place while they were holding first during the last game of the 2022 Invitational.</p>



<p>Since then, Veno has qualified and placed in many different large Fortnite tournaments, making him one of the most decorative players in the scene.</p>







<h2 id="h-additional-players-in-xset">Additional Players In XSET</h2>



<p>XSET also has a few other Fortnite players on its roster, as the team has been preparing throughout 2024, getting as many big names as they can. </p>



<p><strong>Every Fortnite player on XSET:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Clix</li>



<li>Muz</li>



<li>Trashy</li>



<li>Ritual</li>



<li>Edgey</li>



<li>Cold</li>



<li>Veno</li>
</ul>



<p>Veno and Muz are the only non-North American players on XSET, at the moment.</p>

Its inclusion was thrown into doubt by PlayStation's decision to take Concord offline, seemingly spelling the end of the troubled live service game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Prime Video has yet to publicly announce whether or not it will remain in Tim Miller's anthology series, but IGN understands that the episode featuring Concord is indeed still slated to air this season.</p><p>In addition to Concord, Secret Level will include stories featuring God of War, Mega Man, Unreal Tournament, and other properties from throughout video game history. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-looks-like-keanu-reeves-is-in-amazons-armored-core-animation">Keanu Reeves is among the actors said to be starring in the series</a>.</p><p>Secret Level garnered attention at gamescom not just because of its large numer of familiar franchises, but because of Miller's involvement in popular anthologies such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/love-death-and-robots-vol-3-review">Love, Death and Robots</a>.

In fact, it’s a testament to its FPS chops that even while it has a virtually nonexistent story and a serious need for a signature game mode, I still found myself losing dozens of hours to its PvP charms."</p><p>Concord is scheduled to go offline on September 6.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k25-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nba-2k25-review-in-progress.973626/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-2k25-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Over the past few years, developer Visual Concepts’ focus on updating online features and adding more microtransactions has left the meat of its annualized basketball series a forgettable merry-go-round of rehashed ideas and uninspired modes. But after spending about a dozen hours with NBA 2K25 so far, it already feels like a grizzled league veteran instead, and the definition of a perennial starter—there are still gaps in its game, but solid fundamentals and a willingness to adapt help make it a reliable part of any rotation. Or, in this case, right now it seems like a novel and innovative entry that can win new fans and bring back oldheads alike.</p><p>Make no mistake, you still can’t teach a long-running basketball sim new tricks. But that doesn’t mean you can’t polish it until it becomes as smooth as Steph Curry’s buttery jumper. This is where the return of ProPLAY technology shines. Although it was initially brought on board as part of 2K24, this year’s iteration is much better. It produces more lifelike player animations and motions, so Paul George’s fluid jump shot and Jayson Tatum’s upper body heave look like the actual thing.</p><p>Visual Concepts' introduction of Go-To Moves further emphasizes NBA 2K25’s focus on realistic player movement. With it, you can recreate your favorite player’s iconic signature move, whether it’s Nikola Jokic’s one-legged sidestep jumper or Donovan Mitchell’s bump-and-stepback shot. I especially enjoy using (and abusing) these go-to moves whenever my play gets broken up or the clock is running down. After all, most of them, like KD’s crossover hesi pull-up, guarantee space creation and an open shot each time.</p><p>My only issue with it is the lack of variety. Yes, spamming the same, near-unstoppable go-to shot is nice, but I wish each superstar had more than one signature skill they could turn to. I was especially disappointed to see that go-to post moves were non-existent; a one-dribble pull-up fadeaway should not replace Joel Embiid’s real-life arsenal of dream shakes and shimmy fakes.</p><h2>Rhythm and Blues</h2><p>Another interesting new addition is Rhythm Shooting—a completely different and more complex way of scoring middies and threes. But I’ll be honest: as someone who’s tapped-and-released square all these years, I initially found it pointless. It just didn’t feel like there was an incentive to learn its trickier down-up Pro Stick motion. But after repeatedly trying both it and the classic shooting method with different jump shot animations, I started preferring Rhythm Shooting more—not only because it’s more forgiving toward imperfect releases, but also because you can seamlessly transition into dribble moves after faking a shot.</p><p>Of course, with revamped animations comes a new shot meter, which I was admittedly frustrated by the first time I played a full match with it. Can you blame me for getting angry after bricking three open shots in a row? Clearly, it was the shot meter’s fault and definitely not a skill issue. But even though I was dangerously close to hurling both hurtful insults and a controller at my TV, cooler heads prevailed, and I eventually learned about the new Shot Timing Profiles feature.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>NBA 2K25: Top 10 Players at Launch</h3></div></output><p>By default, NBA 2K25’s Shot Timing Profile is set to Difficulty-Based, meaning your current difficulty heavily influences your jump shot timings. So, if you’re playing on All-Pro, like me, your release needs to be near-perfect for your shots to go in. Or, if you’re on Hall of Fame for some reason, you might as well not even try. Thankfully, this isn’t your only choice, and there are four other profiles you can try out: Real Player %, Low Risk-Reward, Normal Risk-Reward, and High Risk-Reward.</p><p>After switching to Normal Risk-Reward, the setting “most similar” to the previous 2K timing, getting used to the new shot meter was much easier because an imperfect release had less impact on a shot (and thus, my TV was saved).  But Shot Timing Profiles can only do so much to mask that this year’s arrow shot meter, along with the ring and dial alternatives, are still difficult to time, and I wish there was an option that would let me use last year’s easier-to-master classic bar design instead.</p><p>After experimenting in the new tutorial hub, Learn2K, I was eager to see what the rest of NBA 2K25 had to offer. So, I went into MyNBA Eras to check out the new Steph Era, which, confusingly enough, begins in 2016, two years after the Warriors’ first championship and the true beginning of Curry's reign of terror. Or, should I say, three-rror? Get it? Although the Steph Era makes the 2010s uncomfortably congested (the LeBron Era takes place in the first half of the decade), it’s an addition that I can fully get behind, commemorating Steph and co’s near-unstoppable dynasty the way it deserves to be.</p><h2>RPGeez, Really?</h2><p>Since this was the only new feature in Eras, I immediately turned my attention to the return of MyGM, which, to my surprise, has <em>almost</em> turned into an RPG. I emphasize the word almost because its RPG elements feel patchy and incomplete. Upon selecting a pre-made character, you’re given a choice between six different backstories, which grant different attributes and perks depending on your preference. I enjoy that this allowed me to imagine a unique rags-to-riches tale for my up-and-coming general manager (for the record, I chose Ex-Scout because I wanted an Erik Spoelstra-like story), but the problems with this new RPG direction began once I finished creating my character and got thrust into bizarre conversations with some of my team’s staff members.</p><p>Every line of dialogue with these NPCs feels unnatural and forced, thrown together just to serve as a way of handing out in-season tasks. In my first conversation with the team governor, he immediately asked me to trade away our oldest (and best) player <em>because of a dream he had</em>. Frustrated, I almost handed in my resignation letter then and there. But Mama didn’t raise no quitter. So, after finishing my strange water cooler chat with the governor, I went on my way, exploring the rest of the new MyGM building.</p><p>Unfortunately, like the previous conversation’s idle and unrealistic tone, the MyGM building appears equally empty, barely filled with expensive equipment you can’t touch, as if it were a barebones museum. Instead of mirroring a bustling business hub for a multi-million dollar NBA team, the weirdly designed, single-floor space feels more like an expensive penthouse apartment you share with four strangers.</p><p>In it, NPC interactions are confusingly kept to a minimum; you can only speak with your team’s governor, scout, head coach, or best player if they have an exclamation point above their head. Otherwise, they’ll give you the cold shoulder. Outside of these rare conversations, the rest of your managerial responsibilities are conducted in the Nav menu, turning the MyGM building and the people within into even more of an afterthought.</p><h2>Don’t Call It a Comeback</h2><p>With the new features in MyNBA Eras being slightly underwhelming, I was preparing myself for disappointment before diving into the refreshed MyCareer mode. Oh, how wrong I was. As soon as I started it up for the first time, I was immediately placed into every hooper’s childhood fantasy: it’s overtime in game seven of the NBA Finals, my team’s in the lead, and (after choosing my preferred position, team, and appearance) I got to play out the rest of the match for a chance at history.</p><p>Although only a short snippet of my player’s potential storyline to kick things off, this immediate thrust into a high-stakes scenario is the sudden revitalizing jolt MyCareer needed following last year’s disappointment. That said, after finishing the match (spoiler alert: we won), I've admittedly spent most of my time in the mode so far trying out different Pro-Tuned Builds and NBA Template Builds because I couldn’t decide on one. That’s been fun in its own right, but I still have to dive back in and make that intro a reality before my final review.</p><p>So, having only spent a few days with NBA 2K25 as of yet, I still have a lot more to play before reaching a verdict. I’ve only had a limited amount of time to check out its shiny new online features, for example, but  I'm at least cautiously optimistic about what I’ve seen overall after enduring 2K24’s glaring shortcomings and its disastrous lack of a single-player storyline. Here’s hoping my optimism isn’t smothered by an inevitable wave of microtransaction ads in MyTeam. Either way, I’ll be back with a score next week.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-frostpunk-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It wasn’t long ago that the city-building genre was more relaxed—a tame experience overall that felt like it was meant to ease new players into the strategy genre as a whole. But then titles such as Banished launched and took the genre by storm, creating a subgenre that melded survival with city-building for a more hardcore experience. Then, along came Frostpunk. It ramped up the core mechanics of the survival city-building genre tenfold. Now, we’re about to dive into Frostpunk 2 this year. Here’s everything we know about Frostpunk 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-frostpunk-2">What is Frostpunk 2?</h2>



<p>Frostpunk 2 is a survival city-building strategy game set 30 years after the first title, in which an apocalyptic winter takes hold of the planet and won’t release its grip. As humanity struggles to survive in settlements across the world, utilizing coal and oil to power heating mechanisms and generators, the world worsens, and people become desperate. </p>



<p>As in the first game, Frostpunk 2 will heavily focus on morals. Will you provide equality for your citizens? Will you force children to work instead of investing time in classrooms? Do your citizens deserve full rations after a hard day at work? You must decide how best to guide your civilization through the end times, even if that means upsetting a few groups along the way.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-frostpunk-2-release-date">Do We Know the Frostpunk 2 Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via 11 bit studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Following a few delays during development, 11 bit studios finally unveiled the official release date of Frostpunk 2 as <strong>September 20</strong>. At the time of this writing, we’re just a few weeks away from the game’s launch.</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of the previous title, this new iteration promises completely overhauled gameplay. It continues the story of the world’s end as we know it during a winter apocalypse!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-are-the-frostpunk-2-system-requirements">What Are the Frostpunk 2 System Requirements</h2>



<p>While certainly not the most demanding genre in gaming, strategy does have its exceptions. Frostpunk 2 is a genuinely gorgeous, albeit bleak, game that pushes the genre’s envelope. But based on its system requirements, you should have no trouble running the game on current hardware norms.</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor: </strong>AMD Ryzen 5 / Intel Core i5 2.5 GHz</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD RX 550 4 GB / Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti 4 GB / Intel ARC A310 4 GB</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 30 GB (SSD Required)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor: </strong>AMD Ryzen 7 / Intel Core i7 2.8 Ghz</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD RX 5700 8 GB / Nvidia 2060 Super RTX 8 GB / Intel ARC A770 8 GB</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 30 GB (SSD Required)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-frostpunk-2-releasing-on">What Platforms is Frostpunk 2 Releasing On?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via 11 bit studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s uncommon for a strategy game to launch simultaneously on PC and consoles, but Frostpunk 2 aims to reach as broad an audience as possible in September. Here’s what platforms you can play Frostpunk 2 on at launch:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation </strong>5</li>



<li><strong>Xbox Series X|S</strong></li>
</ul>

Although players have been able to pick up <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-ps5-console-covers-announced">various cover colors</a> and, more recently, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-internet-weighs-in-on-the-ps5-redesign-and-plenty-think-it-looks-no-different-than-before"><u>single-striped PS5 Slim</u></a>, a PS5 with three breaks in its plates has never been officially revealed. Considering the likely tease accompanies the announcement that Sony’s 30th anniversary plans are on the horizon, we may not have to wait that much longer to see what could be an official announcement for what many are already calling the PS5 Pro.</p><p>Although Sony hasn’t gone as far as to reveal or name its long-awaited PS5 upgrade, fans have anticipated an announcement for months. Now nearly four years removed from the launch of the fifth PlayStation console, it’s high time for a mid-gen refresh that gives gamers more tools to play their favorite titles. There’s also the fact that, last week, reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>leaker billbil-kun shared</u></a> what they said was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-leak-reveals-alleged-name-and-design-of-the-console"><u>the design of the PS5 Pro</u></a>, publishing a picture that looks remarkably similar to what we’re seeing today. The time is right and the rumors are swirling more than ever, but until Sony confirms the news itself, it’s best to keep expectations for the PS5 Pro low for now.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Another look at the PS5 Pro design <a href="https://t.co/WLI6Vy9hLH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/WLI6Vy9hLH</a></p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1831776473839247819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, Sony is said to be aiming to release a new console sometime during this year’s holiday season, with an official announcement possibly happening ahead of Tokyo Game Show.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguards-devs-reveal-new-info-about-each-of-the-companions-and-solas-and-varric-too.973590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguards-devs-reveal-new-info-about-each-of-the-companions-and-solas-and-varric-too<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Friendships, romantic relationships, and everything in between have always been an integral part of not just the Dragon Age series, but of BioWare in general. From Mass Effect’s Garrus Vakarian to Dragon Age’s Varric Tethras, the characters – and how they get along with the player – are inseparable from titles from the studio.</p><p>But, perhaps more than any other BioWare game, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is leaning in <em>heavily </em>on this idea, as it’s already easy to see from the marketing material. For one, the name changed from Dragon Age: Dreadwolf back in June, with BioWare general manager Gary McKay <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay"><u>telling us at the time</u></a> that it was out of a desire to shift the focus to a “really deep and compelling group of companions.” That would be followed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024"><u>a first official trailer at Summer Game Fest</u></a> that put the focus squarely on seven new companions that will be tagging along with the player character, Rook, in The Veilguard.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With all that in mind, it’s little surprise to hear game director Corinne Busche talk about how these companions aren’t <em>just</em> central to the story of The Veilguard, but the gameplay and combat as well.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"You're going to develop trust, understanding. That doesn't mean you're always going to agree.”</p></div><p>“Building a relationship with companions has always been a staple of Dragon Age, but this time around, that relationship translates into how well you work together as a team,” Busche tells IGN. “It is how you're actually going to level up your companions, by getting to know them better. That's how you're going to unlock skill points. So when you look at all of the various abilities the companions have, there's inherent combos and synergies and roles that they'll have on the battlefield.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p>She uses the example of Neve, the mysterious detective mage who has a wildly useful special ability to slow time in combat. “But if I really get the opportunity to know her,” Busche explains, “whether it's platonic or romantic, I'm going to help be able to shape her skills and augment those abilities that work really well with my own personal build, so our sense of teamwork really deepens.”</p><p>During our time with the game, IGN got to see some of this in action; unsurprisingly, Dragon Age: The Veilguard has an approval/disapproval system, with pop-up text on the side of the screen indicating whether or not a companion liked what Rook just did or said. But something new in this Dragon Age: even just completing a quest with a companion in your party increases your “bond” with them, whether they agree with how you handled things or not. Your relationship, Busche says, isn’t necessarily about “how much they like you, but how well you get to know them.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Dragon Age (@dragonage) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonage/status/1828492421639860624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 27, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>“This is about a found family,” Busche tells us. “That is, they have the same goals, different complications in their life, but they're all giving everything they have to defend Thedas. You're going to get to know them really well. You're going to develop trust, understanding. That doesn't mean you're always going to agree.”</p><p>But, we’ll have plenty more to say about the game systems and combat later. With Busche, we had the opportunity to really dive into the seven companions at the center of The Veilguard and what they’re all about. Here’s what she had to say about each one:</p><h3><strong>Davrin</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction</strong>: Grey Warden</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ike Amadi</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Busche: “</strong>When we were thinking about Davrin, how we were going to develop him as a character, we had to think about, 'How is he going to show up on the battlefield?' And it was unique because he has this, I guess you could say, companion of his own, the griffon Assan. That makes him, as a companion, very unique, because Assan shows up on the battlefield. So we had to think about how that integrates into his abilities, where Davrin as a Grey Warden is capable on his own, but also, when does he call upon Assan and what does that look like? What happens if you're indoors?... And indeed, when you're doing some of Davrin's content, just seeing Assan gliding through the environments, you really get a sense that they care and they're protective about each other. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I absolutely love when you're journeying with Davrin, not only his aesthetic, how he carries himself as a Warden, but how he interacts with his fellow Wardens."</p></div><p>“…When we think about Davrin and his being the representative of the Grey Wardens within the team of The Veilguard, it was an opportunity for us to really go back to some of those roots that we know our fans, our players, deeply care about. Dragon Age: Origins, of course, was so Grey Warden-forward. We want to evoke those memories, those connections that our players have. And I absolutely love when you're journeying with Davrin, not only his aesthetic, how he carries himself as a Warden, but how he interacts with his fellow Wardens. The little wrinkle of, 'Hey, there actually are some griffons remaining in Thedas,' how he learns as a Warden to train and interact with these griffons that, to our knowledge, haven't existed for quite some time, it's a learning experience on a lost art of the Grey Wardens that is really unique to Davrin's character.”</p><h3><strong>Harding</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction: </strong>None (scout)</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ali Hillis</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: Dragon Age: Inquisition, The Missing (comic book)</p><p><strong>Busche: “</strong>To talk about Harding as a companion, I guess I'd have to go back to Inquisition. Of course, Harding showed up. She was your scout on the field. There was a light romance with her, and I think one of the things that the team didn't quite expect is how much Harding would catch on in Inquisition. Players fell in love with her, and we heard them. They wanted a deeper romance, they wanted more engagement with Harding. So for the team, I felt like it was kind of a no-brainer for us to bring back Harding, and we also wanted to reestablish that connection to the Inquisition in the world of Thedas, which occurred 10 years ago, the events of Inquisition.</p><p>“Harding serves as our proxy back to those events, and you get to learn about what's happened with the Inquisition since, so she presents some really lovely opportunities for us. I will say, personality-wise and her role on the battlefield, she is among my favorites. When you see her leap into the air, unleashing these devastating attacks with her bow and arrow, I just can't get enough of her.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>Taash</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction</strong>: Lords of Fortune</p><p><strong>Voiced by: </strong>Jin Maley</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Busche</strong>: “Taash, in the creation of their arc, is one of our more complex characters. It's a journey along their arc that is about introspection. 'Where do I belong in the world? What are my boundaries? What do I fight for? How do I become at peace with who I am?' So I love the juxtaposition, actually, between Taash's personal journey and this imposing literal dragon slayer, that sort of hard exterior and really gentle interior. It makes Taash a really special companion for me.”</p><p>(When asked which companion had the steamiest romance): “I'll just speak for me personally, but at the culmination of the romance arcs, I'd have to say Taash. When I got to that scene and saw the finished version of that cinematic, I was hollering. <em>Hollering</em>.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>Emmrich</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction: </strong>Mourn Watch</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Nick Boraine</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: The Flame Eternal (<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-inquisition/news/the-eternal-flame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>short story</u></a>)</p><p><strong>Busche: “</strong>The thing about Emmrich that is going to surprise our fans the most is his relationship with necromancy. I really love that we kind of turned the idea of a necromancer on its head here, where you think of them as these conjurers of evil, the certain malice when you hear the term 'necromancer,' but it couldn't be farther from the truth for Emmrich. There is a reverence about the dead. He has a unique relationship with death. You get to explore how he ended up in the Mourn Watch. Death has shaped this character in all aspects of his life, and we frequently refer to him as our gentleman necromancer. I think his proper, kind nature stems from that respect that he's learned about this cycle of life and death throughout his life. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Death has shaped this character in all aspects of his life, and we frequently refer to him as our gentleman necromancer."</p></div><p>“Manfred is like a son to Emmrich. He very much has an affinity for this wisp, this life force that he's given a second chance through this skeletal body, and in many ways, it's the story of a parent raising a child. Emmrich, he needs to teach Manfred and help him along to develop as a character of their own, things like learning new skills, how to assist The Veilguard. Some of our most charming moments are in dealing with Manfred, and I must say I absolutely love the interactions. They just have me rolling whenever Manfred steals the show.</p><p>“…In my last playthrough, I romanced Emmrich. What I also loved is as I'm synergizing with him as we're doing combos, just having him refer to me as ‘my dear’ on the battlefield. ‘Well done, my dear!’ It just fills me with joy every time.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>Lucanis</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction</strong>: Antivan Crows</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Zach Mendez</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: Tevinter Nights (short story anthology)</p><p><strong>Busche</strong>: “The character that went through the most changes [throughout development] without a doubt was Lucanis. Lucanis is very complex. He's an assassin. He is very skilled in the art of death. The Antivan Crows, they pursue these contracts with a certain level of dispassion, but also, Lucanis is a romantic, and he's dealing with some internal struggles. He's been through a lot of trauma. He's relearning how to trust. And all of those elements come together with a richness, but it creates a lot of complexity in how we tell that story. So I'd say Lucanis is the first one that comes to my mind in terms of the thought that's gone into it, where we've had to make adjustments to really cover all facets of his character.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>Neve</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction: </strong>Shadow Dragons</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Jessica Clark</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: Trevinter Nights, The Missing</p><p><strong>Busche: “</strong>Neve is our confident noir detective. I love to bring her onto the battlefield because she's just so incredibly capable. She's our ice mage, so really big on controlling the battlefield, and that's actually a good metaphor to her arc. She wants to fight for change. She wants to fight for a better Minrathous, and she's going to use all the tools at her disposal to try and reshape Minrathous into a better place for all. She's very much a Shadow Dragon. This is among the mantra of the Shadow Dragons. They operate from the shadows, fighting for a better Minrathous. So as this accomplished ice mage, she's fierce. She's not going to shy away from any challenge, whether it's taking down darkspawn or dealing with the Magisterium in Minrathous.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Screenshots</h3></div></output><h3><strong>Bellara</strong></h3><p><strong>Faction</strong>: Veil Jumpers</p><p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Jee Young Han</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Busche</strong>: “Oh, my dear, sweet Bellara. I relate to Bellara a lot. She is joyous. She's been through a lot, but she remains curious, optimistic. She's kind of a geek. She really likes her fiction. She fangirls over Neve a little bit. She's just so relatable, and I think that's what our players will find and fall in love with when they get to meet Bellara, is just how much you'll recognize some of those patterns and sensibilities that she holds, but don't let it fool you. She is also a Veil Jumper. She's very comfortable in elven ruins. I frequently bring her with me in my party. I like to play rogue. I like to play the Veil Jumper, or the Veil Ranger. Bellara's a fantastic companion to set up that spec with electric vulnerabilities, so I love her both on and off the battlefield.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/05/ign-first-varric-and-solas-illo-copy-1725563602830.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3><strong>Bonus round</strong>: Solas</h3><p><strong>Voiced by: </strong>Gareth David-Lloyd</p><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age appearances</strong>: Dragon Age: Inquisition, The Masked Empire (novel), Tevinter Nights, Dark Fortress (comic series)</p><p>Okay okay, so Solas isn’t technically one of your core companions who will travel with you, but given his place in the Dragon Age story, we <em>still</em> had to ask about his relationship with Rook. Here’s what Busche had to say:</p><p><strong>Busche</strong>: “Rook's relationship with Solas is a complicated one. Everyone has seen, at this point, the gameplay reveal and the opening moments of the game, so you'll know things got shaken up pretty radically for Solas already. He's trapped. He's basically communicating with you as an advisor, and I absolutely love that idea of, ‘He's your lifeline right now, but can you trust him?’ And those touch points with him, ‘Do I take his advice or not? Can he be trusted? Is he going to betray me?’ All the while giving you this information that you absolutely need in order to be successful.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"[Solas is] basically communicating with you as an advisor, and I absolutely love that idea of, ‘He's your lifeline right now, but can you trust him?’ "</p></div><p>“It creates an interesting stage for us, where, I think our fans will agree, Solas is very complicated. He firmly believes he's doing the right thing, and some of our fans will agree that he's trying to do the right thing. Others will not, and this creates a stage for you, the player, where you get to lean into those tendencies of your own as you're taking advice from Solas throughout parts of the game. I think those really interesting debates about, ‘Was he ever redeemable? Can he be trusted? Was he wrong all along?’ You're really going to be able to dive in deep on that.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>Bonus round #2</strong>: Varric</h3><p><strong>Previous Dragon Age Appearances: </strong>Dragon Age II, Dragon Age: Inquisition, Knight Errant (comic book), Tevinter Knights, The Missing</p><p>Varric, while a part of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and a series mainstay, isn’t part of your core companions either. <em>But</em>, as fans can see in the trailers, he’s still very much in The Veilguard, so we asked Dragon Age creative director John Epler about how he’s changed since we last saw him in Inquisition:</p><p><strong>Epler</strong>: “Since the events of Dragon Age: Inquisition, he has spent the time, just briefly, obviously, [serving as] Viscount of Kirkwall. I mean, anybody who knows much about Varric knows how well a job where he sits around and tells people what to do is going to sit with him. He has been participating in the hunt for Solas. And I think for Varric in particular, that's a very difficult thing for him to do because Solas is his friend. Solas is somebody that he grew close to over the events of Inquisition. They adventure together, they work together.</p><p>“And now knowing who Solas really is, that eats at Varric. Because Varric always sees, Varric believes he can always make somebody do the right thing. Varric believes he is the most convincing, charismatic, because he cares about people. And he has this belief that as long as I get a chance to talk to Solas, I'm going to be able to turn him. But as he's seeing what Solas' ritual is doing to the world around him, as he experienced in the comics, Dragon Age: The Missing, that eats at him a little bit. That's challenging his world view of him as always being the best judge of people, being able to see that somebody is able to be redeemed. And he's starting to question a little bit, ‘am I right or am I being a fool by believing in Solas?’ ”</p><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard releases on PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on October 31, 2024.</em></p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

            <p>
A recently leaked image purportedly showing Sony's heavily discussed but still officially under-wraps PlayStation 5 Pro appears to have received corroboration from an unexpected source. A near-identical design has now been spotted in the background of Sony's newly unveiled official PlayStation 30th anniversary artwork.
</p>
<p>
Last week, prolific leaker bilbil-kun <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-design-reportedly-leaks">shared details of Sony's still unannounced PS5 Pro</a>, alongside an illustration of its outer shell. While it mostly retained the PS5's familiar open-shirt design, it included one notable change: in place of the single diagonal stripe found on the body of the PlayStation Slim, the leaked PS5 Pro design featured three diagonal ridged lines.
</p>
<p>
Keep that in mind as we now hurtle forward in time to the present, and Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-30th-anniversary-celebrations-include-digital-soundtracks-and-a-board-game">recently announced PlayStation 30th anniversary celebrations</a>. Alongside details of its birthday activities - which are set to include the release of several digital soundtracks as well as a new range of toys - Sony shared new anniversary artwork featuring a grey cross, triangle, circle, and square made up of various PlayStation consoles and peripherals.
</p>

<p>
And there, right between the PlayStation logo and a big old number three, sits something that doesn't resemble a currently released PlayStation device, but which looks awfully familiar all the same: a large rectangular machine with three distinct diagonal ridges running along its side. So yes, this may well be our first official confirmation, albeit indirectly, of PS5 Pro's existence.
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/PS5-Pro-enhance.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>
And if last week's design is accurate, it seems reasonable to assume other details shared by bilbil-kun (that PS5 Pro will be a digital-only model possibly with support for the PS5 disc drive add-on) are too. It was also claimed Sony would formally announce the console this month, so with official artwork seemingly now out in the wild, we could be on the cusp of a full reveal.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer and Digital Foundry have been tracking the PS5 Pro's path to release since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-df-weekly-are-the-latest-switch-2-and-ps5-pro-leaks-actually-plausible">leaks first emerged last summer</a>. Since then, PS5 Pro <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-leaked-specs-appear-online">technical specs</a> have appeared online, which Eurogamer understands to be accurate, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-leaked-specs-appear-online">Digital Foundry analysis</a> dubbed the PS5 Pro "the most powerful console yet". April brought word Sony has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/which-games-will-get-sonys-ps5-pro-enhanced-label">prepping a "PS5 Pro Enhanced" label</a> for new and older patched games that will take advantage of its upcoming hardware, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-new-ps5-pro-gpu-details-emerge-including-a-235ghz-max-boost-clock">yet more technical details</a> leaked in May. Hopefully, all will be revealed soon.

		<p>The early access launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> has disappointingly been plagued with server issues for the always-online game, as Nacon and developer KT Racing… race to find fixes to get the game’s server capacity solidified for the full launch on 12th September.</p>
<p>The studio has issued <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/4593196713075894202">a statement on Steam</a> explaining the issues and the steps being taken to remedy the situation:</p>


<blockquote><p>Since the official server launch today at 08:00 AM UTC, many players have encountered severe connection issues with the game, mainly with login, lobbies, and various online features. These issues applies to all platforms: PC (Steam), PS5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Our teams are working tirelessly to stabilize the servers so that everyone can enjoy the game as soon as possible. To give you more context on the current situation, we have tried multiple solutions to address these network issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our server team has actively investigated the root causes of connection failures.</li>
<li>We have implemented server optimizations to handle the high volume of players trying to access the game.</li>
<li>We have increased server capacity to reduce queues and connection failures.</li>
<li>Our quality assurance team has conducted thorough tests to ensure the stability of our fixes before deploying them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although each solution has helped partially, some of them have also introduced new technical challenges.</p>
<p>We are actively working to resolve all the network issues and thank you again for your patience.</p></blockquote>
<p>The issues were already a factor before this public launch, blocking us from reviewing the game as maintenance affected all journalists’ ability to play the game on Tuesday and Wednesday, and a separate bug and issue blocked us specifically before then.</p>
<p>A queueing system is currently in place for the game, noting around 1,600 players waiting on PS5 tonight, which gradually ticks down, and then in our case led to getting kicked out to a more general ‘Login Error’ screen. SteamDB notes a peak player count on PC of 4,300 – this will simply be a total of players with the client open, so it’s not clear how many are actively able to play.</p>
<p>All of this is a pretty serious issue, and one that immediately has fans of the series and early buyers either <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/tdu3/">turning around and requesting refunds, or banging the drum over the game’s always-online requirement</a>. This would not have been such an issue with an offline play option, though that obviously has consequences for the game’s internal economy and progression.</p>

<p>Another potential factor is that developers have been going on strike against publisher Nacon in the last couple weeks, organising under the union banner of <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/category/news-en/">Le Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (SJV)</a>. RPG developer Spiders went on strike last week, and on Monday they were joined by colleageues at Kylotonn, who complained:</p>
<p><em>“Management regularly brings up the studios’ supposed independence, but every demand we make gets rejected with the argument that there should be coherence within the Nacon group. Much in the same way, negotiations are hampered under the same pretense.</em></p>
<p><em>“If no improvement in our working conditions is offered because “it would drive other studios within the group to ask for the same”, it stands to reason then that we make those demands together.”</em></p>
<p>Nacon has entered into discussions with workers already last week, but complaints have not yet been fully addressed, and further strikes could potentially hamper Solar Crown’s launch.</p>
<p>All in all, it seems like a difficult time at KT Racing right now. We hope that they’re able to resolve the server issues soon, and also that negotiations with workers company-wide are able to reach a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-preview-bigger-better-and-more-approachable<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Everything I loved about<em> Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> is back in the sequel, just done in a bigger and better way. More importantly for some, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is more refined -- easier to get a grip on.</p>
<p>Because <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> is so crunchy with so much emphasis on trying to be as realistic as possible, it’s an easy title to bounce off of. Layer on top of that a combat system that takes some time to get used to, and it can be an even tougher sale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, from the brief time I played with the sequel, a lot of that is much easier to get a grip on and understand right away. The sequel is just as deep with just as many moving pieces as before, just easier to manage this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first place that is apparent is in the combat. It’s smoother, the visual cues are more clear, and it felt a lot more attainable to be competent enough quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to emphasize, however, that I don’t mean that <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> is "dumbing down" what was already there. This is just a more refined system that has the side benefit of being more approachable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My ability to block, after not having played the original in years mind you, was already better than before. I wasn't perfect by any means, and this was just a demo of course, so there's still a lot of meat on the bone for people to sink their teeth into.</p>
<p>Taking on the role of Henry again, it was like sleeping into a comfortable pair of shoes. The same humor and tone is throughout the story and dialogue with NPCs. If you were a fan of the writing in the original, you’ll be more than satisfied with <em>KCD 2</em> I imagine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While various game systems have been streamlined a bit more, like the combat, the biggest upgrade I experienced in my demo was just the sheer scale of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The demo took place in Kuttenberg, a large German city in Bohemia. A real place, it was full of buildings, market stalls, taverns, guild halls, and so much more. Hundreds of NPCs were walking around &nbsp;going about their daily tasks.</p>

<p>The original game featured &nbsp;nothing of that scale at all, so seeing all of the intricate systems of<em> Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> working together with so many NPCs densely packed together is going to be interesting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the historical aspects of the <em>Kingdom Come</em> series, then you’ll be happy to know that commitment to historical accuracy continues here as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> is set in Bohemia, so we’ll be in an entirely new region from the first game. With historians on the team to keep things as close to accurate as possible, the time period and area have been meticulously recreated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, the game will feature some cool actual historical events you’ll get to experience as Henry. For example, the city of Kuttenberg will be under siege at some point, which actually happened and is something Henry will get to see firsthand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, I think what I played shows that Warhorse Studios is doing exactly what they need to do with <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>. They've rounded some of the sharp edges while beefing up the best parts of the game. &nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the biggest selling points of a new system, whether part of the current generation or the follow-up, is the technical specifications. If a system isn’t more powerful than what’s currently available, then what’s the point? So, what are the PS5 Pro specifications? Here’s everything we know about what’s under the hood on Sony’s new system!</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-ps5-pro-specifications">Do We Know the PS5 Pro Specifications?</h2>



<p>Here’s what we currently know about the PS5 Pro specifications. Since we’re so close to the system’s rumored release date, it’s unlikely anything will change significantly between now and the release. If it does, however, we’ll update this guide to ensure you know precisely what you’re getting in the brand-new hardware!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>System Memory</strong>: 576 GB/s (18GT/s) – A staggering 28% increase over the current PlayStation 5 console.</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: Identical to the current PlayStation 5 console but with “High CPU Frequency Mode,” which increases the CPU to 3.85GHZ.</li>



<li><strong>Audio</strong>: ACV at a higher clock speed than the current PlayStation 5 console, with a 35% increase in performance.</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>
<ul>
<li>45% faster rendering than the current PlayStation 5 console</li>



<li>2-3x Ray-tracing</li>



<li>33.5 Teraflops</li>



<li>PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution Upscaling)</li>



<li>Support for up to 8K resolutions</li>



<li>Custom machine learning architecture</li>



<li>AI Accelerator, supporting up to 300 TOPS of 8-bit computation / 67 TFLOPS of 16-bit floating point</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Software</strong>: SKD 9.00 (SKD 10.00 expected in Fall 2024)</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-is-the-ps5-pro-worth-it">Is The PS5 Pro Worth It?</h2>



<p>If you’re a big fan of high graphical fidelity in your video games, then you’ll likely find the new technical specifications of the PlayStation 5 Pro worthwhile. It’s a more robust system overall, meaning better graphics and a more streamlined experience when enjoying games at home on a 4K television.</p>

While Netflix’s original anime spin-off, <em>Terminator Zero</em>, doesn’t entirely shake the uncanny sameness of its predecessors, it boldly returns to the series long-lost core theme: “No fate but what we make.”<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195369" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Netflix's One Piece Live-Action Trailer Has A Treasure Trove Of Anime Easter Eggs" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="195369,193144,193799" data-current="195369"><div><p>Netflix's One Piece Live-Action Trailer Has A Treasure Trove Of Anime Easter Eggs</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20838.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>At first, it seems like<em> Terminator Zero</em>, written by <em>The Batman</em> co-writer Mattson Tomill and animated by <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> studio Production I.G., retreads the same narrative beats of every film from<em> Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</em> to <em>Terminator: Dark Fate</em>: killer robots are going back in time to snuff out humanity. And intially at least, it seems that <em>Terminator Zero</em> is treading that teritory as well, with its time-jumping hero Eiko (played by <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s Sonoya Mizuno) tasked with protecting a scientist and his children from a Terminator hellbent on stopping a rival AI program from thwarting Skynet. To make matters worse, she has 24 hours to save them all from Timothy Olyphant’s terrifying Terminator before Skynet goes online and kickstarts a nuclear holocaust.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But while <em>Terminator Zero</em>’s eight episodes are filled with the typical gory killing sprees and callback catchphrases the series is known for, the anime offers a shocking revelation in its sixth episode: all this time traveling isn’t changing the existing futures, it’s creating separate timelines. Instead of using this twist to deter its hero on the futility of her mission, <em>Terminator </em>Zero weaponizes this revelation to light a fire under Eiko, just like the one that drove Sarah Connor in <em>Terminator 2</em>.<br></p><p>In the original <em>Terminator</em>, time-traveling hero Kyle Reese brings Sarah a message from her son John, the leader of humanity’s resistance in his grim future, which includes the phrase, “The future is not set.” From there, the idea that there is “no fate but what we make” became <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://terminator.fandom.com/wiki/No_Fate_(quote)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://terminator.fandom.com/wiki/No_Fate_(quote)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a refrain in the <em>Terminator </em>films</a></span>, and though Eiko has learned that she can’t change fate for the people she knows because her actions can only create a new branch in time, rather than alter an existing one,&nbsp;she nonetheless decides that a new present and a completely different future are something worth fighting for. Mix that in with some existential debates between an AI and its creator about whether or not humanity is a disease that should be purged, and a Terminator with a retrofitted crossbow attachment to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/videos/terminator-zero-exclusive-behind-the-scenes-clip&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/terminator-zero-exclusive-behind-the-scenes-clip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">circumvent Japanese gun laws</a></span>, and you’ve got a pretty smart anime on your hands.<br></p><p>Speaking with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-zero-mattson-tomlin-searched-reddit-ive-got-to-just-try-not-to-make-everybody-mad&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-zero-mattson-tomlin-searched-reddit-ive-got-to-just-try-not-to-make-everybody-mad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>, Tomill recounted how he navigated developing a story for a world that already has its own—albeit uneven—canon while putting his own emotional spin on its storytelling.</p><p>“I don’t recommend you do what I did, [but] if you get on Reddit for four seconds, you very quickly go, ‘Okay, there’s a lot of things [fans] don’t want. And then there’s a lot of things that they do, and then there’s kind of this in-between area,’” Tomill said. “And so for me, it’s going on a journey of [asking], ‘Why does this need to exist in 2024? What is it that I have to say that is real, that is emotional?’<br></p><p>He continues: “For me, once I find something emotional and something where [I go], ‘Oh, I can use this as the vessel to tell an emotional story that really means something to me,’ then it’s just a matter of going, ‘Okay, what do people expect?’ Well, they expect Terminators. I think that they expect a level of time travel. They expect, whether or not they would articulate it this way, a story about families. The first movie is a love story between a man and a woman, and the second one is a mother-son story. And so I think it’s about sticking to those tenets and then going, ‘Okay, now I’ve got to just try not to make everybody mad.’”<br></p><p>While your mileage may vary with the Netflix anime’s surface-level moral quandaries,&nbsp;<em>Terminator Zero</em> boasts the best writing the troubled franchise has had in the last 30 years. Hopefully the series will steer clear of leaning on the crutch of Arnold Swarzenegger’s T-800 and Linda Hamilton’s Sarah Connor, should it get the green light for a second season.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It feels like this console generation is going on significantly longer than usual, though it’s not. If you look back at historical data for the major systems, we’re only about halfway through the lifespan of this current generation, give or take, which means there’s room for improvement and new versions to launch worldwide. First up is the PS5 Pro, right? When will the PS5 Pro be released to us eager fans?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-ps5-pro-release-date">When is the PS5 Pro Release Date?</h2>



<p>While we don’t yet have an official release date for the PS5 Pro, rumors indicate it will launch <strong>sometime in November</strong>. That’s perfect timing, of course. It’s right before the holiday season, before most people start buying all of their presents for friends and family, meaning Sony could snag a ton of holiday sales. Of course, that is dependent on the cost of the system. If it’s too expensive, many will wait.</p>



<p>Following the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-image-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30th-anniversary image leak</a>, which includes the PS5 Pro outline, Sony will either drip-feed us teasers until it’s time for an official reveal or showcase the whole system before any more leaks ruin the surprise. It’ll be interesting to see!</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-we-see-more-from-playstation">When Will We See More From PlayStation?</h2>



<p>Insider Gaming previously reported on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/september-2024-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play coming sometime in late September</a>. If that’s the case, the big console reveal will likely happen then and there. I can’t think of a better time for Sony to unveil such a massive bombshell like a brand-new system. If they reveal the system at the end of September, then a November launch certainly makes the most sense.</p>

It’s an update that will affect Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG versions of the 2010 experience, removing David Bowie’s classic ‘60s tune, Space Oddity.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🛠️ Alan Wake (2010) will receive an update on September 10th at 11am UTC. The update will be to all PC versions (Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG).</p><p>This update removes the song Space Oddity from the game due to changes in licensing, and replaces it with a new original song by Petri… <a href="https://t.co/Eem40e6vRd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Eem40e6vRd</a></p></div>— Alan Wake 2 (@alanwake) <a href="https://twitter.com/alanwake/status/1831739167392272866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The dreamy rock song appears in Alan Wake to bookend the story as it plays over its credits sequence. It’s a notable finale for the adventure that eventually picks back up in Alan Wake 2, but Remedy isn’t leaving fans without a proper replacement. When Bowie’s spacey song is removed from Alan Wake, an original song written by Petri Alanko called Strange Moons will take its place. The composer has worked with the studio on projects like Control and Alan Wake 2 in the past, so while we can’t hear what Strange Moons sounds like yet, expect it to fit in with the atmosphere fans love the series for.</p><p>Remedy notes that Alan Wake Remastered, which released in 2021, will not be affected by the impending update. Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/Peppepappa/status/1831740963368108257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Alanko took to X</u></a> to tease what Strange Moons has in store, saying that a slice of the song was once included in an original Alan Wake level that was “cut out long before release.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Written from a point of view of an astronaut who does have quite a few problems. But even _that_ is okay, as it is what it is. It wasn’t completely out of scratch (heh), as a section of the song was originally in a level in OG AW, but that level was cut out long before release. <a href="https://t.co/eqnlzga4bK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/eqnlzga4bK</a></p>— Petri Alanko (@Peppepappa) <a href="https://twitter.com/Peppepappa/status/1831740963368108257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Expired music licenses have impacted games in the past, so while it may be disappointing to hear Alan Wake join the list of affected titles, it isn’t a complete shock. Just earlier this year, Yager Development’s Spec Ops: The Line suffered an even worse fate when publisher 2K announced that it would be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spec-ops-the-line-will-no-longer-be-available-in-online-stores-2k-blames-expiring-partnerships"><u>completely delisting the experience from a number of digital storefronts</u></a> due to the expiration of “several partnership licenses related to the game.” While it wasn’t explicitly stated that the 2012 third-person shooter’s removal was related to music licenses, many believe the frequent appearance of notable songs in-game is to blame.</p><p>We gave the PC version of Alan Wake a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/15/alan-wake-review"><u>our review</u></a>, saying, “Remedy has built a world that, despite being a fantastical realm of twisting shadows and realities, is solidly anchored in authenticity.” With or without Bowie, the franchise will continue to be a part of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-control-alan-wake-and-quantum-break-are-all-connected"><u>Remedy’s connected universe of IP</u></a>. The studio’s future plans include <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-movies-on-the-way-thanks-to-new-annapurna-partnership"><u>movies based on some of its franchises</u></a> and Control 2.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
