<figure><a title="Bowser &amp; Doug Bowser" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9246706593a32/bowser-and-doug-bowser.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that the President and Chief Operating Officer of Nintendo of America Doug Bowser will be retiring at the end of the year, on 31st December 2025.</p>
<p>His replacement has already been named — Devon Pritchard, who has been at NoA for 19 years and is currently the Executive Vice President of Sales, Marketing &amp; Communications. As part of the move, Pritchard will also be joining the NoA Board of Directors and will become a Nintendo Co., Ltd Executive Officer when she takes over.</p>
<p>Other changes are coming, too: Satoru Shibata will be taking over as Chief Executive Officer, in addition to maintaining his position as Managing Executive Officer and Corporate Director of the NCL. Shibata has been the president of Nintendo of Europe and Nintendo of Australia previously.</p>
<p>Bowser's departure is a bit of a surprise to us — he joined the company back in 2015 as the Vice President of Sales &amp; Marketing, before taking over as President of NoA in April 2019 after Reggie Fils-Aimé stepped down.</p>
<p>Here is his statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One of my earliest video game experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong. Since that time, all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family. Leading Nintendo of America has been the honor of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we’ve created for consumers.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself. She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company’s growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President of Nintendo, Shuntaro Furukawa, has thanked Bowser for his work with the company, saying that he brought "smiles to the faces of people connected to Nintendo."</p>
<p>"I would like to express my gratitude for his strong efforts. Devon, who will become the next president, has also made many contributions to Nintendo over the years." Furukawa continues, "I am confident that, like Doug, Devon will continue to support Nintendo’s important mission of creating smiles.”</p>
<p>Pritchard, who will be stepping into her new role on 1st January 2026, says that “I am humbled and excited to take on this new role. Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish."</p>
<p>Her history with the company has been varied, with roles across Business Affairs, Marketing, and Publisher Relations, and her aim is to put Nintendo fans first: "With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo’s legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family.”</p>
<hr>
<p><em>We wish Doug Bowser all of the best for the future, and we're excited to see Pritchard step into the role.</em><em><br></em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser-announces-retirement]]></content:encoded>

                <p>With each new day we're inching closer and closer to a new edition of Fortnitemares, the annual spooky battle royale event that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> holds each October. While Epic has not yet announced this year's event, or even teased it, there's no doubt it's coming--Fortnitemares is one of Fortnite's most beloved annual traditions.</p><p>There have been several leaks about this year's Fortnite Halloween party--about cosmetics and gameplay changes alike--so we actually know a decent amount about what to expect even though Epic hasn't begun promoting it. Let's take a look at what we know, and think we know, so far about Fortnitemares 2025.</p><h2 id="When_does_Fortnitemares_2025_start_">When does Fortnitemares 2025 start?</h2><p>We don't know, but there will be major Fortnite updates on both October 2 (for the new OG season) and October 9 (for the new Festival season), and either of those dates could also mark the start of the new Fortnitemares. It's worth noting that the new OG season is Season 6, which originally gave us the first proper Fortnitemares event back in 2018, so it would make plenty of sense to start this year's Fortnitemares at the same time. But, again, we don't know when Fortnitemares 2025 will begin. We just have educated guesses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4574879-fortnitemares.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574879" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4574879-fortnitemares.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574879"></a><figcaption>What does Fortnitemares 2025 have in store?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4574879-fortnitemares.jpg"></figure><h2 id="What_collaborations_are_we_expecting_for_Fortnitemares_2025_">What collaborations are we expecting for Fortnitemares 2025?</h2><p>It's become standard for Fortnite to drop new skins based on horror-themed franchises each October--last year we got Leatherface from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Billy the Puppet from Saw. <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1971214902422614469" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The buzz is</a> that this year we're getting two more horror icons: Ghostface from Scream, and Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th. And keeping with the spooky spirit, it's rumored that we're getting <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1964043989398491543" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a full set of Scooby Doo stuff this year</a>--including skins for all five members of the gang, and a Mystery Machine van skin. For good measure, it looks like there will be cosmetics related to the creepy/hilarious co-op extraction game<a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1965123026233819314" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> R.E.P.O.</a>, though we don't know what exactly that will involve.</p><p>Considering nothing mentioned in the previous paragraph is owned by Disney, which has been ever-present in Fortnite since its massive investment in Epic Games, there's a good chance that we'll see another major collab or two for Fortnitemares. Last year's Fortnitemares added several sets of Disney items, including the Disney Villains, the second wave of Nightmare Before Christmas skins, Edward Scissorhands, and several spooky Marvel skins like Mephisto and Agony. It would be exceptionally surprising if Disney sat out of Fortnitemares 2025 completely.</p><h2 id="Will_there_be_any_original_Fortnitemares_skins_">Will there be any original Fortnitemares skins?</h2><p>It's very likely, since each Fortnitemares in the past has also added a pile of Fortnite original spooky skins, like last year's Lexa Hexbringer. This year,<a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1971214902422614469" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> it's looking like we're getting</a> a butcher wearing a pig mask, a moth person, and new spooky remixes of Peely and the wolfman Dire. Last October gave us a half-dozen new Fortnite original spooky people, so it's unlikely that the four I just mentioned are the only ones we should expect.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4575065-fortnitemares2024.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575065" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4575065-fortnitemares2024.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575065"></a><figcaption>Last year's Fortnitemares lineup was pretty stacked.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4575065-fortnitemares2024.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Fortnitemares_2025_gameplay_changes">Fortnitemares 2025 gameplay changes</h2><p>The start of Fortnitemares should dramatically change both the loot pool and the season's meta--it's very likely that Chapter 6 Season 4 is three months long because Fortnitemares will be almost like its own mini-season in terms of how much it will change how the season plays.</p><p>So far, only two changes have leaked so far. It's rumored that there will be a <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1953356487075545093" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jason Voorhees medallion</a>, which has an unknown function, and also that there will be <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1966950593307545947" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a mythic version of Ghostface's trademark knife</a>.</p><p>As more is discovered about Fortnitemares 2025, we'll update this space, so look for frequent updates here as Epic's spooky season creeps ever closer.</p>

			<p>For years (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reggie-fils-aime-retires/">since 2019, to be exact</a>), the Nintendo of America president was Bowser. Not really the fictional King of the Koopas, but Doug Bowser, a man who was practically destined to work at Nintendo with that kind of last name. That era is coming to an end, however, as Doug Bowser and Nintendo <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250925384737/en/Doug-Bowser-Bids-Farewell-to-the-Mushroom-Kingdom">have announced he will retire at the end of 2025</a> from his role as president of NOA and chief operating officer. Devon Pritchard, the executive vice president of revenue, marketing, and consumer at Nintendo, will be taking his place.</p>



<p>Along with Bowser leaving his role and Pritchard stepping in, Satoru Shibata will join NOA as its chief executive officer, while maintaining his role in Nintendo Co. Ltd as managing executive officer, board member, and corporate director. Pritchard will also become a member of the board of directors at NOA and a Nintendo Co. Ltd executive officer. </p>



<p>"<em>One of my earliest videogame experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong</em>," Bowser said in a press release. "<em>Since that time,</em> <em>all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family.</em> <em>Leading Nintendo of America has been the honour of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we've created for consumers.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Now, it's time for the next generation of leadership and Devon's track record speaks for itself. She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company's growth. I have full confidence she will guide the company to even greater heights</em>."</p>



<p>For her part, Pritchard added, "<em>I am humbled and excited to take on this new role. Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo's legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family.</em>"</p>



<p>As Bowser departs, Nintendo Co. Ltd president Shuntaro Furukawa added, "<em>During his tenure, Doug made numerous contributions to bring smiles to the faces of people connected to Nintendo. I would like to express my gratitude for his strong efforts. Devon, who will become the next president, has also made many contributions to Nintendo over the years. I am confident that, like Doug, Devon will continue to support Nintendo's important mission of creating smiles</em>."</p>

			<p>Xbox Series X/S console sales haven't been much to write home about in recent years. Not because there's been nothing interesting going on with them, but because there simply haven't been many sales at all. Now, new reports from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/costco-stops-selling-xbox-consoles-in-uk-and-us">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> and <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1971251689425600587">Destin Legarie</a> reveal there will be even less, as the major global retailer Costco has stopped selling the Xbox Series X/S line of consoles.</p>



<p>After players started to report being unable to find the Xbox Series consoles at Costco, GamesIndustry.Biz did some digging and was able to find that, as of August 6, 2025, Xbox consoles were no longer available on the Costco website. A visit to a Costco location and a call to the UK customer service department t a separate store resulted in a customer service representative confirming, "<em>We don't actually have the Xbox anymore</em>."</p>



<p>No further confirmation or statement from Costco has been released, but former IGN host and writer Destin Legarie, who has been reporting as an independent journalist in recent months, put in a similar call to Costco in the US, and was given the same answer, that Costco "<em>will no longer be carrying Xbox consoles</em>."</p>



<p>Legarie did get a little more to his answer, as he was told that it was "<em>a business decision</em>" and that Costcon doesn't "<em>have any plans going forward to carry an Xbox console</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Just called Costco about Xbox stock. I was told that they will no longer be carrying Xbox consoles. “We don’t have any plans going forward to carry an Xbox console.” Saying. It was a business decision.</p><p>They did say they have some great deals on Switch &amp; PlayStation, though.</p></div>— Destin (@DestinLegarie) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinLegarie/status/1971251689425600587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Previous reports of Xbox Series X/S sales numbers have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-x-sold-less-30-million-units-profitable/">entire generation's sales sitting at a little over 30 million units</a>, which has also reportedly made the device profitable for Microsoft. And what won't help those sales figures grow any further is the recent news that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">Microsoft is increasing the price of the Series X/S consoles in the US for the second time this year</a>.</p>



<p>For Wccftech's part, as an outlet headquartered in Canada, a browse on the Canadian Costco website also comes up empty when searching for Xbox Series X/S consoles, with only a pair of wireless Xbox-branded headphones showing <a href="https://www.costco.ca/xbox.html">on the store's dedicated Xbox page</a>. You'll have no trouble finding a <a href="https://www.costco.ca/playstation-5.html">PlayStation 5</a> or <a href="https://www.costco.ca/nintendo-switch.html">Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 console</a>, though.</p>



<p>When we put in a call to Costco Canada's customer service number, the representative said that Costco Canada does still carry Xbox consoles, but they are currently out of stock. We'll update this article if there's any change in the days ahead. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-doug-bowser-president-linkedin-debate-comments-1851467763">Doug Bowser</a> is stepping down as President of Nintendo of America after five years in charge of the North American business unit. The 10-year veteran of the<em> Mario</em> maker departs shortly after the arrival of the Switch 2 with his retirement taking effect December 31. He’ll be replaced by long-time Nintendo executive Devon Pritchard, who will have the distinction of being the first female president in Nintendo of America’s history.</p> <p>“One of my earliest video game experiences was playing the arcade version of <em>Donkey Kong</em>,” Bowser <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250925384737/en/Doug-Bowser-Bids-Farewell-to-the-Mushroom-Kingdom">said in a press release</a>. “Since that time, all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family. Leading Nintendo of America has been the honor of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we’ve created for consumers. Now, it’s time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself. She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company’s growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights.”</p>   <p>Satoru Shibata, who at various times in the past was head of Nintendo Australia and Nintendo Europe, will be joining Nintendo of America as chief executive officer, while maintaining his role as managing executive officer at Nintendo Co. in Japan. Pritchard will be elevated to the Nintendo of America Board of Directors and join the executive officer group in Japan.</p>

 <p>“With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo’s legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family,” Pritchard said in a statement.</p>

 <p>Bowser took over as President of Nintendo of America back in 2019 after <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-president-reggie-fils-aime-is-retiring-1832793123">Reggie Fils-Aime stepped down</a> following 15 years in the position. Bowser took on a less visible role than his predecessor, but has still appeared in the occasional Nintendo Direct and at big launches, including the recent opening of a new Nintendo store in San Francisco. Bowser’s departure comes shortly after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-customer-support-concern-following-outsourcing-decision-ahead-of-switch-2s-first-holiday-season"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> a change to the customer service department at Nintendo of America, including more outsourcing to cut costs.</p> <p>“During his tenure, Doug made numerous contributions to bring smiles to the faces of people connected to Nintendo,” Nintendo head Shuntaro Furukawa said in a statement. “I would like to express my gratitude for his strong efforts.”</p>

              <p>Crunchyroll will bring a bunch of the biggest manga series to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/crunchyroll-price-increase-mega-ultimate-fan-tiers-1851449985">anime streaming service</a> on October 9 with the launch of Crunchyroll Manga. While there are other manga reader services out there, the fact that lots of people already have a Crunchyroll sub and that Crunchyroll Manga brings many different publishers under a single roof has the potential to make it one of the most convenient options out there for keeping up with <em>One Piece </em>and other big series.</p> <p>The company announced on Thursday that Crunchyroll Manga will be available to all subscribers on iOS and Android, and will launch with works from AlphaPolis, COMPASS, Square Enix, VIZ Media, and Yen Press, followed by additional partners like Shueisha and J-Novel Club later on. There will also be a web version launching on October 15. Here’s the pricing breakdown:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><b>Crunchyroll Fan + Manga</b> – $11.99 USD / $15.49 CAD per month (includes Manga add-on at $4.00 USD / $5.50 CAD)</li> <li><b>Crunchyroll Mega Fan + Manga</b>&nbsp;– $15.49 USD / $17.49 CAD per month (includes Manga add-on at $3.50 USD / $5.00 CAD)</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>And here are some of the big-name series fans will have access to:</p> <blockquote> <ul data-cy="list"> <li><strong><em>One Piece</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Daemons of the Shadow Realm</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>My Dress-Up Darling</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Lycoris Recoil</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Delicious in Dungeon</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Sasaki and Miyano</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Tsukimichi: Moonlit Fantasy</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Maiden of the Dragon: Falling for the Demon’s Lies</em></strong></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>The service will be ad-free and come at no extra cost to people who already have the $16-a-month Crunchyroll Ultimate Fan subscription. Perks for all subscriber tiers include “the ability to download chapters for offline viewing, light and dark mode settings, and the ability to build a personalized reading list with curated recommendations.”</p> <p>Crunchyroll has only become more dominant since it was acquired by Sony and absorbed rival service Funimation back in 2020. It’s been riding the recent hit success of <em>Demon Slayer</em> in particular to new heights. <em>Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle Part 1</em> broke records this year, leaving fans waiting for news on <em>Part 2</em> and <em>3</em>. “Well, we’ve announced that it will be a trilogy of movies, but our partners at Aniplex and Ufotable haven’t decided on dates yet,” Crunchyroll boss Rahul Purini <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/crunchyroll-ceo-demon-slayer-infinity-castle-anime-success-1236377193/">said in an interview this week</a>. “But look, there’s definitely urgency for all of us to bring more <em>Demon Slayer</em> to fans as soon as we can—because we know the urgency is there among the fan base.”</p>

<section><p>RGG Studio continues its efforts to bring its beloved Yakuza series up to modern standards, and goes on step further for Yakuza 3.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I still can't believe this is really happening. Longtime Yakuza fans can finally delete all their sad tweet drafts after the recent Ryu Ga Gotoku Summit, because Yakuza Kiwami 3 is real and, from what we've seen, it offers way more than anyone expected.</p><p dir="ltr">I played the original Yakuza 3 after Kiwami 1 and 2 because I wanted to experience the series in chronological order, but going back to a time when the series was less technically capable right after the two gorgeous Dragon Engine remakes ended up being a challenge. Yakuza 3 was released back in 2009, and the gameplay now feels considerably broken and outdated from a modern standpoint. The difficulty scaling in boss fights felt unfair and most of the time, I ended up intensely button mashing through battles, hoping to finally break blocks before getting annihilated with just a few hits. Outside of fighting the game felt slow and clunky. I wanted to enjoy Kiryu's downtime in Okinawa, but the dragged-out interactions almost ruined the experience for me, not to mention those early '00s face models when the gaming industry couldn't quite figure out what a child looks like.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575231-s_yk3_ss_02_3840x2160-23e5b4af.jpg%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575231" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575231-s_yk3_ss_02_3840x2160-23e5b4af.jpg%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575231"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575231-s_yk3_ss_02_3840x2160-23e5b4af.jpg%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, the game managed to save itself for me by having one of the most heartfelt stories in Kiryu's saga, with memorable characters that fans still gush about today. My experience may have been frustrating at times, but those rare, peaceful moments Kiryu spent with the orphans and his relationships with other Yakuza 3-exclusive characters are still some of my biggest highlights in the whole series.</p><p dir="ltr">Since my playthrough, I desperately wanted Yakuza 3 to be remade because I knew if the studio could just update the graphics and gameplay, it would easily end up one of my favorite titles. When I finally got to sit down and demo this remake, I'm not gonna lie, I teared up. Not only does Yakuza Kiwami 3 finally get the Dragon Engine treatment it deserves, but the added content proves once again that RGG puts a lot of love into its remakes.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Yakuza Kiwami 3 Hands-on</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Admittedly, our demo was short lived, but it gave me a glimpse of what changes to expect in Kiwami 3. We started with one of the opening moments of the game: Kiryu has removed himself from the Yakuza entirely and is now living in Okinawa with Haruka, taking care of orphans at Morning Glory, the orphanage where Kiryu grew up. However, constant eviction notices from the Ryudo family push Kiryu to the Ryudo Family office in the city, where he encounters Rikiya and Mikio, who've been spying on the orphanage. This takes us straight to the battle tutorial.</p><p dir="ltr">Since this is a remake, the game takes us back to its beat-'em-up roots with Kiryu's signature Dragon of Dojima fighting style but also features a new Ryukyu Style inspired by Okinawan martial arts. In the new fighting style, Kiryu is equipped with eight different weapons, each of which has a charged attack. The combat is largely similar to the previous Kiwami games, but it was fun testing out new weapons and combos with the Ryukyu style. Of course, nothing beats my favorite classic Kiryu power move: beating up every single enemy with a bicycle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575238-darkties_mine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575238" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575238-darkties_mine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575238"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575238-darkties_mine.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After the battle sequence, we were free to roam the city for a few minutes, and it was nice to indulge in some nostalgia while walking the streets of an Okinawa that has been updated in the new engine. There wasn't much to explore in the demo except basic activities like karaoke and eating at different restaurants. I did, however, spend most of my time with the new cell phone customization. I love that Kiwami 3 kept Kiryu's "Razor" phone, and this time, you can add charms, jewels, and customize the background. I made his phone pink with jewels and a heart charm, which will add a nice touch when getting all those hilarious Revelations again.</p><p dir="ltr">One change in the remake I'm still on the fence about is Rikiya's new face. In the original Yakuza 3, Rikiya had more of a youthful, somewhat innocent visage that complemented his naive personality and Okinawan roots. His soft and more casual appearance compared to typical Yakuza characters was more fitting as an islander, but it's now been replaced with his new voice actor Sho Kasamatsu's face. It'll be odd to get used to his new look now that he resembles a rugged, attractive Japanese actor, but hopefully the playful (and painful) interactions between him and his "aniki" Kiryu will deliver the same emotions. I'm really looking forward to how they play out a certain hotel scene. After getting a glimpse of the remake, it was time to check out the biggest surprise from the studio: Yoshitaka Mine getting his own game called Dark Ties.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Dark Ties Hands-on</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Finally, a Yakuza game where you play as an actual yakuza! On top of a full remake, Kiwami 3 also features an entirely separate game that focuses on the main antagonist, Yoshitaka Mine, and the events that lead up to Kiwami 3's plot. Comparable to the Majima Saga in Yakuza Kiwami 2, this is a separate story that is accessible in the main menu but it's an actual full-length game. I don't think anyone expected RGG to give a one-off villain from 15+ years ago his own entire playable story, but the studio continues to impress me with how consistently they are at putting out meaningful content and give lots of exposition and love to its fanbase's favorite characters.</p><p>In Dark Ties, Mine is a businessman who wants to grow connections in the Yakuza world. We got to watch one of the opening cutscenes, where Mine is having an existential crisis about where his life is headed after leaving his current business. After witnessing the loyalty of Tojo Clan members to their chairman and our boy Daigo Dojima, Mine decides he will do anything to connect with him. He then receives a tip from a private investigator about a yakuza recently released from prison who has connections: the arrogant, perverted antagonist from Yakuza 3, Tsuyoshi Kanda. The first thing I thought during the opening cutscene was, "Wow, Mine is so beautiful in this game." His face design is slightly different from Yakuza Isshin's, but Mine fans will definitely be spamming the timelines with fan edits, myself most likely included.</p><p>Shortly after the cutscene, we tested out Mine's fighting style in the battle tutorial. Mine's style is a unique blend of aerial and "shoot boxing" moves that can trigger his Dark Awakening. This mode is triggered by building up the shackled hearts below his health bar through combos and, when activated, makes Mine more powerful. I couldn't help but laugh at the silliness of calling his specialty "Dark Awakening." Mine is jokingly known for being a bit emo, so it only makes sense his moveset would have an edge to it.</p><p>After the battle tutorial, we were free to explore Kamurocho. Like all Yakuza protagonists, Mine also gets to participate in minigames such as golf, baseball, and gambling. I was so happy to hear Shido Nakamura's voice as Mine again, so obviously the first thing I did during the free-roam session was head straight to karaoke. I can't tell if RGG making all the protagonists VAs sing karaoke is a perk or a punishment for them, but damn did Mine sound beautiful singing Bakamitai, even if it was to a photo of Kanda. Sorry to disappoint the MineDai fans with this one.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575232-s_yk3_ss_06_3840x2160-54997087.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575232" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575232-s_yk3_ss_06_3840x2160-54997087.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575232"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575232-s_yk3_ss_06_3840x2160-54997087.jpg.jpg"></figure><p>We were left on a cliffhanger after Mine finally met with Kanda, but I cannot wait to see what additional content we will be getting in his story and how it leads up to Kiwami 3. Considering we are getting the full backstory of Mine's relationships with both Kanda and Daigo, it will be wild when we finally get to witness their conclusions in Kiwami 3. More importantly though, I am really looking forward to the Mine and Daigo shippers' reactions and memes when the games are finally out.Out of every title RGG has released in the last couple years, this is the one I'm most excited about.</p><p>Spending time with Kiryu in the orphanage and witnessing him in a more peaceful setting in that beautiful Dragon Engine is something I greatly look forward to, on top of all the silly side content and moments with my favorite Yakuza 3 characters. Normally, I don't care for video game remakes--it's very rare they offer anything different for me aside from updated graphics, but RGG continues to pump out beautiful, re-crafted titles with new content. We are getting closer to having remakes of the studio's full library, and while there are minor, sometimes-questionable changes, these Kiwami titles prove RGG cares about its fanbase and wants newcomers to have the best experience with Kiryu's full story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capstone Games' newest tabletop game, Aquaria, is available now for pre-order. The game is a family-friendly experience about who can build and maintain the most impressive aquarium.</p>

<h2>The <em>Aquaria</em> Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://capstone-games.com/product/aquaria/" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, <em>Aquaria</em> is a board game designed for 1-4 players and takes about 60-180 minutes to complete. Each player takes turns building their own aquarium with its own unique ecosystem of marine life. Those turns are spent buying new fish, feeding them, and keeping the aquarium in good condition.</p>

The encyclopedia rewards points for how involved each player becomes in their understanding of marine biology and their aquarium maintenance. Whoever has the most points at the end wins the game. Notably, the game revolves less around exotic fish and more around aquascaping and fauna management.</p>

<p>The lead designer of <em>Aquaria</em> is&nbsp;Tomáš Holek, the award-winning tabletop designer, no stranger to management-oriented tabletop experiences. His work includes <em>Tea Garden</em>, a game about managing and cultivating your own tea garden in China's Yunnan region, and <em>SETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence</em>, a sci-fi game about searching for life beyond planet Earth.</p>

<p>This management focus is also not unheard of for Capstone Games. Their most beloved board game is 2012's <em>Terra Mystica</em>, a euro-game designed by&nbsp;Jens Drögemüller and&nbsp;Helge Ostertag about managing your own small part of a vast fantasy kingdom. It is an experience so beloved it has won multiple awards over the years, including the acclaimed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/diana-jones-award-2025-winners-have-been-announced-their-prize-includes-trip-to" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Diana Jones Award</a>, Meeples' Choice, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/designer-of-bomb-busters-board-game-wins-this-years-spiel-des-jahres" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Spiel des Jahres</a>.</p>

<p>The acclaim is so profound that Steamforged Games has announced plans to <a href="https://steamforged.com/blogs/brands/terra-mystica-special-edition" rel="nofollow">reprint the game</a> through a crowdfunding campaign.</p>

<p>The <em>Aquaria</em> board game is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $74.95 not including shipping. It is expected to ship out to customers in November.</p>

              <p><em>Hades 2</em> is finally out of Early Access and Supergiant Games has rolled out the red carpet with patch notes showing every major change as the game enters version 1.0 on PC and comes to Switch 1 and Switch 2. The true ending to Princess Melinoë’s adventure is now live, along with fresh secrets and a bevy of balancing tweaks.</p> <p>Supergiant Games put <em>Hades 2</em> out in Early Access <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-pc-early-access-release-date-surprise-1851458365">back in May 2024</a> and it was already pretty decent. The studio’s been adding more content and fine-tuning its more ambitious scope ever since. In addition to the True Ending and Epilogue, there are also new story events, gift events, keepsakes to discover and fresh artwork and music for players to enjoy. Most of the balance changes are buffs or bug fixes. Appearance rates for resources have undergone some changes as well<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->all Prestige are now Kudos<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and Tablet of Peace and Rod of Fishing sequences have been sped up.</p> <p>“While <em>Hades 2</em> spent more than four-and-a-half years in development, including about a year and a half in Early Access, it’s also the culmination of all the experience we’ve gained together as a team since Supergiant Games started back in 2009,” director Greg Kasavin wrote in the game’s Discord. “Early Access development was foundational to the entire idea of the original <em>Hades</em>, and proved instrumental to this latest game as well. So, from all of us, thank you for inspiring us to do our best, and we hope you enjoy your time with <em>Hades 2</em>.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-ii-the-kotaku-review-2000628064">Opinions may vary</a> on how well this sequel builds on the foundations of the original, but <em>Hades 2</em> is an impressive achievement for a studio that’s retained all seven of its founding members and continues releasing popular indie hits without a CEO or conventional business structure. “I don’t have some kind of magical explanation for why we’ve been able to stick around for this long while some others haven’t been as fortunate,” Kasavin <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/hades-supergiant-games-studio-21057611.php">told <em>SFChronicle</em></a> in a new interview. “I do attribute it to the value that we place on sticking together as a team, on keeping our ambitions relatively modest. We don’t have an ambition to grow big for its own sake.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gamers who love multiplayer online combat games where teamwork is key — think&nbsp;<em>Helldivers II</em> or <em>Marvel Rivals</em> — are all too aware that it only takes one laggy teammate to kill an entire mission. It’s not always a slow internet connection or console either — a subpar monitor with a bad refresh time can spell doom for the whole team.</p>
<p>If you end up being&nbsp;<em>that guy</em> who says “sorry, my screen is slow” one time too many, you might find your team membership revoked. This limited-time Amazon deal <em>that guy</em>-proofs you and ensures your screen is totally ready for combat: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4321/">Act now and save 30% off the price of the 27-inch ASUS TUF gaming monitor</a>, a 1440p QHD gaming superstar with a blistering 260Hz refresh rate, Adaptive Sync technology, and many more features that will upgrade your gaming performance. It’s just $229 while this deal is in effect.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4321/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Silky Smooth, Lightning Quick</h2>
<p>First things first — the ultra-fast 260Hz overclocked refresh rate and 1 ms pixel response time. No blur, smooth frames, or delay, even in the fastest action of your favorite shooter or racing game. ASUS doubled down on killing the bluir with their ELMB Sync tech (Extreme Low Motion Blur), and adaptive sync options that keeps things moving even if your graphics card is having a hard time. That translates to less tearing.</p>
<p>The colors pop too, and the anti-glare coating is a huge plus if your rig is located with your back to a window. That, of course, comes in handy if you decide to take a break from gaming to enjoy some streaming or YouTube.</p>



<h2>Not a Space Hog</h2>
<p>The ASUS TUF monitor won’t require a total overhaul of your gaming space either. It’s razor thin and weighs only 11 pounds, meaning it’s also easily wall-mountable of you go that route. The display port and two HDMI 2.0 ports are located in the back of the unit along with an earphone jack, and it comes with DisplayPort and HDMI cables so you can go from unboxing to heavy-duty action in mere minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4321/">The 30% off deal happening right now at Amazon on the 27-inch ASUS TUF gaming monitor translates to a $100 price break</a>, and also to one of the best $230 gaming monitors you’ll find. Finding a gaming monitor with enough speed to keep up with the most intense action gaming at this price is beyond rare, but as limited time deals do, this one could end at any time.</p>
