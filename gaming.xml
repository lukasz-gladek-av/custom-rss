<p>A reputable insider has claimed that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle will be coming to PlayStation 5 after an expired timed-exclusive window.</p>



<p>That’s according to <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1825594654387294219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NateTheHate</a>, who took the news to Twitter, “MachineGames’ Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will release on Xbox &amp; PC this holiday (Dec) as a timed console exclusive. After this timed-exclusive window expires, Indiana Jones &amp; the Great Circle is planned to come to PlayStation 5 in the first half of 2025”, he said.</p>



<p>According to Insider Gaming sources, some outlets have been given the heads up on the news and have signed NDAs, but it’s currently unclear on if the information will be announced at Tuesday’s Opening Night Live or not.</p>



<p>Nate’s claims come following another report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/4/24057433/microsoft-bethesda-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge’s Tom Warren in February</a>, who stated that Bethesda was “considering” brining Indiana Jones to the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>As for the information Nate has revealed himself, the news that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle will only be a timed-exclusive for what appears to be less than six months has already had people talking about Microsoft’s future strategy with its Xbox titles.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Insider Gaming did revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-2024-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle was still intended to release in 2024</a>.</p>

It's been revealed that Capcom's Blue Bomber will be playable in Funko Fusion, and fans can play as him in the free demo now available on Steam. Of course, players can also play as actual characters from The Thing, but why do that when you could be Freddy Fazbear of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/five-nights-at-freddys/" data-ref-id="5000-306190">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> fame or He-Man instead?</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siURR3s9OdQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/siURR3s9OdQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We've been working on this game for three years, and this is the first time we're inviting the public to experience it outside of recent timed convention demos," 10:10 Games writes in post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843310/Funko_Fusion/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. "Any feedback, positive or negative, will be invaluable as we approach the September 13 release date and beyond."</p><p dir="ltr">The co-op action-adventure game starring the line of pop culture collectibles will feature over 20 IP owned by NBCUniversal. In addition to The Thing, there will also be content in Funko Fusion from Jurassic World, Jaws, Back to the Future, Shaun of the Dead, Battlestar Galactica, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent hands-on preview, we said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/funko-fusion-looks-to-claim-the-space-vacated-by-traditional-lego-games/1100-6525803/" data-ref-id="1100-6525803">Funko Fusion is very obviously building on ideas seen in Traveler's Tales Lego games</a>, but that fact isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Now, a member of the mod team that goes by the handle "Watchful Wolf" says that the gaming giant put out the cease-and-desist order due to concerns that H2M would hurt Black Ops 6 sales.</p><p dir="ltr">Fans immediately took to forums like the Call of Duty subreddit to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1et5csh/cod_h2m_cease_desisted/" rel="nofollow ">express</a> their displeasure with the move, with many of them noting that the C&amp;D came the day before H2M was scheduled to release. In a video posted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhHQ76SgPUI">YouTube</a>, Watchful Wolf stated that the order from Activision came just hours before the mod's release, and that the team immediately "dropped everything," taking their website and all servers down.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Watchful Wolf also stated in the video that the C&amp;D explicitly stated why Activision moved to shut the project down. They said it was "because of the popularity H2M was gaining and how close it is to Black Ops 6 releasing. They did not want H2M interfering with possible sales of Black Ops 6."</p><p dir="ltr">As usual in this kind of situation, it's difficult to verify Watchful Wolf's claims. However, it does make sense that Activision would do whatever it can to try to maximize Black Ops 6's sales, as it's the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-game-pass-savior-spot-on/1100-6523868/" data-ref-id="1100-6523868">first one releasing</a> on Xbox Game Pass. It also comes at a sensitive time for the Xbox brand, which now owns Activison. But it's also important to note that this isn't the first high-profile Call of Duty mod to get the axe from the publisher, and we highly doubt that it'll be the last. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">Black Ops 6 beta</a> begins on Friday, August 30.</p><p dir="ltr">We've reached out to Activision for comment, and we'll update the piece accordingly if we hear back.</p>

            <p>Nintendo and Level-5 have announced a delay for Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, which was originally due to launch for Switch on 10th October.</p>
<p>"To all of you who have been looking forward to the release, we apologise for any inconvenience caused and sincerely appreciate your understanding," Level-5 said in a <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/240819/">statement</a> sharing news of the delay. "Thank you for your patience."</p>
<p>Level-5 hasn't yet suggested when Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time might now release, nor did it offer any reason for the delay. Could the studio be waiting for Nintendo's next generation of hardware, tentatively dubbed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>? I suppose time will tell.</p>

<p>We first got word of Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">Nintendo Direct in February last year</a>. At the time of its announcement, the game was set to release in 2023, but it later saw its launch nudged back into this year.</p>
<p>We got a subsequent look at Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time this February, when the team gave us a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">peek at the various jobs players</a> will be able to undertake in this time travelling adventure. You can see for yourself in the trailer above.</p>
<p>Away from Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Level-5 also has a new Professor Layton game in the pipeline</a>. It's known as New World of Steam and will place the Professor as something of a newcomer himself, in a story which moves the series' action to America.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Jen Kellan, the Storm Witch who serves as <em>Tactical Breach Wizards’ </em>de-facto protagonist, has just returned from a job gone badly. As a PI, she responsibly goes to the police to file her report and findings before being dismissed for inserting herself into missing persons cases and having her abilities dismissed as “witch’s tricks.” Since the game is wildly sharp, it lets you talk your shit right back at them, pointing out that maybe she wouldn’t have to insert herself if the police did their jobs. Soon after, you spend a mission dismantling the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-police-recruitment-poster-peoria-apology-1851300689&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-police-recruitment-poster-peoria-apology-1851300689">brutally inefficient police force</a></span>, and once again, toss people out of windows.<br></p><p><em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>is immensely talk-y. It’s got an unfiltered voice that I’m deeply jealous of and which bleeds into its presentation and lovely level design. Some of my favorite moments in the game aren’t even in combat, but instead in the dialogue-heavy cutscenes that play between missions or just before you breach a door to begin a level. You get to know Zan, a veteran black ops wizard with ties to the game’s villain, and the “base” he brings you back to is actually his mom’s flat. Once you’re there, the two of them regale you with Zan’s “origin story” and his mom tells you that he’s got his dad’s “dogshit spirit.”</p><figure id="" data-id="0311d7740c2526755efc99cd4f9ea701" data-recommend-id="image://0311d7740c2526755efc99cd4f9ea701" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan having a hilarious conversation." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan having a hilarious conversation." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Tom Francis</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0311d7740c2526755efc99cd4f9ea701" data-recommend-id="image://0311d7740c2526755efc99cd4f9ea701" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan having a hilarious conversation." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Everyone is a <em>character</em> in <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em>,<em> </em>which makes me appreciate how much it squeezes from these interstitial scenes. A traffic warlock with uncanny hearing named Steve Clark is among the brightest of them, and he thankfully recurs as a hilarious rival to Jen. Bori, a pyromancer known for producing barely-hot flames, is another such oddity, and a necromedic named Banks even ends up joining your team. Her whole shtick is that she can only heal people by resurrecting them and she can only resurrect someone who’s died within an hour, so she carries around a gun to expedite things. Yes, she resurrects you with a headshot. </p><p>Naturally, this quirkiness extends into the game’s story and approach to level design. Combat plays out via a turn-based system on an isometric grid, where you first deploy your units and take your actions before the enemy goes. If you leave one of your allies in a precarious position, you can foresee what the enemy will do before ending your turn and committing to it, and a rewind button allows you to carefully calculate every step of the turn before letting your foes advance. More often than not, you won’t be dealing direct damage as much as you’ll be debuffing enemies, knocking them into parts of the environment, or sending them careening out a window or into holes. However, <em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>does a marvelous job of ramping things up, despite how simplistic this might sound.<br></p><p>One of the latest levels I took on occurred within Jen’s own anxiety dream, and it was appropriately pretty unorthodox and challenging, both thematically and mechanically. On one level, Jen is quite literally interrogating herself about her inability to separate her identity from her work, diminishing her worth and sense of self. On another, two versions of her are fighting through stifling bureaucratic offices filled with the very police officers and traffic warlocks that filled her otherwise bland daily life. That is, until Zan came to her for help preventing World War <em>Five</em> and she began to feel like she was capable of being more than a cog in a broken machine.<br></p><p>In addition to familiarizing me with her struggles, this anxiety dream also pushed me to get to know all of Jen’s tricks. For example, the biggest thing about Jen is that she is both highly mobile and capable of pushing units around, so rather than confronting enemies head on, I tried to reposition her near windows. That way she could either use her main weapon (which pushes a unit at a time) or her Chain Bolt (which knocks back even further and also attacks multiple enemies) to send people flying out of windows, <em>or </em>use her broom to fly out of a nearby window and emerge from another one.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="7861effdba894cd95efa0ca2bfbb79b1" data-recommend-id="image://7861effdba894cd95efa0ca2bfbb79b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan crouching in front of an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan crouching in front of an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Tom Francis</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7861effdba894cd95efa0ca2bfbb79b1" data-recommend-id="image://7861effdba894cd95efa0ca2bfbb79b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Jen and Zan crouching in front of an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Banks plays an excellent supporting role, being able to transfer damage from one character to another, opening up eldritch portals that enemies can be sucked up into, or even just softening them up with a thrown sedative, multiplying the effectiveness of any knockback damage. Zan is much more offensive, having the ability to set fire to any enemy that crosses whatever axis he fixes his sights on, but my favorite move of his eventually allows him to send out multiple projections of himself to take fire, shoot at nearby enemies, or even interact with objectives. It’s corny to admit, but you feel downright magical after a certain point, though <em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>rarely feels pitched in your favor because of that.</p><p>An enemy turret will still absolutely cap you in 1-2 hits, and other traffic warlocks will send spectral cars and buses in three lanes directly at you. Neutralisers occasionally fill the ranks of enemies, and since they fixate on the closest unit to them and strip them of their magic, you have to carefully consider pulling enemy aggression when breaching a room and tactically position your allies accordingly. You wouldn’t want Zan to be pinned down on that opening turn, for example, since his clones and uniquely offensive skills make him ideal for taking out that Neautraliser quickly. That then creates an opportunity for Jen to dart through the room and push people into walls, portals, or out of windows. No matter what you think the goal of this game is, it’s <strong>pushing as many people out of windows as possible.</strong></p><p>If you don’t believe me, try and meet all the “confidence” goals in every level. These sub-objectives encourage you to optimize your playstyle by challenging you to sometimes beat a level in a certain amount of turns, toss a certain number of enemies out of windows in one move, or extend a turn so long that you and all your allies are able to use a number of skills, which take either action or mana, or sometimes both. Each character has their own confidence objective, which gives points to unlock cosmetics, but just beating missions will reward XP that can be doled out to modify and level up individual skills in a system that’s deeply familiar to anyone who’s played the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/into-the-breach-the-kotaku-review-1823365331&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/into-the-breach-the-kotaku-review-1823365331">beloved tactics game <em>Into the Breach</em></a></span><em>.</em></p><p>While I am two acts into the game, there’s another two that are even longer and there’s a slew of dream missions, which include challenging gauntlets as well as survival missions. You know, just in case you thought there wouldn’t be enough meat on the bones. Between its ridiculous cast and premise, a sleek sense of style, and a mystery I actually want to unravel—complete with a board and lots of interactive red string—not to mention its incredible wit, <em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>is absolutely one of the best games I’ve played this year. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are new puzzles and additional endings, but Bloober Team is mostly sticking to the specifications and spirit of the original <em>Silent Hill 2</em> blueprint. “It provides the game a comfortingly familiar structure—while allowing new detail to flourish around it like a trellis—and I’m looking forward to seeing where it grows past its first three hours,” he writes.</p><p><em>IGN</em>’s Dale Diver <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-hands-on-preview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-hands-on-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was similarly impressed</a></span> with how reserved Bloober Team was, likening <em>Silent Hill 2 Remake</em> more to BluePoint Games’ by-the-book recreation of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> than Capcom’s remade <em>Resident Evil 2</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-preview-significantly-better-than-the-trailers-youve-seen/1100-6525893/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-preview-significantly-better-than-the-trailers-youve-seen/1100-6525893/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GameSpot</em>’s Jessica Cogswell</a></span>, meanwhile, said the overhauled graphics haven’t negated the grimy mystique of the older version. “The <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake is a gorgeous game that doesn’t abandon the grime, grotesquerie, and yes, fog, that made the original game so mesmerizing,” she wrote. “In fact, it regularly amps it up.

<p>The rumors of FIFA and 2K Sports working together continue to circulate, and it’s even gotten to the potential competition at EA Sports. In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/fc-25-developer-interview-career-mode-football-manager-fifa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, EA FC 25 developers Andreas Wilsdorf and Alex Constantinescu&nbsp;addressed the rumors of FIFA 2K coming in the future.</p>



<p>“It’s still just rumors, but even if the rumors are true, we welcome competition. I think competition is always interesting to see, you know, how other people approach the sport,” Wilsdorf says. “We know how tough it is to make a football game and it will be interesting to see how they would challenge us, but again, we’re welcoming competition.”</p>



<p>To add to that, Constantinescu, EA FC 25’s principal game designer for Career mode, said that challenges from the past is something they he feels they are lacking at this stage.</p>



<p>“I remember it was pure coincidence that a couple of years ago when we added press conferences to the game, PES did as well,” he said. “And when we saw the announcement from PES, I remember I got like ‘Okay, this is interesting. Now I really need to pick it up a notch and work a bit more on the content’.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wilsdorf then said that while competition “brings out the best of everyone”, the team at EA Sports isn’t afraid of what could happen with a FIFA 2K game.</p>



<p>“We’re not worried because we know how good the game is…,” he said.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-do-things-stand-with-a-fifa-2k-game">Where Do Things Stand With A FIFA 2K Game?</h2>



<p>Regarding FIFA 2K, while nothing is official, there have been continued talks between FIFA and 2K parent company Take-Two Interactive. After talking to sources last week, the hope is that the sides can announce a deal sometime later this year. Negotiations, which date as far back as earlier this year, remain ongoing.</p>

<p>During Take-Two’s recent earnings call, CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-addresses-rumors-surround-fifa-and-2k-sports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refused to put out the smoke</a> that has been rising surrounding a possible partnership. Instead, while admitting to the difficulty it takes to make a soccer console game, Zelnick said that the company will have “more announcements in due course”.</p>



<p>He also said, thanks to their mobile manager game Top Eleven, that they are already in the “soccer business”.</p>

<p>There are so many upcoming games worth being excited about, but few offer the scale and scope of Dune Awakening. It’s an upcoming open-world survival game set on the world of Arrakis from the Dune franchise. Developer Funcom, known for Conan Exiles, likely has a clear winner on its hands. Here is everything we know about Dune Awakening!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-dune-awakening">What is Dune Awakening?</h2>



<p>Dune Awakening is a third-person action survival game set on the massive open world of Arrakis. You’ll explore the endless deserts in search of Spice, delve into underground laboratories, and uncover secrets within hidden caves inside of sprawling canyons. To accomplish such a daring adventure, players will have a variety of abilities, skills, and weapons, most of which you can upgrade over time to dive into new content.</p>



<p>As you grow in power, engaging in combat with infantry, ground and air vehicles, and more, you’ll form a guild to take control of a House Minor. Yes, you can even harvest Spice to bring immense wealth to your House.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-dune-awakening-release-date">Do We Know the Dune Awakening Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Funcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>We do not know Dune Awakening’s official release date. We expect to hear more soon, hopefully at Gamescom, but there’s no guarantee Funcom is prepared to announce a date just yet. They’re still working on scheduling a playtest or two for the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-systems-is-dune-awakening-launching-on">What Systems is Dune Awakening Launching On?</h2>



<p>Upon release, Dune Awakening will be available on:</p>



<ul>
<li>PC (Steam)</li>



<li>PlayStation 5</li>



<li>Xbox Series X|S</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-is-dune-awakening-multiplayer">Is Dune Awakening Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>Dune Awakening is an MMO with survival elements. It’s set in a massive, persistent world where players will strive to survive a hostile planet against other players and enemy NPCs while building a House Minor from humble beginnings.</p>



<p>That said, it’s unclear precisely how many players will inhabit each server in Dune Awakening. While the game is billed as an MMO, we’ve found that many developers and players use the term loosely. </p>



<h2 id="h-does-dune-awakening-have-character-customization">Does Dune Awakening Have Character Customization?</h2>



<p>Dune Awakening offers an extensive character creation toolset, with players able to choose a body type, height, skin tone, age, various details (head, eye, nose, etc.), hairstyles, facial tattoos, makeup, and so much more. </p>



<p>From what we’ve seen in the character creation trailer Funcom released in July, the mechanic is rather extensive. You can create a unique character that you’ll shape from nothing to something!</p>

<h2 id="h-is-dune-awakening-cross-platform">Is Dune Awakening Cross-Platform?</h2>



<p>As Dune Awakening will launch simultaneously on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, the question of cross-platform support frequently arises. Unfortunately, Funcom has yet to confirm cross-platform support or crossplay for Dune Awakening. </p>



<p>The tech is certainly there, as so many other games opt for cross-platform support these days, but it’s a matter of Funcom having the resources and know-how to achieve the goal before launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-dune-awakening-free-to-play">Is Dune Awakening Free-to-Play?</h2>



<p>It’s unlikely that Dune Awakening will launch as a free-to-play title. We suspect it will launch at the same price point as Conan Exiles, which sells for $39.99 retail. That said, they may opt for slightly more expensive, considering the overall scope of this project seemingly surpasses their last open-world survival game!</p>

<p>We expect to see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-games-well-see-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quite a few games at Gamescom</a>, and Dune Awakening is one of them. Here’s hoping for gameplay and, at the very least, a release window!</p>

Final Fantasy 16's two DLC expansions, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi-echoes-of-the-fallen">Echoes of the Fallen</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi-the-rising-tide">The Rising Tide</a>, are launching simultaneously on PC, too, but you'll need to pay extra if you want to play them. While it's unclear if the story add-ons can be purchased individually, Square Enix is offering a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/1029295/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Complete Edition"</a> version of the game for $69.99 that comes with the base experience, both DLC expansions, and a few miscellaneous in-game items. Additionally, Square Enix confirmed that a demo is available on Steam and the Epic Games Store now, with any progress made in the demo carrying over to the full build.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Final Fantasy 16 was released in 2023 exclusively for the PS5. Last September, Square Enix confirmed that a Final Fantasy 16 PC port was in the works, which came to the surprise of many as Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-producer-denies-existence-of-pc-version-buy-a-ps5">previously shut down</a> the possibility of it coming to PC, noting players should go buy a PS5 if they wanted to play it. In March, during an interview with Game Informer, Yoshida revealed that the PC port of Final Fantasy 16 was in the "<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-pc-port-final-stages-of-optimization">final stages of optimization</a>" and hinted that the system requirements to run the game would be "somewhat high." </p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-review">our review of Final Fantasy 16</a>, IGN wrote: "Featuring fast, reflex-driven, action-heavy combat, Final Fantasy 16 is certainly a departure from what fans may expect out of a Final Fantasy game, but its excellent story, characters, and world-building are right up there with the best the series has to offer, and the innovative Active Time Lore feature should set a new standard for how lengthy, story-heavy games keep players invested in its world." </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-hands-on-the-evolution-not-revolution-of-a-great-idea<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Lots of portals. Still no cake.</h2></div><section><p>There are few ideas more worthy of a sequel than that which powered Splitgate. Cribbing Aperture Science’s portal tech and loading it into a competitive arena shooter? I mean, c’mon – who the heck wouldn’t want to play that?! But while the first stab at this awesome concept proved too much of a rough draft to keep players’ fickle attentions for long, Splitgate 2 hopes to build on what worked by making modest improvements to the formula. After playing four hours of its fast-paced PvP matches for myself, I think this streamlined sequel stands a much better chance of keeping my attention, even though it seems like it won’t exactly swing for the fences with the kind of significant overhauls one might hope for.</p><p>Most of Splitgate 2’s tweaks are incremental improvements rather than anything revolutionary, but nearly all of the decisions developer 1047 Games has made are welcome changes. Without question the biggest refinement is the addition of character classes in the form of the three playable factions. Aeros is all about mobility, with abilities that keep you moving faster and let you easily restore your health. My personal favorite, Meridian, is a support faction that can reveal enemies through walls for their whole team and manipulate time within an area of effect, so you can do things like shoot and reload faster, but your enemies do so more slowly. Finally, there’s Sabrask, who are brute force bruisers with sticky grenades and deployable protective walls they can shoot through while their opponents can’t.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Splitgate 2 First Reveal Images</h3></div></output><p>None of the factions play all that differently from one another (you’re still always manipulating the battlefield with portals, jetpacking all over the place, and using samey feeling weapons with all three), but the abilities and equipment they each bring into battle are pretty significant, and since they all have quite short cooldowns to boot, that makes them feel pretty distinct despite having a lot in common. Dropping barriers as a Sabrask knucklehead or a time-altering dome as a Meridian agent can have a significant impact on the flow of battle, and encountering a Aeros fighter hopped up on stims and flying through the air at blazing speeds can be extremely bad for your health. It’s also neat that you can customize all three with a handful of different options for your class equipment, a few options for perks that passively augment how your character plays, and more. For example, if you want a more tactical version of the Sabrask faction, you can replace your sticky grenade with a smoke grenade that gives you a different sort of advantage with that class. Or, if you’re like me, you might just want to go into battle with a shotgun to pop out of portals and give the enemy a lead surprise at close range.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The freedom you lose from getting to assign your portal manually is more than worth sacrificing for a simpler and more intuitive experience.</p></div><p>Another fairly big adjustment comes in the form of Splitgate 2’s maps, which are much smaller than its predecessor’s arenas and are more conservative in their placement of surfaces you can place portals on. The original Splitgate’s maps were often too big for the player count and as a result, it took a bit too long to get into the action after each respawn. In Splitgate 2, that’s not a problem at all, and maps on the whole seem to be a lot more thoughtfully planned out. Of course, smaller maps mean there are also more opportunities for spawn killing, and at least a few of my deaths came mere seconds after spawning, which never feels great. The fact that portals only appear in select areas and are way less common than in the last game is also mostly a good thing. Plus, there’s generally less chaos and fewer opportunities for more experienced players to sweat all over newcomers with their portal-based tricks and superior map knowledge, which definitely makes for more welcoming matches. On the other hand, though, it’s a bit of a bummer that there are fewer opportunities to get creative and pull off wild stunts. I’ll probably need more time in the wild with the more prudently placed portal surfaces to say for sure whether this adjustment is for the best.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While factions and map design represent the biggest changes in Splitgate 2, most of the other adjustments are much more minor. One nice update is how your respawn timer works, which grows longer with each death, and can be sped up by having your teammates score kills against the enemy, with each frag reducing it by three seconds. Another is how portal mechanics have been simplified, so instead of having to juggle two separate commands for each part of your portal, your gun is now smart enough to do this automatically based on context. The freedom you lose from getting to assign your portal manually is more than worth sacrificing for a simpler and more intuitive experience. These minor quality of life updates might not be the game-changers one might expect from a sequel, but they definitely help nudge an already rock-solid concept in the right direction.</p><p>The flip side, though, is that so much of Splitgate 2 remains unchanged from the original that I’m genuinely not sure if it’ll be enough of a shot in the arm for this sequel to avoid the fate of its predecessor. From what I can tell, it certainly seems this will be a step up from Splitgate 1, but will it be enough of an improvement to keep my attention? Time will tell.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tactical-breach-wizards-review-breach-and-seer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You might not know them by name, but developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-developer-tips-shared-by-gunpoint-dev-tom-francis">Suspicious Developments</a> has been around the indie scene for quite a while. The creators of <em>Gunpoint</em> and <em>Heat Signature</em> are back with what might just be their best game yet, which is saying a lot since this studio takes risks and isn't afraid to be weird and different.</p>
<p>So for their latest game, <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em>? Like I said, it's definitely weird and different, but also cleverly designed and wildly inventive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-combat.jpg?itok=gk2wk9fC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-combat.jpg?itok=VW6EJeaC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Throwing someone out of a moving train is also an option.</figcaption></figure><h2>Hurling Baddies Out of Windows in <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></h2>
<p>Here's a little lesson on defenestration. Even as an English major, I hadn't heard of this word, but once you learn it, it captures the essence of <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> quite well. To defenestrate someone is to throw them out of a window, which goes to show there truly is a word for everything.</p>
<p>On the surface, one wouldn't put wizards and throwing folks out of windows together, but <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> says otherwise. As a <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/turn-based-tactics">turn-based tactics</a> game, you use the magical powers of your units to move enemies around in strategic ways -- usually involving windows.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-objectives.jpg?itok=LCmLjC_e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-objectives.jpg?itok=lL-Jl1wG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In the absence of windows, there's always alternatives... like hacking the turret here.</figcaption></figure><p>In this regard, the strategic elements of <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> follows the same philosophy as <em>Into the Breach</em>: using abilities to move enemies into positions that put them at a disadvantage or outright dispose of them. You can approach each mission like it's a puzzle and you'll do just fine -- finding how to optimize your strategy and defeat enemies in the least amount of turns is half the fun.</p>
<p>With quite a few missions across a roughly 15 hour campaign, <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em>' employs exceptional level design and combines that with an array of powers that make anything seem possible. Mission objectives are often accompanied by secondary, optional tasks that add a bit more difficulty, and in turn, variety.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-lore-2_0.jpg?itok=OKSTNtAt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-lore-2_0.jpg?itok=cpnKQzDj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm sure you can figure out who the main characters are.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Colorful Cast of Characters in <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></h2>
<p>But the real star of the show are your units themselves. As you progress across <em>Tactical Breach Wizard</em>'s campaign, you'll recruit a few extra members. Once your party is complete, everything comes together and a whole world of possibilities are revealed.</p>
<p>Jen and Zan are the first two units players start with, and this duo starts out a bit underwhelming but become powerhouses as time goes on. Now Jen, she's especially useful when it comes to defenestration, as her abilities push enemy units pretty far. She can even chain together lightning to push around multiple enemies at once, so you can just imagine the possibilities she offers.</p>
<p>Zan, on the other hand, is arguably the most important unit in the game. This multi-talented Navy Seer has the ability to create mirages that distract enemies and even shoot at them later on. The attack with his weird-ass gun/staff hybrid moves enemies a bit, too, so on top of dealing a lot of damage, he can also move people around.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-combat-4.jpg?itok=SevyADGs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-combat-4.jpg?itok=nNsUVhAr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dessa might just be the most fun to play, but that's just my preference.</figcaption></figure><p>His quintessential power is that of foresight, enabling players to make moves <em>before</em> a turn ends and see how solutions play out -- and thankfully, this ability extends to other units even when he's not in a battle. This allows you to commit and experiment, so <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> encourages players to test out different strategies rather than punish you for silly mistakes.</p>
<p>The other units that'll join you are extremely helpful in their own right, like Dessa. She's a necromancer, so she can revive teammates, but don't just think of her as your traditional healer. She has some awesome abilities, like a spell that creates Death's Door that, when you push an enemy into it, they're thrown into the void, never to return. Now <em>that</em> is metal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-combat-2.jpg?itok=Tesd04Yu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-combat-2.jpg?itok=R6dAjl6M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You might not be able to walk from building to building here, but with spells, there is a way.</figcaption></figure><h2>Spells: <em>Tactical Breach Wizards' </em>Tools of the Trade</h2>
<p>Here's how one scenario could play out: use Dessa to put Death's Door on a wall behind another of your units, Dall. Use Dall to swap with an enemy halfway across the map. Now that the enemy is in close range to your other allies, have Zan use a spell to push the enemy into the door and have them removed from combat for good.</p>
<p>Two more characters join you, and it's when all five members of the party are together that <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> shows its full potential. Only a few missions will have all members of the team on at each time and you can't choose, so I would have liked to see them all in action at the same time more often.</p>

I can't begin to imagine the work it took to create levels revolving around so many unique abilities, but they make it work.</p>
<p>Environmental hazards like exploding barrels and electrified walls on top of the copious amount of windows means you can and should take full advantage of the environment around you, especially since enemies become more complex in their own abilities as time goes on. <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> is a game that demands to be broken, and with your teammates, nothing seems impossible.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-dialogue.jpg?itok=ZXRR7x1_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tactical-breach-wizards-dialogue.jpg?itok=yrrkyyDh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Um, okay?</figcaption></figure><h2>Tactical Breach Wizards' is Quirky, Alright</h2>
<p><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> leans pretty hard into the narrative side of things, so it pains me to say it didn't captivate me nearly as much as the gameplay did. There's a lot of back-and-forth dialogue, which in itself is fine<em>, </em>but it has to be intriguing to keep my attention. This is not the case, and in fact, turns out to be more annoying than anything else.</p>
<p>The characters are pretty goofy and quip at one another, so dialogue is definitely more lighthearted and jokey than anything else. Try as <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> might to be humorous, it didn't resonate with me at all. I wanted to like the characters, but some of the things they said to each other were just so unrealistic and weird, it was hard to get over.</p>
<p>The goofy dialogue and the serious content of the story clash with one another. The stakes of the plot are high, so for the characters to be these goofballs the whole time while attempting to stop a giant war feels wrong.</p>

We're throwing enemies out of windows, slinging spells, and knocking explosive barrels into them. That's not something you can just walk away from alive.</p>
<p>Even still, the world-building is admirable, if a bit messy. <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> drops you into the deep end and creates a modern fantasy world where Traffic Warlocks and the Druid Mafia are just everyday things. Some elements of this world can be pretty funny, even if the vast majority of dialogue suffers from too many jokes.</p>

<p>I usually play turn-based tactics games with a controller, but <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> makes that difficult. The Gamepad's joystick moves a mouse cursor on the screen, which is a huge pet peeve of mine. It only ends up making the controller an absolute burden to use.</p>
<p>Using a controller for most tactics games makes things quick and snappy, but it's the exact opposite here. It feels like you're swimming against the current where instead, gamepad should be an easy alternative to mouse and keyboard controls.</p>
<p>It's easy to forgive <em>Tactical Breach Wizard</em>'s shortcomings when the core gameplay itself is so inventive and addicting. It's definitely one of those games where you'll be surprised by your own ingenuity, and <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> encourages you to think outside the box. So go on -- defenestrate to your heart's content!</p>

            <p>Please lock your Chocobos to attack position and set your Phoenix Downs to stun: Square Enix have released fresh details of Final Fantasy 16's PC port, which has now been dated for launch on 17th September. They've also shared a little about why it's taken so long to arrive - the (generally decent) action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> hit PS5 over a year ago, back when I was still some filthy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-review-16-easy-to-like-hard-to-adore">console-playing freelancer</a>.</p>
<p>According to director Hiroshi Takai, it was "impossible" to create the PC and PS5 versions at the same time, even if Square Enix hadn't been restrained by a timed exclusivity clause. He also thinks that the Final Fantasy series faces no "existential risk" right now, despite lower-than-hoped returns from both Final Fantasy 16 and, going by Square Enix's latest financial reports, the more recent and currently PS5-only Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.</p><!--more-->

<p>Final Fantasy has a track record for showing up fashionably late on PC - it took Final Fantasy 7 Remake, first of the FF7 reboots, well over a year to land on Epic Games Store following its PS4 launch. As regards Final Fantasy 16 specifically, Square Enix had to work around a six month exclusivity deal with Sony and PS5 following the initial release in June 2023. Producer Naoki Yoshida has also indulged in a touch of bait-and-switch with journalists, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nobody-said-a-word-about-a-pc-version-says-final-fantasy-16-producer">jocularly denying that Square Enix had ever announced the game for PC</a> at one point. I suspect the uneven communication there has less to do with trolling than with the unpredictable nature of game development.</p>
<p>"The reasons vary for each title, but in the case of FFXVI, it primarily comes down to the original game being tailored for the PS5 in a lot of different ways, and it was impossible to do this at the same time as all the optimization work that was needed for the PC version," Takai told me over email, when I asked why this and other Final Fantasy games tend to arrive later on PC. He was unable to tell me anything about the specifics of the PC version's development, other than that this is the same team who made the original PS5 version.</p>
<p>So what do PC Final Fantasisers get for their patience? For starters, the port will accompany a Complete Edition which includes two DLC packs, Echoes Of The Fallen and The Rising Tide. I haven't played either of those, but they seem reasonably juicy. Echoes Of The Fallen's offerings include a new final dungeon, while Rising Tide packs a new region, an endgame mode and new abilities for this iteration's protagonist Clive Rosefield - "Devil May Clive", as I boisterously call him down the pub, forgetting that all my friends got sick of that joke over Xmas.</p>
<p>Square Enix have also added a bunch of new graphics and performance settings, as you'd expect. "Since PC gamers all have different PCs with different specs, we've provided extensive configuration options to maximize flexibility," Takai told me. "We've increased the frame rate cap to 240fps, and you can choose from various upscaling technologies such as NVIDIA DLSS3, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS." </p>
<p>Argh, so many letters and numbers! Where is hardware editor James to translate? Oh dang, I think he's gone to Gamescom. I feel like Final Fantasy games should have their own bespoke jargon for graphics features, blending third-party terminology with the series own naming conventions. Any PC RPG can boast of supporting upscaling, but only a Final Fantasy game could get away with e.g. Fabula Nova CrystaLSSIII or AMD Fenrir Shiva Ragnarok.</p>
<p>Square Enix have made a big noise about pushing beyond console lately. In May this year, the publishers promised "aggressive" expansion to other platforms, perhaps in light of the fact that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-sales-did-not-meet-high-expectations-says-square-enix-president">FF16 did not meet the company's expectations on PS5</a>. They said they wanted to "win over PC users" especially. With that in mind, I asked Takai whether Square Enix feels the audience for Final Fantasy games differs much between console and PC. "That's a difficult question!" he said, before proceeding to answer it very straightforwardly. </p>
<p>"Honestly, there's not much difference between playing games on PC and consoles these days, so I don't know if there's any real difference when it comes to FF fans," Takai commented. "However, more people have access to a PC, so I'm hoping we can get the game into the hands of a broader audience of gamers with the PC version."</p>
<p>The company have yet to share sales of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, which released on PS5 in February, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sales-drop-year-on-year-despite-release-of-final-fantasy-7-rebirth">they have reported a year-on-year overall game sales drop</a>, offset by relatively steady returns from subscription-based MMO Final Fantasy 14. All this notwithstanding, Takai doesn't think the Final Fantasy series has become unsustainable and in need of a fundamental rethink, not least because Square Enix are always rethinking it.</p>
<p>"While it's always important to balance development costs with sales, I don't think there's any kind of existential risk for the series," he told me. "As developers, we just need to keep creating what we think is fun - and if players think to themselves, 'they went in a new direction this time, but it was still fun', then maybe that's all the dramatic change we need."</p>
<p>If you're curious about FF16 on PC, I've saved the best for last: there's now a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738000/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_DEMO/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/final-fantasy-xvi-demo-c289c2">Epic Games Store</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
