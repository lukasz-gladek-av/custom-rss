            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-tv-4k-streamer-drops-to-new-low-as-amazon-fire-tv-and-roku-streaming-device-deals-heat-up-for-the-super-bowl-2000666210</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If your TV doesn’t offer built-in streaming options and you’re looking to cut the cord, a streamer can be a smart investment. Google’s 4K TV streamer is one of the best options out there, and you can now grab it without paying the full price at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7076/">It typically sits at $80, but you can now snap it up for $100 at the retailer, after a modest 20% drop.</a> The offer applies to both Haze and Porcelain models, so you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics the best. Just note that the offer is selling out fast (as you’d expect), so you don’t really have a lot of time left to save. Grab it before the price shoots back up!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7076/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Popular Streaming Platforms, Plus Live TV Channels</h2>
<p>This streamer sits neatly on your console and comes with a redesigned remote that makes it easy to navigate and access content. It supports voice commands, meaning you can also just speak to find shows, get answers, and control smart home devices.</p>
<p>You’ll enjoy a ton of movies and TV shows from all your services right from your home screen, plus get tailored recommendations based on your viewing habits. Popular streaming apps that come built right in include Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+, Apple TV, and more. Note that most of these require a subscription. If you’re looking to cut back on those, the streamer also gets you live TV, with access to over 800 free channels from Pluto TV, Tubi, and more. What’s even better is that if you find an interesting show or movie on your TV, mobile app, or Google, you can quickly add it to your watchlist and stream when you’re ready in just a few clicks. Additionally, casting content from multiple compatible Android and iOS apps on your phone, tablet, or laptop right to your streamer is possible, too.</p>



<p>Then there’s support for 4K HDR and Dolby Vision, which lets you view both the classics and latest releases in great detail with true-to-life colors. You can also connect external speakers that can support Dolby Atmos for 3D sound. The result? An immersive viewing experience that pulls you into whatever’s playing on the screen.</p>
<p>As for performance, Google has packed the streamer with a 22% faster processor and twice the memory of the previous generation. This translates into smoother navigation and faster app switching. Those with smart home devices will also appreciate how this thing doubles as a hub, making it easy to get things done around the house more conveniently. This can include managing lights, checking camera feed, adjusting temperature, etc.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to stream your favorite shows and movies better, the 4K Google TV Streamer is a top option to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7076/">The current 20% discount makes upgrading a lot more affordable, but the offer won’t be around for long</a>. It’s best to place your orders while the discount is still live to avoid last-minute disappointments!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/moon-studios-arpg-no-rest-for-the-wicked-hits-1-5m-copies-sold-two-weeks-after-hitting-1m/</link>
            <guid>1428079</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ori </strong>developer <strong>Moon Studios</strong> took a big swing with <strong>No Rest for the Wicked</strong>, choosing to make something outside of its 2D platforming comfort zone and instead direct its talents into making an action RPG. After its <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/">initial early access launch in <strong>May 2024</strong></a>, it was clear that the game had a lot of unrealized potential, and the time to realize that potential as an early access game. </p>



<p>Now, over a year and a half later, during which the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-patch/">has seen more than</a> a <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-breach-update-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-lots-of-content/">few significant updates</a>, the most recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-together-co-op-update-gameplay-trailer-moon-studios/">being <strong>a co-op update</strong> that went live last month</a>, it's starting to realize that potential. A little more than <strong>two weeks</strong> after Moon Studios confirmed that the game had sold over <strong>1 million copies</strong>, the developer gave players another sales milestone update: No Rest for the Wicked has officially sold over <strong>1.5 million copies</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>Hey Wicked fans, it's been only <strong>15 days </strong>since our previous 1 million announcement, and already we're happy to make a small correction," </em>the team wrote on the game's Steam page.<em> "Now it's <strong>1.5 million copies sold so far</strong>. We're honestly so happy to see this as a small dev studio doing internal publishing. We want to thank you, our players, for being here with us, whether it's through your amazing support, sharing</em> <em>your love for the game, giving us constructive feedback, patiently waiting for consoles, or cheering us on from the sidelines.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It’s been only 15 days since our 1 million announcement, and we’re incredibly happy to share a small correction:</p><p>We’ve now reached 1.5 MILLION copies sold!</p><p>Thank you all, you’ve been a huge part of this ❤️</p><p>Last day to get 40% off on Steam: <a href="https://t.co/X1teDv5Q4j">https://t.co/X1teDv5Q4j</a> <a href="https://t.co/kc51LM4JRi">pic.twitter.com/kc51LM4JRi</a></p></div>— No Rest for the Wicked (@wickedgame) <a href="https://twitter.com/wickedgame/status/2019078495964459314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>This milestone came just as No Rest for the Wicked closed off a sale where the game was discounted by 40%, and also serves as a means of putting down any fears or concerns<a href="https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/"> that the studio is in any kind of trouble</a>.</p>



<p>Two short years ago, months before Moon Studios would release No Rest for the Wicked, analysts were <a href="https://wccftech.com/games-industry-to-become-even-more-concentrated-pure-play-companies-will-be-challenged-but-hits-like-palworld-will-still-occur/">sharing concerns over how concentrated the industry was becoming</a>, and how it would only become more challenging for smaller studios to make an impact. To see an <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-gets-new-major-update-moon-studios-purchases-publishing-rights-back/">independent studio that's also publishing its own game</a> find success is a positive sign, one that we'll hopefully see repeated with other developers throughout 2026. </p>

            <guid>1428076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every night for the past several weeks, I'd go to bed thinking about <em>Mewgenics</em>. With my eyes closed and my head on the pillow, my mind wouldn't rest; it would play out scenarios from the game automatically, until, eventually, I finally managed to sleep. Even then, I'd start to dream about <em>Mewgenics. </em>This game has consumed me.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Mewgenics</em> is a turn-based, tactical roguelite created by <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/edmund-mcmillen" rel="nofollow">Edmund McMillen</a> and Tyler Glaiel. The former is most known for <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> and <em>Super Meat Boy, </em>but they both co-developed the tough-as-nails platformer <em>The End Is Nigh</em> in 2017. The duo is back with this being their largest and most ambitious game yet.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Don't mess with these kitties.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Pick a Collar, Any Collar</h2><p>This is a multi-faceted game with so many different layers, yet they somehow meld together to create something truly special. We have the breeding mechanics from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/pokemon" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon </em></a>series combined with elements from strategy titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chronicles-review-timeless-classic" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></a> and heck, even <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a><em>. </em>And of course, a good ol' roguelite twist adds even more spice.</p><p>Like any game with McMillen involved, there's a lot more going on than what is initially shown. As you progress throughout <em>Mewgenics</em>, fighting battle after battle and breeding a plethora of super messed up cats, you'll start to see just how deep the rabbit hole goes. If it clicks as it did for me, it will be your life for the next few weeks at the very least.</p><p>But of course, <em>Mewgenics</em> starts out very simple. You're given a group of four cats, and you're tasked with taking them out on runs. Runs start fairly linear by nature, as you're given a path that you must follow (sort of like a linear version of &nbsp;<em>FTL: Faster Than Light)</em>, and each path has a set amount of battles and random events players must engage with.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Spider cats???</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Battles are the bread and butter of <em>Mewgenics</em>. It's a tactics game first and foremost, and while it has a crude and humorous look to it, the mechanics are no joke. Seriously, this might be the most in-depth, fleshed-out, and rich system I've ever come across in a turn-based tactics title, surpassing even that of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/battle-brothers" rel="nofollow"><em>Battle Brothers</em></a>.</p><p>Before each run, you're able to assign a class collar to your cat. In <em>most</em> instances, you can only have one of a certain class, and that determines their role from the start. Each cat has a set of predetermined stats, with attributes like Intelligence affecting mana regeneration and Luck affecting anything chance-based and random.&nbsp;</p><p>Picking a class gives a few bonus points to certain stats befitting the role, while others might take a hit. From there, it's onward to battle! Fights take place on 10x10 grids filled with obstacles and enemies. There's no elevation to take into consideration here like other tactics games, and honestly, there's already so much complexity to <em>Mewgenics</em> that elevation isn't even needed.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Can't go wrong with Healing Aura, I say!</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>A Talented Group of Felines</h2><p>Part of the depth comes from the breadth of abilities each class is privy to. After each battle, a random cat gains a level-up. You'll be able to choose abilities to use in combat, different passives, and also stat increases. Your choice of abilities, passives, and stats is random, so sometimes you have to make do with what you're given, even if it doesn't seem optimal at first.</p><p>Active abilities are diverse and offer a wide range of benefits. The Cleric class, for instance, has several different types of heals to choose from; one is a single-target spell that can be shot from afar, while another allows you to dash long distances and heal an ally.&nbsp;</p><p>My favorite abilities are attributed to the Druid class, which offers various forms to shapeshift into, if you're lucky enough to be offered those on a level-up. You can turn into a tree that's completely stationary, but offers some support abilities; or, my personal favorite, the stag.

</figure>
<p>Combine that with a few other spells, like the ability to give your druid's crow companion an extra turn, and there's a great deal of utility and usefulness derived out of a single unit. Throw passives into the mix, and that's where things get truly crazy.&nbsp;</p><p>The Necromancer class is my favorite in this area, as a lot of passives revolve around minions spawning from either the enemies they kill or from the Necromancer themselves. The Necromancer has a few other ways to just go absolutely crazy, though.&nbsp;</p><p>This class's basic attack is a leech that siphons health from enemies every turn. With a combination of passives and abilities, there's a way to multiply this effect and cause catastrophic damage on enemies, with numbers reaching in the hundreds or even thousands.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>Mind you, most basic enemies don't have a lot of health, with very few reaching upwards of 50. Bosses themselves, while chunky, usually don't have more than several hundred, but this is late in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, <em>Mewgenics</em> is a game you can break, and it encourages you to do so. There is an unprecedented amount of options in this game, in which you're able to absolutely steamroll it if you're lucky enough and build your units right.&nbsp;</p><p>Not to mention the various other ways your cats can become hilariously overpowered. Throughout runs, you'll come across hundreds of different items that affect the behavior of your cats and their abilities. Some items are fairly simple and might give just stat gains, while others have behaviors that can be truly game-changing.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>You can't just hoard items as there is a limited amount of space between each run.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Leaky Brain item, for instance, gives your unit a couple of hits in the intelligence stat, but any mana spent is given to adjacent allies. Another item, the Fly Larva, gives your basic ability "rot" and causes flies to spawn from enemies afflicted with it. As I said, there are so many different items, and I haven't even begun to see probably half of them over 100 hours in.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><em>Mewgenics</em> is a game you can break, and it encourages you to do so.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>With each cat having several different equipment slots, you're able to make freaky little cat super soldiers. One of my favorite passives to use in conjunction with weapon items is duel-wield, which allows Fighters to use their weapon twice in succession. As you might imagine, some weapons can have ludicrously good effects, and this makes a huge difference on the battlefield when used twice.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>The Cost of Battle</h2><p>For all that choosing the right abilities, passives, and items does for you, fighting can be brutal in <em>Mewgenics</em>. Each chapter in each of the three acts have different quirks to the environment and their own set of enemies that come with it. These progressively get harder, continually putting on the pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's talk about the Desert, which might just be one of the most brutal areas in <em>Mewgenics</em> due to its scorching hot sun. In most areas, your units regain some health after combat, but because the cats are dehydrated in the desert, they do <em>not</em> regain health after battle. You can mitigate this in a few creative ways, like with water-based abilities, but sometimes that isn't at your disposal.</p><figure role="group">

<p>There are also spiky cacti that can damage your cats if they're knocked into them, but conversely, you can also knock enemies into the cacti for some bonus damage. As I said, each area has its own quirks, and you're constantly challenged to counteract them with ingenuity and incentivized to take advantage of environmental elements, as well.</p><p>Enemies as a whole, though, are so diverse that I continued to see new ones even 80+ hours in. The Boneyard has a bunch of ghostly enemies that can cause fear or inflict leeches, while The Cave has a bunch of spiders that shoot webs. The Sewers have piles of poop that spawn more little poops, and be sure to look out for those rolling turds. The Sewers also has bloodthirsty sharks, because of course.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Enemies as a whole, though, are so diverse that I continued to see new ones even 80+ hours in.</p></blockquote><p>With such a high number of enemies across all these zones, gameplay might feel a little intimidating or even overwhelming at first. Thankfully, each enemy has a handy tooltip that describes their behaviors, so that is definitely recommended.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>The Chaos of <em>Mewgenics</em></h2><p>Let's throw in random events to stir the pot even more during runs. Random events are, by their very nature, random. You might come across a rotten corpse and... it might be moving? It's filled with insects like flies and grubs. You're usually given a few choices, and in this case, you can eat the corpse, loot it, or examine it. Whatever you choose, it's essentially a die roll, so you'd better hope the outcome is good.</p><p>Fail an event, though, and you're in for some trouble. You might get a cursed item, which, in most cases, cannot be removed. You might even get a parasite or a disorder, which drastically affects your cat in typically adverse and unsavory ways.&nbsp;</p><p>One of my cats became obsessed with eating poop, so they'd rush over and eat any poop close to them at the start of their turn. It just goes to show, you shouldn't eat random piles of poop, who'da thunk?&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>One particularly nasty side-effect from an event gave my cat a nasty case of Cordyceps. You know, the fungus made popular by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/last-of-us-part-ii-review" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a><em>? </em>Well, that cat, he was a lost cause, now with a 30 percent chance to be controlled by the AI every turn. It can actually be frustrating to encounter some of these punishing events and can, unfortunately, derail a run before it even begins.</p><blockquote><p>It just goes to show, you shouldn't eat random piles of poop, who'da thunk?&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>To lose a run means all of your cats are dead and gone for good, which can be very unfortunate since you'll lose almost all of your food, money, and items gained during that run as well. Plus, you can't breed dead cats, so if you come across a string of unfortunate events, <em>despite</em> your cats being well-built... tough luck.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Everything is fine.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I don't disparage <em>Mewgenics</em> for its difficulty, though, as you're able to bounce back fairly quickly. You're given a steady stream of cats, and they breed fast. Food is easy to get during runs, which is needed to feed your cats at home base.&nbsp;</p><p>The best part is, when the randomness of active and passive abilities, items, and events collide, you're met with so many unexpected moments. Abilities and items interact with enemies unpredictably, and there is rarely, if ever, just one way to handle a certain situation or encounter. The unexpected ways in which you can combo all facets of <em>Mewgenic</em>'s gameplay means every run is something to look forward to.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if I lost a run, I'd be ready to jump right back in and learn how I can break the game. The "one more run" mentality has never been stronger in a game for me than <em>Mewgenics</em>, and that's because of all the twists and turns the minute-by-minute gameplay provides.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>What a weird, messed up family.</figcaption>

<h2>Breeding!&nbsp;</h2><p>But of course, I've alluded to breeding a few times now, and that is a <em>huge</em> part of <em>Mewgenics</em>. There's a home base that holds all of your cats -- cats from previous runs, and ones that have yet to embark on an adventure.&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth noting that cats from an adventure become retired and can't be used again. Their stats and abilities, however, can become inheritable and are passed on to the next generation. Thus, at the beginning of <em>Mewgenics</em>, it's the weakest your cats will ever be. With enough time and effort, you'll have dozens of badass little kitties ready to take on the world.</p><p>That also means that any mutations you gain from your adventure are often carried over to their offspring. One of my cats gained a mouth mutation, giving them gills instead. That mutation gives a permanent +2 health regeneration while a cat is wet. Another mutation, for the eye for instance, might give +2 intelligence but -1 luck.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>So some mutations can have negative effects on your stats. Even so, I dedicated a sole room in my house to cultivate the most freaky and abominable cats possible, yielding some very intriguing units to use as a result.&nbsp;</p><p>The depth of this mechanic is as complex as you want it to be, depending on what mutations you think are useful. Put these cats in a room together, and they'll breed more and more. Of course, cats don't always get along, so they might also fight each other (and even kill each other) at the end of the day instead of breed.</p><p>By adding certain items to your house, you can stimulate cats to breed more, be less aggressive, or stay healthier so they don't develop disorders like ADHD. Items are gained either through runs or bought via an NPC, and the usefulness of these cannot be understated enough; the items you use to decorate will directly have an impact on the next crop of cats.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Cats fight, and when they do, it can get bloody. Lethal, even.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can also donate any cat you want to any number of NPCs, giving you various benefits. I donated kittens to an NPC to unlock the Gaydar, which, well, determines if cats are straight, bisexual, or gay. It's actually important to know these things because, if a mutation you like ends up on a gay cat, you might be out of luck getting it to spread.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I dedicated a sole room in my house to cultivate the most freaky and abominable cats possible, yielding some very intriguing units to use as a result.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>My only issue with donating cats is that it's pretty slow-going, and some crucial features are locked behind this. The Gaydar was quite useful, but so too was the ability to determine a cat's demeanor. Meaning, for a while, before unlocking this, you'd be grouping aggressive cats with docile ones without really knowing it.</p><p>The house also becomes crowded quite quickly, so it's difficult to sort through all your cats. There really isn't a great way to filter through them, so I wish there was a streamlined way to pick what cats I wanted for a run. Give me a filter so it highlights the cats I need, rather than having to click through each cat one by one.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Mewgenics </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p>In case you couldn't tell by the screenshots, <em>Mewgenics</em> has a certain aesthetic to it. It's an acquired taste, but I've grown up with Edmund McMillen's art style through his flash games. He goes for a dirty, nasty, unapologetic cartoonish style that features tons of poop and other unsavory bits. A duo of phallic, white fluid-spewing bosses is the tip of the iceberg here.</p><p>Still, I fell in love with all the freaky cats I made and the creative enemy designs. If <em>Mewgenic</em>'s art style is the only thing putting you off, I encourage you to push through it and discover the sheer amount of depth in its mechanics.</p><figure role="group">

<p>There's a robust soundtrack here, too, and it's surprisingly catchy. There are definitely a few very unlikely, weird songs, but dammit all, I can't get them out of my head. A lot of vocal tracks are here, and if you listen to the lyrics, well... they're definitely something else.&nbsp;</p><p>There are some elements to this game that I've deliberately omitted so that you can be surprised just as I was by what <em>Mewgenics</em> offers; even so, if I got you even a little bit interested, I've done my job. After all, <em>Mewgenics </em>is, no doubt in my mind, one of the best tactics games I've ever played, and with even over a hundred hours put into the game, I'm still finding new things and having more fun than I did when I last played it. More sleepless, feline-filled nights, here I come.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Mewgenics</strong> was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the developer over the course of around 100 hours of gameplay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From numerous flash games to<em> </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/super-meat-boy" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Meat Boy</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/binding-of-isaac" rel="nofollow"><em>The Binding of Isaac</em></a>, it's fair to say that developer Edmund McMillen's made an immense impact on the video game industry. So then, it's also fair to say that <em>Mewgenics</em> is shaping up to be another monumental release not just for this critically acclaimed developer, but for games at large.</p><p>To learn more about <em>Mewgenics</em>, which McMillen describes as his "best work," TechRaptor chatted with him about features we can expect in this tactical strategy title, and we also reflect on the game's long developmental journey.</p><h2>The Long Journey of <em>Mewgenics</em></h2><p>If you've followed Edmund McMillen at all in the past, oh, decade, then you've probably heard of <em>Mewgenics</em> at least in passing. Both he and co-developer Tyler Glaiel have made several games since <em>Mewgenics</em>' announcement (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/edmund-mcmillens-end-is-nigh-releases-july-12th" rel="nofollow"><em>The End is Nigh</em></a>, for instance), but this is shaping up to be their biggest title yet.&nbsp;</p><p>"The gameplay loop is essentially breed cats, take them on adventures," said McMillen. "Bring them back, breed them again, and inchworm your way towards a bigger house and a crazier bloodline of cats."</p><p>That's <em>Mewgenics</em> in a nutshell, but there's so much going on under the hood. The very process of cats going on an adventure is highly dangerous; this is, after all, a tactical strategy game, a genre known for its high stakes.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>With that basic understanding of what <em>Mewgenics</em> is, know that it's been through a long and tumultuous developmental cycle. Initially announced in 2012, this one particular game has been on quite the journey.&nbsp;</p><p>"I knew I wanted to make a roguelike," said McMillen, "and I had this idea for a little test, and I wanted to kind of get my feet in the water with roguelike. So before I jumped into <em>Mewgenics</em>, I wanted to make a roguelike game that I thought was going to be really simple, and that was <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>."</p><p>The irony of this statement is that <em>The Binding of Isaac</em> is lauded for its depth, and it's turned into a resounding success. Of course, despite said success, <em>Mewgenics</em> was still on McMillen's mind as he toyed with ideas throughout the years. From his experience developing <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, his intent was to use that knowledge to further develop <em>Mewgenics</em>, though it was still early on.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Yes, breeding is still a core component of <em>Mewgenics</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"So it looked really pleasing, and it was kind of a fun breeding sim," said McMillen, "and outside of that, it was just like collecting furniture to decorate your house with, and then you would use your cats as avatars in minigames, and that was as kind of far as it got, and we did end up working on it for almost two years -- I think it was 18 months, maybe a little under 18 months, and we got as far as showing it at PAX in its barebones form, and shortly after that, it was cancelled out from under me."</p><p>This was all while McMillen worked at the studio he co-founded (and eventually left), Team Meat. McMillen was reluctant to cancel <em>Mewgenics </em>at that time, and it was shelved. Even so, elements from the original <em>Mewgenics </em>were retained. Elements like the vibe and world, characters, and cat breeding are shared between the prototype and the 2026 release.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's still there," said McMillen, "but really, I mean, as you've seen, the meat and potatoes of the game is this sprawling tactical turn-based strategy game, which did not exist in the slightest before."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Some early concepts for gameplay included a <em>Pokemon-</em>style battler, a brawler a la <em>Castle Crashers</em>, and heck, even a <em>Pikmin-</em>like RTS. Even so, the idea of a turn-based strategy game was what both McMillen and Glaiel kept returning to. McMillen says the duo are fans of the genre and connected on having played <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> <em>Advanced</em> when they were younger.&nbsp;</p><p>"I had always wanted to do a game like this, but these kind of games, to make a unique tactical turn-based strategy game... it's a lot of work," said McMillen. "You got to do a lot to go further than what exists there, and going in, we kind of just started playing those old games again and kind of realized that when you go back, your memory fills in a lot of blanks, and there's actually not as much going on as you would think, especially in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chronicles-review-timeless-classic" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></a> games."</p><figure role="group">

<p>McMillen's enjoyed other games in the genre such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/advance-wars" rel="nofollow"><em>Advance Wars</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/15-years-of-fire-emblem-in-west" rel="nofollow"><em>Fire Emblem</em></a>, and even <em>Into the Breach. </em>He likens these games to chess where, "the bigger your brain, the better you do." Conversely, <em>Mewgenics</em> follows a more unexpected source of inspiration: <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>.</p><p>"There's something appealing about <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> that does work for big brain people, and it's because it's odds. It's odds and averages, and you're always leaning in different ways when you're drafting and whatever else, but there's an element of surprise and, I guess, luck with the card draw aspect of the game that shakes things up just enough to make it so it's not a guarantee that the smartest guy in the room is destroying everybody all the time, and it still feels correct and nice."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Eugenics in <em>Mewgenics</em></h2><p>One of the defining characteristics of <em>Mewgenics</em> are mutations. These can manifest in multiple ways: through random events, from breeding, and other unexpected events. Since breeding is a core part of <em>Mewgenics</em>, you're bound to come across some interesting combinations.</p><p>Florian Himsl, co-creator of <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, is an avid cat breeder in <em>Mewgenics</em>. McMillen recalls the craziest cat he's ever seen in <em>Mewgenics </em>and, of course, this monstrosity belonged to Himsl.&nbsp;</p><p>"It wasn't a cat anymore. It was a turtle with a really long neck that had three sets of eyes. So it was like its mouth had eyes. Its eyes were eyes, and its eyebrows were eyes. And then it had an exposed brain. And then it was like shiny and just like the craziest, craziest stuff. And the cool thing is with those cool visuals come cool abilities. So it wasn't just this, oh, it looks cool. It also had the stats of a turtle. It was very defensive, and all of its eyes gave it dodge chance because it could see in all directions, you know what I mean? So it's bonkers."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>With hundreds of different mutations, players can expect to see new things for many hours to come -- and not just with mutations, but with disorders too. In McMillen's most recent run at the time, he came across a cat with narcolepsy.&nbsp;</p><p>"I designed the disorder, but it's not something I ever got to play with," said McMillen. "And narcolepsy is just simply your cat falls asleep at the end of its turn, but whenever you fall asleep, you gain 10 HP and I think seven mana. So it's this big boost to whatever. And the puzzle here is, OK, that's bad because it's skipping a turn. Like every other turn, he's asleep. But how do I work around this? How can I find a way to wake up my cat?"</p><p>This is where the ingenuity of <em>Mewgenics </em>comes into play, where punishment doesn't mean utter defeat. McMillen's Hunter (a class in <em>Mewgenics) </em>shoots a needle that gives the narcoleptic cat thorns, which damages anything that hits the unit.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>"I found ways to basically, when he would wake up, he would just be so, maxed out mana, maxed out HP," said McMillen, "and I could just put him right in the battle, in the middle of all the enemies and all the enemies would attack him, but it doesn't matter because he was never going to die.</p><p>"So while he was sleeping, he's getting pummeled and then he'll wake up and then he'll start barfing -- he had a barf attack -- and he'd have so much mana that he could just puke on everybody and his barf attack was tied to his constitution, so I just drafted around his constitution and that was a lot of fun. So I did it. I had a plan going in and I pivoted mid-run and it worked out for me. And those are the sort of things that as you play for a really long time, you'll really appreciate."</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Flash Games and Beyond</h2><p>McMillen and Glaiel both were avid Adobe Flash game developers back in the day. <em>Meat Boy</em> and its subsequent level pack came years before the indie darling that is <em>Super Meat Boy.</em> To that end, we wanted to hear more about McMillen's thoughts on developing for that platform back in its heyday.</p><p>"I do miss the instant gratification of making a small-form, quick game," said McMillen, "and I would like to definitely do that in the future, but I don't even know, the way I think about future stuff is like... right now, who knows if I'll even make another game.</p><p>"I might just work on <em>Mewgenics </em>DLC for the next five years and just kick back and do whatever else. I'm gonna go with whatever moves me and whatever feels right at the time. I'm going to try not to plan and just let it happen."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Though Adobe Flash is technically dead, it still has its uses. You might be surprised to learn that all of McMillen's hand-drawn art in <em>Mewgenics </em>(you can tell it's done by him if it has thick lines), are created in Flash and then exported over.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're just not using the engine at all, it's just Vector art from Flash that's being imported from SWFs, so all the animation and all that stuff, it's all in FLA files, it's all SWF files." He adds: "There are action script calls that we use; we utilize Flash as much as possible, but it's just an art tool for this."</p><picture>

  </picture><p>While writing this article, some interesting news came out: Adobe was <a href="https://community.adobe.com/announcements-539/adobe-animate-end-of-life-and-support-timeline-1548220" rel="nofollow">discontinuing support</a> for Adobe Animate, the program that is essentially Adobe's successor to Flash. This caused quite a bit of uproar amongst game developers utilizing this tool.</p><p>Both McMillen and Glaiel use Animate extensively, so for Adobe to discontinue such a service has massive repercussions. Glaiel's custom engine for <em>Mewgenics</em> ingests the aforementioned SWF files for art assets, which is why it's important to the game; the game does not <em>run</em> on Flash/Animate itself.</p><p>Glaiel was available for comment at the time, so we reached out to him to understand the importance of Adobe Animate, despite the company's insistence on discontinuing support:</p><blockquote><p>"We use Animate (aka Flash) for the art and animation in [Mewgenics]. Flash is more than JUST an animation program, it was a multimedia program, capable of doing a whole lot of things and working in a very unique way that basically has no alternatives. The particular way you can organize assets in it is core to how <em>Mew</em>'s art style functions (piecing together cats out of pieces, heavy use of randomization within art assets, etc, while also exporting to a format that retains the raw vectors and animations instead of flattening it out) which is also core to the main gameplay mechanic of the game (breeding these cat pieces). - Tyler Glaiel&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Later that evening on Feb 3, Adobe decided to roll back its plans to discontinue the product, though it wasn't without great uproar. For now, in a Tweet, Mike Chambers from the Adobe Community team relayed that Animate is now in what is called "<a href="https://x.com/mesh/status/2018812283158470726" rel="nofollow">maintenance mode</a>," implying support will continue, but new features are not planned at this time.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Looking Into Both the Past and Future</h2><p><em>Mewgenics</em> has had quite the journey from its start in 2012, to its cancellation, to its resumed development once more. Now, in 2026, we're finally getting <em>Mewgenics</em>, and a lot has changed for McMillen since then.</p><p>McMillen is a father, and his youngest, a five-year-old daughter, has <em>only</em> known him as working on this game. As for Edmund McMillen as a game designer? He's feeling pretty darn confident about his work, and it took years to get to this point.</p><p>"I think I'm much better at this point," said McMillen. "I got a few failures under my belt, and I think I learned a lot from those failures. I think I grew as a designer and have a better understanding of what to do and what not to do. I've learned a great deal over these years. I think I've discovered how to have fun more with a project and how to entertain myself throughout it.</p><p>"I don't know, that's really the culmination of everything. <em>Mewgenics</em> really is, like, I think it's my best work. It's what I poured most of myself into, which is saying something, because <em>Binding of Isaac</em> was that game for me for so long, but I feel like this has eclipsed that."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/edmund-mcmillen-talks-mewgenics-development-journey-turtle-cats-and-adobe-flash]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>Much of the United States experienced one of the worst snowstorms in a minute over the past few weeks. For some regions, it meant piles and piles of snow. For others, it meant one-in-a-lifetime temperatures that had you dripping faucets and praying for the best. </em></p><p><em>And for some, it was both!</em></p><p><em>Rob and Patrick experienced different versions of this recent winter sweep, though one thing the both of them had in common was, albeit very different reasons, making the poor decision to decide to try and drive through a blizzard and experiencing consequences.</em></p><p><em>Both wives were upset.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>A few weeks back, you mentioned a good letter series for us might be about preparing for a snowstorm. I virtually nodded, believing that, of course, there’d be much for me to discuss.</p><p>Such as…honestly, I don’t have a good answer. The weather was awful in spurts the past few weeks—piles of snow to manage, one day where the temperature with wind chill was something like negative 40—but outside of some groceries delivered a day in advance, it was pretty normal? We didn’t go to the store and stock up, a la COVID, on supplies like we’d never see daylight again? We get snow in Illinois but it’s rarely of the catastrophic variety. The local and state infrastructure to deal with worse-than-normal inclement weather is such that, so long as you’re not actively trying to drive through a potential death trap while it’s unfolding, you’ll be fine.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the weather that whipped through here was different than yours. By all accounts the snow you were dealing with was more of a pile on. Be honest, Rob. Do you take the threat of a snowstorm not as a warning—but a blessing to be given permission to load up and hibernate?</p><p>There have been moments in the past. A snowstorm knocked out power for longer than 24 hours just after our oldest was born. We stuck it out for a night before getting worried about the thermostat continuing to drop as we entered the second day, deciding to spend the next 24 at my mom’s. Sometime in the midst of that day, my signal that the power came back on was not a notice from the power company, but my phone informing me that I could control my lights again.</p><p>More recently, I was in Wisconsin over Thanksgiving when a mild amount of snow became a concerning amount of snow. Not a major worry for anyone in a well-stocked house, but the parts of Wisconsin I frequent are not near major cities. You’re talking smaller areas with more limited snow responses. Your road <em>will</em> get plowed and salted—but not before the major veins, such as they are, are accounted for first. That might take hours, could take half a day. And if the snow keeps coming down <em>after</em> that plow comes through? Well, again, it’s back to waiting again.</p><p>On this occasion, I had to deliver a check. With a friend or family, you could wait. But in this case, we’d bought something notable from a local and by the tone of their text message, they were hopeful to get that check despite the snow. And so I went out in the snowstorm, hugging the right side of the road and going well below the speed limit. My car has very new all-weather tires, but they are not specifically <em>snow</em> tires. The drive there, where you’re maneuvering up a series of tiny hills that curve around a lake dotted with bajillion dollar houses, was slow but fine.</p><p>What one acutely realizes on the way back is those tiny hills curving around the lake added up and become quite the elevation change on the way <em>down</em>, a descent into a road that has not been well plowed or salted. A road that, as you begin to tap on the break with your all-weather tires, you feel it…slip. It can’t establish a grip with the road. It’s at this moment you look in front of you and realize that, were you to <em>keep</em> slipping, it would be a slow motion wreck off the side of a tiny cliff. Would you survive this tiny cliff? Well, probably so. But would you want to chance the tiny cliff? Probably not. Thankfully, my tires kicked in, I slowed to 5MPH, and made it back.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@zacdurant?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Zac Durant</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>You know, my driving instincts were humbled the day the storm started. MK and I were out at the audio shop listening to a few different DACs, and we were delighted when we saw postcard-perfect snowfall outside the windows. We enjoyed the pure cozy vibes while we listened to the same five music tracks on three different setups, then it was time to go.</p><p>My car has all-wheel drive and good (though damage-prone) all-season tires. It is ridiculously surefooted in most conditions. So I wasn't too troubled by all the fresh, slushy powder that had been dumped on the ground. I even laughed when we saw some Chevy SUV limping down a street after it had <em>clearly </em>just skidded out on the gentlest hill imaginable. We had no such trouble, and while I could feel the traction control working overtime and the car fishtailing ever so slightly, it wasn't alarming. Until we came to a stop sign. I flicked a quick left and hit the gas… and the car <em>completely </em>broke traction. Just slid to the right at like 3 MPH, heading toward a telephone pole. Fortunately the rear quarter panel tapped a snowdrift from the last snow storm and that checked our momentum enough for the car to get back under control.</p><p>I was much more cautious when we reached the turn to get back onto our street. Didn't matter: again the car shimmied and lurched wildly until it came to a halt. It had basically made its entire 90-degree turn by spinning in place.</p><p>MK, who used to drive a lot around rural Michigan, was unsurprised. She was like, "You're used to winter driving, but you're used to doing it on 41 through Wisconsin or driving around Boston where they salt like crazy. You're not used to a place where your roads are low-priority for the plows. You have no idea how bad the roads can really get."&nbsp;</p><p>Which was a generous way of saying, "I forgive you for nearly putting me into a telephone pole you fucking idiot."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If smart sunglasses have been sitting on your tech wish list, this might be the moment to finally make the jump. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7075/">Amazon is currently offering the first-generation Oakley Meta Smart Glasses at a 15% discount, bringing the price down from $449 to $382</a>. That $67 savings makes these futuristic frames far more tempting, especially for anyone hunting for a standout gadget or a gift that feels genuinely different.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7075/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tech and Style Come Together As One</h2>
<p>At first glance, the Oakley Meta Smart Glasses look like classic Oakley eyewear, but there’s a surprising amount of technology packed into the frames. Meta AI is integrated directly into the glasses, working alongside an HD ultra-wide 12MPl camera and built-in five-microphone array. Together, they let you capture photos and videos either by tapping or completely hands-free, using simple voice commands. You can also ask questions about what you’re looking at, save bits of information for later, or scan a QR code just by glancing at it.</p>
<p>Built-in open-ear speakers deliver clear sound without blocking out your surroundings. Spotify, Amazon Music, and Apple Music connect seamlessly, so playlists and podcasts are always within reach. Calls sound natural on both ends. A quick double-tap on the frame lets you switch between your phone’s front camera and the camera in the glasses, giving callers a live view of your perspective. Voice commands also handle calls, texts, and voice messages across apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, keeping your phone in your pocket.</p>



<p>One of the more impressive additions is real-time language translation. Conversations across languages happen naturally, even if you only speak your native tongue. Support currently includes English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, and Portuguese, with more languages planned. All of this works locally, so Wi-Fi isn’t required to keep the feature running.</p>
<p>Battery life holds up well for daily wear. The glasses last up to eight hours on a single charge, while the included charging case extends total usage to 48 hours. Pairing them with a smartphone unlocks the Meta View app, where photos, videos, voice controls, and system settings are easily managed.</p>
<p>Style hasn’t been overlooked either.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprise! <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/highguard"><u>Highguard</u></a> has another "heaping pile of fresh, free content" for you, including a new warden, map, a ranked mode, mount, and a variety of QoL tweaks, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new free-to-play PvP raid shooter hailing from some of the creators of Respawn's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/apex-legends"><u>Apex Legends</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/titanfall"><u>Titanfall</u></a> only released a couple of weeks ago, but that hasn't stopped developer Wildlight from dropping a second "major update" in as many weeks, this time introducing Episode 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New warden Ekon is described as a legendary monster-slayer who shapeshifts into a powerful direwolf to track and hunt his prey. The last of a long line of ancient magic wielders known as the Wildwalkers, once thought extinct, Ekon jumps into action when his mentor, and closest thing to family, goes missing in the lost land of Highguard.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">His passive ability, Dread, reveals the heartbeat of wounded enemies, and their heartbeats will continue to be visible until they are dead or regen their health. His tactical, Wolf Spirit, lets you hunt the nearest enemy and apply Dread — even across long distances and through walls and rocks — and ultimate ability Wolf Form sees him turn into a powerful direwolf that can track and hunt mounted enemies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the new map Skydrift? Coming to the 3v3 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/just-4-days-after-launch-highguard-gets-5v5-limited-time-game-mode-to-counter-those-3v3-complaints"><u>now permanent 5v5 rotation</u></a>, wardens can navigate through hollowed-out caverns once home to great winged-beasts, spar off against one another in an ancient ring of stone, and ride across huge chain bridges and through "remarkable Sky Jumpers to reach Skydrifts highest point — a palace above the clouds." The full notes are included below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Highguard Episode 2 Patch Notes — Out February 6</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">A NEW WARDEN ARRIVES — EKON</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A legendary monster-slayer who shapeshifts into a powerful direwolf to track and hunt his prey. Ekon is the last of a long line of ancient magic wielders known as the Wildwalkers, once thought extinct. When his mentor, and closest thing to family, goes missing in the lost land of Highguard, there is no monster or warden this great predator will allow to stand in his way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dread (Passive)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reveal the heartbeat of wounded enemies. Once an enemy Warden is low health, they are highlighted in pulsing beats until they are dead, or their health regenerates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wolf Spirit (Tactical)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unleash a spirit wolf to hunt the nearest enemy and apply Dread. This Wolf Spirit travels long distances, moving straight through rocks and structures to find its prey. If seen in time, it can be shot down. This ability can be cast in human form, or in Wolf form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fearsome Howl (Ultimate)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apply Dread to all enemies across the map and increase your movement speed. This ability can be cast in human form, or in Wolf form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wolf Form</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ekon doesn’t ride an animal into battle, he becomes one — transforming into a powerful direwolf that tracks, hunts, and runs down mounted enemies. While in this form, Ekon’s speed is unmatched by other mounts. Through a full third-person point of view, the direwolf can see around cover. When moving in for an attack, weapons are laid down in favor of Ekon’s deadly bite attack, which will dash forward and bite a prey before immediately transforming back to human form to finish off the job. Attacking without a target will allow Ekon to perform a small air dash to traverse maps more athletically. In addition, while in Wolf Form, Ekon can track an enemy’s scent that they leave in their path. Ekon can use all of his other powers while in Wolf Form.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">A NEW LOCATION IS DISCOVERED — SKYDRIFT</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Far west of Headwall, beyond the vast, uncharted lands of Highguard where the maps go blank and expeditions go missing lies the fabled lost city of Skydrift recently awakened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wardens can navigate through hollowed out caverns once home to great winged-beasts, spar off against one another in an ancient ring of stone, and ride across colossal chain bridges and through remarkable Sky Jumpers to reach Skydrifts highest point - a palace above the clouds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skydrift is added to the map rotation in 3v3 and 5v5.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER — RANKED MODE</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gain Ranked Points (RP), earn point modifiers and climb the ranks to claim your rewards. Go from Bronze (Hare) to Grandmaster (Leviathan) if you’ve got what it takes! Visit the Headwall menu in game to see more information.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ranked Structure</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>The format for Ranked is 3v3</li><li>We believe 3v3 is the more tactical structure of the game and fits best for comp. We will monitor feedback as we get it.</li><li>Each episode will have 2 Ranked Splits. Splits will change the map and base list, and introduce some balance changes.</li><li>All players start Ranked for the first time in Bronze 3.</li><li>Each Rank has 3 Divisions.</li><li>There are 7 Ranks</li><li>Bronze (Hare)</li><li>Silver (Goat)</li><li>Gold (Ape)</li><li>Platinum (Dire Wolf)</li><li>Diamond (Gryphon)</li><li>Master (Manticore)</li><li>Grandmaster (Leviathan)</li><li>At the end of each Episode, you will be rewarded based on the Rank you achieved at the end of the Episode.</li><li>De-Ranking: You can only de-rank inside a Division during a Split. For example, by losing matches you can de-rank from Gold 2 into Gold 3, but you cannot de-rank from Gold 3 into Silver 1.</li><li>At the start of every Split, you will not de-rank at all. At the start of every Episode, you will move backwards 6 Divisions (2 full Ranks)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fairness</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Play with teammates up to 2 tiers difference</li><li>A two person party must be within +/- 1 tier of each other</li><li>A full party of 3 can mix any ranks and be able to play. You will queue into the Rank of the top Ranked player.</li><li>Solo Bonus: If you’re playing without a party, you’ll earn the Solo modifier (details below). You’ll gain more points and lose less per match.</li><li>Loss Protection: You accrue loss protection for playing matches all the way through. It will get automatically spent to stop you from losing RP.</li><li>Early Leaver Penalty is more severe in Ranked. Leaving early counts as 2 strikes and resets your Loss Protection.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Scoring System</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We think if you win big, you should score big.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Victory has 3 versions, before the modifiers are applied.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Overwhelming Victory: 25 RP</li><li>This is winning with 100% base health remaining</li><li>Victory: 20 RP</li><li>This is standard victory where each team was more evenly matched</li><li>Close Victory: 15 RP</li><li>This is winning where your base had 35% base health or less remaining</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">For defeat:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Defeat: -25 RP</li><li>If you lost without doing damage to the enemy team.</li><li>Strong Defense: -20 RP</li><li>If you lost, but had done some damage to the enemy team.</li><li>Close Defeat: -15 RP</li><li>If you lost, but had done at least 65% damage to the enemy team.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Other modifiers:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Winning Streak Bonus: adds 3 RP for each win in a row, up to 6 extra points per game.</li><li>Kill Bonus: Earn extra RP for kills, up to a cap of 5 points per game.</li><li>Solo Bonus: Always earn an extra 4 points if queuing up solo.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Imbalance Protection</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>If a game is deemed imbalance by player ranks:</li><li>The favored team will have less points to win and more points to lose</li><li>The weaker team will have increased points to win, and less points to lose</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Requirements</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>In order to unlock Ranked Mode, you must Win 10 matches of 3v3 Raid Mode.</li><li>This is retroactive. If you’ve already won 10 matches in Episode 1, Ranked Mode will be unlocked immediately.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Maps</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Ranked Mode playlist will have a subset of maps and bases per Split.</li><li>We will change the list every split to keep the rotation interesting, but allow time to build consistent strategies.</li><li>The first Split will have maps Kingdom, Summit and Rivermark, and bases Hellmouth, Smuggler’s Den, King’s Lair, Soul Well, Frosthold and Wellspring.</li><li>As more bases get added to the game, we think having a total of 6 bases in Ranked allows players to master certain bases and build competitive strategies over a Split, but still need to master more than 1 base because your first pick won’t always be available.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Rewards</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Episodic Reward: Ranked players will earn a brand new cosmetic item called Banner Frames.</li><li>You will be awarded the Frame that matches the Rank you achieved in the Episode.</li><li>Frames grow in prestige at higher Ranks!</li><li>Every Episode will earn a new themed Banner Frame. This Episode’s theme is Ekon and the Wolf and will be awarded at the start of Episode 3.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">A NEW BEAST HAS BEEN TAMED — WOLF MOUNT</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">WOLF</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Loyal pack hunter of the wild. The new wolf mount is free to all players.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Try Ranked Challenge: Play 10 matches of Ranked to earn the Shadow Wolf skin.</li></ul><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/c6a8ae1785573990d2bbdeb0f141fc7c431006a8-1770382953019.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">GEAR UP PHASE UPDATES</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One consistent point of feedback we’ve heard is that the Gear Phase needs improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re tackling that in 4 ways for the launch of Episode 2, and we’ll continue to work on that phase in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Better POI Loot</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Weapon Chests in POIs now contain Masterwork weapons.Masterwork weapons have improved stats within their rarity. Blue Masterworks are better than Blues, but still less quality than Purple. Players can still loot upgraded weapons outside of POIs, but the Masterwork versions of weapons each round are only found in POIs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ultimate Chargers</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">These items are found in white barrels in POIs, but we’ve seen that players are having a hard time identifying that. In order to make that clear, white barrels that contain Ultimate Chargers now have an obvious gold glow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Waypoint Markers</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you leave your base in the gear phase, waypoint icons will guide players towards the Points of Interest. They’re also pingable so players can communicate intent without voice comms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The map will also communicate that POIs contain Masterwork Weapons and Ultimate Chargers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Speed Gates</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speed Gates are always on when a player is near them, instead of only when a Shieldbreaker is present. This should allow players to get back to fights after respawning,</p><h2 data-cy="title2">QUALITY OF LIFE &amp; NEW FEATURES</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As we continue to improve the game through feedback, bug fixing and small features, we will document them here. When necessary, we’ll use “dev notes” to give context on why we made a specific change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Stats 1.0</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players want stats! For Episode 2 we have added a Stats menu to Headwall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The stats tracked here are mostly retroactive from Episode 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raid Attack and Defense success stats are new for Episode 2, as we are just now starting to track these stats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We will continue to expand this feature in future episodes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Orange Weapon Mods:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We will continue to mix up orange weapon mods. For Episode 2, we are adding variety and not removing anything.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Saber Rifle - Impact Rounds</li><li>Increased critical damage (headshots) with a slower rate of fire. Fires a two shot burst instead of three. Faster projectile speed.</li><li>Vanguard - Drum Magazine</li><li>Much larger magazine, with a slower reload.</li><li>Corsair - Doubleshot</li><li>Fire a 12 round burst on each trigger pull</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Technical Updates</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>From the last patch, performance optimizations were applied to player replication, movement netcode, and siege tower rendering.</li><li>Users can now enable NVIDIA Reflex on supported systems.</li><li>Several optimizations were added to reduce bandwidth utilization.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gameplay Updates:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Defensive Phase at the start of the game has been reduced to 30 seconds from 60.</li><li>Anchor Stones fuse timers have been increased to 80 seconds from 60.</li><li>Dev note: The goal here is to make Anchor Stones a bit harder to win on</li><li>We’ve added your Kills and Assists to the HUD above the minimap.</li><li>Many zipline usability improvements, including smoother attaching and riding, and making it harder to accidentally attach</li><li>Players can now have a maximum of 4 ziplines. When casting the 5th, their first one will automatically destroy</li><li>Improvements to mantle feel</li><li>You will be prompted to drop the BigRig when it gets to low or zero ammo</li><li>Upon being revived, you now get a hint to tap the emote button to say "Thank You".

TTK is nearly equivalent. This just reduces the number of bullets required to kill</li><li>Increased headshot multiplier</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Longhorn</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Repeater - Less vertical kick, faster raise time, faster sprint raise time, less spread (hipfire), slower spread bloom (hipfire)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Viper - Impact Rounds</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Smaller mag size</li><li>More kick</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Item Updates:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Amulet: Bomb Kit</li><li>Bomb plant time nerfed (2.5s -&gt; 3s).

During our chat, we learned more about how the surprise hit video game, which has sold over 12 million copies since going on sale in October, has impacted its team and how it will continue to affect them in the months ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Söderlund acknowledged the “unfortunate” reality that mass layoffs have rocked the video game industry for the last two years. It’s marked a period of uncertainty for developers of every shape and size, but for Embark, Arc Raiders’ popularity among gamers across PC and consoles means safety – and even room for growth – for at least a while.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can live for a long time on the money that Arc Raiders has been generating, and that does give financial security and employment stability for the people that work there,” he said. “We're growing our studio, we're hiring people, we want to build more of Arc Raiders, we want to build more of The Finals.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S priced $40 on October 30, 2025, and follows the team’s 2023 multiplayer shooter, The Finals. At <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-keeps-on-going-as-it-tops-124-million-copies-sold-gifts-all-players-a-gilded-pickaxe"><u>12.4 million copies sold as of January 13</u></a> and an all-time concurrent player peak of 481,996 on Steam (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>), the success of Arc Raiders should also help Embark as it continues work on two new, unannounced games. What those look like or when they will release remains unclear for now, but Söderlund and the rest of the team show no signs of slowing down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For us, it's a sigh of relief, obviously for any developer, and we're incredibly happy for that and thankful for everyone that's been supporting us by buying the game,” he added. “It feels great. Obviously, hopefully, we can have competitive salaries, good bonuses for the people that have done all this hard work and deserve to be taken care of adequately.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/06/gettyimages-970613588-1770382431157.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Patrick Söderlund says the huge success of Arc Raiders changes the game for Embark.

Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stockholm-based developer hasn’t officially confirmed the exact budget for Arc Raiders, nor has it said how much it’s profited since its October launch (quick maths tells us 12.4 million sales is approximately $500 million in revenue, but it could now be much more). Meanwhile, industry analyst <a href="https://youtu.be/58P5sZJ3Vho?si=RxoryJwAVJ0V5vt8&amp;t=677" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Michael Pachter recently claimed</u></a> the project was made on a $75 million budget (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-budget-was-75-million-its-claimed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Insider Gaming</u></a>). Söderlund wasn’t willing to talk specifics but told us that number is “not too far off.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders is currently in the “Shrouded Sky” portion of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026"><u>its early 2026 roadmap</u></a>, with Embark telling fans to expect a new map condition, new Arc threat, new Raider Deck, and more.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/making-hbo-baldurs-gate-3-tv-series-without-larians-help-would-be-a-big-mistake</link>
            <guid>1428040</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">It was recently revealed that a live-action adaptation of Larian’s award-winning RPG, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-tv-series-set-for-hbo-will-be-a-continuation-of-baldurs-gate-3s-story"><u>Baldur’s Gate 3, is on the way from prestige TV makers HBO</u></a>. It somewhat makes sense at first glance — you can see the Game of Thrones of it all weaving into Baldur’s Gate’s DNA, which itself isn’t shy of a fair helping of shedding both blood and clothes. But look a little closer, and the worries begin. Not necessarily when considering Craig Mazin’s involvement (we’ll get to that later) but when noticing that, apparently, Larian will play no significant role in the show’s development. A decision I can’t help but feel would be a big mistake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get into why Larian is so essential to a show that dares to continue the story of Baldur’s Gate 3, it’s important to establish that the Belgian video game studio does not own the rights to the game’s universe, characters, or storylines. Baldur’s Gate 3 is set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and so is the intellectual property of Wizards of the Coast, the Hasbro-owned tabletop RPG company. Larian’s partnership with Hasbro is over, and so Wizards can do whatever it wants with the likes of Shadowheart, Astarion, Gale, and company – whether that’s another game or, in this case, a TV show. Larian has no legal right to be involved. But that’s not to say its involvement doesn’t make sense, both in terms of simple respect for the studio’s work, and making the most of its unrivalled, extensive knowledge of Baldur’s Gate 3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the show’s announcement, Larian’s director of publishing, Michael Douse, posted his thoughts on X. “I've spent the last 8 to 10 years of my life with the writers &amp; creators of Baldur's Gate 3, and they're the most incredible storytellers &amp; creators in the space,” he said. “Only hope is that they get both the credit deserved &amp; the characters are represented at the same level as the game”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, fans immediately took to social media to question members of Larian about the project. When asked if any of the game’s writers l would be involved in the show, Baldur’s Gate 3’s director and CEO of Larian Studios, Swen Vincke, confirmed that they’re not. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Not to my knowledge. But Craig did reach out to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us. From the conversation we had, I think he truely is a big fan which gives me hope.</p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019648134645957061?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 6, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Not to my knowledge,” he said. “But Craig [Mazin] did reach out to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us. From the conversation we had, I think he truely [sic] is a big fan which gives me hope”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it seems no one from Larian, at least at this stage, will be involved in the production process, it is encouraging to see that Mazin will consult with the studio. But is this really enough? This is a studio that reignited a world, turned a cult-classic CRPG series into one of gaming’s great phenomena, and I can’t help but feel that a little more than a handful of studio visits may be required for the show to make anywhere near as big a footprint on our culture. We do know that, according to the original report on the show’s announcement by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Deadline</u></a>, Mazin wants to reach out to the game’s beloved cast to sound out how best to approach their roles in the TV show, and if they'd want to be involved. This is another smart step towards recapturing the magic of the game, but it will be interesting to see how those actors react to being asked to speak someone else’s words – and their feelings on the very real potential of their starring roles being given to more prolific TV and film actors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I genuinely don't think anyone can trump our writers”, Douse goes on to add. It’s a sentiment I agree with; no one knows those characters or that particular corner of Wizards of the Coast’s world quite like the narrative team at Larian. But, I also don’t think the game’s writers absolutely have to be part of the show’s writers room — crafting stories for video games and television are completely different arts, after all. I do, however, think that the show could do with a steady hand with first-hand experience of the tales Larian told to help steer the ship.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t to say I have no faith in Craig Mazin. Chernobyl is one of the finest pieces of television this century, and his contribution to HBO’s interpretation of The Last of Us was certainly successful in its first season, even if the jury is definitely still out on its much more divisive season two and whatever becomes of its next chapter. But the adaptation of Naughty Dog’s post-apocalyptic tale crucially had a strong connection to the games at the top of its call sheet: Neil Druckmann. Though the co-creator has since left the show to focus on future games, there’s no denying that his presence on HBO’s The Last of Us helped keep it tied to the vision and philosophy of the games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A similar point can be made regarding the highly successful Fallout TV series on Prime Video. Again, a name synonymous with the games was there to root the show in the very detailed canon of such a unique apocalyptic world: Todd Howard. Indeed, Fallout may be a much more appropriate comparison to what HBO is trying to achieve with its Baldur’s Gate show, as Mazin’s project is not attempting to recreate a story one-to-one, but further building out a universe that players already love, while throwing in familiar faces and places along the way. Fallout successfully manages to tell its own story, but also gleefully expands on and references existing lore to great effect. That is, presumably, what the Baldur’s Gate show hopes to achieve, too. </p><p>Don’t let the magic those teams concocted over the past decade disappear into the air – there’s simply no need to create it all from scratch once again.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t think there’s much doubt that both The Last of Us and Fallout have been two of the most successful attempts at translating a video game world to the small screen, so it just makes sense to me to follow that established blueprint and consult Larian on what makes its world so special. I have no doubt that Mazin is a huge fan, and he can certainly write top-tier television, but in order to make sure that this continuation of Baldur’s Gate 3’s story holds the same magic as the genre-defining RPG does, it would be foolish to not involve the Belgian studio in some way. Don’t let the magic those teams concocted over the past decade disappear into the air – there’s simply no need to create it all from scratch once again.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Don't abandon hope, but do expect the world. That's the job.</p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/2019573832520982563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 6, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Don’t abandon hope, but do expect the world. That’s the job”, are Douse’s final words, at least for now, on the announcement. And they ring true. Larian has set the bar incredibly high when it comes to telling stories in this world, and it would certainly be a risky dice roll from HBO to proceed without the modifier of the studio being there to help guide the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Time will only tell, though, on how much Larian ends up being involved in the Baldur’s Gate show. But with Mazin still gearing up to start shooting the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-certainly-seems-that-way-hbo-boss-gives-clearest-indication-yet-that-the-last-of-us-will-end-with-season-3"><u>third, and now likely final, season of The Last of Us</u></a>, it certainly seems we’re a few years away from knowing how successfully it will follow in the footsteps of the game. For now, I live in hope. But then again, I’m somewhat of a doomed optimist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

Craig Mazin, who created HBO shows Chernobyl and The Last of Us, is in place as showrunner (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-certainly-seems-that-way-hbo-boss-gives-clearest-indication-yet-that-the-last-of-us-will-end-with-season-3">it sounds like The Last of Us will end with Season 3</a>, which now makes a lot of sense). Chris Perkins, the former longtime Head of Story at Hasbro subsidiary Wizards of the Coast, which owns the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe in which Baldur’s Gate 3 is set, will serve as consultant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say the internet has reacted strongly to the news, and from what I can see much of that reaction is a mix of disbelief and concern. Most can’t fathom why anyone would want to continue on from the events of Baldur’s Gate 3 itself, given its many different endings, variances in world state, and, most importantly, the vastly different outcomes for characters such as Astarion, Karlach, and Shadowheart.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also significant concern at the fact that Larian, the developer of Baldur’s Gate 3, is not consulting on the show. This was confirmed in a <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019648134645957061" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a> from Larian boss Swen Vincke, who went on to say that Mazin has asked to visit the developer for a chat. “From the conversation we had, I think he truly is a big fan which gives me hope,” Vincke said, perhaps diplomatically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019646146587525143" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went on to offer his thoughts on the show</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Crazy that a story that started out in a small hotel conference room eventually evolved into a narrative inspiring enough for it to become a HBO series,” he said. “We worked incredibly hard on making Baldur's Gate 3 worthy of its legacy. Its characters and narratives are the result of many teams working together and I think I can speak for them all in saying that they'll think this is cool and hope that what comes next will enjoy the same level of passion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventures. There's plenty of directions they could go. I'm eager to find out which ones Craig and his team will pick. He's reached out for a chat so we'll have the opportunity to tell him our thoughts.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Crossing fingers that the story we're cooking up for Divinity will eventually grow to the same heights.

With Todd Howard leading the charge, Bethesda is heavily involved in the creation of the smash hit Fallout TV series, which has been praised by fans for nailing the Fallout universe, tone, and aesthetic. The Fallout TV series also avoids the pitfalls of retelling the story of an existing game, nor does it feature main characters from any of the games. Instead, it’s set after the events of all the Fallout games, bringing in new characters and telling new stories, while returning to fan-favorite locations (New Vegas etc).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will be intense scrutiny on the casting choices for Baldur’s Gate 3. The video game’s characters have become part of the culture, instantly recognizable online, and their actors as high-profile as those in the space get. The idea of an Astarion played by someone other than Neil Newbon, for example, seems almost ridiculous.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">HBO at least knows what an online backlash to a video game adaptation looks like. While Season 1 of The Last of Us was a huge hit and, generally speaking, went down very well with fans, Season 2 has been a mixed bag. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/last-of-us-tv-series-showrunner-wants-you-to-know-he-didnt-kill-anyone-in-real-life-the-actor-is-alive-and-hes-in-literally-everything-else">Mazin himself has spoken openly about this backlash</a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-star-bella-ramsey-tells-season-2-haters-they-dont-have-to-watch-season-3-if-you-hate-it-that-much-the-game-exists">Ellie actor Bella Ramsey told those who hate The Last of Us that they can play the video game instead</a>. Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-chief-neil-druckmann-to-step-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-ahead-of-season-3-to-focus-on-game-development">Naughty Dog chief Neil Druckmann left The Last of Us ahead of Season 3</a> to focus on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems early days for Baldur’s Gate 3, so we probably won’t know anything concrete about it for some time. Until then… Timothée Chalamet for Astarion?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Sophie Turner has started filming for Amazon's upcoming Tomb Raider adaptation, and we now have our first look at her Lara Croft making her way through a soggy woodland.</p>
<p>The brief footage, which you can see below, shows Turner's Lara with holsters-a-plenty, because yes, those are her dual pistols you can see strapped to her thighs. Hurrah!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Turner's hair has been styled in a long braid for the scene, which according to the YouTube description accompanying this footage, was shot in Surrey (that explains the weather).</p>

<p>Additional set photos show Turner doing her own stunts, and parachuting in to the scene (via <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15534645/Sophie-Turner-stunts-set-Tomb-Raider.html">Daily Mail</a>).</p>

<p>We've recently had a flurry of cast announcements for Amazon's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>. Along with Turner's Lara Croft, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Jason Isaacs has been cast as Lara's Uncle Atlas</a>, while Martin Bobb-Semple will play Zip, Bill Paterson will play Winston and Celia Imrie will play Francine (that is to say, the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, who is "focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne").</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-lara-croft-actress-spotted-on-tomb-raider-set-with-fans-now-speculating-she-will-play-laras-mother-in-amazons-series">former Lara Croft actress Keeley Hawes was also spotted on set in London</a>, with many suspecting she will play Lara's mother Amelia on the show's release.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms Has The Juice]]></title>

            <guid>1428016</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>In an episode of <em>The Simpsons</em>, Barney Gumble, Springfield's resident alcoholic, visits Moe’s Tavern, which has been turned into a speakeasy after the town realizes that prohibition laws are still on the books. Moe charges him $45 for a mug of beer. Flabbergasted, Barney says, “This better be the best-tasting beer in the world.” He takes an eager sip. He then says, “You got lucky,” and gives Moe $45. This is how I feel about the latest television series in George R. R. Martin’s Westeros universe, <em>A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em>.</p><p>To say that I was burned by the ending of HBO’s <em>Game of Thrones</em> would be an understatement. <em>All</em> of us got burned. It was a final season and finale so legendarily awful it has supplanted <em>Lost</em> as the perennial example of “a show with an ending that pissed off all the fans.” Once showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss ran out of George R. R. Martin’s original material, it really showed—the show missed the zippiness, the twists and turns that made early seasons so much fun to watch, and all the characters got a lot dumber.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image source: Steffan Hill/HBO</span></figcaption></figure><p>I watched <em>Game of Thrones</em> for ten years of my life, and then I assumed I would never need to know how to spell “Targaryen” ever again. How wrong I was. HBO has the rights to more than one Martin property, and by god, they’re going to use them. The follow up prequel, <em>House of the Dragon</em>, unfortunately suffers from a pretty similar issue as the ending of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. <em>House of the Dragon</em> is based on just one book, a history of the Targaryen family that’s written as an in-universe academic text about the history of the Targaryen dynasty. In the hands of truly great showrunners, this would give the crew room to make these characters truly sing, to expand them in meaningful ways. In practice, the expansions to the world and characters have diminishing returns, and <em>House of the Dragon</em> is less prestige drama and more high budget soap opera.</p><p>What I’m saying is: I did not expect <em>A Knight of the Seven Kingdom</em>, based on a collection of short stories by the same name, to be very good. I am quite fond of the stories of Dunk and Egg, as this collection of tales is called by fans, but I’m not a fucking idiot. I let the premiere of this show pass me by, only watching after I’d seen other people’s good reviews on social media.</p><p>And it’s great. It’s just great! Instead of being about the trials and tribulations of the royal families, like <em>A Game of Thrones</em> and <em>House of the Dragon</em>, this show is just about A Guy. Ser Duncan the Tall was a squire to a knight, but that knight died just before they were about to reach a tournament. Ser Duncan intends, then, to enter the tournament himself, and ends up enlisting the help of a clever bald-headed boy called Egg.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image source: Steffan Hill/HBO</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then quite literally, hijinks ensue. There’s a whole runaround that Duncan has to do in order to enter the tournament, and he visits a few of the noble houses that <em>Game of Thrones</em> fans probably remember: there’s a drunk Baratheon, and a whole cadre of Targaryens who hate each other. There’s a puppet show, with actual puppets being puppeteered on screen, one of them a puppet dragon that’s much more impressive than the series of CGI dragons this franchise has shown me. In fact, not having to animate an enormous CGI dragon has clearly opened up some room in the budget for nicer-looking wigs and costumes, as well as one really fun joust at the end of the third episode. In the most recent episode, there are no less than two original, in-universe dirty songs, one of which casually drops the entire Targaryen family line if you listen carefully. I am not necessarily gasping at outlandish turns of fate in this show, but I enjoy the way Ser Duncan and Egg bond with each other, and how this low-born hedge knight teaches chivalry and righteousness even to the royal family.</p><p>There’s as much depth to the worldbuilding as I remember from the first season of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, but it’s also a lot more fun overall. There’s no succession crisis; there’s just a dumb knight and his clever squire, and the drama of whether or not he’ll get to kiss the cute girl at the puppeteers’ booth. The whole thing is more T.H. White than, well, George R. R. Martin. There’s even a secret prince.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roblox Advertises AI Tools That Immediately Rip Off Clair Obscur: Expedition 33]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai-roblox-maelle-2000666407</link>
            <guid>1428001</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The Roblox Corporation just revealed its new “real-time, action conditioned world model,” a generative AI tool for producing interactable videos that seems to work </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/google-ai-genai-nintendo-zelda-breath-wild-mario-64-project-genie-2000664227"><span>exactly like Google’s Project Genie</span></a><span>, which launched last week. While that one was able to rip off <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, the Roblox version is plagiarizing 2025’s Game of the Year.</span></p> <p><span>“We see several immediate uses for our Roblox world model,” the company announced on February 5. “We will use it side-by-side text, image and video prompts as a way to launch auto-generation of immersive worlds. In Roblox Studio, a creator could walk around and use prompts to ‘paint’ a world and then convert it into a 3D representation or direct to Roblox native as a way for many people to play simultaneously.”&nbsp;</span><span>It then proceeded to show a really ugly-looking version of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> as proof.</p>

 <p><span>The strangest part of the entire reveal is that the world model tech that the Roblox Corporation decided to show off was actually an addendum to a completely separate reveal. The real announcement here is the impending release of their “</span><a href="https://about.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/02/accelerating-creation-powered-roblox-cube-foundation-model"><span>4D generation</span></a><span>” tech, a feature for the Cube Foundation Model that allows “creators and players to generate fully functional objects” that can be ported into </span><span>Roblox</span><span>, the platform its billions of users actually play on and spend money in.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Are we supposed to pretend that isnt expedition 33 or are we selling that ai generation is theft on purpose?</p> <p>— Mjl8 (@xMJL8x) <a href="https://twitter.com/xMJL8x/status/2019496403471311281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The genAI world model addendum was featured </span><a href="https://x.com/Roblox/status/2019221626387312810?s=20"><span>in a reply</span></a><span> made by the official Roblox X account to its 4D generation announcement, which explained that the “real-time, action conditioned world model” has been “trained on a combination of data, including proprietary Roblox 3D avatar/world interaction data.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The “including” part of the message here is clearly attempting to do a lot of heavy lifting, because everyone immediately noticed that the “woman in a glowing cave” prompt had unmistakably used footage of Sandfall Interactive’s </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><span>to generate its “real-time dreaming” world.</span></p>

 <p><span>As one user very handily </span><a href="https://x.com/josephioanna/status/2019449659337458057?s=20"><span>pointed out</span></a><span> in their reply, it seems to have specifically used the Flying Waters location as inspiration, as well as Maelle’s model (including her outfit). “What do @SandfallGames think about this? I wonder what you trained your model on?”</span></p> <p><span>Sandfall Interactive has yet to make an official statement regarding Roblox Corporation’s world generation showcase. However, Nintendo hasn’t weighed in on Project Genie’s use of its assets and IPs either. That’s despite </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-stocks-down-take-two-gta-nintendo-roblox-unity-google-ai-game-maker-2000664594"><span>a drop in Nintendo’s share value</span></a><span> on January 30 that some analysts have directly attributed to Project Genie’s release.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>According to a new claim, Starfield’s Switch 2 port appears to be delayed and might never see the light of day. </p>



<p>A Starfield PlayStation 5 and Switch 2 port has been rumoured for a long time, but we have yet to hear any official details about it. This week, we have already heard a claim about Bethesda <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-playstatiion-5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planning an April 2026 release</a> for Starfield on PlayStation 5. We have now received claims about the Switch 2 Port as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-starfield-switch-2-port-reportedly-pushed-out">Starfield Switch 2 Port Reportedly ‘Pushed Out’ </h2>



<p>The claim that Starfield’s Switch 2 has a chance of never releasing comes from Shinobi602’s recent comments on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ppe-pl-starfield-is-coming-to-ps5-on-april-7th.1426351/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>. When asked whether the Switch 2 port will release at the same time as the PS5, Shinobi602 stated, “That’s been pushed out. And might not even come out at all.” When asked whether the delay was to target holiday sales, the insider replied, “They’re having problems with it, nothing to do with holidays or anything.” </p>



<p>The Starfield Switch 2 and PS5 ports are expected to release with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2-0-could-be-real-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.0 update</a> for the title, which will bring significant changes to some mechanics, help reduce load times, and be optimised for lower-power devices like handhelds. However, if the Switch 2 version is experiencing issues, the latter half of the 2.0 update might take longer than expected. Readers should take all the information with a grain of salt. </p>







<p>In other news, Starfield co-lead designer recently reflected on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-co-lead-designer-reflects-on-games-shortcomings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s shortcomings</a>.&nbsp;Additionally, the words ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘ were teased in an anniversary post.

    <p><span>The Phantasmoon Games begin, Planarcadia descends, and a journey of Elation departs.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 4.0 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “No Aha At Full Moon,” will launch on February 13, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [220 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1024691"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this update, players will arrive at Planarcadia, Aha’s very own playground, and be presented with a brand-new world where clout reigns supreme and society amuses itself to death. At the same time, by participating in the “Phantasmoon Games,” Trailblazers will have the chance to compete for the honor of becoming an “Aeon for a Minute.” This Trailblazing journey surrounding The Elation will unfold here and continue throughout the entire coming year. Beyond Planarcadia, the Express Crew will subsequently head to the Interastral Peace Entertainment headquarters, “Astropolis,” to embark on new explorations. Get ready to set off on this fresh interstellar journey with your new companions Yao Guang and Sparxie.</p><p>Legend has it that “Planarcadia” was once a flat “World in Canvas,” but after the IPC took over management, it awoke from the canvas, revived, and gradually transformed into the bustling hub it is today. Upon the Express Crew’s arrival, Madam Pearl, one of the Strategic Investment Department’s “Ten Stonehearts,” will be there to play host. Yet beyond the glitz, Planarcadia carries a deeper meaning: it is both Navigator Himeko’s homeland and the very place where the Astral Express reignited its journey fifteen years ago. Now, as the Express enters this paradise once again, another kind of “star treatment” awaits them: a hit comic based on the Express Crew is currently being serialized, thrusting everyone into the spotlight.</p><p>After wrapping up pleasantries with the IPC, the Trailblazer will arrive in “Duomension City” and encounter the unique “imagenae” of this world. These creatures live in symbiosis with the locals, having long been integrated into the city’s daily life. Whether it’s the station master “Meowton,” the train-like “Bullet Wyrm,” the “thundercoil” looming over the city, or the “mechatron” beloved by Mr. Yang, they have all become indispensable parts of Duomension City. However, the existence of the imagenae isn’t guaranteed. They rely on people’s “Wishpower” to sustain their lives—they only persist if they continue to attract attention; once forgotten, they gradually fade away. It is for this reason that entertainment facilities line every street and alley of Duomension City, and laughter never ceases. The city also hides mysterious entrances. Stepping through them allows the Trailblazer to enter a marvelous Duomension world, peeking into another facet of this arcadia or being led to unexpected destinations—be it the brightly lit commercial district of Dovebrook, Himeko’s alma mater and world-renowned art school “Graphia Academy,” or even the secret gathering place of the Masked Fools: the Tavern of Elation. Rumor has it that this place is quietly tucked away in some corner of the Dovebrook District…</p><p>In this boisterous amusement park, the vast majority of residents are followers of the Elation. Even conflicts and disputes are packaged as games to be solved. Among all the entertainments, the most eye-catching—and most insane—is undoubtedly the “Phantasmoon Games,” which is also one of the Express Crew’s key objectives for this trip. Legend has it that this game was personally designed by The Laughter. The victor not only earns the right to an audience with THEM, but also receives the prize of “becoming an Aeon for one minute.” The Phantasmoon Games has no fixed rules. The only criterion for judgment is who can attract the most attention. Any method goes, as long as it’s dazzling enough. All participants rely on a single mask as their ticket, and there are only eight such masks in existence. As the games approach, various factions have quietly gathered. The Astral Express, the Masked Fools, the IPC, and the Xianzhou Alliance have intervened one after another. Even the Stellaron Hunters have made an appearance, Silver Wolf and Blade seem to have already begun their operations. Are they, too, here for the Phantasmoon Games? All suspense will be revealed one by one in future stories.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In Planarcadia, even Combat is placed under the gaze of The Laughter. When characters on the Path of “Elation” are added to the team, or when fighting special enemies, you will obtain “Punchlines.” As Punchlines accumulate and Aha’s interest peaks, THEY will personally take the stage to initiate an “Aha Instant.” During this phase, Aha will lead the “Elation” characters in the team to unleash Elation Skills in turn. The more Punchlines gathered, the stronger the ability effects. After the “Aha Instant” concludes, all characters on the Path of Elation will gain their own unique “Certified Banger” buffs, adding further layers to combat strategy.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1024692"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>In the new version, Trailblazers will welcome two powerful new 5-star characters to their roster. First up is the Seer Strategist from the Xianzhou Alliance’s Yuque: General Yao Guang. Previously only a voice heard during the storyline, she is finally making her official debut. As the senior soror to the familiar face Fu Xuan, Yao Guang serves as the Alliance’s vital divination advisor when facing difficult predicaments. To the people of the Xianzhou, she is “Madam Yao,” a goddess of fortune who resolves crises and brings good omens through her divination. As a Physical character on the Path of Elation, Yao Guang specializes in using “Weal and Woe Lots” to control the flow of battle. Weal Lots increase ally Elation and grant the team “Punchline” stacks when Yao Guang uses her Skill. During an “Aha Instant,” Yao Guang casts Woe Lots, causing enemies to take increased DMG while regenerating Skill Points for the team. Yao Guang’s “Certified Banger” buff allows teammates’ attacks to deal 1 instance of Additional Elation DMG; if that attack consumes a Skill Point, the DMG is further increased. Furthermore, her Ultimate not only provides “Punchline” for the team but also immediately triggers an extra “Aha Instant,” increasing All-Type RES PEN for all allies.</p><p>Another mysterious 5-star Fire-Type character on the Path of Elation is Sparxie. Bearing a striking resemblance to the familiar Masked Fool Sparkle, she is the hottest streamer in Planarcadia. In the storyline, Sparxie will debut alongside Sparkle, bringing a unique surprise to the Trailblazer. In combat, acting as a streamer, Sparxie opens a livestream room to engage in a live upvote showdown with enemies. Players can continuously consume Skill Points to send random “Gifts” to Sparxie, regenerating varying amounts of Skill Points or “Punchlines” for the team. The more Skill Points consumed, the more Punchlines the team gains, and the higher the DMG dealt at the final settlement. During “Aha Instant,” Sparxie kicks off a boisterous lucky draw, dealing massive DMG to all enemies with multiple bounces. While in the “Certified Banger” state, every Gift triggered during the live showdown will deal additional Elation DMG to a random enemy target upon settlement. Furthermore, Sparxie’s Ultimate also deals extra Elation DMG.</p><p>Limited 5-star characters Black Swan, Evernight, and Hysilens, along with Sparkle, Cerydra, and Rappa, will be featured in Warp events during the first and second halves of the version respectively. At the same time, Black Swan and Sparkle will also receive enhancements. Black Swan can further elevate the overall DMG output of DOT teams, while Sparkle’s support effects will now apply to Elation DMG, boosting the overall damage output of Elation teams and providing players with more stable and powerful combat support in their journey ahead. Additionally, players who log in after the version launches will receive a 20-pull reward and can claim Ruan Mei’s new Outfit for free. Meanwhile, the Yao Guang fortune event will also bring players 1,600 Stellar Jades in rewards. During this period, multiple benefits will be gradually released, including new Trailblaze Outfits and new headwear, as well as a free 5-star character selector, bringing even more surprises to your adventure.</p><p>Finally, version 4.0 will also bring a host of brand-new events and gameplay updates. For example, in “Cosmicon Collective,” you’ll challenge formidable foes via card battles and strive for the pinnacle of cosmic might. In “Furbobo Weekly,” Trailblazers will become magazine editors, experiencing a different kind of fun through management and critical decisions. As for permanent gameplay modes, “Currency Wars” will see its first expansion, while the “Divergent Universe” is also getting an update, injecting more variety into long-term challenges.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,348 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [25,443 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer and special program below.

Think of the sort of square hunks of metal, wood, and sail that might come out of an episode of Scrapheap Challenge about floating tanks, and you've got the picture.</p>
<p>These tugs are slapped together at deployable boat building stations, fitted out with boaty accoutrements like engines, cannons, and anchors, then cast off in search of plunder. Engine and sail placement factors into your vessel's handling and speed, so maybe don't stick them all at the very back of the deck because you're trying to build the barge version of a Porsche 911. Naturally, you can also install a plank just in case any bickering over loot breaks out among your crew.</p><p>Then, it's heave ho and off you go to the edge of the map, where a new region dubbed the deep sea awaits. "This is not a place to live: you cannot build, and nothing respawns," Facepunch warn. "First come, first served. The deep sea will open and close intermittently, like a world event." Within the bounds of these dangerous waters, you'll find ghost ships protected by hostile scientists and their new turret-equipped PT boats and tropical islands boasting mystery loot. In between battles over goodies, you can drop anchor at ramshackle floating cities "built from abandoned barges and the framework of an unfinished oil rig", where you can restock and hang out at the Deep Deck casino.</p>
<p>It all sounds ripe for piratey antics that build on Rust's well-established scramble for survival among base-building hoarders. The good news is that it's out now and Facepunch have included five new naval missions to get you started.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-v-the-kotaku-review-1324730770"><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> launched over a decade ago on Xbox 360 and PS3 in September 2013.</a> And its sequel, the highly anticipated <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, is seemingly, finally, actually, for real, launching this November. Take-Two’s CEO is even promising that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-still-confirmed-for-november-with-summer-marketing-blitz-planned-2000665452">game’s marketing will kick off this summer</a>.</p> <p>So, as we wait for that and hope the game doesn’t get delayed again, let’s look back at the complete timeline for<em> GTA V</em>‘s marketing and promotion, from announcement to release.</p> <h2>2011</h2> <p><em>GTA V</em> was officially announced on October 25, 2011, <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/128788090969001984">via a simple little tweet</a> that just said “#GTAV.” People went wild at the time as the last main installment in the series, <em>GTA IV</em>, had been released in 2008. Can you imagine waiting possibly four years for a <em>GTA</em> sequel?!?!</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666176" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666176"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666176">©Twitter / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>One week later, on November 2, Rockstar released the <a href="https://youtu.be/QkkoHAzjnUs">first trailer for <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>.</a> It featured narration by one of the game’s main characters, Michael, and showed beauty shots of Los Santos and the surrounding area. Young Zack watched this trailer way too many times. It ended without a release date. Then…nothing. Radio silence from Rockstar. The more things change…</p> <h2>2012</h2> <p>In July 2012, as part of a Rockstar Newswire post answering fan questions, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/4k4128838a3a4a/asked-answered-max-payne-3-and-grand-theft-auto-v.html#:~:text=however%2C%20manage%20to-,sneak%20a%20quick,-screenshot%20out%20for">Rockstar released two new screenshots of </a><em><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/4k4128838a3a4a/asked-answered-max-payne-3-and-grand-theft-auto-v.html#:~:text=however%2C%20manage%20to-,sneak%20a%20quick,-screenshot%20out%20for">GTA V</a>.</em> They didn’t feature any main characters, but offered two new looks at the then-upcoming open-world game. Once again, a lot of <em>GTA</em> fans went wild over these crumbs.</p>

 <p>In August 2012, <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V/Screenshots#:~:text=In%20August%202012,%5B5%5D">Rockstar teased fans with 10 more screenshots</a> released across three different posts throughout the month. The company also promised that more was coming in the near future. But fans would have to wait a little bit longer than planned.</p>

 <p>Rockstar planned to release a second trailer for <em>GTA V</em> on November 2. However, these plans were derailed when <a href="https://kotaku.com/hurricane-sandy-delays-second-gta-v-trailer-5957385">Hurricane Sandy slammed into New York City</a>, where Rockstar’s main HQ is located, and knocked out the power. The trailer would eventually be released 12 days later on November 14. It featured the excellent song “Skeletons” by Stevie Wonder, a song I can’t hear without thinking about this trailer.</p>  <p>In October, a year after the game was announced, Rockstar confirmed a leaked release date of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/27/gta-v-coming-spring-2013">“Spring 2013” for the game</a>. In November, it started taking pre-orders for <em>GTA V</em>. Before 2012 ended, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gtav"><em>Game Informer</em> ran a large cover story about </a><em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/gtav">Grand Theft Auto V</a>,</em> detailing a hands-off demo they were shown and revealing some other details about the game.</p>

 <h2>Early 2013</h2> <p>Rockstar kicked off the new year with bad news. On January 31, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/31/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-a-september-release-date">Rockstar Games announced that <em>GTA V</em> had been delayed</a> from Spring 2013 to September 17, 2013.</p> <p>“To all <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> fans, please accept our apologies for the delay, and our promise that the entire team here is working very hard to make the game all it can be. We are doing all we can to help ensure it will meet, if not exceed, your expectations come September – we thank you for your support and patience,” posted Rockstar at the time.</p> <p>A few months later, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130406024311/http://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/04/new-mural-could-reveal-grand-theft-auto-v-box-art/">in April, Rockstar revealed the game’s official cover</a> via a mural painted on the side of a building in New York City. Later that same month, Rockstar Games released not one, not two, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/27/ign-live-presents-gta-5-character-trailers">three different trailers</a>. Each trailer focused on one of the three playable protagonists in the game. Younger Zack lost his shit that day, let me tell you. Rockstar would once more enter radio silence mode, but this would be the last time before an onslaught of marketing and promotion kicked off.</p>

 <h2>Summer 2013</h2> <p>On July 9, Rockstar finally shared actual gameplay of <em>GTA V</em> as part of a gameplay overview trailer. This was the first time most people had ever seen the game running on actual hardware, and it was wild to witness. I remember being shocked at how good it looked. Even today, all these years later, I still think the original version of<em> GTA</em> <em>V </em>and <em>GTA Online</em> look pretty dang good.</p>  <p><a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/519075-new-epsilon-program-twitter-found/">Also in July, a viral marketing campaign began using an old <em>GTA San Andreas-</em>era website</a> mocking Scientology and cults. This would end up leading players to a fake Twitter account for the Epsilon Cult and would end with a way to audition to be in the game. <a href="https://screenrant.com/gta-5-6-casting-fans-epsilon-program/#:~:text=In%20the%20lead,the%20Epsilon%20Program.">Five people were picked and digitally added to <em>GTA V.</em></a></p>

 <p>Between August 13 and September 13, Rockstar began posting blogs on its website sharing even more details about <em>GTA V’</em>s world and characters, as well as new screenshots. The floodgates were truly open at this point.</p> <p>On August 15, <a href="https://youtu.be/olEGtoYs_8A">Rockstar released a gameplay overview showing off our first look at</a><em><a href="https://youtu.be/olEGtoYs_8A"> GTA Online</a>.</em> Looking back at it now, it is clear that Rockstar had no idea what this game would evolve into over the next decade. It looks so quaint now.</p>  <p>And finally, on August 29, 2013, just over two weeks before the launch of <em>GTA V</em> on Xbox and PlayStation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep5QfWMba-s">Rockstar released the final pre-release trailer for the game</a>. This was a shorter trailer and would end up being played on TV as <em>GTA V’</em>s launch commercial. If you were watching cable back around 2013, you likely saw this ad a few dozen times or more.</p>

 <p>That ends the marketing timeline for<em> GTA V.</em> Of course, the game would go on to be ported to many more platforms, get many more trailers, and spawn <em>GTA Online,</em> one of the most successful live-service games ever made. And it all started with a tweet in 2011.</p>

<p>The Pokémon commercial that was supposed to play at Super Bowl LX on Sunday has already leaked online, featuring a star-studded cast. </p>



<p>Pokémon is one of the franchises that gets leaked on all fronts. <span>We have seen the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-pokemon-company-coo-calls-for-pokemon-leaks-to-be-removed/" target="_blank">mainline games leaking</a></span>&nbsp;ahead of announcement, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-a4a-set-secluded-springs-leaks-ahead-of-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TCG Pocket cards</a>, packs, and so much more. Now, something really unexpected has happened: even their Super Bowl commercial leaked a few days earlier than planned. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-super-bowl-commercial-features-lady-gaga-charles-leclerc-and-young-miko">Pokémon Super Bowl Commercial Features Lady Gaga, Charles Leclerc, and Young Miko</h2>



<p>Only a small clip of the Pokémon Super Bowl Commercial, posted by CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/2019650640088297854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), has surfaced online, but it provides plenty of new information. The video features American singer, songwriter, and actress Lady Gaga, Puerto Rican rapper, singer, and songwriter Young Miko, and Formula 1 driver Charles Leclerc. All 3 personalities seem to be talking about their favourite Pokémon and what they like about it, but it could be something else. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Young Miko is first shown with a Gengar, with the words “He’s mischievous, that’s sort of his love language”. Then we see Charles Leclerc with a Growlithe, uttering the phrase “his loyalty, his speed.” We also see Lady Gaga with a Jigglypuff, but as this is just a clip, her statement wasn’t revealed. When asked whether the commercial was about a “specific game”, CentroLeaks responded, “It doesn’t promote a specific game…”</p>

            <p>The Highguard team has released another patch for its live-service hero shooter.</p>
<p>This update includes a new Warden, known as Ekon. Ekon is described as a "legendary Wildwalker" who is able to shapeshift into a direwolf. This means he doesn't need a mount, as he is the mount.</p>
<p>"When his mentor, and closest thing to family, goes missing in the lost land of Highguard, there is no monster or Warden this great predator will allow to stand in his way," developer Wildlight teases.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As well as this new Warden, the update - which welcomes in Highguard episode two - also adds a new map known as Skydrift which, as the name suggests, takes place above the clouds. From a quick glance at the artwork for this map (see further below), I get flashbacks to the sky islands in Legend of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, but with more structures dotted about.</p>
<p>Other quality of life improvements include the likes of being able to leave the party by clicking on party member's social card, Dead players no longer show up on the minimap and more.</p>

<p>Highguard was announced back in December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out Geoff Keighley's trailer-filled The Game Awards extravaganza</a> (which did also feature some awards). Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format.</p>
<p>Since this slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry have voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one."</p>

            <p>PC game-download store GOG has come under scrutiny for using generative-AI in marketing artwork, then for seeming to sit on the fence in an answer about whether it will keep using the tech in the future.</p>
<p>The piece of artwork was a banner advertising a 2026 sale, <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner/post69?cjdata=MXxZfDB8WXww&amp;utm_campaign=cj&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=cj">which a GOG forum user, presumed to be a GOG artist, spoke out about</a> and confirmed was created with AI. This caused a stink and so gen-AI use was one of the topics GOG was immediately questioned about during <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gog/comments/1qu09vg/ask_the_gog_team_and_micha%C5%82_kici%C5%84ski_anything/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">an Ask Me Anything on Reddit</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>Managing director Maciej Gołębiewski - when asked about the negative reaction and whether GOG would move away from gen-AI use in the future - replied: "We're not planning on making absolute statements in either direction. AI tools are one of many technologies we test and try out, and in some contexts it genuinely helps us push the company (and the mission) forward.</p>
<p>"What we will change, though, is how and where those tools are used; we understand that using new technology doesn't mean skipping human judgment." His answer did nothing to cool or calm the crowd.</p>

<p>I followed this response up with GOG and Gołębiewski this morning but was told GOG wouldn't elaborate on what had been said. However, I did speak to Gołębiewski at length in January, in an interview about GOG's private acquisition, and gen-AI was one of the topics we broached.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Every technology at some point finds its way to be put to good use"</em></blockquote>
<p>Gołębiewski told me at the time: "We are not using it [gen-AI] as of right now, but we've seen instances where communities have used the AI or neural network to analyse all of the code that is available for a game - all of the repositories or the documentation that's available for a game - with an aim of making it run better or maybe making it run on a different operating system or different hardware. AI is pretty good at absorbing the context and then guessing some action points based on that context.</p>
<p>"We haven't done this in this form," he added, "but I'm sure that at some point the application of AI - not necessarily generative AI in terms of artworks or code or whatever - will be found for how this can be used to advance game preservation. Every technology at some point finds its way to be put to good use. It's just the road to that is usually windy, shaky, however you might call it. So we haven't yet, but I'm not saying we won't do it in the future. If this can be used to advance our mission, then we will do it."</p>

<p>GOG's founding mission - and continuing mission - is restoring and preserving classic games, whether they be old classics or more modern classics, and ensuring they can be played in their best form into the future without being locked behind DRM. This often requires a lot of work on GOG's end, hence the attraction of AI in helping alleviate some of that.</p><p>But GOG is a store that also sells newer games, both indie and bigger games, and that prides itself on a selective approach, and on being close to its audience and receptive to them. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-says-selling-horses-when-steam-wouldnt-was-matter-of-freedom">GOG earned plenty of respect by stocking provocative indie horror game Horses</a> last year, when other stores, like Epic and Steam, wouldn't. "We as a company are always ready to take a stand on the right values," Maciej Gołębiewski said to me about making that decision. It's a statement that seems to grate against what it's saying now about gen-AI.</p>
<p>GOG recently became a private company after having spent its entire existence as part of CD Projekt - the house of The Witcher games and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. And one of the positive potential ramifications of this is not being burdened by that huge game-making business, and therefore being more agile and able to take risks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">new owner Michał Kiciński explained to me recently</a>. I wonder if this moment will be a telling one in the company's new era.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Late last year, it seemed like<em> Half-Life 3</em>, the third entry in the Valve series, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-rumors-intensify-on-27th-anniversary-original-game/"><strong>about to be announced</strong></a>. <span>Every&nbsp;<strong>available indication</strong>, whether </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/should-you-give-up-on-half-life-3-no-not-while-work-continues-on-hlx/"><strong><span>updates to the So</span>urce 2 engine</strong></a> or rumors from reliable insiders about <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization-trailer-prepared/"><strong>a trailer in preparation</strong></a>, seemed to point to an <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">imminent reveal before the end of 2025</a></strong>. </p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">However,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2025 has ended</strong>&nbsp;without any confirmation of what the HLX project is, and the complete lack of information from the usual sources plunged the community into&nbsp;<strong>doom and gloom</strong>, with </span>many starting to doubt the game really exists, or believing it was ultimately cancelled.</p>



<p>While we still don't know if <strong>HLX is indeed the long-awaited Half-Life 3</strong>, we now know that development of the project is <strong>proceeding</strong>, at least in some capacity.</p>



<p><span>A few hours ago,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/2019536782279557428" target="_blank"><strong>Gabefollower</strong></a>, one of the most&nbsp;<strong>reliable sources</strong>&nbsp;of rumors about Valve's projects, confirmed on X that the latest&nbsp;<em>Deadlock</em>&nbsp;update<strong>&nbsp;includes some new mentions of the HLX project</strong>.</span> By itself, the new mentions don't <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">mean much</strong>, but at least they have confirmed that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"HLX survived Valve's winter break,"</em> as Gabefollower put.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">community reaction</strong> to the news that development of what is supposedly <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Half-Life 3</em> did not disappoint, divided between those<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"> inhaling generous doses of hopium</strong> like <a href="https://x.com/Marcegonz19/status/2019542841836597746"><strong>X user Marcelo</strong></a> and those who believe <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Nothing Ever Happens,"</strong></em> like <a href="https://x.com/souvlaki420/status/2019544321591009472"><strong>X user tzatziki</strong></a>. Others, however, are <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">giving up hope</strong>, now believing <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">HLX is not the third entry in the series</strong>, but something else entirely.</p>



<p><em>'Gabe, I think that it's getting to a point that HLX isnt half life X or 3. I think it's just a new addition to games that could be for moderation, making the games better, or something else completely. Stop giving us hopium that eventually turns into dispairium,'</em> said <a href="https://x.com/d116223reb/status/2019602979784126694"><strong>X user dude3reborn</strong></a>. Was this <strong>a plea</strong> to Gabefollower or to Gabe Newell, CEO of Valve? Who knows, but this statement summarizes well the <strong>wild state</strong> the <em>Half-Life</em> community has been since it started to seem like <em>Half-Life 3</em> wasn't a fever dream, but a <strong>concrete possibility.</strong></p>



<p>Although there's no <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">concrete indication</strong> that HLX could indeed be <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Half-Life 3</em>, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-reportedly-getting-announced-soon-but-how-will-it-play/">datamined discoveries</a></strong> made over the years suggest this project could be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a very interesting game</strong> coming with a lot of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">unique mechanics</strong>, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fire and heat conductivity</strong>, a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">gravity gun</strong> with complex physics mechanics likely used for puzzles, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">advanced NPC AI with superior hearing</strong> that, on paper, could make for <strong>a very immersive experience</strong>. As for when it will be <strong>revealed</strong>, it's really difficult to say at the moment. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-sony-soundbar-sees-a-final-price-drop-before-the-super-bowl-now-as-cheap-as-budget-earbuds-2000666195</link>
            <guid>1427953</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar delivers clear audio for TV, movies, music, and other content without overwhelming your home theater setup. Simply set the soundbar in front of your TV and plug it in with a single cable to enjoy significantly improved audio over standard TV speakers. Its two-channel design, bass-reflex driver, and tweeter add depth to TV audio, while surround sound processing creates the illusion that sound comes from farther away. You can also pair your phone or tablet via Bluetooth with the soundbar and stream music or playlists when the TV is off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">You can purchase the Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar on Amazon now for just $98, saving $62 or 39% off its retail price of $160.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An easy way to improve your TV’s default audio</h2>
<p>The S100F soundbar provides a direct, no-nonsense approach to delivering strong 2.0 channel audio and has sufficient power to pull audio out of the flatness often associated with most TVs’ built-in speakers. The tweeters inside the soundbar help the primary drivers better separate dialogue, effects, and background details, creating cleaner separation and less blending of these elements. The Bass Reflex architecture in the soundbar is specifically designed to deliver additional energy to low-end frequencies, greatly enhancing the impact of action scenes, music, and game audio, all without the need for an external subwoofer to take up valuable floor space.</p>
<p>In addition, S-Force Pro Front Surround Processing is included to enhance the soundbar’s stereo field. While the soundbar is only a few inches wide, it has been engineered to simulate a much wider sound field by shaping how it projects audio throughout the room. Voice Enhancement is another feature that makes the S100F soundbar extremely practical for those who have difficulty hearing soft-spoken lines and fast-paced conversations amid loud soundtracks.</p>



<p>Connectivity options accommodate common configurations. For example, the soundbar supports HDMI ARC, which allows many modern TVs to send both audio and basic control commands to the soundbar through a single cable, eliminating the need for multiple remotes and cables. Bluetooth supports wireless music streaming from devices such as mobile phones and tablets. This allows users to easily switch between TV audio and music playback without turning on their TV.</p>
<p>The compact form factor and ease of use contribute to a user-friendly experience that doesn’t disrupt normal daily routines. The soundbar is small enough to be placed below or on top of a TV, or mounted to the wall, depending on the user’s preferences. The remote control is simple to use and lets users choose from different sound modes, toggle Voice Enhancement on or off, and adjust the soundbar’s volume. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">At the moment, the Sony S100F 2.0ch Soundbar is available at Amazon for only $98, down from the typical retail price of $160, and represents a significant step up from standard TV speakers without requiring a complex installation process.</a></p>
