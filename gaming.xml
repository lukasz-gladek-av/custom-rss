                <p>Velan Studios' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/midnight-murder-club/" data-ref-id="5000-633798">Midnight Murder Club</a> is now in early access on PC and PS5.. And as part of the pitch to gamers, only one player has to actually has to actually own Midnight Murder Club in order to invite up to five others playing via the game's Guest Pass Edition. </p><p>Unlike some other PvP shooters, Midnight Murder Club drops 1-6 players into a large estate called Wormwood Manor without the benefit of lights. Players will have to rely on their own flashlights, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/midnight-murder-club-preview/1100-6524984/" data-ref-id="1100-6524984">proximity chat</a>, or the flash of gunfire to come out on top. That leads to a very lethal game of hide-and-seek.</p><p>Velan Studios recently unveiled Midnight Murder Club's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/midnight-murder-club-hits-early-access-in-march-includes-guest-pass/1100-6529746/" data-ref-id="1100-6529746">Wildcards mode</a>, which gives players the ability to rewrite reality thanks to some special cards. When players pick cards from their collection, they can be given special abilities like super speed or the power to self-detonate upon death. Some of those powers will extend to the other players in the match as well. At the end of each round, players are given new cards to experiment with, and they won't necessarily get the same powers again.</p><p>Players can join the early-access game for $20 starting on PS5 or PC via Steam, and the Guest Pass Edition is available for free, which will come in handy for five of your buddies.</p>

<p>Everyone has a one or a few personal favorite heroes they lock in to win in Marvel Rivals, but the win rate data says that some are just plain better than others. While a higher win rate doesn’t automatically mean they’re a better hero, it’s certainly nothing to scoff at or take likely.</p>



<p>So which heroes in Marvel Rivals win the most? Let’s take a look at the top performing heroes according to win rate.</p>



<h2 id="h-hero-win-rates-in-marvel-rivals-march-2025-season-1-5">Hero Win Rates in Marvel Rivals (March 2025, Season 1.5)</h2>



<p>Similar to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-popular-marvel-rivals-heroes-highest-pick-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our highest pick rates piece</a>, we’re taking into account competitive and quick play. For competitive play , we’re using current data from tracker sites&nbsp;<a href="https://rivalstracker.com/heroes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsTracker</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://rivalsmeta.com/characters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsMeta</a>. For quickplay, we’re using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hero Hot List</a>&nbsp;from the official Marvel Rivals website. Even though the Hero Hot List was last updated February 17th, it’s a better source of quickplay rates than the incomplete data on RivalsTracker and RivalsMeta.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Hero</strong></td><td><strong>Competitive Win Rate</strong></td><td><strong>Quick Play Win Rate</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Storm</td><td>54.29%</td><td>58.11%</td></tr><tr><td>Rocket Raccoon</td><td>54.04%</td><td>55.23%</td></tr><tr><td>Mantis</td><td>53.99%</td><td>55.65%</td></tr><tr><td>Magik</td><td>52.60%</td><td>53.14%</td></tr><tr><td>Peni Parker</td><td>52.44%</td><td>54.82%</td></tr><tr><td>Thor</td><td>52.15%</td><td>54.71%</td></tr><tr><td>Adam Warlock</td><td>52.12%</td><td>52.42%</td></tr><tr><td>Captain America</td><td>51.92%</td><td>53.45%</td></tr><tr><td>Mister Fantastic</td><td>51.87%</td><td>53.99%</td></tr><tr><td>Loki</td><td>51.25%</td><td>52.55%</td></tr><tr><td>Hela</td><td>49.81%</td><td>50.07%</td></tr><tr><td>Star Lord</td><td>49.78%</td><td>49.15%</td></tr><tr><td>Groot</td><td>49.71%</td><td>50.32%</td></tr><tr><td>Black Panther</td><td>49.71%</td><td>49.89%</td></tr><tr><td>Hulk</td><td>49.70%</td><td>51.87%</td></tr><tr><td>Iron Fist</td><td>49.55%</td><td>49.95%</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Soldier</td><td>49.46%</td><td>50.38%</td></tr><tr><td>Spider Man</td><td>49.17%</td><td>49.45%</td></tr><tr><td>Venom</td><td>49.15%</td><td>50.08%</td></tr><tr><td>Scarlet Witch</td><td>49.10%</td><td>50.48%</td></tr><tr><td>Doctor Strange</td><td>49.01%</td><td>50.72%</td></tr><tr><td>Iron Man</td><td>48.80%</td><td>50.08%</td></tr><tr><td>Magneto</td><td>48.72%</td><td>50.43%</td></tr><tr><td>Psylocke</td><td>48.33%</td><td>50.17%</td></tr><tr><td>Invisible Woman</td><td>48.12%</td><td>50.17%</td></tr><tr><td>Wolverine</td><td>47.72%</td><td>49.41%</td></tr><tr><td>Cloak &amp; Dagger</td><td>47.39%</td><td>51.42%</td></tr><tr><td>Namor</td><td>47.33%</td><td>50.72%</td></tr><tr><td>The Punisher</td><td>47.29%</td><td>48.32%</td></tr><tr><td>Luna Snow</td><td>47.26%</td><td>48.97%</td></tr><tr><td>Squirrel Girl</td><td>46.77%</td><td>50.40%</td></tr><tr><td>Hawkeye</td><td>45.88%</td><td>44.63%</td></tr><tr><td>Moon Knight</td><td>44.83%</td><td>49.09%</td></tr><tr><td>Jeff The Land Shark</td><td>43.59%</td><td>44.61%</td></tr><tr><td>Black Widow</td><td>40.74%</td><td>42.31%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The Human Torch and The Thing have not been included because the quickplay win rates for them are not available yet.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-strategists">Best Strategists</h3>



<h4 id="h-rocket-raccoon">Rocket Raccoon</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Rocket Raccoon’s sheer healing output and duelist-buffing teamup options establish him as the winningest strategist. He has a <strong>54.04% win rate in competitive, and a 55.23% win rate in quick play</strong>. His secondary fire healing can rapidly heal a group of allies stacked together, and both Punisher and Winter Soldier thrive when teamed with him. His damage amplifying ultimate also swings any teamfight in his side’s favor.</p>



<h4 id="h-mantis">Mantis</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mantis’ ability to provide healing and damage buffs, plus her individual firepower, make her on the same winning level as Rocket Raccoon. She has a <strong>53.99% win rate in competitive, and a 55.85% win rate in quick play</strong>. Mantis is especially strong at lower ranks, as her heals and buffs are easy to apply. She can also use her sleep and a personal damage boost to solo kill a squishy DPS that tries to challenge her.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-vanguards">Best Vanguards</h3>



<h4 id="h-peni-parker">Peni Parker</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Peni Parker is the winningest vanguard hero in Marvel Rivals. She has a <strong>52.44% win rate in competitive, and a 54.82% win rate in quick play</strong>. Peni has arguably the best ranged damage capabilities of any vanguard, and she’s an infuriating nuisance to dig out of an objective once they get their mines down.</p>



<h4 id="h-thor">Thor</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thor has the second highest win rates of any vanguard in Marvel Rivals. He has a <strong>52.15% win rate in competitive, and a 54.71% win rate in quick play</strong>. Thor’s ability to close the distance and thrive in the chaos of a hectic teamfight translate into huge winning potential.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-duelists">Best Duelists</h3>



<h4 id="h-storm">Storm</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Storm is the winningest hero in all of Marvel Rivals. She has a <strong>54.29% win rate in competitive, and a 58.11% win rate in quick play</strong>. Storm is a mobile, hard-to-hit, damage-dealing menace that can lead a teamfight with her thunderous Goddess Boost. There’s virtually no escape from her Omega Hurricane ultimate, especially when she can combo it with The Human Torch.</p>



<h4 id="h-magik">Magik</h4>



<figure></figure>



<p>Magik is the second most winning duelist in Marvel Rivals. She has a <strong>52.60% win rate in competitive, and a 53.14% win rate in quick play</strong>. Magik is one of the few pure melee characters in the duelist class, dashing through portals and swinging her sword at anything in range.</p>

            <p>
Point-and-click fans rejoice! After a long (and, if you're me, impatient) wait, Wadjet Eye Games - the dependably brilliant studio behind the likes of Unavowed and the Blackwell series - is finally ready to share a release date for its intriguing time-travelling adventure, Old Skies. And it's close, launching for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Switch on 23th April.
</p>
<p>
Old Skies, which was originally announced all the way back in June 2022, cast players as Fia Quinn - a time agent for the ChronoZen agency who's been tasked with keeping a close eye on seven travellers as they take their own trips to the past. "Some are simply curious," explains Wadjet Eye. "Others have unfinished business to resolve. And they've all put down a lot of money for the trip, so it's vital that you keep them happy while ensuring they follow the rules. But what could go wrong? It's only time travel, after all."
</p>
<p>
Seven travellers means seven distinct time periods spanning over 200 years of history to explore, with Old Skies taking players from speakeasies of Prohibition to the gangs of the Gilded Age, and even the morning of September 11th where a murder is waiting to be solved. It's got paradoxes to escape, puzzles to overcome - some requiring a spot of temporal thinking - and even the possibility of your adventure coming to a fatal halt. Although, as Wadjet Eye notes, the whole time travel thing means death is not the end.

<p>
Away from the story stuff, Old Skies features some (by Wadjet Eye's standards) positively futuristic 1920x1080 artwork - it marks the first time the developer has eschewed the chunky, distinctly old-school pixels of its past adventures - as well as music by Unavowed composer Thomas Regin, and full voice acting from the studio's "largest cast yet". You can get a general idea of how all that comes together in the trailer above, and Wadjet Eye's also released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAQ9UMzqZUQ">new trailer focusing on one of Old Skies seven cases</a>.
</p>
<p>
So there you go! Old Skies launches on 23rd April via Switch's eShop and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1346360/Old_Skies/">Steam</a>. And speaking as big fan of Wadjet Eye's consistently excellent back catalogue (which, incidentally, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/WadjetEyeGames">currently cheap as chips thanks to the Steam Spring Sale</a>), I can't blimmin' wait.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kcd-2-patch-1-2-out-now-all-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Warhorse Studios has published patch 1.2 in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, the stellar open-world RPG that was released last month. This update is gargantuan, coming in at a whopping 62 GB on PC – and comparable sizes on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox. It adds a few nice touches to the game but, more importantly, addresses <strong>more than 1,000 bug fixes</strong>.</p>



<p>Check out the key inclusions of patch 1.2 in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kcd2-1-2-patch-notes">KCD2 1.2 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>I’m not going to list the <strong>full patch notes </strong>for the 1.2 patch for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, or we’d be here all day.</p>



<p>Instead, I’ll invite you to hop over to Warhorse Studios’ site to <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">check the full breakdown</a> of the 1,000+ bug fixes, improvements, and quality-of-life adjustments.</p>



<p>At the top of the table with patch 1.2 sits the addition of the barber mode, which players can take advantage of in Zhelejov and Kuttenberg. With this new feature, you can adjust Henry’s hair and beard, further customising him as you see fit. It’s purely a cosmetic upgrade, though – it doesn’t have any bearing on the game itself.</p>



<p>Here are some of the key bug fixes addressed in the 1.2 patch for Kingdom Come 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>Players no longer die randomly after exiting a cart (very important stuff)</li>



<li>Multi-hit combos will now do more damage</li>



<li>Difficulty has been balanced across pickpocketing, lockpicking, stealth, bartering, and more</li>



<li>NPC daily schedules have been improved across the entire game (including tweaking the <strong>sweeping </strong>animation!)</li>



<li>‘Generally improved’ environment across both maps, including improving the look of Trosky Castle from further away</li>



<li>Improved road magnetism when riding a horse</li>



<li>Improved frame rate and performance in battles and built-up areas like Kuttenberg’s marketplaces</li>



<li>Shops no longer sell cobwebs (damn)</li>



<li>DLSS 4 Super Resolution can be enabled</li>
</ul>



<p>Ultimately, even the full patch notes stress that hundreds of other fixes aren’t mentioned in the report. This is one of the single biggest updates I’ve ever seen for the sheer number of issues it addresses. I can’t possibly think what might remain in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 that would need patching in the next update!</p>



<p>Have you played Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 yet? Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Focus Entertainment has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-3">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3</a> development has begun, which is great news for fans of one of the biggest hits of 2024.</p>
<p>“Your duty is not done,” the company writes on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/focus-entmt.com/post/3lkbkal3ils2k">BlueSky</a>. “We’re pleased to announce that the development for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 has officially begun at Focus Entertainment, Saber Interactive and Games Workshop.”</p>


<p>“Players can look forward to an immersive campaign, a multiplayer mode, and innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games,” they add. “We will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third instalment.”</p>
<p>It’s interesting to note how Focus frames the game’s development as being a collaboration between the three companies. This comes a few weeks after it was announced quite specifically that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/space-marine-2-devs-saber-and-hasbro-partner-for-a-tentpole-aaa-game/">Hasbro has signed the Space Marine 2 team</a> to develop one of their tentpole franchises into a game. There’s a lot of flexibility in how studios work these days, so Saber’s St. Petersburg studio could have multiple teams and new creative leads could be stepping up to work on Space Marine 3 while the old leads look to crack this new nut.</p>
<p>Either way, it will be a while before we actually get to see Space Marine 3, and if you were worried that Space Marine 2 would be dropped like an unloved toy from yesteryear, Focus have assured players that there is still plenty of support for that game to come, continuing on with the planned post-launch support roadmap.</p>

<p>They followed up, “We’ll share updates on this new title when the time is right. For now, our focus remains on delivering the best possible experience for Space Marine 2 players.”</p>
<p>There’s already been the dangled thread&nbsp;that support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> could continue after the end of the current roadmap. Back in February, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/06/space-marine-2-february-update-brings-the-datavault-tyranid-biovore/">on the cusp of Season 3 of content, the team said</a>, “Worry not, even if this roadmap ends in 2025, that doesn’t mean the game will not receive new content after that!”</p>
<p>Of course, it’s easy to start speculating what kind of challenge you’ll have to face when Space Marine 3 arrives. After battling Orks and Chaos in the first, Relic Entertainment developed game, Saber used their Swarm engine to great effect to let you fight Tyranids… and also Chaos – which the developers admitted was something they wished they hadn’t repeated. However, there were also teasers of other alien races sprinkled through Space Marine 2, with the appearance of Necron tombs hinting that these ancient robotic beings could be opponents in future…. and hopefully not Chaos again.</p>
<p>Even with that foible, Space Marine 2 goes down a treat for fans of Warhammer 40,000 in particular. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2 review</a>, we said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-x-first-hands-on-preview-the-new-dual-front-mode-reinvigorates-the-10-year-old-fps<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I was in high school, I would stay up ‘til all kinds of ungodly hours of the night playing PC games. I even stayed up five days straight once, just to get to the end of Baldur’s Gate II ‘Throne of Bhaal,’ but what fascinated me about PC games most was how inventive they could be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One that struck my imagination powerfully was Red Faction, which caught my eye because it had some of the hallmarks of DOOM (a high-tech, first-person shooter set on Mars, you say?) yet it added an essential wrinkle; terrain deformation. Red Faction is set in the mines of Mars, and I could fire explosive weapons at walls, creating holes or destroying them, and even tunneling through rock to circumvent checkpoints. It was all about charting your own course and finding your own path to accomplish your goals. It was incredible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, not a lot has been done with that idea in the intervening years, but when Rainbow Six Siege came out, the ability to freely climb and rappel up and down buildings, and shoot through or destroy walls and ceilings sent a delightful little tickle through my Red Faction-loving brain.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Siege began as a far more focused (and less exploratory) affair than the old Volition shooter, that (and quite a bit more) is about to change with the arrival of the upcoming Siege X update. Apart from gameplay, graphical, auditory, and UI enhancements, it introduces what is shaping up to be a fantastic new permanent multiplayer mode: Dual Front. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Dual Front, a predetermined seasonal Operator pool will dictate who you can play, and team sizes are bumped up to six per side. Instead of spawning directly inside (or outside) one target area, there are three large areas to choose from, each with its own objective, so your team of six will need to split up to focus on both defending and attacking different locations simultaneously. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the scope has expanded, much of the great core gameplay remains the same. When a match starts, each team will spawn in their squad HQ and one of two locations in your team’s sector will start a countdown to a Defend mission. The     is true for your opponents, so each team will need to defend one spot while attacking another. How you handle that, and where you decide to go, is up to you.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rainbow Six Siege X: Dual Front Mode Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s more, there is a neutral zone in between the mirrored zones held by each team, and extra objectives will appear there. Completing those objectives, such as rescuing a hostage and getting them to an extraction point, will give your team a big boost in the back-and-forth struggle for supremacy, so even if you fail to defend your first location or attack the enemy base, victory is still possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Dual Front expands the contested space so significantly, I was moving between attacking and defending to suit the team's needs, creating a more free flowing experience with way more variation between matches than your standard Siege match. What results is a fluid, chaotic mess I had a blast with.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Dual Front Mode is, so far, a fluid, chaotic mess I had a blast with.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The seasonal Operator pools will be updated every month, and because your squad will need to do a little bit of everything, you’ll have access to both Attacker and Defender Operators on the character select screen. When you die during a match, you’ll quickly respawn and re-select your Operator, so changing strategies on the fly to counter your enemies is a central (and delightfully fun) part of the game now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Several times during my preview, it looked like my current (attacking) team was in a great spot, so I would rush across the map to help my other beleaguered comrades who were fighting for their lives to defend our own base objective. Sometimes, everything was as it seemed: I arrived in time, and our team brought home a victory. Other times, I got separated from my team only for them to be ambushed by reinforcements. Each match was tense, because in maps as large as Dual Front’s, it’s difficult to know where the enemy is until they become a capital “p” Problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of navigating larger areas, I should mention some of the new gameplay additions. You can now rappel around corners of buildings and even sprint while rappelling, so it’s easier to poke around and find ways to get inside structures. New fire extinguishers create concussive blasts and visual obfuscation when destroyed, gas pipes can be shot or damaged to create jets of fire before exploding and scattering fire around on the ground, and metal detectors can be disabled temporarily or permanently. Overall, it’s more fun to play in the space, and there is a lot more space to play in on Dual Front’s mirrored map.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege X also marks a shift in monetization. After the update, Siege will adopt a free-to-play model, and for casual versus competitive stuff, here’s the skinny: casual and onboarding playlists, unranked quickplay, and Dual Front are all free, and will grant access to up to 26 Operators and skins. Siege Cup and Ranked modes will be pay-to-unlock, and grant access to all 50 Operators. So if you are jumping in as a casual player, there are no barriers to entry, but new players who want to get more serious on the competitive side will need to fork over some cash. If you already have Siege, don’t worry; you will keep everything you have, and retain access to all modes (and as an added bonus, Siege players will get a badge showing off the year they started and a little bonus for each year of Siege they played).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some other updates in the Siege X package include five modernized maps (Clubhouse, Chalet, Bank, Kafe, and Border), enhanced visuals, audio, first-person shadows, new menus, better player onboarding, the ability to inspect weapons, and a lot more. The dev team has also committed to introduce a new Operator (or remastering an existing one) each season, and a bunch more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But all those enhancements pale in comparison to Dual Front, which is on track to become my favorite mode for Siege, and once Siege X launches, it’s likely to be the only mode I’ll play as Siege marks its upcoming tenth birthday in an incredibly fun way.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Hazelight took <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1900204006451925484" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to social media</a> to celebrate the strong launch, saying that it’s “blown away” by the support from fans both new and old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team’s previous update on Split Fiction sales numbers revealed that a whopping 1 million players picked up Mio and Zoe’s sci-fi story <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-sells-one-million-copies-in-48-hours"><u>only 48 hours after its initial launch</u></a>. That means another million have each picked up a copy in the five days since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Split Fiction’s status as a co-op game means the actual number of players engaging with the experience is surely much higher than the number of copies sold. Bolstering its impact with gaming fans is its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/features/friends-pass-pc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Friend’s Pass</u></a> feature, which allows one player to purchase the game while granting a friend access at no additional cost. As Hazelight’s adventure continues to make waves on social media, that 2 million sold number will surely only increase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hazelight’s previous title, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2021-winners-revealed"><u>2021 Game of the Year winner It Takes Two</u></a>, saw similar success after selling around <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-two-selling-1-million-copies-shows-that-players-want-co-op-only-games-josef-fares-says"><u>1 million copies a few weeks after its launch</u></a> in March 2021.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-coming-courtesy-of-steamforged-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steamforged Games has announced <em>Helldivers 2: The Board Game</em>. The tabletop studio known for creating complex bespoke tabletop games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/runescape-kingdoms-shadow-of-elvarg-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Runescape Kingdoms</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-announces-sea-of-thieves-voyage-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a> will bring Arrowhead Game Studios' satirical sci-fi shooter to gaming tables.</p>

<h2>The <em>Helldivers 2: The Board Game</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Helldivers 2: The Board Game will be produced through a crowdfunding campaign on Gamefound. Much like the Helldivers 2 videogame, the board game will be a fast-paced, tactical co-op game for one to four players. Those players will utilize deadly weapons, powerful stratagems, and coordinated tactics to overcome enemy threats in service of Super Earth.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-the-board-game-enemy-miniature.jpg?itok=zg2yvAtD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-the-board-game-enemy-miniature.jpg?itok=bBOIHK3t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition, <em>Helldivers 2: The Board Game</em> will translate the game's escalation and tongue-in-cheek humor. Objectives and threats will evolve as players progress. This will mean avoiding dangerous explosions, overwhelming waves of enemies, and the most dangerous threat of all: friendly fire. Every decision you make can mean the difference between glorious victory or total annihilation.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> released on PC and PlayStation 5 in February 2024. It is one of PlayStation's fastest selling video games, selling over 12 million copies within its first 12 weeks. In addition, it has several accolades such as Best Multiplayer from the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards and The Game Awards 2024.</p>

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios' CEO Shams Jorjani said the following about working with Steamforged Games on <em>Helldivers 2: The Board Game</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As passionate tabletop gamers ourselves, we're delighted to partner with Steamforged to bring Helldivers 2 into a whole new realm. The game's intense action is a perfect fit for the tabletop experience, and we can't wait for players to blast their way through its chaotic and challenging missions soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Steamforged Games' reputation in tabletop games is stellar. In addition to making impressive board games based on videogame properties, they have also produced great TTRPG products and accessories such as their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-palace-of-drow-queen-and-lair-of-drider-review-new-shade-of" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Epic Encounters</em></a> miniature boxes.</p>

<p>The Gamefound campaign for <em>Helldivers 2: The Board Game</em> will go live on April 8, 2025.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Following a hugely successful launch that saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hits-1m-sales-in-just-one-day">over 1m people snapping up Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 in just 24 hours</a>, developer Warhorse Studios continues to plug away at its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-post-launch-roadmap-bringing-barbers-horse-riding-and-more">post-release roadmap</a>. And that brings us to today, and the release of the medieval action-RPG's 1.2 update, adding mod support, a barber shop, and "over a thousand" fixes and improvements.
</p>
<p>
According to Warhorse, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>'s 1.2 update features "a host of fixes, improvements, and rebalancing tweaks" designed to ensure "a smoother, more immersive medieval experience". These include combat refinements, enhanced NPC behaviour, more polished animations, and performance optimisations. The update also improves the physics of your parsnip, which (probably) isn't a euphemism.
</p>
<p>
The full list of changes is long enough that it's probably safer to <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2">link to Warhorse's patch notes</a> rather than risk breaking this page. But the flagship additions include Kingdom Come Deliverance 2's aforementioned barber shops and PC-only mod support. Starting with the former, those looking for a natty follicular makeover will be wanting to visit Zhelejov and Kuttenberg. Here, they can change protagonist Henry's hairstyle or pick from a variety of facial hair options, including designer stubble, a full beard, or simply clean-shaven. Regardless, a fresh trim isn't just for aesthetics - it'll temporarily buff Henry's charisma.

<p>
As for mod support, it's described as a new suite of tools offering greater accessibility and direct Steam Workshop integration. "Whether you want to tweak mechanics, expand the world, or forge entirely new adventures, the tools are in your hands," writes Warhorse. "Get ready to create, customise, and bring your own vision to life in the medieval world."
</p>
<p>
Today's 1.2 update - which is available for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC - marks the first in a series of free post-launch additions for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, previously revealed to include horse racing and a new Hardcode Mode promising a "greater challenge". That's alongside three paid story expansions - Brushes with Death, Legacy of the Forge, and Mysteria Ecclesia - due this summer, autumn, and winter respectively.
</p>
<p>
"It is a hard and maddening slog at times," Eurogamer's Katharine Castle wrote of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">her three star review</a>, "but one that still has its moments where it surprises and quietly delights. Like the original, this isn't an RPG designed to make you feel good - you continue to be little more than a passenger in this historical tapestry, following along behind the horse tails of Henry's betters, and clearing up the mess they leave behind. Some will revel in that work, but I for one won't be chomping at the bit for another sequel any time soon."

Not to be confused with the Rainbow Six Siege 2 some may have been expecting, the update makes a ton of changes to Rainbow Six Siege, big and small. Those include the first new permanent game mode since launch, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dual-front-brings-fast-paced-6v6-action-to-rainbow-six-siege/1100-6530104/" data-ref-id="1100-6530104">6v6 Dual Front</a>, which is designed to provide a new tactical experience for long-time players, as well as a friendly mode for new players to learn the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of the big reveal I got to spend a few hours playing Dual Front, as well as the classic 5v5 mode on modernized versions of existing maps, which have drastically improved lighting and textures, plus a few other changes to the classic formula. While the name and framing might make it seem similar to other live-service titles getting major updates as sequels, like Overwatch 2, Siege X is more about bringing the decade-old-shooter up to modern standards, without losing anything in the process.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Dual Front brings faster paced action to Siege</h2><p dir="ltr">Dual Front is a new permanent 6v6 mode coming to Rainbow Six Siege X when the update launches. This mode features one large map, with two lanes on each side and a neutral zone in the middle. Each lane has two sectors, which serve as small maps, leading into the enemy team's base. Team's will be tasked with taking control of the enemy sectors, one at a time, while also defending their own. How you decide to split up your team of six is up to you, and when players are killed, they do respawn after a roughly 30-second wait. When you respawn, you also have the option to swap operators, with a mix of offensive and defensive operators available. Matches are expected to last around 20-25 minutes, with a maximum of 30 minutes, which lined up with my experience while playing. A match could end much quicker if one team moves through sectors without much resistance.</p><p dir="ltr">While the mode sounds overwhelming on paper, in practice it's a distilled version of Siege. Each sector has a small building, like a gas station or firehouse, which serves as the map. These sectors are also mirrored structurally, so each team has the exact same objectives, although each side of the map does have a slightly different aesthetic. Each team only has one sector active at a time, so the action gets focused into the smaller area. These feature multiple potential sites for planting a bomb, with one chosen randomly at the start of the match. During my time playing Dual Front, I found the mode to offer tons of new strategies not present in the main 5v5 mode.</p><p dir="ltr">In our first match, the team split up into groups of three, one focused on offense and one on defense. The enemy team ended up doing something similar, but after we took over the first enemy sector, they shifted to having more team members on defense, allowing us to send some defenders on the attack. You can get from one end of the map to the other fairly quickly by moving through the neutral zone in the center, but you risk running into enemy players. You also have the option to move through your own sectors and base for a safer, but much longer path, but there is nothing stopping you from moving from one objective to another as needed.</p><p dir="ltr">Where the strategy comes in, is that you don't know just how many players on the enemy team are focused on each objective. At the start of the second match, we sent five people on attack and left one on defense. This worked out well for the first set of sectors, as their defense wasn't prepared for that many people, and the attackers didn't know just how many people were defending our objective, causing them to play too cautiously against a single defender.</p><p dir="ltr">The other new wrinkle here is that the operator limitations are no longer based on offense and defense. Dual Front will feature a pool of operators--35 at the launch of Siege X--which will rotate twice per season. Creative Director Alexander Karpazis told me that the number isn't set in stone, with plans to shift the pool significantly and with built-in synergies, to allow for the mode to feel different season-to-season.</p><p dir="ltr">I picked Frost, a defensive operator who can place bear traps that will down enemies who step on them. After pushing on offense and planting on their sector, we had to defend it for a few minutes as the capture meter ticked up. With a defensive operator and access to wall reinforcements, I was able to lock down the objective for us to hold it, quickly shifting our offense to defense.</p><p dir="ltr">As for future plans for Dual Front, Karpazis told me that while the current plans are to evolve the map every season with small changes and different operator pools, but depending on the community's reaction to Dual Front, there could be more maps and even potentially a ranked mode in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Dual Front also gave me a chance to see some of the new additions coming with Siege X that will also appear in the classic 5v5 mode. Rappelling has been upgraded, adding the ability to sprint along the side of buildings and to turn corners. New "Destructible Ingredients" are additions to the environment that provide new tactics. For example, fire extinguishers are now present, which create a smoke screen when shot and will concuss nearby players. There are gas pipes, which spew fire when shot before exploding, letting you block off a pathway temporarily, or blow up any gadgets nearby. These are found throughout the Dual Front map and the new 5v5 modernized maps.</p><h2 dir="ltr">5v5 modernized maps and ranked improvements</h2><p dir="ltr">Rainbow Six Siege X will also include five modernized maps: Clubhouse, Chalet, Bank, Kafe, and Border. Modernized means multiple pretty significant changes, but none of them are to the map layouts themselves. Those are the same, including the bomb sites, but the feel is quite different, thanks to some improved looks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458920-pvp04_clubhouse_intlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458920" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458920-pvp04_clubhouse_intlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458920"></a><figcaption>The new look for Clubhouse</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458920-pvp04_clubhouse_intlarge.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458921-pvp04_clubhouse_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458922-pvp09_bank_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458923-pvp09_bank_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458924-pvp10_chalet_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458925-pvp10_chalet_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458926-pvp12_russiancafe_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458927-pvp13_border_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458928-pvp13_border_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458929-r6x_ka-16_9_largelarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458921,1300-4458922,1300-4458923,1300-4458924,1300-4458925,1300-4458926,1300-4458927,1300-4458928,1300-4458929" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458921-pvp04_clubhouse_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458922-pvp09_bank_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458923-pvp09_bank_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458924-pvp10_chalet_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458925-pvp10_chalet_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458926-pvp12_russiancafe_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458927-pvp13_border_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458928-pvp13_border_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458929-r6x_ka-16_9_largelarge.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458921-pvp04_clubhouse_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458922-pvp09_bank_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458923-pvp09_bank_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458924-pvp10_chalet_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458925-pvp10_chalet_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458926-pvp12_russiancafe_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458927-pvp13_border_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458928-pvp13_border_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458929-r6x_ka-16_9_largelarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The three most important changes are to textures, lighting, and sound. For textures, the majority of surfaces had their resolutions doubled, creating more detail in the environments. There is also an optional 4K texture patch on PC, allowing players with high-end rigs to enjoy even sharper textures. This combines with a new lighting system, meant to provide more realistic shadows and illuminations. In practice, this changes the way maps look significantly. Not only are areas like the brick walls of Clubhouse far sharper in detail, but the new lighting system allows the red brick to have a more saturated look.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this comes together to create a noticeable and significant coat of paint on these maps. While much of this doesn't necessarily impact gameplay, there are some aspects that do. For example, the new lighting system creates more detailed and realistic shadows for players. It also allows you to see your own shadow, which is important because standing too close to a doorway could mean casting a shadow into the next room, potentially giving away your position.</p><p dir="ltr">The audio improvements also make a huge difference. The main improvements here are the direction, reverb, and muffling. Now, when gunshots or footsteps are heard, it's much clearer which direction it's coming from, both horizontally and vertically. In Dual Front, I was able to give much clearer callouts to my teammates when I heard enemies approaching, thanks to the improved sound. The reverb now changes based on the size of the room, and gunshots heard through walls are more muffled, making it easier to tell not only which direction a sound came from, but if it was in another room or not. In a methodical, tactical shooter like Siege, audio is incredibly important and these improvements felt immediately noticeable in match.</p><p dir="ltr">Siege X is launching with five modernized maps, but Ubisoft confirmed that, each season, three additional maps will get the modernized treatments. Starting in Year 11, brand-new maps with these features will start to be added regularly as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458930-pvp12_russiancafe_intlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458930" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458930-pvp12_russiancafe_intlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458930"></a><figcaption>The revamped Kafe Dostoyevsky</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458930-pvp12_russiancafe_intlarge.jpeg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">New player onboarding and veteran rewards</h2><p dir="ltr">Part of the hope for Siege X is that it will create another opportunity for new players to jump into the multiplayer shooter. Dual Front, a mode with respawns, is a big part of this push, but Ubisoft is also moving Siege to a "free-to-access" model. This model will allow players to jump in for free, with a guided experience from level 1 to 20.</p><p dir="ltr">While the onboarding will certainly make the new-player experience easier, Karpazis did point out that the barrier to entry can't be completely removed, since Siege is a game with over 75 operators, all of whom have different special gadgets to use. There will still be an intense learning curve for new players, but the hope is that this more on-rails start will at least ease some of that pain.</p><p dir="ltr">This onboarding experience will unlock new modes, tutorials, and operators as they level up, with a total of 26 operators unlocked in this leveling experience. Free players can enjoy everything Siege has to offer, with two exceptions: Ranked and the Siege Cup, ranked tournaments that serve as the most competitive offering Siege has. Unranked, TDM, Dual Front, and any other mode can be accessed by free players, with no time limits or restrictions. Karpazis told me that he expects many players to play the game exclusively for free, although it's important to note that free players will still be able to purchase microtransactions, like new operators and cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">Karpazis told me that this new model makes it easier than ever for new players to try out Siege, with Dual Front as a premier mode to attract them, without compromising the Ranked experience of Siege. He said that the price of the game to get access to Ranked and Siege Cup isn't changing from what it's currently at--$20 USD, but regularly discounted. He also noted this decision should help to curb Smurfing--making a new account to play in lower-ranked lobbies--an issue that many free-to-play shooters have struggled to deal with.</p><p dir="ltr">Ranked is also getting a minor change to the way operator bans work. Instead of teams going back and forth, making multiple bans at the start of a match, each team will simultaneously ban one operator before each round, shortening the time it takes to get into a match and allowing for more strategic bans based on which operators the other team picks. These bans are reset when teams switch sides and all bans are disabled in the event of overtime.</p><p dir="ltr">For longtime players of Siege, they will be happy to know that nothing currently in the game is going anywhere. All of their cosmetics and purchased operators will be available with Siege X, and existing players will receive some in-game rewards as well. While Ubisoft didn't tell us what the rewards are, players will receive them for each year of Siege they have played and a special badge based on which year they first started playing.</p><p dir="ltr">Rainbow Six Siege X surprised me, as I was expecting a far more massive overhaul to the shooter, similar to over live-service games in the space. Instead, Ubisoft has chosen to not touch what players love about Siege and what makes it unique, which is the methodical, slow-moving tactical-shooter gameplay focused on breaching and defending spaces. Dual Front builds upon that idea, giving more flexibility without compromising the core premise, and importantly, not replacing anything. The modernized maps feel like meaningful improvements, even if the changes are more on the periphery than in the core gameplay. Siege X is attempting to thread a needle that has alluded other multiplayer games, but a focus on adding without removing features or drastically changing the core of the game makes Siege X feel like an update that could satisfy both new players and people who have been playing for a decade.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft also teased that there are some reveals for Siege X that haven't been shared just yet, with a Reload event in May, prior to the launch of Siege X. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-x-closed-beta-starts-today-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6530117/" data-ref-id="1100-6530117">Siege X closed beta</a> is also now underway.</p>

<p>As part of that there’s a whole host of technical improvements and updates to the core game, but perhaps the biggest announcement here is that the game is going free-to-play with free access to the bulk of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> experience – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-new-dual-front-mode-why-just-attack-or-defend-when-you-can-do-both/">including the new Dual Front mode</a> – while a paid tier (or a prior purchase) locks away certain modes and operators.</p>
<p>There’s a significant visual overhaul, with Ubisoft going back to rework all of the main materials within the game, upping the detail for things as fundamental as brick walls and wooden planks. Alongside that, there’s refreshed lighting and reflections that are best seen in the maps Clubhouse, Chalet, Bank, Russian Cafe, and Border. The change can feel very subtle without side-by-side comparisons, but the emphasis is basically on making lighting more realistic, so rooms will likely be a notch darker and light sources, like the sun streaming through windows in Bank, more important. Three more maps will be modernised in the same way with every season going forward, and a new map will be added each season from Year 11.</p>

<p>Maps will also feature new destructible ingredients that can be used tactically. Fire extinguishers can create a temporary smoke screen or even concuss anyone caught in their blast. Gas pipes will cut off an area with a flame that gradually concentrates before exploding to set an area on fire for a little while, and metal detectors are now interactive, and can be disabled temporarily or permanently.</p>
<p>Audio has been given the 2.0 treatment with better sound propagation and better reverb to make it easier to tell where things are coming from. Sound now passes through walls, instead of just bouncing around the environments, and sounds in a small room will have a different reverb to those in a large room or coming from the exterior.</p>
<p>Oh, and they returned to the motion capture studio to dramatically improve rappelling. You can now rappel round corners, and you can sprint along walls for faster repositioning – though obviously they’ll hear you stomping on the walls from the inside.</p>

<p>Along with all of this there’s to be an overhauled esports section in the menu UI, and Pick and Ban has been rejigged to make it quicker – both teams will choose at the same time, and then get a chance to amend picks and bans when swapping between attack and defence. For prospective newcomers there’s a redone onboarding progression and, most significantly, a shift to free access to the game – ranked, esports and access to the full character roster will require that you pay or have already paid. There’s new tutorials and a Clearance Levels onboarding system that aims to get new players up to speed, first against bots, then other players in Quick Match, before Unranked returns as the standard playlist and feeds into Ranked.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege X isn’t a full sequel, but it’s still an important step for the game. There’s the excitement and intrigue that a new game mode inevitably brings, sensible improvements throughout, and making the game free to play and with a new introduction to the game can bring this to a wider audience once more.</p>

From the looks of it, the studio isn’t just aiming to put its acclaimed RPG on a tiny screen and call it a day, but is instead restructuring the game to fit phones by trimming out some of the exploration mechanics and basically turning it into a visual novel, which could help you play the game in quicker bursts, rather than sitting down at your PC or console for hours a day.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,197298,197284" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That’s the idea, anyway.

Havel also says:</p><p>“Mobile players deserve deep, story-rich experiences, like <em>Disco Elysium</em>.

                <p>The race to be the first to clear the Mythic difficulty version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> new Liberation of Undermine raid is still ongoing, though a group of exploiters have already technically cleared it. Twice.</p><p dir="ltr">It all happened last week when the raid launched. A guild by the name of RAoV (Random Acts of Violation) Quality Assurance managed to, somehow, clear the raid's final boss, Gallywix, before any other boss in the raid while decked out in practically useless grey items. As soon as the feat began appearing on raid-tracking sites like WoWProgress, Raider.IO, and even Blizzard's own WoW Hall of Fame, players started scratching their heads over how it was done. Blizzard, however, was already on the case.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXDdl5IDdKE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YXDdl5IDdKE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We immediately began an investigation into these unusual kills, and we detected a group of new accounts using an exploit to cast an internal spell to kill Mythic raid bosses, including Chrome King Gallywix," WoW community manager Kaivax said on the game's <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/rwf-cheating/2071020/60" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forums</a>. "Our security engineers quickly moved to put a stop to the cheat and take action against the accounts involved, and we have cleared the Hall of Fame to await the rightful winner to the RWF."</p><p dir="ltr">It seemed like the problem had been solved and the exploiters punished. Until it happened again on March 10, when a guild appearing to be the same group but using the name "ecnarussAeR ytilauQ VoAR" (RAoV Quality Reassurance spelled backwards) struck a second time. For <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/exploiters-return-and-call-out-blizzard-kill-gallywix-mythic-again/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">round two</a>, the group killed every boss using the exploit, and to add a cherry on top, one of the exploiters on the Raider.IO listing for the clear quoted Kaivax's forum post and issued a response of their own: "QA is really hard." The second clear was also quickly scrubbed from raid-tracking sites.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-first-gallywix-exploit-quickly-removed-by-blizzard-375618" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, the guild committing these recent exploits shares a name with an older hacking and exploit group that was shut down in 2018 after Blizzard issued them a Cease and Desist letter. It's currently unclear if this new RAoV is the same one from years ago, or merely a new group coopting the old name. Many of the exploiters used names similar to various WoW YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@rextroy3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rextroy</a> (who does routinely break Blizzard's MMORPG in more light-hearted, less nefarious ways), seemingly as a means of throwing investigators off the scent.</p><p dir="ltr">Players are already gathering <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1j8sy76/sir_a_third_exploit_has_hit_the_mythic_gallagio/?sort=new" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">evidence</a> that may point towards a third clear using the exploit, though time will tell if that is indeed the case. In the meantime, Team Liquid and Team Echo are currently in a race to bring down the raid's final two bosses legitimately, while WoW players who couldn't care less about the Race to World First are pouring over newly revealed details on how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">WoW's in-the-works player-housing system will handle interior decoration</a>.</p>
