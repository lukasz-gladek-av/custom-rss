            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lumines-arise-is-going-to-be-your-chill-out-game-of-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As soon as I saw <em>Lumines Arise by Enhance</em> make its debut at the State of Play, I was excited. While I haven't played Lumines titles in the past, I was one of the millions to get hooked into the gameplay-audio-visual experience that was <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="afa641fb-5d53-43f0-b390-fc3bc40fea45" href="https://techraptor.net/games/tetris-effect" rel="nofollow"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a>. Lucky for me <em>Lumines Arise</em> was also at Summer Game Fest where I was able to check out the first three levels of the game.</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> is a block-dropping game where your aim is to destroy enough blocks to be able to complete a level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <em>Lumines Arise,</em> you're always dropping a 2x2 cube made up of two different types of shapes. Much like in <em>Tetris Effect,&nbsp;</em>as you progress through different levels and songs what you're dropping will pretty much always be changing. Even across the few levels I played I saw the blocks include coins, spherical wind effects, a nut (as in 'nut and bolt'), and what seemed to be AC Compressors.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lumines-arise-seahorses.jpg?itok=BZknXJxz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lumines-arise-seahorses.jpg?itok=7r1738qj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As you're dropping your 2x2 cube of differing units, your goal is to create squares out of the pieces that have already been dropped. When you have a 2x2 cube of a single shape that's easy enough, but sometimes they'll be one shape on the left and one on the right, or opposite corners from one another. Create a 2x2 cube, 4x4 or even larger cubes to earn points.</p>

<p>A major difference to a title like <em>Tetris Effect</em>, where when you achieve a line it disappears, the squares you make in <em>Lumines Arise</em> only disappear once the line that is continuously moving from left to right passes over it. This opens up fast gameplay to creating combos, and even setting up additional cubes for when one set disappears.</p>

<p>The further you progress the faster the game plays, you'll need to work even harder to ensure you're spinning boxes appropriately, making quick matches, and giving the line enough time to clear out the groupings you've made.</p>

<h2>The Audio-Visual Feast Of <em>Lumines Arise</em></h2>

<p>At time-limited gameplay appointments it's key to be able to talk about a game while playing it, maximizing your chance to not only experience the game but hear from an expert near you about what the game will entail and why excited gamers will want to play it. That was not the case for me at <em>Lumines Arise</em>.</p>

<p>Sitting there with headphones on, watching the colorful blocks spin, strange chameleons dance, and the score rising I took 15 minutes to get through the provided levels and it was one of the most relaxing and focused experiences of the show for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Game For Many Experience Levels</strong><br>
After my completion I was advised that what took me 15 minutes took some returning players 7 minutes, and others 22.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much like Tetris Effect, each level of the game has a unique soundtrack, effects, and symbols. Each of these isn't just a repetition, a song on loop, but also speeds up, and slows down with the game pairing together all elements of the game to be in sync in an incredibly satisfying way.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lumines-arise-chameleons.jpg?itok=KQxRqQz_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lumines-arise-chameleons.jpg?itok=XgCloVOj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There will also be playlist options so while you're playing, you can jam out to your favorite tracks.</p>

<h2><em>Lumines Arise</em> Confirms Multiplayer And Campaign</h2>

<p>In talking with CJ, Product Manager at Enhance, about the gameplay options when <em>Lumines Arise</em> releases on Steam and PS5 later this year he indicated that it would come with a full Journey mode, taking players through keenly curated levels, but that it would also have an Endless mode to zone out and try for your highest score.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"At it's core it's about forming two by two squares, but the skill ceiling is so huge" - CJ, Product Manager at Enhance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, <em>Lumines Arise</em> will have multiplayer modes, though he wasn't able to tell me more about those at this time. Whatever those multiplayer modes are though will be enjoyable in the Summer Demo that will be coming along before too long.</p>

<p>One gameplay mode that CJ advised a lot of effort was being put into was the training mode. This is being developed so that while the game is completable by simple clearing each level when you want to challenge others online or go for the longest streak possible in Endless mode that you'll have all of the tools at your disposal.</p>

<p>If you're not a fan of loud music, pulsing and shifting icons, and technicolor images moving up, down, around, and through your screen then worry not. <em>Lumines Arise</em> features a wide variety of accessibility options to make sure as many players as possible can experience the game.</p>

<p>Some of the accessibility features mentioned were that you can change any of the screen effects, make the play field static, can normalize the look of the blocks for easier recognition, and <em>Lumines Arise</em> will also include colorblind settings.</p>

<p>The game also has three different difficulty modes, and an additional setting that the blocks are the top of the screen won't start dropping automatically.</p>

<p>You can control nearly even level of the single player experience.</p>

<p><em>Lumines Arise</em> is doing for <em>Lumines </em>for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fea07652-3892-4b73-b789-13e6a4c5b930" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tetris-effect-review-full-of-stars" rel="nofollow"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a> did for <em>Tetris</em>. It's bringing a curated story experience, perfect to zone out to, and a fun new level of play for fans of the dropping blocks genre.</p>

<p>It's a game where you'll be able to continuously challenge your speed and wit while getting to enjoy beautiful visuals and engaging music.</p>

<p>That being said, at it's core it is still a game about dropping blocks to solve puzzles and moving on. If you're not a fan of this genre then it's not likely Lumines Arise will be what convinces you to enjoy it, but if you do at least enjoy good atmospheric EDM tracks then it's probably at least worth a few rounds.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-preview-focused-on-teamwork</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-preview-%E2%80%93-focused-on-teamwork.1216125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pathfinder-abomination-vaults-preview-focused-on-teamwork<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Surprisingly enough, <em>Pathfinder </em>hasn’t had a ton of video game adaptations, though the team at BKOM Studios is here to change that. They’re taking one of Pathfinder’s most popular Adventure Paths, Abominations Vaults, and turning into a hack and slash RPG.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Classic Hack and Slash</h2>

<p>What I played at SGF Play Days was a vertical slice of the game that is not quite finished. If you’re familiar with isometric hack and slash games like<em> Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance</em>, the old <em>Gauntlet </em>games, or the <em>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</em> games, you know what I’m getting at.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you play, there are always four characters (an AI will control those not played by someone) that work together on the field. They have complementary abilities, like healing each other or setting up combos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One unique aspect was that each had an AoE they could throw on the ground that then buffs the heavy attack of your friends with a unique effect while they stand in it. Those sort of interactions are exactly what they want to happen throughout the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When talking to Creative Director Wyatt Gray, he described the design philosophy of the game and what he envisions certain elements of the game to be like.</p>

<h2>Focusing on Teamwork</h2>

<p>For one, he wasn’t looking for a mindless hack and slash but something that really emphasized cooperation and the party working together to accomplish some task. That can come in the form of combat, navigating the level, solving puzzles, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, we all worked together to push large boulders out of the way to get further in the level. In another area, there was a noxious gas slowly killing us that could be relieved by a healing mist from some nearby mushrooms two party members could then activate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a more advanced way, Gray mentioned scenarios where two people in the party may be rowing and controlling a raft while the other two defend them from enemies attacking. They want to get creative in the scenarios they put players in to have to overcome together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To that end, even if you’re playing solo, <em>Abomination Vaults</em> will always feature four heroes running around with you. You have the option of swapping through them at any time while playing as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gray noted that for a solo player, it is a slightly different game. You can fine tune characters to be a singular killing machine that sets up combos the way you want, where multiplayer lets you and some friends play each character the way they want.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Pathfinder Adventure Classic</h2>

<p>The four characters you play are likely well-known to Pathfinder players: Amiri the Barbarian, Harsk the Ranger, Kyra the Cleric, and Ezren the Wizard. Fans of Owlcat Games may remember Amiri the Barbarian, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each character will have three different subclasses you can choose, which vastly change up their gameplay style. And of course there’s a ton of gear that will let you build them as you please.</p>



<p>Moreover, if you’ve played through the Adventure Path of <em>Abomination Vaults</em> of the pen and paper variety of <em>Pathfinder</em>, most of this game is going to be very familiar to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gray said that their game is essentially an adaptation of the 1 – 10 experience of <em>Abomination Vaults</em>, so the characters, settings, and story beats will remain the same. Obviously there will be some minor changes to make it work for a game, but by and large it’s the same thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the end, <em>Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults</em> looks like it will be a good time, particularly with friends. It has a let’s grab some food and drinks, chill for a bit, and just go on an adventure vibe"... sort of like the tabletop version of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p>Pathfinder: Abomination Vaults was previewed at Summer Game Fest and is looking to release in 2026 only on PC currently.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Party Preview - A More Interactive Party Game]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lego-party-preview-more-interactive-party-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-party-preview-a-more-interactive-party-game.1216119/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lego-party-preview-more-interactive-party-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>LEGO </em>games always have a certain charm and humor to them that always makes for a good time. That same wit, whacky, and unserious atmosphere permeates <em>LEGO Party</em>. Is it <em>Mario Party</em>? Well, yes but also no.</p>

<h2>Is LEGO Party Just Mario Party?</h2>

<p>It’s impossible not to compare <em>LEGO Party</em> to <em>Mario Party</em>, and it’s set up in a similar way. The main game is set up on a board with spaces, minigames in between, and you're collecting gold bricks instead of stars. Though, there are some change ups and nice quality of life features that <em>Party </em>fans will be happy to hear about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for changes, <em>LEGO Party</em> doesn’t have a set turn order. That is determined by the order of where everyone placed in the minigame prior. Each new game is kicked off with that initial minigame before you start moving on the board.</p>



<p>Whoever wins the first minigame not only has the first turn of the game, but they also have a huge advantage. Everyone starts with enough bits to buy a gold brick, and the first gold brick is always just a few spaces from the start. A quick way to get an early lead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One big change is just how much more interactive and just plain active the game is while you’re playing.<em> LEGO Party </em>tries to have very little downtime where even the screen showing minigame winners is a little box you can run around and slap each other in. Where something like <em>Mario Party</em> can have great theming in one of the boards,<em> LEGO Party</em> enlivens it with an announcer that helps really sell the competition you’re in on top of all the board's quirks.</p>

<h2>LEGO Party Is Full of Charm and Jokes</h2>

<p>There are over 13,000 unique lines of dialogue for that announcer written by the writer of <em>LEGO City Undercover</em>. Some of that is set up for what is happening on screen, and there is a lot of reactivity to what just happened, like a drastic change in who is winning.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>LEGO Party </em>is set up as though you’re participating in a game show, so the announcer plays a big role and that’s why he always has something to say. It is all laced with the classic <em>LEGO </em>humor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The contestants of said game show, you and your friends, can make the minifigure of your dreams if you want as well. They are fully customizable, from the head, torso, legs, hats, and all other accoutrements that you may desire. We didn’t get to play with it much, as we all know how easy it is to get lost in character customization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At launch, there will be four different boards that all play quite differently. We played the smaller pirate themed board, which was full of interesting hazards and unique board elements that fit the theme. For example, you would get picked up and thrown to a different part of the board by a giant tentacle or could rebuild a pirate ship to bury treasure (gold bricks) around the map.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other maps were larger, with one based on <em>Ninjago</em>, another in space, and the last was a theme park-like in that there were four distinct areas that each acted very differently from the other. They’re each designed for a certain play length, and we found that six turns is about 30 minutes of gameplay.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minigames are Flash Games Inspired</h2>

<p>Minigames are a pretty big step up from what you might see in something like <em>Mario Party</em>. Developer SMG Studio said that a couple of their designers have a deep history with making classic flash games, hundreds of them in fact, which you can really see in the minigame design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one, it was a downhill snowboarding game that seemed ripped from my childhood, another was a <em>Splatoon</em>-like where we had to run over sections of the map to paint them our brick color, and another was pretty much just straight up <em>Trials </em>and whoever got furthest in the time would win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the board itself, there are quite a few opportunities to level the playing field. For example, someone landed on a dueling space that pitted us 2v2 (there is no 1v1, everyone is always involved in everything) where the winning team would get a golden brick. High stakes and it made the minigame that much more fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are also things like hidden bricks that may net you a golden brick just by luck and a lot of shenanigans built into the boards to knock people off the top so they don't get too far ahead.</p>

<p>We played a condensed version, but it felt that every turn who was up top was changing. There is a lot of “rubberbanding” to keep everyone in a similar playing field. By that, I also mean that there is a lot of random shenanigans with seemingly no explanation like <em>Mario Party </em>as well.</p>

<h2>LEGO Party Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>LEGO Party</em> was a good time that I think anyone who likes party games will absolutely love. There is a lot of charm, the boards are fun to engage with and look at, and a lot of attention was given to making sure there isn’t a ton of down time.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Possessor(s) Preview - A Deal with the Devil That's Worth It]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/possessors-preview-deal-with-devil-thats-worth-it</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/possessor-s-preview-a-deal-with-the-devil-thats-worth-it.1216116/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/possessors-preview-deal-with-devil-thats-worth-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Often, I bounce off metroidvanias due to their rather slow and deliberate combat as you move around their sprawling maps. <em>Possessor(s)</em> is quick, brutal, and full of cool combos powered by an arsenal you can make your own.</p>

<h2>Quick Customizable Combat</h2>

<p>I like the fast-paced weapons, but <em>Possessor(s)</em> will give you an arsenal of weapons and abilities to customize as you like. Pair that with its quick movement and dodge, and you’ve got all you need to be effective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You'll have your main attack determined by the weapons you equip and up to three different secondary abilities you can throw out there. The one I had access to was a computer mouse that you whipped forward to hit enemies with a combo, which was really reminiscent of Ness's yo-yo attacks in <em>Smash Bros</em>.</p>



<p>Obviously, movement and getting around the map is pretty key in the game. I was introduced to wall jumping and given a grappling hook to swing on certain points – as well as use it in combat to pull enemies towards me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some soulslike elements to <em>Possessor(s)</em>, as well. The save points you reach are akin to bonfires, and you collect a currency for defeating enemies along the way. They respawn if you heal up and you leave behind something to collect if you die to retrieve that lost currency.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Big, Visually Interesting Setting</h2>

<p>I didn’t have enough time to really dig into the exploration of the game, as in getting a sense of the scale or just how interconnected it is, but I did get to see vast swaths of empty map for objectives I had to get to. Plus, there are a ton of hidden secrets if you’re keeping an eye out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every area I went into was visually interesting and had engaging level design for moving/fighting through the level. None were simply just go left to right to get to the next area. Lots of verticality and visual cues for things to check out.</p>

<p>As much as I love to speed through some platforming quickly dealing damage, taking in the sights is worth it.</p>

<h2>Story with a Great Hook</h2>

<p>As someone who can’t get enough of a good story, <em>Possessor(s)</em> has a great setting and hook. Something has led to demons attacking, seemingly related to some big corporation go figure, that has left the main character, Luca, extremely injured with both her legs missing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game starts with you literally crawling along legless, trailing blood behind you, before you reach an injured demon. Of course, Luca has no choice and makes a deal with the demon who promises he can restore her legs. He didn’t tell her that three years would pass in that time, however.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luca awakes three years later in the world wracked by demons, now intimately connected with on of her own, Rehm. He grants her some abilities and they have a tenuous truce as they both realize that they need one another to survive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see where the story goes, as it has a lot of potential for great character moments and big setpiece moments as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you like metroidvanias, <em>Possessor(s)</em> is an obvious one to keep your eye on. Combat is great, story is intriguing, and it is genuinely fun to move around the map. Not much more you can ask for.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several minutes into <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a></em>, the leader of the kingdom I crash landed on told me that he couldn't help me fix up the bone dragon I rode in on because I don't have a life. And by life, he meant a job. In <em>The Girl Who Steals Time</em>, jobs are called lives. "Because without a Life, what are we?" the leader asked. "How are we supposed to help others? Without Lives, we are no better than the monsters that roam outside the gates."</p><p>This felt like a direct shot to my gut, coming just over a month since I was laid off from a job I've been trying to untangle from my self-worth. If I wanted to help my bone dragon, I needed to get one of the 12 starting jobs. This game is both simulation and role-playing, so the jobs you can do — or, in <em>The Girl Who Steals Time</em> speak, Lives you can have —&nbsp; are resource gathering, crafting, alchemy, or several different fighting styles. I choose cooking to start — first, boiling eggs then making more complex dishes. Naturally, I also have debts to pay off, so I have to do favors to earn money. These are largely resource gathering, but then require me to pick up new jobs. I take up fishing, figuring it will complement the cooking gig. (Both fishing and foraging require a small, timed-based minigame to complete.) I fish and forage for a while to help out around town, switching between those two and several others, like mining, to earn money. It's a satisfying loop in itself, but <em>The Girl Who Steals Time</em> continues to change and shift as more pieces of the world opens up. The game feels like a mixture of <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>. And that's where taking on more jobs — again, Lives — become more crucial.</p><figure></figure><p>After leveling up your jobs a bit — of particular importance before moving on is being able to fight — you head out into the world to explore, opening up parts of the map by unlocking tall towers and fighting monsters in mysterious shrines. This is where I'm at in the game, around its second chapter. Laterally, <em>The Girl Who Steals Time</em> continues to evolve by introducing community and village-building, which I’ve only seen a fraction of. What’s impressed me so far is that developer Level-5 has collected beloved elements from other games to create something that doesn't just feel like it's been copied-and-pasted from somewhere else. That's due to the charming story and art style, which is over-the-top in a way that feels self-aware and a bit cheeky. Or, at least, that's how I'm choosing to read a game that immediately told me to get a job.&nbsp;</p><p>The sheer number of jobs, and the ways you can mix and match jobs to get stuff done around the island, is what makes the game particularly interesting. So far, I don't feel pushed into any direction or job that I'm simply not interested in. By focusing on the ideas I do care to pursue, like resource gathering and crafting, I can make the game what I want it to be. Someone who chooses a different set of jobs will surely have a different experience.</p><p>It's my first time playing the Fantasy Life series, the first game of which, simply called <em>Fantasy Life</em>, was originally released in 2012 on Nintendo 3DS. It was released globally in 2014. It was a different story, but the original concept — centered on Lives, or jobs — remains the same. <em>The Girl Who Steals Time</em> was a launch title for the Switch, with a special version that includes "improved resolution, framerate and faster load times," <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per the eShop store</a>, and the game itself came out for other consoles on May 21. I'm <em>not</em> playing it on Switch, but I suspect it'd be a perfect game for the new console because it’s got the Nintendo vibe. I've been playing on Steam Deck, where it’s the sort of game I'm enjoying in short little bursts right before bed. The lack of urgency in moving forward is key for me; I don't feel like I'm missing out by figuring out how the different jobs work before moving out into the big, open-world game.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-indie-games-summer-game-fest-2025"><h3>Seven Cool Video Games I Saw During (Well, After) Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>From LEGO to bicycles to...whatever the Yakuza guys are doing next</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After all, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree"><u>Shadow of the Erdtree</u></a> was more demanding than the original, and that was an expansion built into it. Considering Nightreign is a standalone title, it has the potential to take things up a notch. But I have great news: It runs even better than Elden Ring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That seems surprising, but it shouldn’t be: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is limited to a small <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/elden-ring-nightreign/limveld">map called Limveld</a>, meaning there’s far less on the screen at any time. It helps that the environment is based on Limgrave rather than anything from Shadow of the Erdtree, which came out two years later and had more complex visual effects that gave my Ally a run for its money. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Can the Asus ROG Ally X Handle Elden Ring Nightreign?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I tested the game primarily in the castle at the center of Limveld. It's the largest set piece on the unaltered base map, where giants can throw enormous pots of magic at the player. This is where my framerate consistently dips to its lowest points, so I’m using it as a baseline for performance. I also started a new match between each graphics preset (as recommended by the game).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I set my ROG Ally X’s Operating Mode to Turbo (30W) and plugged it into an outlet, allowing it to output the maximum amount of watts into performance. I also allocated 16GB of RAM to the GPU to get the most of its hardware, which is a unique advantage of the Ally X, as it’s built with 24GB of RAM. Most other handheld gaming PCs feature 16GB of RAM and can only allocate 8GB to the GPU. These settings allow the Asus ROG Ally X to run at its best.</p><div><div><p>Elden Ring Nightreign ROG Ally X Performance</p></div><div><div><p>1080p, Maximum Preset</p><p>30 fps (27 fps low)</p></div><div><p>720p, Maximum Preset</p><p>41 fps (38 fps low)</p></div><div><p>1080p, High Preset</p><p>35 fps (28 fps low)</p></div><div><p>720p, High Preset</p><p>44 fps (40 fps low)</p></div><div><p>1080p, Medium Preset</p><p>39 fps (33 fps low)</p></div><div><p>720p, Medium Preset</p><p>50 fps (46 fps low)</p></div><div><p>1080p, Low Preset</p><p>43 fps (39 fps low)</p></div><div><p>720p, Low Preset</p><p>53 fps (48 fps low)</p></div></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The game runs well on the handheld, but Elden Ring Nightreign can struggle when there are a lot of enemies and visual effects at the same time, especially in more open areas. So, if you’re being ganked by several blood-infused enemies set to self-destruct on your position, all while overlooking Limveld from the top of ruins, the frame rate will take a massive hit. However, in enclosed spaces, like a dense forest, the game fares much better, particularly if you strategically point the camera towards the ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My ROG Ally X maintained an average of 30 fps at 1080p on the Maximum preset, with occasional drops down to 27 fps (usually after being bombarded by magic pots). The only other preset that dipped below 30 fps was 1080p on High. It hit an average of 35 fps, but dropped to 28 fps a few times when battling atop the castle. Otherwise, no other graphics preset dipped below 30 fps once. 1080p at Medium settings came in at an average of 39 fps. Low averaged at 43 fps, with a low of 39 fps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game runs much better at 720p, even reaching 60 fps occasionally. Maximum at 720p averaged 41 fps, with a 1% low of 38 fps. High came in with an average of 44 fps, with 40 fps at the worst. Medium and low look crunchy, but yield excellent performance.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/19/ally-x-1-1721422488015.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign Is Perfect on the Asus ROG Ally X</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightreign looks great at 1080p with Maximum settings, and plays decently enough. I enjoyed sessions from start to finish on this preset, and while occasional stutters were bothersome, it’s pretty smooth otherwise and often hovered over 30 fps. 30 fps isn’t enough for everyone though, and those willing to take a hit to resolution will likely find a better balance playing at Maximum graphics and 720p, which hovers around 41 fps, hitting a midpoint between smoothness and quality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players clamoring for 60 fps on their Asus ROG Ally X will have the best luck at 720p, but you’ll have to reduce the graphics presets to Medium or Low. Even then, the machine cannot maintain an average of 60 fps, and only reaches that high during less demanding encounters, like in enclosed spaces. It doesn’t look great, though, as Limveld appears flat on Low especially. The island loses its complex shadows, and each structure is low-poly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Claire finds joy in impassioned ramblings about her closeness to video games.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crimson-desert-preview-%E2%80%93-jaw-droppingly-detailed-gameplay-depth.1216080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/crimson-desert-preview-jaw-droppingly-detailed-gameplay-depth<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had a chance to play <em>Crimson Desert</em> for about an hour at Summer Game Fest Play Days, and I’m finding it hard to put into words just what I played. That’s not because it’s bad or anything, just that my mind was constantly being blown with just how ridiculously detailed and how incredibly deep the gameplay systems are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To get it out of the way, I didn’t see anything about progression, open world, questing, whether there is some faction reputation stuff – nothing like that. The entirety of my time was spent on the combat and the traversal mechanics.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Crimson Desert Gives You a lot of Tools to Get Around</h2>

<p>The demo took place 20 something hours into the game, so I had a lot of tools at my disposal. It was like learning to drive but someone stuck me in the cockpit of a plane. Can I drive it like a car? Sure. Does it do a whole hell of a lot more, like fly? Of course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For getting around, you can obviously run around and have a trusty steed, but there’s a lot lurking under the hood. Your character, Kliff, has access to a lot of abilities that let him do things like launch himself into the sky and transform into shade-like figure to glide across the land.</p>



<p>Kliff can also launch himself in a straight line to a point far in front of or above him. Point to the roof of a building and Kliff will go flying that way in a straight line. You can even choose the tops of trees to use that as a launching point to glide. I was terrible at it but comboing that grappling hook-like function with the glide makes traversal really quick.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of my demo, the developer helping me showed me a whole lot more mechanics that we didn’t have time for. In one, he showed me that you could use that grappling hook mechanic as an anchor point to swing around something sort of like Spider-Man.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Combat in Crimson Desert Is Vast, Versatile, and Very Satisfying</h2>

<p>I’m going to be honest when I talk about the combat. I definitely don’t remember everything I was shown, as it was so dense, so many systems working together, so many choices for how to approach any given combat situation that it was truly mindboggling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can string together combos with the shoulder buttons, use a special ability to slash out to do some more damage, then animation cancel that to swap to the second weapon you have selected to get the combo going more. You can also charge up your sword with an elemental attack and unleash a series of strikes.</p>

<p>Also, suffice to say that each weapon plays very different and combos with it are wildly different as well. Each one suits a certain playstyle and will operate a little differently. It’s pretty standard stuff, like a sword and shield, two-handed mace, etc. For example, I could spin around and cause all sorts of devastation with the two-handed mace.</p>



<p>Once I learned the many ways to combo enemies, the developer asked me if I liked wrestling.<em> Crimson Desert</em> has a robust grappling system that will let you throw people any direction, grab them by the head and shoulder drop them to the ground, and throw them into other enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can combo a launching attack that sees Kliff leap forward, kick your enemy, grapple them quickly, and then swing them around like Mario does to Bowser in<em> Mario 64.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s even a wheel you can use to change the elemental affinity of your weapon at any time. It has a cooldown and a bar it uses, but that can set up some nice combos in the environment as well. For example, I was warned of standing in a puddle when using an electric weapon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of my demo I had a pretty intense boss fight in the keep of a castle with a heavily armored knight. Quickly, it was obviously that my basic attacks were doing no damage to him and I had to figure out another way to defeat him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We had knocked over some pillars and they laid on the ground. I was reminded that earlier in the demo I had done a sequence where I had to pick up a large beam to then slot it in a stand to re-fly a banner at a location. Just as I picked up that large beam, I could pick up a pillar.</p>



<p>Kliff has some sort of telekenetic powers that let him pick up large objects, so I went through a sort-of complicated sequence of activating powers with L3 + R3, selecting the beam, mashing X to lift it up, grabbing it with triangle, turning towards the boss, and then swinging it down to crash on him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fight the boss, stagger him, smash him with a pillar. Turns out that works really well against heavily armored dudes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>There was more I was shown that this game could do but I can’t remember it all. It felt like it was one of those games that you could try just about any button combo or multiple button press and it would do something for you. The team said as much while I was playing, letting me know there were a lot of hidden mechanics not necessarily described to the player but those that experiment would be rewarded.</p>

<h2>The Graphics Are Gorgeous, Physics Impressive</h2>

<p>The final thing I want to mention is the setting for this demo. It’s one of those settings I’ve dreamed of seeing done well in a game, just waiting for technology to allow us to experience it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kliff is tasked with rescuing a friend fighting in the middle of a war, with his side besieging a keep. So, you have to make your way through a battlefield, the encampment outside the keep, over the castle walls, and through the castle to find your friend and defeat their leader.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The excruciating detail of the large-scale fight was astounding. It was beautifully chaotic with friend and enemy soldiers fighting all over the place. I wasn't just funneled down some pathway with invisible walls of background fighters in the distance either.</p>



<p>I could go anywhere and everywhere to interact with the hundreds of soldiers all duking it out at once on screen if I wished. The visceral mayhem I waded through is not something I’ll soon forget. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The physics of watchtowers exploding in a satisfying way, seeing them crumble or their individual boards flying apart was amazing to see among all the fighting, fire, and so much more.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Crimson Desert Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Every look we’ve seen of <em>Crimson Desert</em> has been intriguing, and I can say that my hands-on time exceeded my expectations many times over. It was breathtakingly beautiful, animated perfectly, and had very dense, well-connected gameplay systems that can be engaged with satisfyingly for any level of player. It's a game with al ot of complex systems but you can choose what you want to engage with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If they can nail the open world and story, <em>Crimson Desert</em> may be this year’s biggest hit. Look out <em>Clair Obscur</em>.&nbsp;</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Days after announcing a "tentative agreement" had been reached with key video game companies, US actors union SAG-AFTRA has suspended its nearly year-long strike, instructing members to return to work on productions that fall under its Interactive Media Agreement.
</p>
<p>
The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which represents around 160,000 members, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">announced a strike</a> affecting all work under its Interactive Media Agreement - which includes video game voice acting and other roles - last July. The move came after the union failed to reach an agreement with major video game companies as it renegotiated the terms of the contract, despite more than 18 months of discussions.
</p>
<p>
While SAG-AFTRA had successfully managed to negotiate on a variety of critical issues - including wages in-line with inflation, and job safety - sufficient protections against the exploitative use of AI remained a key sticking point. Back in March, eight months after the strike began, SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-applauds-tenacity-and-persistence-of-sag-aftra-members-as-tentative-agreement-over-ai-reached">said</a> proposals from video game companies were still filled with "alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to AI abuse".
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, however, SAG-AFTRA announced it had <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national">finally reached a "tentative agreement" with companies</a> including Activision, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a>, and Warner Bros. that included the "necessary AI guardrails" it had been pushing for. And now, following that news, SAG-AFTRA national executive director &amp; chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland has <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-video-game-strike-suspended-noon-pt-today">officially suspended the strike</a> against the companies signatory to the Interactive Media Agreement, as of noon PT today.
</p>
<p>
"All SAG-AFTRA members are instructed to return to work on productions under the IMA," the union wrote in its announcement, "including work promoting or publicising projects produced under the IMA. The SAG-AFTRA National Board will meet in special session tomorrow, 12th June, 2025, to consider the tentative agreement. If approved, it will be sent out for ratification by the union's membership in accordance with established policy."
</p>
<p>
In a separate statement provided to Eurogamer, Audrey Cooling, spokesperson for the video game producers party to the Interactive Media Agreement, said, "We are pleased to have reached a tentative contract agreement that reflects the important contributions of SAG-AFTRA-represented performers in video games. This agreement builds on three decades of successful partnership between the interactive entertainment industry and the union. It delivers historic wage increases of over 24 percent for performers, enhanced health and safety protections, and industry-leading AI provisions requiring transparency, consent and compensation for the use of digital replicas in games. We look forward to continuing to work with performers to create new and engaging entertainment experiences for billions of players throughout the world."
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, UK actors union Equity <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-applauds-tenacity-and-persistence-of-sag-aftra-members-as-tentative-agreement-over-ai-reached">applauded the "tenacity and persistence" of SAG-AFTRA members</a> after news of the tentative agreement broke. Equity <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/actors-union-stages-baftas-protest-seeking-improved-conditions-for-performers">protested outside the BAFTA Games Awards in April</a>, calling on the games industry to improve conditions for performers, including better pay and terms and conditions for their work, as well as AI protections.

There hasn’t been a truly new entry in the series since 2014's <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, so being stoked to dive into this exciting adventure is perfectly reasonable. Equally reasonable, especially given the game’s controversial price tag, is to wonder how long it’ll take to beat and what type of replayability it offers.

But if your goal is simply to tackle all of the game’s races and call it quits, <strong>you can complete every Grand Prix cup in just a few hours of playtime</strong>. You’ll probably find the experience lacking, though, as that’s only a small part of what Nintendo’s newest entry in the franchise serves up. </p><p><em>Mario Kart </em>games are known for having an extremely long lifespan due to their seemingly endless replayability. If you thoroughly enjoy racing in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, you can continue to replay its tracks as many times as you’d like via time trials or offline tournaments by yourself or via split-screen multiplayer.</p><p>Alternatively, you can head online to race up to 24 players in a standard Grand Prix or Knockout Mode, the latter of which is a brand-new elimination-based showdown. If you’re feeling feisty, you may want to take to the Battle Mode to fight your pals in a silly arena fight to see who can defeat each other with items. With all of this to do with friends (or strangers, if you’re so inclined), <strong><em>Mario Kart World</em> will likely keep you busy for many months, or even years, after release. </strong></p><p>If you’re more interested in exploring the game’s open world, you can do so entirely alone, or you can team up with your pals in a free roam session to explore it together. You’ll be able to round up plenty of collectibles or engage in dozens and dozens of short-but-sweet P-Switch missions—though it’s worth noting that the latter is strangely absent in cooperative free roam, so you’ll have to do those all by yourself. Sorry!</p><p>If this new kart racing outing sounds like fun to you,<em> Mario Kart World</em> is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Fortunately, there are a handful to choose from even this early in the console’s life.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,197533" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The best controller for you will always come down to the one that matches your budget, the features you need, and what feels most comfortable in your hand. But I’ve been taking a look at some Nintendo Switch 2 controllers, and I think these three are the best choices in order from most to least expensive. Maybe there’s one here that will tickle your fancy. </p><h2 id="h223682"><a id="1"></a>The king reigns supreme: Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</h2><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller may be pricey as hell, but it is hands down the best controller you can buy for your Nintendo Switch 2 right now. For its high asking price, you can rest assured that it has every feature needed to make the most of your gameplay experience on your new console. So, if you’ve got the dough, it’s definitely worth the investment.</p><figure id="" data-id="c8d0b5c046c34a9fe1d3fd071660950a" data-recommend-id="image://c8d0b5c046c34a9fe1d3fd071660950a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1705" data-height="946" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Switch 2 Pro Controller." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 Pro Controller." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8d0b5c046c34a9fe1d3fd071660950a" data-recommend-id="image://c8d0b5c046c34a9fe1d3fd071660950a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1705" data-height="946" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Switch 2 Pro Controller." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller comes with mappable back buttons, HD Rumble 2, gyro controls, amiibo support, and a dedicated C button for GameChat. It’s a complete feature set that third-party controllers can’t always lay claim to. But most of all, it’s likely the most comfortable controller I’ve ever held. I adore how smooth the sticks move, how clicky the buttons are, and how the two back buttons rest at just the right spot where they’re easily accessible without making me feel like I might click them accidentally. The controller borders on perfection.</p><p>If I had any real complaint about Nintendo’s newest controller, though, it wouldn’t be about anything functional. Instead, I simply wish the company would offer more colorways than black. Nintendo has frequently embraced quirky, colorful hardware, so I’m hoping we’ll eventually see some unique colors pop up down the line. </p><h2 id="h223683"><a id="2"></a>Let’s get fashionable: Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller</h2><p>My favorite third-party Nintendo Switch 2 controller to use has been the Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller. Officially licensed by Nintendo, this controller comes sporting basically all of the things I want in a controller, and at a lower price than the Switch 2 Pro Controller.</p><figure id="" data-id="d34d157438e3b52f971865e8d8efc59f" data-recommend-id="image://d34d157438e3b52f971865e8d8efc59f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2308" data-height="1183" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wireless controller has Mario on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A wireless controller has Mario on it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Turtle Beach</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d34d157438e3b52f971865e8d8efc59f" data-recommend-id="image://d34d157438e3b52f971865e8d8efc59f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2308" data-height="1183" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wireless controller has Mario on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You get up to 40 hours of playtime on a charge, built-in gyro controls, mappable back buttons, and satisfyingly grippy thumbsticks. It’s just killer all-around, honestly, and feels wonderful in the hands. Even more, it’s a hell of a looker with some neat aesthetic flair. Whether you choose the Invincible Mario (pictured above) or the Super Mario Star version, you’re getting a visually fun controller that also glows in the damn dark! And look, I know I’m almost 40, but don’t judge me for embracing some childlike wonder to offset the doom and gloom in the world these days.</p><p>Unfortunately, because it was initially designed for the original Nintendo Switch,<strong> the Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller lacks a dedicated C button for GameChat</strong>, so you’ll need to access that feature from the UI instead. I also wish it provided amiibo support, but that’s life.</p><h2 id="h223684"><a id="3"></a>Rippin’ on a budget: PowerA Advantage Wired Controller</h2><p>Whether you’re on a budget or simply prefer wired controllers, the PowerA Advantage Wired Controller is a beast at only $40. It comes packing Nintendo Switch 2-specific features like programmable back buttons and a C button for accessing GameChat. And its 10ft wire is plenty long enough that you should be able to kick back on the couch and relax while playing your favorite games.</p><figure id="" data-id="f5623d3e6674091e82b7bacea76edca4" data-recommend-id="image://f5623d3e6674091e82b7bacea76edca4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1562" data-height="967" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wired controller with Mario on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A wired controller with Mario on it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->PowerA</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5623d3e6674091e82b7bacea76edca4" data-recommend-id="image://f5623d3e6674091e82b7bacea76edca4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1562" data-height="967" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wired controller with Mario on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The disadvantages of the PowerA Advantage Wired Controller are that it’s missing HD Rumble, motion controls, and amiibo support. If any of that is a dealbreaker for you, you’re probably better off saving up for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, I reckon.</p><p>The PowerA Advantage Wired Controller comes in a few different neat versions, including a sleek all-black edition and two Nintendo-themed versions that really stand out. I dig the Mario Time controller in the picture above, but I’d say it’s nice to have options.</p><p>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">After the 2019 release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/code-vein/" data-ref-id="5000-464088">Code Vein</a>, Bandai Namco staked its claim in a genre it helped popularize as the publisher of games like Dark Souls. Code Vein married that Souls gameplay with its penchant for anime aesthetics to manifest a world of vampires and tough-as-nails action. Now, years later, the team behind that freshman effort is returning with an expanded sequel that will give fans of the sleek anime souls-like more to chew on.</p><p dir="ltr">Keita Iizuka, producer of Code Vein and its sequel, acknowledges that the genre has changed since Code Vein released, but sees it as a challenge to rise to. “Yes, games like Elden Ring are very praised,” Iizuka starts with a glint in his eye, “But I like to consider those games our rivals.”</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> CODE VEIN 2 — Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/code-vein-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-681504">Code Vein 2</a> started development just after the first game wrapped, it is clear that the developers have tried to anticipate where souls-likes might go. While the first title was a bit like souls-likes at the time in structure--which is to say, the non-linear freedom to get lost but not much choice in where to go--Code Vein II looks to rectify this. This time around, the game is expanding around the edges, letting players look for bosses and dungeons in an open environment. The player-character, once again custom-made, even has a slick motorcycle to help facilitate exploration.</p><p dir="ltr">And explore you must, even if you have played the first title. Code Vein 2’s world has no connection to the first game in terms of narrative, IIzuka says.</p><p dir="ltr">“It is a new world, new characters, and a new story,” he explains. This does mean that Code Vein’s ending cliffhanger, which implied a connection to the God Eater series but still left fans desperate to know more, will not be followed up on with the sequel. Those hoping for some resolution to the harsh cut-to-black tease from Code Vein’s ending will not find it in this sequel, at least as far as Iizuka is willing to admit right now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511994-ss_f53df962d8bd99bd5afab9b3d424fcd64b13fffb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511994" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511994-ss_f53df962d8bd99bd5afab9b3d424fcd64b13fffb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511994"></a><figcaption>Code Vein 2 does not follow up on the first game's cliffhanger ending.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511994-ss_f53df962d8bd99bd5afab9b3d424fcd64b13fffb.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Instead, Code Vein’s narrative tells the story of a world where humans and revenants, the series’ name for vampires, must join forces to stave off a world-destroying force that threatens them both. To do so, you as a revenant hunter must travel between the past and the present to better the world. This is also the driving force behind Code Vein 2’s other major improvement: a time-travel mechanic where actions and quests in the past affect the future.</p><p dir="ltr">When pressed for examples, Iizuka mentioned that saving a bridge repairman in the past gives the player access to a dungeon they otherwise might not have been able to reach in the present. If an NPC has a life goal of creating a specific tool, that character may not have survived into the present, but helping them achieve their goal likely means that tool is waiting for you to use years later.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond those new mechanics, Code Vein 2 is not looking to reinvent the wheel. Iizuka is clear-eyed on his vision: marrying sleek anime-style characters and action with the more thoughtful and pensive gameplay of a souls-like. As such, players will find aspects of Code Vein have been expanded, like a brand-new agile dual-wielding weapon type to attack enemies while looking cool doing it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511995-ss_3857481b5d7fe1d4c7664383536fe0793f6e0075.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511995" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511995-ss_3857481b5d7fe1d4c7664383536fe0793f6e0075.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511995"></a><figcaption>Like the first game, partner NPCs play a crucial role in combat.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511995-ss_3857481b5d7fe1d4c7664383536fe0793f6e0075.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Partners also once again play a major role, which Iizuka believes sets the Code Vein series apart from other games. With it, players encounter and recruit NPCs to go through dungeons and beat bosses with them.

You’ve probably traveled to this area while hunting either monster, as they’ll commonly move to this nest once they’ve taken enough damage.</p><h2 id="h710397"><a id=""></a>How to Deliver Wyvern Eggs</h2><figure id="" data-id="e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-recommend-id="image://e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter carries a Wyvern Egg through a colorful forest and towards a red pop-up camp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hunter carries a Wyvern Egg through a colorful forest and towards a red pop-up camp." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-recommend-id="image://e38e8b6ad4fbb37727b30c1a70c94941" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter carries a Wyvern Egg through a colorful forest and towards a red pop-up camp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Collecting eggs has its fair share of obstacles. For example, your movement is while carrying these things. You’re also unable to jump from most ledges or roll. Trying to do any of these will break the egg. As if that wasn’t inconvenient enough, <strong>picking up a Wyvern Egg can instantly aggro any Rathian or Rathalos on the map</strong>. They’ll fly right towards you and begin their assault, which will likely result in them breaking the egg you’re carrying.</p><p>Luckily for you, the right tools and planning will make this a trivial matter. Here’s what you need to pull off a Wyvern Egg heist:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Ghillie Mantle</strong>: Equipping this will prevent any monsters from seeing you during the trek back to camp. More importantly, it also prevents any large dragons from being alerted by your theft. Keep in mind that they will begin hunting you as soon as the Mantle stops working</li><li><strong>Outdoorsman Skill</strong>: Although its description only vaguely mentions improving transportation, this cancels out most of the movement drawbacks. You’ll have faster movement, dodging/rolling available, and jumping off a ledge will no longer break the egg. The Ranger Jewel decoration is the easiest way to apply this skill. Otherwise, you’ll either need to collect Gajau fish to forge Gajau Boots or complete Alma’s glasses sidequest to forge Square Glasses</li><li><strong>Area 12: Northeast Pop-up Camp</strong>: One welcomed improvement in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is that Wyvern Eggs don’t need to be delivered to your main camp. This is arguably the closest pop-up camp with the relatively safest conditions. Area 7: Bower of the Great Tree is another option, but it frequently has monsters nearby</li></ul><p>You can take out any Rathian or Rathalos on the map first if you want the absolute safest egg trip. I suggest checking the map’s Environment Overview Forecast beforehand to make sure you’ll have enough time before another one spawns in.</p><p>Before we start, you’re going to want to set up a waypoint to the nearest Pop-up Camp. This will help if you’re not as familiar with the map or accidentally get lost moving through this giant forest. Holding L1/LB for about a second will cause your scoutflies to head towards the waypoint, leaving a visible trail for you to follow.</p><p>Once you’re in the nest, equip the Ghillie Mantle and pick up the Wyvern Egg. Head north where a long set of vines lead down to another tree top. You might need to be walking straight towards it to slowly climb down these, which is a common reason players get stuck up here. If you have the Outdoorsman Skill in your build, feel free to just run right off. Your hunter will safely land with the egg intact. Keep moving forward to find an even longer set of vines you can climb or jump off from.</p><p>Now that you’re on the ground, you’ll want to turn right and move towards the giant mess of mossy rocks. Follow the water that goes around the left of this, and you’ll see the Pop-up Camp as soon as you round the corner. You’ll successfully deliver the egg once you approach the camp and see an animation of you placing the egg down.</p><p>Your reward is 50 Guild Points, which admittedly isn’t a lot. Previous entries had special egg delivery quests, so it makes sense that the rewards aren’t great without anything like that. Fingers crossed they add some in the future to give incentive for doing this. For now, it’s more or less a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> easter egg.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/open-world-action-rpg-the-seven-deadly-sins-origin-unveils-two-new-trailers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A new look at the combat, characters, and world of Britannia.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Open-world action RPG The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin recently dropped new trailers at Summer Game Fest and the Future Games Show, showcasing the world and characters developer Netmarble has been cooking up. They also announced that pre-registration has opened for all regions as momentum builds to its release window later this year.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/10/250529-sdo-press-en-1749585781087.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is being made by the same team that created 2019’s The Seven Deadly Sins: Grand Cross and tells an original story set in Brittania, the same world as The Seven Deadly Sins anime and manga series. That series has sold 55 million copies and Grand Cross reached 70 million downloads globally, so it’s fair to say there’s a huge fanbase that’s been anticipating the latest installment. It stars Tristan, son of series main characters Meliodas and Elizabeth, in a multiverse narrative that dives into parallel timelines and alternate character arcs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all begins with the Book of Stars, a pendant that lay dormant in a cave beneath a lake. It has the power to record and connect timelines, and it chooses Tristan to be its next guardian. That moment sets Tristan on his course to explore the world and save it from turmoil and chaos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new trailers provide a glimpse into the game’s central narrative, a deeper look at its expansive world, and show off the eye-catching art style that emulates the anime, powered by Unreal Engine. The first trailer, revealed on Friday during Summer Game Fest, begins with Tristan’s discovery of the Book of Stars. It seemingly sets off an explosion of power before settling into a celestial orb in the middle of the pendant.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We then see some of the game’s large and varied environments, including open fields, canyons, lakeside docks, a desert oasis, and an underwater area. You can fly or go diving to fully explore some of these regions, and you can take part in other activities as you explore, like fishing and cooking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We get a look at the flashy and fast-paced real-time combat system, showing several different characters and their abilities. At one point, two characters attack at the same time, hinting at the ability to strategically combine characters’ unique skills and weapons to create combos. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a variety of enemies featured, including spiders, golems, aggressive plants, and a horned monster that falls out of a flaming hole in the sky. And that’s on top of two hulking monstrosities that tower above the trees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second trailer, shown during the Future Games Show on Saturday, expands on the showdown with one of those monstrosities. We see that it’s not just a cutscene, it’s an actual boss fight where the controllable character has to dodge fireballs before climbing up the body of the massive creature.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That trailer also expanded on the environments, showing a deep forest, a cavern beneath the sand, the inside of a town, and a rain-drenched grassland. You can also see Tristan magically moving blocks into empty holes in a door or wall, possibly indicating that there will be environmental puzzles you need to solve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two trailers combined to give us our deepest dive into The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin yet, and they clearly have fans excited, since they gathered more than a million views on YouTube in just two days. Origin will be available on PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile, with crossplay available across all platforms.

The union said it will convene a special meeting on June 12 to "consider the tentative agreement." If approved, the agreement will then be sent for ratification by the union's members. This is also when the full terms of the agreement will be published.</p><p>The video game companies released a statement regarding the strike coming to an end, with spokesperson Audrey Cooling saying the companies are "pleased to have reached a tentative contract agreement that reflects the important contributions of SAG-AFTRA-represented performers in video games."</p><p>The statement goes on: "This agreement builds on three decades of successful partnership between the interactive entertainment industry and the union. It delivers historic wage increases of over 24% for performers, enhanced health and safety protections, and industry-leading AI provisions requiring transparency, consent and compensation for the use of digital replicas in games. We look forward to continuing to work with performers to create new and engaging entertainment experiences for billions of players throughout the world."</p><p>The strike began in July 2024. The union and video game companies agreed to terms on a number of points in negotiations, but a sticking point was the matter of AI.

            <p>
In case you hadn't noticed, what with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>'s launch and the annual Summer Geoffs causing all sorts of distractions, June is well and truly upon us. And Sony is marking the occasion - much as it does every month - with a fresh batch of additions to its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium catalogue, which this time include Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
Sony's latest catalogue refresh takes place next Tuesday, 17th June, bringing a total of eight new games for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, alongside one further addition exclusive to the latter tier. You'll find the full list of June's titles below:
</p>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra:</h3>
<ul>
<li>FBC: Firebreak (PS5)</li>
<li>Battlefield 2042 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>theHunter: Call of the Wild (PS4)</li>
<li>We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Train Sim World 5 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Endless Dungeon (PS4, PS5)</li>
</ul>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deus Ex: The Conspiracy (PS4, PS5)</li>
</ul>
<p>
So there're some decent arrivals, then, with highlights including Alan Wake developer Remedy Entertainment's promising co-op Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, and the ever-delightful We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie. RPG fans, meanwhile, might get a kick out of Suikoden spiritual successor Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes, and Amplitude's tower defence roguelike Endless Dungeon is also a good old time.
</p>
<p>
As for those forking out for Sony's top-tier membership, June's retro addition comes in the form of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a>: The Conspiracy - the PlayStation 2 adaptation of developer Ion Storm's cyberpunk immersive sim classic Deux Ex, which first hit the console back in 2002.
</p>
<p>
And that's your lot! All the above don't arrive until next Tuesday, 17th June, meaning you've still got some time to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-ps-plus-catalogue-additions-for-may">last month's PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra additions</a> before your attention is yanked elsewhere.

<figure><a title="Age of Calamity" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7aab1096cbe2/age-of-calamity.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>One pleasant surprise of the Switch 2 launch, beyond the advertised upgrades — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">free and otherwise</a> — to various Switch games, has been seeing how <em>some</em> Switch games that once struggled to hit their frame rate targets have gotten a nice boost on the new console.</p>
<p>It seems that Switch 1 games with unlocked frame rates are getting a largely untouted bump in the performance department, with games like the nigh-on unplayable <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> — which we called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/batman-arkham-knight">"one of the worst ports we've ever played"</a> — now becoming a viable option on Switch 2. Loads times have also shot down for some titles. Result!</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Here, we've collected 13 examples which have impressed us. Some were fairly miraculous on Switch to begin with, but Switch 2 is making a bunch of the bad ones good (or at least playably stable!) and some of the great ones shine brighter than ever. Let's jump in, in no particular order...</p>
<p><em>NL Staff Key - <strong>GL</strong> (Gavin Lane), <strong>OR</strong> (Ollie Reynolds), <strong>PJ</strong> (PJ O'Reilly)</em></p>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disaster_report_4_summer_memories">Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories (Switch)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disaster_report_4_summer_memories">Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories!</a> My god, I love this game. However, it was a bit of a mess, a bit of a *bunch of swear words* if i'm being honest, on Switch 1.</p>
<p>Back at the release, our review said, <em>"From a technical perspective, the Switch port of Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories is an absolute mess. Narratively and artistically, however, it’s one of the most fascinating games in recent memory."</em> Correct.</p>
<p>Now, though, thanks to Switch 2, from what I can see, the game runs flawlessly. And you need to play it. Now, I'm not gonna pretend I know exactly what the numbers are here, but if I had to guess, I'd say we're looking at an uncapped frame rate that's lifted the action right up to around the 60 mark. It feels great. It also looks much clearer. I think a replay is unavoidable. Sorry. <em><strong>- PJ</strong></em></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>I fired <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> up and dove into one of the EX missions and...blimey. Essentially, it now has the performance you always wanted from the game. I played a mission and tried out the two-player splitscreen and didn't note a single dropped frame.</p>
<p>Granted, its original state, while hitchy, didn't massively affect my enjoyment of the game. Of course, I saw it — you couldn't miss it — but I still very much enjoyed my time with it (RSI notwithstanding).</p>
<p>Now, I'm not going to play through the entire thing hunting frame rate dips, but after firing it up again for the first time in several years, I'd absolutely consider it if the backlog didn't just have two dozen Switch 2 games piled on it! <strong>- <em>GL</em></strong></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3 (Switch)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a> is an incredibly ambitious, bombastic game that definitely struggled in places on Switch 1 as a result. It looks fuzzy when playing handheld and the accompanying frame rate rarely hits its 60fps target.</p>
<p>Moving over to Switch 2, the game still kind of looks like arse in handheld mode, and it'll likely take a proper 'Nintendo Switch 2 Edition' upgrade to change this. The frame rate, however, is now buttery-smooth throughout. There's not a single drop below 60fps, from what I've played, even during the busiest set pieces.</p>
<p>For me, the last mainline entry in PlatinumGames' flagship series has its downsides, but if performance was one of them for you, then you can feel comforted in the knowledge that this has been completely rectified for Switch 2. Oh, and load times are now much zippier, too. Nice. <strong>- OR</strong></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Batman: Arkham Knight (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p>Booting this horiffic mess up for this article,...I'm now impressed? Sort of.</p>
<p>There's no doubting that the move to Switch 2 has benefitted <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Arkham Knight</a> immensely with regards to its frame rate, which is now super smooth — even whilst driving Batman's car. I can't remember what it's called...the Bat Car? Anyway, you can barrel through the streets now and it's all good.</p>
<p>And so it goes in combat. It now feels very smooth, and even spinning the camera around Gotham City as you glide through the sky causes no stutters or anything. Miraculous. Or it would be if they could fix the resolution, which is rough in places.</p>
<p>However, if you only have this one way to play Arkham Knight — or it came in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/batman_arkham_trilogy">Arkham Trilogy</a> and you abandoned it — it's good to know this version now runs well enough, besides some fuzzy visuals. <strong><em>- PJ</em></strong></p>
</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bakeru">BAKERU (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>Oh, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bakeru">BAKERU</a> is so lovely. If you haven't played this delightful little 3D platformer yet, then now is the perfect time to do so.</p>
<p>On Switch 1, Bakeru's frame rate was kind of all over the place at times. You could tell it was gunning for that 60fps sweet spot, but it never even came close to hitting it. On the Switch 2, it's a completely different story.</p>
<p>I felt like I was playing a remaster when I booted it up for the first time on Nintendo's new console. The frame rate is absolutely spot on, and it really helps elevate the incredible art design and animations. This is up there with some of Nintendo's best. Get on it. <em><strong>- OR</strong></em></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>I'm gonna be blunt now. I hated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3</a> on Switch. I know, I know...it was a miracle port. Whatever. I couldn't handle the muddiness, the sluggishness, and the draw distance that gave me a headache outside of towns. It just wasn't viable for me. I'm a pig.</p>
<p>And so, I'm very pleased to announce that, having taken so poorly to The Switcher, the very same game on Switch 2 is one I'd happily go on a date with. I might even pay for the food. Switch 2 makes the game look night and day different. It's really crisp and clear and, even with all the graphical excisions, manages to look quite purdy, especially while galloping (unfettered by flailing frames) across the game's glorious countryside.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpn5-Ifk27k">Yep, the frame rate feels slick as hell now, too.</a> The Witcher has gone from struggling to run, to feeling as though it needs a bespoke patch to unleash its full powers on a machine that can handle it. For now, though, it's a bloody nice, free little boost. Ta. <strong><em>- PJ</em></strong></p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bloodstained_ritual_of_the_night">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (Switch)</a></h2>
<p>I was super-hyped for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bloodstained_ritual_of_the_night">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</a> on Switch (massive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/castlevania">Castlevania</a> fan detected) and even decided to make that my platform of choice for the game.</p>
<p>Whilst it was okay, in a pinch, there was a big loss in terms of visual fidelity, and frame times were all over the place, leading to juddery, unsatisfying play. It just wasn't a <em>grea</em>t version of what is a great game, put simply. However, on Switch 2, any frame time issues have been sorted, with a fully solid lock to 30fps (yes it's not 60, but it's smooth and maybe we'll get a patch).</p>
<p>It's also just a much nicer game to sit down with, thanks to more responsive menu navigation and loading times that have been squashed right down to a breezy minimum. If the game had arrived on Switch like this, I probably wouldn't have double-dipped. Not bad! <em><strong>- OR</strong></em></p>

<p>Compared to other series entries, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> wasn't quite as rage-inducingly bad in the performance department, but as highlighted by Alex in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/rwJk2nz_xcA?si=Mqsb70rP8ZKf9sbp&amp;t=1071">a recent live stream</a>, the game is now rock-solid, stable 30fps for anybody playing on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Now, that's not to say that Arceus is some bastion of graphical prowess or anything, but if the frame rate drops bothered you before, they've been zapped on Switch 2. The Pokémon Company let everyone know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> were getting an update, but don't forget this winner, too. <em><strong>- GL</strong></em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium</a>, despite being utterly incredible, definitely had its drawbacks on the Switch 1. Load times were pretty dire, and even just heading into the pause menu would yield some unsavoury slowdown.</p>
<p>Not so on the Switch 2. Here, everything is as slick as you could possible hope for. Transitions from one area to the next are pretty close to instantaneous, and heading into the pause menu now has absolutely no slowdown whatesoever.</p>
<p>These hardly sound like the most enthralling improvements ever, I know, but with some like Disco Elysium — a game that utterly demands you to pay attention — seeing all these little improvements add up makes for a much more enjoyable experience. <strong><em>- OR</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xcom_2_collection">XCOM 2 Collection</a> is a game that I awarded an 8/10 to when it released on Switch, and I stand by that score, as bringing a game of this depth and size to a dinky little console, and in a form that played well enough, was very obviously a huge undertaking. And Firaxis managed it - albeit with some big concessions.</p>
<p>On Switch 2, while the graphics remain downgraded (for now), the game now runs buttery smooth, meaning that it's now a viable way, <em>a fully enjoyable way</em>, to play this timeless collection of strategy classics in portable mode. Get in. <strong><em>- PJ</em></strong></p>

			<p>Since the Souls series formula has become popular among players, countless games have tried to recapture what makes FromSoftware's hardcore action role-playing games so engaging, but only a few have managed to even get close. Among these is NEOWIZ and Round8 Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/">Lies of P</a>, which still stands, a few years since its release, as the game that got the closest to recapturing the haunting atmosphere of the beloved Bloodborne.</p>
<p>Launching almost two years after the base game's release, the Lies of P: Overture DLC promised, before its release, to provide more of the same solid experience players have been enjoying since late 2023. Those who didn't expect anything else will find the expansion a worthy addition to the experience, but those who expected something more will inevitably be disappointed to see how the expansion doesn't push the formula past the boundaries set by the base game.</p>

<p>The Lies of P: Overture expansion is set in the past, in a time before Krat was overrun and then destroyed by the terrible Puppet Frenzy Outbreak that players deal with in the base game. Starting with the Krat Zoo, which was burned down in the main timeline, players get to explore a slew of different locations which are no longer standing in the post-outbreak Krat, get to meet characters who are only briefly mentioned in the main adventure, and fight tons of powerful enemies to learn more about the world's lore and the chain of events that led to the Outbreak.</p>
<p>When it comes to the story, there's no doubt that Lies of P: Overture fully delivers. The main characters of the expansion may be fewer compared to the base game, but they are endearing enough and add quite a bit to the experience. Same with the new information on the world, which better fleshes out the story of the city of Krat. If you wanted to learn more about the setting, then the DLC is definitely a worthy purchase, even if you aren't too keen on dealing with high difficulty, thanks to the two new easier difficulty settings that have been added to the entirety of the experience with the free update that added support for the Overture DLC.</p>
<p>Even if you pick the easiest difficulty setting, however, you should be aware that the Lies of P: Overture DLC expansion is not a walk in the park, and you won't be able to mash your way to victory. As the expansion can only be accessed after reaching the end of Chapter IX, it is meant to be a late-game experience that expects players to possess a certain degree of skill, properly upgraded weapons, and effective builds. As such, the expansion is challenging from the get-go.</p>
<p>Possibly a little too much: enemy HP pools are generally high, as is the damage they can deal at the base difficulty, so expect to die a lot as you get reacquainted with the experience and some of its quirks, such as perfect blocking, which is more important than ever before to leave the enemies open to powerful critical attacks, if you haven't played the game in a while like myself. The difficulty of the expansion is so high that even the developer has promised to look into balance changes down the line. If you are coming to the expansion straight from the base game, you will likely have far less trouble, but you will still need to be on your toes, as it's not just the enemy stats that make them challenging, but also their placement, which, at times, gets really, really unfair. The enemy placements, alongside some locations that resemble each other a little too much, somewhat impact level design, though they are minor issues that most of those who liked the base game will have no trouble looking past. For the rest, expect to explore some fairly intricate locations, unlock shortcuts, and discover all sorts of secrets, including some new gear.</p>

<p>Though the Lies of P: Overture experience is the same Souls series-inspired action RPG experience seen in the base game, the expansion offers plenty of new tools to play with. Some really change the way the game is approached, such as the Royal Horn Bow, which provides a solid ranged combat option, but the other weapons are similarly well designed and can really shake up how combat is approached. The Pale Knight greatsword, inspired by Final Fantasy VIII's gunblades, is a persona favorite of mine, but every other new weapon and Talisman in the expansion is a worthy addition to the experience.</p>
<p>With these new tools at the player's disposal, it's no surprise to see enemy design take them into account to prevent some options from being too powerful. Some of the new enemies, for example, are quite aggressive, so don't expect, for example, to be able to use the Royal HornBow from afar too much. Other than this, however, enemy design isn't too different from the base game. Bosses, on the other hand, are the highlight of the experience, and are rather well designed, except for a couple that are, in my opinion, more frustrating than fun. Even this, however, is entirely in line with what is seen in the base game, so if you have spent 40 hours going through the streets of Krat already, you will feel right at home spending 20 more in the Krat of the past.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, Lies of P: Overture is an expansion in the true sense of the word. Opting to deliver more of the same, Round8 Studio plays to the game’s strengths, offering an experience every bit as enjoyable as the base game, even with some unfair difficulty that will likely get toned down in time. As such, the DLC is a worthy purchase for those who loved the original and still want more. Those who feel they’ve had their fill or struggled with the game’s quirks the first time around won’t find much to change their minds here, however. For better or worse, it’s more Lies of P.</p>

				<p>While it doesn't add anything substantially new to the experience, Lies of P: Overture expansion is a more than worthy expansion, delivering an engaging story delving deeper into the base game's lore, featuring some of the best bosses in the entire game, and adding new weapons that can significantly shake up combat. Its lack of innovation and unfair difficulty may turn off a few players, but all those who loved every second of the base game will have no trouble falling in love again with one of the best Soulslikes of the past few years.</p>
