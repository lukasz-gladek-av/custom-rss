			<p>Contrary to what recent findings seemed to suggest, the yet-to-be-officially revealed Xbox handheld will not switch to the ARM architecture, but will be powered by an AMD APU.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/qualcomm-job-posting-suggest-the-next-xbox-will-be-based-on-arm.1684130/post-270428048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeoGAF forums</a>, known AMD leaker KeplerL2 commented on the handheld, saying that it will be powered by a custom low-power APU from AMD. The Xbox-branded handhelds, on the other hand, will use whatever APUs are available to OEMs, including Z2E from AMD, Lunar/Panther Lake from Intel, X Elite 2 from Qualcomm, and N1 from NVIDIA.</p>
<p>Though it was expected for Microsoft to go with AMD again for its next-generation systems, including the dedicated handheld, which has been teased multiple times in the past, a job ad that surfaced online last week<a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-xbox-arm/"> suggested</a> that some of the next-gen Xbox products could make the switch to the ARM architecture. This choice could have made sense somewhat for a handheld system, as the ARM architecture provides better power efficiency, but it would have led to issues in terms of compatibility with current software, and not having access to a large part of the Xbox library wouldn't really fit with the current strategy of making Xbox games available on as many devices as possible.</p>
<p>With the Xbox handheld likely far from release, we will get to see the first glimpses of the company's handheld strategy with the aforementioned branded handhelds. The first one, known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/">Project Kennan</a>, is being developed in collaboration with ASUS, will run Windows, unsurprisingly, and feature an interface reminiscent of the Xbox consoles. This handheld should be released before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 launched on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One back in 2018 and was later ported to PC in 2019. While the game was never properly updated for current generation consoles, a new PS5 and Xbox Series X|S patch is <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-nintendo-switch-2-playstation-5-upgrade/">reportedly</a> in the works, together with a Nintendo Switch 2 port that could be released before the end of the year. Though unconfirmed, these new releases would definitely help Rockstar Games and Take-Two's release schedule for the second half of the year, especially after Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed to May 2026.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. You can learn more about one of the best open-world games ever released by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/">review.</a></p>

So <em>Mario Kart World</em> has had to dig deep to expand that roster even further, and has looked mostly to former enemies and background props for inspiration. In addition to Cow, who was previously an obstacle in Moo Moo Meadows, <em>Mario Kart World</em> also adds Goomba, Hammer Bro, Coin Coffer, Conkdor, Chargin’ Chuck, Snowman, and lots of other minor characters to its playable cast. </p><p>“The character designer quickly put together a prototype of Cow that could race, and surprisingly it didn’t feel out of place at all,” Ishikawa said.<strong> “</strong>So we thought maybe we could include other obstacle characters, and decided to add Cheep Cheep and Pokey as racers. As a result, the idea of taking obstacle characters, usually found in courses in past games, and having them participate in races made sense to me in terms of an interconnected world.”</p><p>Cow didn’t just immediately transform into<em> Mario Kart World</em>’s breakout star, however. It also led to lots of philosophical debates internally, as well as ideas for completely new game mechanics. “It was like, ‘They’re NPCs, but they’re playable? Which is it?’” said producer Kosuke Yabuki. “It was thanks to the introduction of various ‘NPC drivers’ that the idea to have Kamek appear as an item was born,” developer Shintaro Jikumaru added. “When Kamek casts a spell, the racers are transformed into playable NPCs, so one by one they might all turn into Cow mid-race.”</p><figure id="" data-id="9bde55b569477d3d97b2dca43110475f" data-recommend-id="image://9bde55b569477d3d97b2dca43110475f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1072" data-height="603" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cows appear in a meadow as Mario drives by.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But making Cow and other obstacles into full characters also required getting creative with the acting performances. “We were conscious of depicting the personalities and characteristics of ‘NPC drivers’ in a way that doesn’t look inferior to classic characters like Mario,” developer Atsuko Asahi said. “The voice team members went through a lot of trial and error in the pursuit of the ideal sound.”</p><p>So it turns out <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s Cow isn’t just a fun online meme, she was also an integral catalyst for what sets the new game apart from earlier entries. “Cow is actually a pivotal character in the <em>Mario Kart</em> series,” joked Ishikawa. Top-selling franchises have to find inspiration somewhere. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony is ending its PlayStation Stars loyalty programme, in its current form, after three years.</p>
<p>The programme first started in July 2022 and allowed players to earn reward points to be redeemed for PSN wallet funds and other products on the store. It became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-stars-program-now-available-in-uk">available in the UK</a> later that year.</p>
<p>However, Sony is now ending support for the programme as it evaluates "the types of activities our players respond best to", though it could return in some form in the future.</p>

<p>From today, new members to the PlayStation Stars programme will no longer be accepted and if current members cancel they won't be able to rejoin this version of the programme - all earned Points will be lost.</p>
<p>Current PlayStation Stars members can still earn points and products until 23rd July 3:59pm UK time (7:59am PDT, 11:59pm JST). No new campaigns will be available after this time.</p>
<p>This version of PlayStation Stars will fully end on 2nd November 2026. Current members can still earn points until this time. Digital Collectibles will still be accessible after these changes take place.</p>
<p>"Since launching the programme, we've learned a lot from evaluating the types of activities our players respond best to, and as a company, we are always evolving with player and industry trends," said the company on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/21/playstation-stars-coming-to-a-close-as-sie-evaluates-new-ways-to-evolve-future-loyalty-program-efforts/?sf277358162=1">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-is-coming-to-ps5-this-summer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 is coming to PlayStation 5 this summer, another first party Xbox game that is making the jump to the blue team.</p>
<p><iframe title="Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II Comes to PlayStation 5 This Summer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sh4QQyM1KP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hellblade 2 will be optimised for both PS5 and PS5 Pro, such that Ninja Theory are putting an “Enhanced” label on the announcement artwork. This new release will have some additional features added into the mix, though these will also be made available as a free update for players on Xbox Series X|S and PC via both Xbox and Steam.</p>
<p>One of the most intriguing aspects on a technical level is what the PS5 Pro can offer over the Xbox Series X. The original release targeted 30fps on Series X with no performance modes, so will the PS5 Pro look to push for higher resolution, add a performance mode, or increase fidelity? We’ll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Writing in their announcement post, the team writes, “At Ninja Theory we have a rich heritage of releasing games on PlayStation, starting with Heavenly Sword back in 2007. If you’re familiar with our history, you’ll know that Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice was originally released on PlayStation 4 back in 2017. Developed by a small, passionate team, it resonated with so many of you, the players.</p>

<p>“We released the next chapter of Senua’s story a year ago today, and we know there are many of you who haven’t had the opportunity to experience that next chapter for yourselves. Today we’re excited to announce that we will be releasing Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II on PlayStation 5 this summer.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/24/microsoft-explain-why-they-bought-ninja-theory/">Microsoft’s acquisition of Ninja Theory in 2018</a> came off the back of the success of Hellblade. The studio had struggled to find stability for quite some time, despite critically acclaimed games like Heavenly Sword, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and DmC: Devil May Cry. The first Hellblade was an experiment in small budget game development at AAA quality, and it was a major hit for the studio. It was also a PlayStation 4 console exclusive at its original 2017 launch before being ported to Xbox and Switch in subsequent years. That Microsoft’s acquisition meant that the sequel would be Xbox exclusive was unpopular with PlayStation gamers, to say the least. But Microsoft’s current cross-platform strategy is at least breaking down this barrier for one of the most visually stunning games of last year.</p>
<p>Playing the game last year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review/">we said</a>, “Just like its forbear, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is an oppressive, powerful and haunting example of the power of video games, and one that sets its own parameters for what a digital experience can be. It is a game that must be experienced, not least because, there’s nothing else quite like it.”</p>

			<p><span>Neowiz recently invited Wccftech out to a private hands-on event alongside other media and content creators at The Paramour Estate in sunny Los Angeles. As part of some of the first opportunities to go play Neowiz and Round8 Studio’s expansion to 2023’s surprising puppetry action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lies of P</a>, we enjoyed (and suffered) through some of the new content featured in this anticipated expansion and enjoyed a brief respite of tacos and a metal rendition of Feel to cap off the evening.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-overture-qa-its-an-opportunity-for-us-to-really-complete-the-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lies of P: Overture</a> takes the bold approach of making the DLC a prequel to the story, rather than continuing P’s adventure after the credits roll. To access the DLC in the first place was something that Neowiz hadn’t been entirely upfront about, but did seem to tentatively agree about a particular damaged and overgrown stargazer in the Path of the Pilgrim. A loading screen tooltip also advised visiting the Star’s Chrysalis near the Malum District. Whether there’s more to be done to access Overture’s new campaign beyond finishing the game for the first time and returning to that particular golden stargazer still has to be confirmed by Neowiz.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Anguished-Guardian-of-the-Ruins-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Our hands-on time with Lies of P: Overture was split up into two sessions of equal length. Our first breakout session centered on the Battle Memories boss fights that are also set to come to the base game for Lies of P in a future patch. In this mode, players can challenge any boss they’ve fought once they finish the story and achieve at least one ending first simply by visiting the Hotel Krat stargazer. These fights are locked to the Legendary Stalker difficulty, but each features five different tiers of difficulty that ramp up the enemy’s strength and stats. Completing a fight on a particular might reward players with something special if the fight is completed in a certain amount of time, although I only saw items like collectible pins being unlocked by finishing a fight on the fifth tier. These pins, by the way, are part of a new cosmetic for Lies of P: Overture where the main character can equip and show off up to three pins on their satchel that otherwise don’t provide a statistical bonus from what I could see.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s a second battle mode called Death March where players go through a sort of Boss Rush with multiple fights in tandem with a limited supply of consumable items and resources, but it wasn’t something we were able to check out during our hands-on session.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the Battle Memories mode, we faced off a trio of bosses that highlighted how diverse the enemy types can be in Lies of P: Overture. The very first fight was a puppet and master fight where players have to contend with not just a human-type enemy capable of explosive light magic spells, but also a valkyrie sort of puppet that could attack independently. Players might instinctively move to finish off the puppet first, but all this does is phase the enemy briefly while the main boss revives their puppet and restores their durability to fight once more. The second was a hulking abomination within a dingy sewer whose attacks are just as damaging as they are telegraphed. I found this fight to be much simpler and straightforward than the puppeteer from the first encounter once I got a feel for getting back in the groove of parrying attacks. Sure, it did have an enrage mode during its final 1/3rd of health, but by then I had a good flow to the combat and P’s new Legion Arms definitely helped deal damage while staying a safe arm’s length away.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Carnival-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>The final boss was a massive chimera hybrid of multiple animal types, crystalline structures, and human-like upper torsos, each with differently wielded weapons that could swing and clear out a dozen meters across in a single slash or explode the ground around P if trying to play more defensively. On top of that, the boss transitioned into a second phase where its attacks got much more vicious in addition to a few beam lasers that would catch me by surprise. Trying to fend off this boss with the new bow weapon was largely ineffective, given the sheer amount of HP this boss had versus the miniscule amount of damage the bow could pull off (a tradeoff from having unlimited arrows and staying out of melee range, I suppose). While I could finish the first two bosses with relative ease on the third of five difficulty levels, I was only able to fend off this final boss on the first and second difficulty levels in the limited amount of time I had.</span></p>
<p><span>The second half of our Lies of P: Overture preview centered on actually diving right into the DLC from when it’s first available. Here, P and Gemini venture into the snowy outskirts of Krat and stumble across the Krat Zoo, seemingly still open to the public. There aren’t any NPCs to interact with during the introductory hours, so who’s to say if we might see the real Alidoro in all his katana-wielding glory later on in the DLC? Instead, it’s a snowy path filled with relatively straight corridors and a few spots off the beaten path for consumables and simple loot leading up to the front gates of Krat Zoo. Not all is as pristine and glamorous as Krat once was, as the wilderness is already filled with blue-blooded Carcass enemies and mutated animals alike. I suspect the Carcass Butcher’s Amulet purchased from Pulcinella in the base game might be one of the best accessories to put on for the DLC, at least in the early moments.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if you’re intimately familiar with the flow of Lies of P’s combat and are sufficiently geared up, the enemies in Overture are no joke. Even the basic mindless carcass zombies can knock P down in a few hits and trying to take on two or more from a bad vantage point can leave the player ganged up on. This is another time where I wished the bow was more effective, but instead it seems more used to harass enemies that might have poor pathfinding, or at least could simply not reach the player, rather than trying to engage on even footing. Instead, there were two weapons I gravitated towards the most in Lies of P: Overture’s modest selection of new weapon types. The first was a windmill-looking rotary saw that would actually charge up with stronger attacks if P dashes with the weapon equipped and a large gunblade, where P can fire off explosive shells at the end of combo swings or even propel himself around the arena like a Gunlance user in Monster Hunter. This latter type, much like the Bow and a number of other weapons in the Overture preview, is unique in that they do not have a separate handle and blade, meaning swapping about like you could with nearly every other weapon in Lies of P isn’t an option.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Even the minibosses that exist like skill checks against the player in order to progress could be a struggle early on in Lies of P: Overture. A hulking gorilla Carcass marked off the front gates to Krat Zoo and existed to make sure the player understood either how to perfectly parry, something I had to retrain my muscle memory after playing more lax titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and The First Berserker: Khazan as Lies of P: Overture features a much tighter parry window, or get used to dodging out of harm’s way. This gorilla was easily the death of me three or four times before I finally persevered, only to realize later on that no, that is simply a regular enemy type who shows up at least more than once in the back portion of the Krat Zoo. There were other vicious Carcass animals throughout Krat Zoo, including a stampeding mammoth, which was surprisingly much easier than either of the gorillas, and a corrupted crocodile, which served as the main boss for this playable section. Regrettably, I was not able to reach in the limited time available. Instead, I focused on exploring the side paths of Krat Zoo and taking a return trip to Hotel Krat to see what had changed.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Z-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>While I couldn’t venture out and see everything I wanted to outside of Hotel Krat, I did get a rough idea about how little has changed outside of the Overture map. Taking a moment to harvest some gold coin fruit or upgrade the weapons I had on me (there was a dragon spear ala Guan Yu’s signature weapon in the item box to try out) instead showed that there were the same rewards and +10 enhancement cap from the base game, although I would think that enhancement cap would be lifted later on in the DLC if the power scaling goes up. The P-Organ system also appeared to feature the same nodes from the original and respeccing still required gold coin fruit, something that seemed obvious given that both respeccing and even venturing into the Overture DLC both required completing the game at least once.</span></p>

<p><span>Three hours were not enough to do more than scratch the surface of Lies of P: Overture, and I’m already considering how my NG+3 playthrough will go in preparation for tackling the DLC. There’s initially a bigger focus early on with using large two-handed weapons in Overture, so I’m looking forward to picking up that gunblade once more and exploding my way to glory. There isn’t a firm release date beyond Summer 2025, but alongside the Overture DLC, there will also be a sizable patch with quality of life fixes for all players, including two new difficulty levels geared towards a more story-focused experience for those that might want to explore Krat but not have to fully engage with parrying and the other more difficult nuances to Lies of P’s combat. Lastly, Lies of P Overture will launch as a $29.99 premium DLC for the base game.</span></p>

			<p>A report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-loses-integral-staff-responsible-for-server-meshing/">Insider Gaming</a> points to more issues at Cloud Imperium Games, with the studio reportedly losing "<em>integral</em>" staff regarding server meshing and having been hit with more layoffs across all its departments.</p>
<p>According to Insider Gaming, after Roger Godfrey's departure in December 2024, Ivan Corbett and Jordan Wood have left the studio, leaving no producers at Cloud Imperium Games working on server meshing. Sources Insider Gaming spoke to described all three leaving as a "<em>huge loss</em>" for Cloud Imperium Games.</p>
<p>It's the latest news in what's been a rocky time for Star Citizen and Cloud Imperium Games. Last year, the studio suffered layoffs in <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/some-star-citizen-devs-reportedly-laid-off-as-cloud-imperium-restructures/">February</a> and <a href="https://www.cgmagonline.com/news/star-citizen-layoffs-funding-release/">November</a> 2024, and just ahead of the November layoff, a separate <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-expose-paints-a-fairly-bleak-picture-theres-no-actual-focus-on-getting-the-game-done/">report from Insider Gaming</a> described an internal environment where developers are overworked on anything but finishing Star Citizen to launch it out of the early access state it has remained in for its entire existence.</p>
<p>More recently, CIG has come under fire from players for its 'pay-to-win' Flight Blades. Players made their vitriol known to the point where CIG released a statement, admitting that it had "<em>missed a step</em>" with its implementation of Flight Blades, and that in an upcoming June update, players will be able to acquire them through in-game currency instead of just being able to buy them with real money.</p>
<p>"<em>The choice has and should always be yours. If you want to support the project early, you can, but it’s not required. If you own a game package, you’ll be able to pick these up with in-game currency in our next monthly patch. And for future gameplay kit introductions, we’ll ensure these items are obtainable in-game on day one,</em>" CIG wrote in its <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/%%7Breply_id%7D">statement</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Thanks to everyone who’s weighed in, especially those who brought the heat constructively. This game has always been shaped by the community. Star Citizen wouldn’t exist without your passion and support, or your scrutiny and feedback. We hear you, and we take it all to heart.</em>"</p>
<p>Players were not appeased with this though, with many of the comments underneath still calling out the studio, claiming that it was always their plan to get players to buy into Flight Blades through "<em>FOMO</em>" and then offer them as an in-game item later.</p>
<p>It's definitely been a difficult time for CIG, but just how much this will impact Star Citizen remains to be seen. Earlier this year, CIG passed $800 million in crowdfunding for the game, which has been in early access since 2012.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/dune-awakening-interview-art-directors-gavin-whelan-and-david-levy</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-interview-art-directors-gavin-whelan-and-david-levy-on-bringing-arrakis-to-life.1195209/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/dune-awakening-interview-art-directors-gavin-whelan-and-david-levy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At PAX East 2025, there was one booth that dominated the convention floor and had dozens of stations open for people to play: <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dune-awakening-preview-pax-east-2024" rel="nofollow"><em>Dune Awakening</em></a>. Not only did I have the opportunity to download and play some of the <em>Dune Awakening</em> beta over the weekend, but I got to sit down with Senior Art Director Gavin Whelan and Associate Art Director David Levy to talk about their work on bringing Arrakis to life.</p>

<p>In our<em> Dune Awakening</em> interview with the art directors, let's dive into what it took to design and build this new MMO.</p>



<h2><em>Dune Awakening</em>'s Inspirations: Pulling From Many Sources</h2>

<p>"We all have experiences of what our perception of <em>Dune</em> is," Whelan said. "Some of the older devs like myself, we have the 1984 movie, which scarred me mentally when I was way too young. A lot of people have read the books, and there's the newer movies and TV series. The sandworm is kind of just this thing that's part of our general consciousness."</p>

<p>The original Frank Herbert novel provided a lot of lore for the dev team to go on, but so much of the style of the world has been adapted to film and TV already. I was curious how much of those designs were incorporated into the game versus what was being developed from scratch.</p>

<p>"We have the legendary movies, which we were working with those guys very closely," Whelan said. "They shipped a bunch of us down to the set. We got to sit inside an ornithopter, and the relationship between us and Legendary Pictures was very close. They were sending us concepts, reference images, prop photos, so we could start modeling things based on that."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whelan also met with Cinematics Director Greig Fraser to discuss details for the game. Plus, <em>Dune Awakening</em> Creative Director Joel Bylos was a passionate fan from the start who brought his perspective to every detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's great to have that sort of safety net," Whelan said, speaking of Bylos. "He is such a lore nerd on this. He will just go, 'No, that's not the way it goes. Here's the line in the book.'"&nbsp;</p>

<p>The close relationship between the developers and the filmmakers helps make <em>Dune Awakening</em> be an extension of that universe that shares similar themes while still carving out its own space in the <em>Dune </em>timeline.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Setting the Tone for <em>Dune Awakening&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>Associate Art Director David Levy, meanwhile, was bringing his own experience to the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I worked on the TV series for <em>Dune Prophecy</em>, I was a lead for the concept team, so I worked on the TV series for three years," Levy said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having a team that's passionate about the source material was critical for getting the details of the world accurate and making it feel more lived-in, from the design of the lighting from the harsh Arrakis sun to the vehicles you can see and interact with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You'll see in the game we have big ships flying across the sky," Whelan said. "I nagged for so long to get those in because it wasn't essential gameplay, it was just something in the sky, but it set the tone."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, you can't talk about <em>Dune</em> without talking about sandworms. These are designs that are well-known from screen adaptations, but I was curious what the design process was like for the sandworms in&nbsp;<em>Dune Awakening.</em></p>

<p>"We needed to have a certain amount of articulation in the mouth for the smaller worms," Whelan said. "The tri-mouth design was much easier to anticipate and give it some articulation. And we have those out in the deep desert, though those are the small worms. The big worm – I have never worked on, and will never work on, a game where we have a creature that big."&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had to ask the two of them directly: can you ride a sandworm?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We're working on it," Whelan said. "There are a whole bunch of challenges, it's going to be an interesting journey to get that working right. It has to be a visceral, engaging feeling."&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Dune Awakening</em>: Deep Desert &amp; Beyond&nbsp;</h2>

<p>A core element of <em>Dune Awakening</em> is the deep desert, a PVP area with high-risk, high-reward opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's a balance between the amount of freedom and amount of danger we give the player," Levy said. "It's going to be a very high-octane area."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two developers wanted to make sure that exploration pays off, giving players plenty to see and do if they venture out into the deep desert. At the same time, for players not interested in PVP gameplay, there's plenty of other missions to take on.</p>

<p>"There are aspects of this game for all gamers to come into," Whelan said. "I have a friend who is exclusively into PVP, and will really be into that area. Other people can research, resource gather, build, or craft. There's just so many cool elements that can attract a lot of people."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plus, huge sandstorms will sweep across the map and reset the deep desert, giving Funcom opportunities to create new points of interest out there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every aspect of <em>Dune Awakening</em>, from the deep desert design to the character creator to the narrative, was built from a global team that had to navigate the challenges of developing a game when COVID was at its peak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Eventually, we all transitioned to working online," Whelan said. "We had to coordinate something so complicated remotely. I love having people face to face in a room, where ideas can flow and you can see body language. Anybody can come up with the perfect idea, the perfect solution. But doing things on Teams meetings, it was a slow and challenging process."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Levy's role, he was taking charge of how the lighting works in the world and how to make each day in-game feel dynamic and new.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I love photography, and we were able to translate Gavin's vision into something that is immersive and unconscious to the player, like the day-to-day changes. Every day will be slightly different weather. How do we make it beautiful, but also oppressive? There's so many different biomes, I'm excited for the player to feel that sense of immersion in the atmosphere."&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Dune Awakening</em>: One Big Sandbox</h2>

<p>At its core as an MMO, <em>Dune Awakening</em> has been designed to give the player agency to explore what kind of experience they want to have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I'm blown away by the creativity of the players," Whelan said. "We build a sandbox for players. They take ownership of it, and they start to shape it. Some people want to play straight <em>Dune</em> fantasy, we accommodate that. Others just want to have fun with it. We have heat maps so we can see what the players are doing and how they explore."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The player is the component of the game," Levy said. "They're not just a passenger who's going through a very linear experience. The player is making<em> Dune Awakening</em> after we've built it."&nbsp;</p>

<p>A core goal of <em>Dune Awakening</em> was to constantly let the player branch out and try new things. The immediate needs must first be met – food, water, shelter. But similar to other survival MMOs, once the player has a handle on those things, the world really starts to open up, and before too long they'll be flying ornithopters and gathering resources to make more complex tools.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only were Levy and Whelan interested in making the game accessible to as many players as they could in the design of the world, they also wanted it to run on as many machines as possible.</p>

<p>"We have been very conscious of the fact that there are economic challenges," Whelan said. "People can't rush out and buy a graphics card. We want to make sure that the lighting and the world looks beautiful and consistent on low-end machines.</p>

<p>"We get to a point where the game looks beautiful, and then we start optimizing. We bounce back and forth making sure <em>Dune Awakening</em> looks good and runs well."&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Dune Awakening </em>was a big hit at PAX East, with the beta weekend allowing me to try it out on my Nvidia GeForce 3060Ti (runs great!) as well as on my Steam Deck (runs not so great). The <em>Dune Awakening </em>release date is June 10 with early access for those who buy <em>Dune Awakening Deluxe Edition</em> on June 5.</p>

<p>Whelan, Levy, and the whole team have worked to make <em>Dune Awakening</em> an authentic<em> Dune </em>experience for fans, and there should be many secrets to uncover when players jump in for themselves in just a few weeks.</p>

Among the many things discussed is an explanation for why the game isn’t called <em>Mario Kart 9</em>, despite being a sequel to the best-selling <em>Mario Kart 8</em> — and it has to do with the game’s approach to open-world design.</p><p>“If the idea had just been to add more courses, then I think we would’ve called it <em>Mario Kart 9</em>,“ explained producer Kosuke Yabuki. “But, that wasn’t our approach this time. We wanted to take the series to the next level. So, we decided to drop the numbering this time and go with a completely new title, <em>Mario Kart World</em>. So, we’d already added “<em>MARIO KART WORLD</em>” to the concept art from the early stages of development.“</p><p>The development team also discussed the game’s origins on the original Switch. Many of the key aspects of <em>World</em> — including its interconnected map and increasing the number of players per race from 12 to 24 — were in place early on, but they apparently proved to be a challenge on the previous hardware.</p><p>“When we were developing for the Nintendo Switch system, it was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return,” programming director Kenta Sato said. “We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the frame rate to 30 fps in some cases. It was a tough situation.” Yabuki added that when the idea of moving the game to the Switch 2 came up, “It was truly a ray of hope.”</p><p>There’s a lot more to dig into in the four-part Q&amp;A, including the fact that there will be 200 tracks to listen to and how important food is to the game from a worldbuilding perspective.

My favorite detail, though, is how a character named Cow made it onto the roster of racers. As art director Masaaki Ishikawa explains it “Cow is actually a pivotal character in the <em>Mario Kart</em> series.“</p><p>After looking at this concept art, I can’t help but agree:</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"If the idea had just been to add more courses, then I think we would’ve called it Mario Kart 9," Yabuki explained. "But, that wasn't our approach this time. We wanted to take the series to the next level. So, we decided to drop the numbering this time and go with a completely new title, Mario Kart World. So, we'd already added "Mario Kart World" to the concept art from the early stages of development."</p><p>Mario Kart World's namesake draws from its tracks being part of one large open world. The game even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-free-roam-mode-features-missions-hidden-collectibles-and-more/1100-6530931/" data-ref-id="1100-6530931">features a Free Roam mode</a> where players can drive around and complete challenges off-track. Yabuki said that he "thought that with modern technology, being able to seamlessly transition between courses and realize a single, vast world wasn't beyond the realm of possibility," so this concept, and the name Mario Kart World, were present from very early on in development.</p><p>The decision to go open world and implement systems like dynamic weather was a massive undertaking for the development team. "The sheer volume of work required to prepare all the art needed to show time and weather changes in a seamless world... We were under no illusion," art director Masaaki Ishikawa admits later on in the interview. "We were even on the verge of giving up on it at one point."</p><p>Historically, Mario Kart games have either referenced the platform they are on or what number game they are in the series in their title. Mario Kart World joins the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-double-dash/" data-ref-id="5000-3633">Mario Kart: Double Dash</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-super-circuit/" data-ref-id="5000-2924">Mario Kart: Super Circuit</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-tour/" data-ref-id="5000-477986">Mario Kart Tour</a> in bucking that trend.</p><p>Mario Kart World will launch alongside Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5.

            <p>Donkey Kong - Nintendo's mighty monkey with a penchant for bananas - received a bit of a makeover recently, and now we know why.</p>
<p>We originally got a look at DK's new in-game look back in January, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">gorilla starred in the first brief teaser for Mario Kart World</a>. At this time, fans noticed he looked much closer to his Super Mario Bros. film design than before. Since then, this look has been featured in plenty of Nintendo advertising, and of course the main monkey is set to star in his own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> game - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> - later this year.</p>
<p>Now, Donkey Kong designer and Nintendo legend <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> has shed some light as to why the company chose to redesign his iconic character for this generation.</p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-shigeru-miyamoto-interview-i-see-nintendo-as-like-a-talent-agency-and-we-have-within-our-roster-a-lot-of-talented-characters">IGN</a>, Miyamoto said "when it comes to character creation and working with characters", he still has an active role in what goes on.</p>
<p>"Looking back to the first generation <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a>, we worked with Rare to create Donkey Kong Country," Miyamoto continued. "When we were talking about trying to create new versions, evolving Donkey Kong, we created the game called Jungle Beat. We worked together with the team that made 3D Mario. With the technology that was available at the time, we were able to make Donkey Kong more expressive."</p>
<p>The creator furthered that "going back to the design that Rare came up with, we reevaluated", with the team wanting to come up with something to make DK's design "more expressive" than before.</p>
<p>"And then when it comes to the movie, we decided to move forward with this new generation Donkey Kong design," Miyamoto concluded.</p>

<p>Soon after Donkey Kong's redesign was first revealed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kongs-new-look-in-switch-2-mario-kart-approved-by-former-rare-artist">former Rare artist Kevin Bayliss shared his thoughts on the new look</a>, stating: "You can take the KONG out of the Country, but you can't take the Country out of the Kong! (I love it - this is really funny! - Everything changes! - Change is good!)."</p>
<p>As for the monkey's upcoming game, Eurogamer's former EIC Tom Phillips has already had some time with Donkey Kong Bananza, which is set to launch on Switch 2 on 17th July.</p>
<p>"Yes, everyone might have been expecting Mario, but Bananza's brawny obliteration is far better suited to his one-time enemy," he wrote after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">hands-on with Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> was originally in development for the original Switch, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> has allowed the developers to realise their vision of an inter-connected world.</p>
<p>Nintendo began prototyping for the new Mario Kart game back in 2017, even during development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>. Development then began at the end of that year.</p>
<p>"I felt that in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, we were able to perfect the formula that we'd been following in the series up to that point, where players race on individual courses," explained Mario Kart World producer Kosuke Yabuki in a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-1/">interview from Nintendo</a>. "That's why, this time, we wanted the gameplay to involve players driving around a large world, and we began creating a world map like this."</p>

<p>Programming director Kenta Sato continued: "When we were developing for Nintendo Switch, we often worried whether we could find the right balance between planning and performance. Of course, the Switch system's performance is sufficient for developing different kinds of games, but if we had included everything we wanted to in this game's vast world, then it wouldn't have run at 60 fps and would have suffered from constant framerate drops.</p>
<p>"I think there were a lot of people on the team who were worried about whether we could really manage it. But once we decided to release this game on Switch 2, we expected our worries to evaporate all at once. I remember being overjoyed when I discovered we could express even more than we'd originally set out to."</p>
<p>Yabuki noted that had the idea for the game just been more courses it would've been called Mario Kart 9, but the new approach led to the name Mario Kart World. In fact, that name was added to concept art in the early stages of development.</p>
<p>"In previous Mario Kart games, after finishing a course, you'd move on to the next course," said Yabuki. "However, I thought that with modern technology, being able to seamlessly transition between courses and realise a single, vast world wasn't beyond the realm of possibility. So, with this in mind, we set out to create a new kind of Mario Kart...And that's when all our troubles began."</p>

<p>Sato had heard of difficulties in creating open world games and felt pressure to achieve this with Mario Kart, especially as Nintendo considers 60fps to be important for the series, as well as split-screen multiplayer. It seems the power of the Switch 2 allowed for this to happen.</p>
<p>The move to an open world also led to the increase of 24 players instead of 12, which was decided fairly early in development.</p>
<p>"By creating long routes in a vast world, you could end up with players spread out in various places, which could diminish the sense that they're racing against each other," said Yabuki. "So, we figured that by increasing the number of racers, you'd be sure to see some competitive action here and there."</p>
<p>Added art director Masaaki Ishikawa: "I felt like the 12 players we had previously was a lot, but as Yabuki-san said, once players spread out, the course starts to look sparse, and the visuals give off a sort of lonely feel. So, I thought that 24 players would be better because there'd be more interaction between various players. That said, it was quite challenging once we got going and the volume of design work increased. But it was worth it."</p>
<p>Speaking of art, the team wanted to recapture the "lively, bustling atmosphere" of Super Mario Kart on the SNES, with a key phrase being "playfulness". This led to the more rounded, cartoonish designs of Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>"The characters in the Super Mario series have a rounded look, so we wanted to give the vehicles a rounded design too, to match their appearance," said Ishikawa. "We also wanted to give the characters a livelier look even while they're in their vehicles, so we put everything together in a way that gives off a sense of playfulness through the combination of the characters' rounded designs, soft facial expressions, and rich movements."</p>
<p>The open world design means courses are now inter-connected across the world, but Yabuki said adding up all the possible variations would "easily exceed 100".</p>

<p>Lastly, the developers discussed the creation of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-is-the-true-star-of-nintendos-switch-2-direct">Mario Kart World's meme-worthy new character, Cow</a>.</p>
<p>"Each new Mario Kart game features new characters to race with, but since we added so many to the previous game, we wondered where we could go from there," said Ishikawa. "And then one of the designers came up with that silly sketch of Cow cruising along, and I thought to myself, 'This is it!' So that's when we realised the course surroundings actually contained a lot of untapped resources.</p>
<p>"The character designer quickly put together a prototype of Cow that could race, and surprisingly it didn't feel out of place at all. So we thought maybe we could include other obstacle characters, and decided to add Cheep Cheep and Pokey as racers. As a result, the idea of taking obstacle characters, usually found in courses in past games, and having them participate in races made sense to me in terms of an interconnected world."</p>
<p>Mario Kart World will launch alongside Nintendo's Switch 2 on 5th June as a key game in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">launch lineup</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-originally-switch-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that&nbsp;Switch 2 launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>was originally in development for the first Switch, and that the release of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>'s Booster Course Pass DLC is the reason the game ended up on Switch 2.</p>

<p>The Japanese gaming giant's latest Ask the Developer article is all about the new&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game, which launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">alongside the Switch 2 on June 5th</a>. It turns out, though, that Nintendo began prototyping&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>all the way back in 2017.</p>

<p>According to producer Kosuke Yabuki, work on&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>began in March 2017, a month or so before the release of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>. Programming director Kenta Sato says the original plan was to develop for the Switch, but that this threw up a lot of technical issues.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-switch-1-game-switch-2-shot.jpg?itok=9F4aF8SX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-switch-1-game-switch-2-shot.jpg?itok=qtH1RAF- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>was originally intended as a Switch game.</figcaption></figure><p>Specifically, Sato says there were doubts about whether the original Switch was capable of accommodating&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s 24-player limit. The team discussed various solutions, including "toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and...dropping the frame rate to 30fps".</p>

<p>Yabuki says that the team "kick[ed] the can down the road" while trying to work out what to compromise on for&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, but that when&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>'s Booster Course Pass DLC was released, it gave the team "a bit more time to continue development".</p>

<p>During that time, the development team discussed moving&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>to the Switch 2, which became, as Yabuki puts it, "a ray of hope", opening up "a bunch of possibilities" and removing the need to compromise on performance or visual fidelity.</p>




<p><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will launch for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mario-kart-world-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on June 5th. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">just one of the games</a> that will be available for the system on release, alongside the likes of&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and the bafflingly paid-for&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-massively-outsold-the-original-oblivion-in-the-us-in-its-first-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered</a> launched in a not-so-surprising shadow drop at the tail end of the month, and in just one week managed to vastly outsell the original Oblivion's first 15 months on the market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from Circana, which reports that Oblivion was not just the best-selling game in the U.S. for the month of April in dollar sales, and the third best-selling game of 2025 so far, it also sold more units in April than the original Oblivion managed in its first 15 months, and brought in more money than the original Oblivion did in its first 14 months. While that's admittedly not a huge shock given the massively larger install base Oblivion sold into now compared to 2006, it's still an incredible feat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remainder of April's top 20 present some fascinating twists on the usual suspects we see on the charts. In second place for the month was Forza Horizon 5, up from No.42 last month due to its PS5 launch. Following it is MLB: The Show 25 at No.3, and then Minecraft at No.4, up from No.11 and almost certainly riding a high from the release of the Minecraft movie earlier in April.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At No.5 was last month's winner, Assassin's Creed: Shadows, and it's followed by Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at No.6. It's up from No.118 last month thanks to, like Forza, its PS5 release. As Circana analyst Mat Piscatella notes, four of the top five — and five of the top seven — best-selling games of the month on PlayStation platforms were published by Microsoft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also worth pointing out that The Last of Us: Part 2 jumped from No.23 to No.13 this month, possibly due to the second season of the TV show. And while Schedule 1 doesn't appear on the sales charts, it did rank No.1 in U.S. total monthly active users on Steam (Call of Duty topped the MAU charts on PlayStation and Xbox).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're an RPG fan, you might be wondering where the heck <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is. Per Piscatella, publisher Kepler Interactive doesn't share digital data with Circana, and thus Expedition 33's digital sales aren't counted and likely resulted in it not appearing anywhere on the chart. Piscatella did tell me that its physical sales ranked it among the top 35 best-sellers in April, No.22 on PlayStation, and it was 19th in monthly active users on Xbox and 21st on Steam. "It released towards the end of the month, and started a bit slow (player count rankings have improved each week since launch through May 10)," he said. "All of those bits reflect a very successful result for a game of its type.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a game that was been incredibly well received by the enthusiast audience, but by the end of the month had not crossed over to the mainstream in a significant way. We'll have to see what May ends up looking like (with more physical copies entering the market and word of mouth pushing the game to a bigger audience)."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, April consumer spending on video games was down 3% year-over-year to $4.1 billion, with content spending down 2%. Non-mobile subscription spending and console digital premium downloads were up, but all other content segments were down. And accessories spending was down 2%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hardware was also down 8%, reaching the lowest monthly hardware dollar sales total reached in the U.S. market since July 2020. The PS5 was once again the best-selling console in both unit and dollar sales despite dropping 5% from last year.

            <p>Microsoft has announced its next wave of Game Pass titles for May and into June.</p>
<p>Day one releases with this batch include Monster Train 2, To a T, and Spray Paint Simulator. To a T is a charming looking game from the creator of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a>. It follows the story of a teen whose body is stuck in a T-pose, as they navigate life in a small town with their cute dog companion.</p>
<p>Here are the list of Xbox Game Pass additions for late May 2025:</p>
<ul>

<p>Our Ed has already had some time with To a T, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/katamari-damacy-creators-to-a-t-is-full-of-colour-and-joy-but-is-also-a-serious-and-affecting-depiction-of-living-with-disability">spoke to its creator Keita Takahashi</a>. "The concept of the character being in a T-pose came from another small game idea I had," Takahashi told Ed. "I hadn't linked the T-pose to disability until someone pointed it out in feedback. I was more focused on daily life challenges, which could be categorised as disabilities, but the inspiration was primarily drawn from game design."</p>
<p>Metaphor ReFantazio is a particular highlight from this batch of incoming Game Pass games. We awarded it five stars on its release, with our Ed saying "what it lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in grandeur and heart," in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Eurogamer's Metaphor ReFantazio review</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Game Pass Ultimate members can look forward to more games coming to the Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) library on 23rd May. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brütal Legend</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/is-puyo-puyo-tetris-2s-better-with-joy-con-2-mouse-controls/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S is…. one of the more confounding game releases for the Nintendo Switch 2 launch. The mash-em-up puzzler where Puyo Puyo and Tetris combine and collide in a variety of different game modes broke onto the global scene with the first game’s release for Nintendo Switch (and PlayStation 4) in 2017, a localised port of the 2014 Japanese release. That was then followed a few years later with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/puyo-puyo-tetris-2">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</a>, with a new story mode and Skill Battles.</p>
<p>Now that same game is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> with a sprinkling of added content for the new system. It’s essentially the same game with a new Tetris Doubles mode where two players share the same board with their own stream of blocks – something that we sadly didn’t try out while going hands on – and support for Joy-Con 2 mouse mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S –&nbsp;Mouse mode most puzzling" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RNJ5wHF4nvQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s the mouse mode that everyone at Sega’s preview event really focussed on. It’s pretty simple, really. As a new block appears at the top of the grid for you to drop, you move the mouse and that block swipes from side to side while gradually dropping down to the pile of blocks you’ve previously placed. Click with the shoulder button to rotate the block, but then to drop the block down hard you pull the mouse towards you.</p>
<p>And that’s where I had my biggest issue. Time and again, pulling the mouse toward me also had me moving left or right just enough so that the block would also shift over a space or two, ruining my placement and plan – not always so disastrous in Puyo Puyo at my skill level, but always a pain in Tetris to adjust. It’s quite a strange input choice for such a key mechanic, when the PC versions of this series allow for mouse inputs, but use a key press for the hard drop instead of a gesture.</p>

<p>There is also a way to hard drop using the analogue stick, though this didn’t really sit under the thumb for me, so thankfully there’s also other control presets that you can switch between. These let you trigger that hard drop with a face button press or one of the shoulder triggers, which should be much more reliable. Why is that not the default? I don’t rightly know, but that does help with the biggest issues I had with mouse inputs.</p>

<p>Even then, I’m not entirely sure that it makes sense for me. There’s an argument to be had for rapid swipes, but these are games where the players have to make fast, if not instant decisions, and rely on precise digital inputs. Even for a frankly very run-of-the-mill kind of player like me, I imagine that I’d find that imprecision rather annoying in the long run.</p>
<p>Spending half an hour with Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S and checking out the new mouse mode, the first impressions are a bit underwhelming for what’s touted as an enhanced release.&nbsp;It’s fair to say that there’s some strong opinions about how this game is priced from this, as there’s no upgrade path from Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 to 2S.</p>

<p>At the very least, it’s no more expensive than other versions, and this game is still jam-packed with different ways to play and combine Puyo Puyo and Tetris, whether it’s the solo adventure mode, Skill Battles, a variety of multiplayer battle modes, or just playing a straight up game of either of these puzzle legend. If someone buying a Nintendo Switch 2 wants a Puyo Puyo Tetris game, this will likely be the one to get.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-train-2-review-to-hell-and-back.1195119/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-train-2-review-to-hell-and-back<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Standing out as a roguelike deckbuilder is hard. New games in the genre seem to constantly be releasing on Steam. For every <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/high-stakes-how-balatro-confronts-addiction-and-roguelikes" rel="nofollow">breakout hit like&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em></a>, some games just get left behind. If you're going to release a deckbuilder in the current landscape, you better be sure you have a way to stand out.&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>uses the autobattler foundation of its predecessor to iterate by doubling down on player freedom.</p>

<p>From the selection screen to the last track on the map, there are so many ways for you to build your perfect army to storm the gates of Heaven with. Though the forces you face and friends you find can become a little repetitive, the toolbox Shiny Shoe gives to you feels near infinite in the ways you can customize each run.</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em> - Charming Challenges</h2>



<p>The structure of <em>Monster Train 2 </em>stands on the shoulders, like most roguelike deckbuilders, stands on the shoulders of <em>Slay the Spire</em>. However, beyond the deckbuilding and energy aspects, this deckbuilder is very much its own thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fights take place on your train, which has three floors. You place units on each floor, trying to prevent monsters from climbing the floors of your train. If you can’t defeat them, they reach your train’s most valuable resource: the Pyre Heart. Your units can die without consequence, but when your Pyre Heart reaches zero health, you lose.</p>

<p>This gameplay is divided into different runs, each of which can take up to around an hour. These are eight battles, each with a track to choose from between battles. Tracks have different stops, including places to spend your gold, fireplaces to heal your Pyre Heart, and banners to recruit new units to your forces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main increasing challenge that each run presents is the difficulty system of Covenants. As the Covenant level increases from 1-10, you gain new challenges, like reduced control over your deck and increased strength for your enemies.</p>

<p>If you want some more interesting challenges, though, you can head over to the Dimensional Challenge portal. These challenges will provide interesting and compelling modifiers and restrictions to change how you see the game. For instance, in one early challenge, everything you receive is doubled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It sounds great at first: double gold will make upgrades so much easier! Then, you realize it means that you also need to take two copies of every card. It really makes you rethink which cards to take in a creative way. If you find mutators you enjoy more than others, you can choose to add them to your standard runs before starting them from the menu.</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em> - Expression Excellence</h2>



<p>Deckbuilders are at their best when they give you the tools to break them in creative ways. <em>Monster Train 2</em> delivers in spades, and a major reason why is the clan system. In addition to choosing a primary clan that grants a primary champion to follow, you choose a secondary clan, which can impact your starting deck cards and cards you find along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, combining the Lazarus League’s Reanimate abilities with the Banished’s Valor spells can help your units revive near death with 1 health point, but high armor to withstand continued attacks.</p>

<p>As you collect cards, your runs can become even more personalized with upgrades you collect. Instead of a linear upgrade system, <em>Monster Train 2</em> takes a more open approach to upgrades, letting you choose which aspects of a card you want to upgrade in each shop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do you want to make a card that’s usually only single-use, able to be used multiple times in one combat? Reduce a card’s energy cost? Make a spell’s power more potent? The choice is yours, and you can go anywhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best part is that there isn’t a single “correct” answer. There may be ones you become more comfortable with, but the best answer will change depending on how your run is developing, and what you’re focusing on to do heavy damage or build up your defenses in your run.</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em> - The Repetition Rut</h2>



<p>While you have loads of variety to express yourself, I wish the enemy forces you were fighting did the same. There are a couple of different possible permutations for each of the 8 encounters, but after a few runs, you'll see most of what there is to see as far as encounters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bosses are the same during each train ride through Heaven, with 3 in each run. There are a few different modifiers they have to freshen them up, but it definitely leaves runs feeling a little samey if you are playing as the same clans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Celestial Alcove events, which are small events that let you make choices to affect your deck, also seem to pull from a pretty small variety. I started mostly ignoring these because while some were neat, it felt like I'd seen them all pretty early. When I did see them, more often than not, I ignored them due to the harsh penalties that some imposed.</p>

<p>This will also become the case with given clans. With so many different card types like Spells, Equipment, and Units, and specialized shops for each, you'll almost certainly start seeing the same cards in your runs. However, this was a small snag that was easy to circumvent. When I started seeing a lot of the same cards, changing up the clan made it feel fresh again. Even when I started seeing the same cards, I could make different upgrade choices to make things feel fresh.</p>

<p>More unlocks for content started to unlock throughout the process of the main story. As you progress the story, which will happen naturally as you unlock the various clans and Pyre Hearts, other mechanics, both for your foes and you, will reveal themselves. It's a neat way to gate content and drip-feed new stuff as you progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the story itself is a little one-note and feels like it relies quite a bit on knowledge of the first&nbsp;<em>Monster Train</em>. It's easy to enjoy the game itself without the knowledge of the predecessor, but you might be scratching your head a bit during the dialogue exchanges without it.</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em> - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-prince-review-i-finished-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve" rel="nofollow">great deckbuilder</a> that fans of the genre should add to their collection. The resistance you face can start to feel a little repetitive as you start getting deeper into the game, and the story is more of a vehicle for unlocks than something that stands on its own. But the toolbox of deckbuilding creativity on the player side, from the synergies you can build in your deck to mutators you can add into your run, makes it feel like a game that anyone who takes the time can break in the best way.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-tops-us-gaming-sales-chart-for-april.1195116/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Circana has released its gaming industry sales data for April in the US, and Bethesda's&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>has topped sales charts for the month, an impressive feat considering its availability on Game Pass.</p>

<p>According to Circana's Mat Piscatella,&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>topped the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lpoo44vmwk2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all-format sales charts</a>&nbsp;for the month, and it also hit number one on both the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lpoo4byukv2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lpoo4dcbr52e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> charts individually. The game isn't available on the Switch, so that console's honor went to&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-released" rel="nofollow">shadowdropped last month</a> (although it had become a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-oblivion-remake-images-seemingly-leaked" rel="nofollow">pretty poorly-kept secret</a> by the time it was released). Developed by Virtuos, the game retains the original title's gameplay and underlying engine, but gives it a fresh Unreal Engine 5 coat of paint.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remastered-circana-april-spriggan.jpg?itok=FT8Ftecy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remastered-circana-april-spriggan.jpg?itok=5lkIrgE8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>has sold pretty well, despite the fact that it's on Game Pass.</figcaption></figure><p>In second place on the all-format charts is&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, no doubt bolstered by its PS5 release in April, with&nbsp;<em>MLB: The Show 25</em>,&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>in third, fourth, and fifth place respectively.</p>

<p>On a year-to-date basis (i.e. starting from January and running until May), the best-selling game of the year is still Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which shouldn't come as a surprise given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">phenomenal early sales performance</a>.</p>

<p>Second place goes to&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, which will likely come as a reassurance to Ubisoft given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible" rel="nofollow">grim financial state</a>, and the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>is the year's third best-selling game so far.</p>

<p>In the hardware stakes, the PS5 has once again emerged victorious in April on both unit and dollar sales. Switch hardware sales plummeted by 37% compared to last year, but that's arguably to be expected given that its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">successor is just around the corner</a>.</p>
