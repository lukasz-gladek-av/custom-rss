			<p>The next Battlefield game could be released as soon as this year, as publisher EA has recently confirmed the release window of the yet-to-be-named new entry in the series.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings results report for the third quarter of FY2025</a>, EA confirmed that the game will be released during the fiscal year 2026, which begins on April 1st, 2025, and ends on March 31st, 2026, so there's a solid chance it will be released before the end of the year. As the latest new main entries in the franchise have been launched in either October or November, EA is likely pinning for a late 2025 release for the next Battlefield as well, although it will probably take a few months to learn if the next entry in the series will be following what has become the franchise's tradition at this point.</p>
<p>While very little is currently known about the next Battlefield, it was made clear earlier this week that EA is determined to make its launch as good as possible. A few days back, the publisher unveiled <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-labs-testing-environment-announced-first-pre-alpha-footage-of-next-entry-in-the-series-shown-in-new-video/">Battlefield Labs</a>, a new testing environment that will allow the massive development team, which includes series' creator DICE, Ripple Effect, Motive, and Criterion, to quickly gather community feedback and improve the game as much as possible ahead of launch. More information on the new community testing environment can be found on its <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

			<p>Today, CAPCOM released a free Monster Hunter Wilds benchmark that allows PC users to gauge how the full game will run on their configurations. The benchmark<span>, which weighs 24.8 GB, can be downloaded&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a></span>. As usual for CAPCOM benchmarks, the user will be presented with a score at the end of the benchmarking; the developers have shared a table to outline the various score ranges.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">Score</th>
<th scope="col">Details</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<th>20000 ~</th>

<p>The benchmark is fairly long, featuring a mix of cutscenes and open world gameplay (though not combat). Unsurprisingly, the frame rate is higher during cutscenes.</p>
<p>I tested it at 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLAA enabled, and all settings (ray tracing included) set to max, as befitting the most powerful PC configuration currently available (Ryzen 7 9800X3D + <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5090</a>), and got a score of 21896 and an average frame rate of 127.98 frames per second. This is with the standard NVIDIA DLSS CNN model and x2 Frame Generation, as the game does not support DLSS 4 and/or Multi Frame Generation for the time being.</p>

<p>CAPCOM also shared updated PC requirements for each of the four graphics presets available in Monster Hunter Wilds. Using the high-resolution texture pack will require a graphics card with at least 16GB of VRAM.</p>

            <p>
EA has become one of the first publishers to discuss - in broad terms - its plans for Switch 2, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">now Nintendo has finally lifted the lid on its next console</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to investors last night following the release of its latest financial results, EA boss Andrew Wilson namechecked major franchises the company expected to find a home on Switch 2.
</p>
<p>
"Certainly, our expectation is that products like [EA Sports] FC and Madden and others might find real energy on the platform as they have done in the past," Wilson said. 
</p>

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
"When you think about something like The Sims and MySims: Cozy Bundle, which performed well ahead of our expectations, 50 percent of all players were new to EA," he continued. "That represents a great opportunity for us."
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 still lacks a release date, but with public hands-on events running in April and May, a summer launch seems likely. 
</p>
<p>
Could Switch 2 launch with the current <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>? Or might EA decide to hold off until this autumn's next installment?
</p>
<p>
It's easy to see EA releasing existing titles in The Sims series on the new console - perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-2-re-releases-are-out-now-and-you-can-get-both-for-25">the new Sims 1+2 Bundle</a>? Could EA also make use of the Switch 2's mysterious mouse pointer functionality also?
</p>
<p>
And how about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>? EA could try and launch that on Switch 2 as a way to boost sales, after previously saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">the game had not met its own expectations</a>.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">there's the next Battlefield</a>. EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">still seems unsure exactly when it will land</a> (we may know more after Rockstar decides on a date for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>), but could Switch 2 have the horsepower to run that? It'll be intriguing to find out. 
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo is next set to discuss Switch 2 in April</a>, via a special Nintendo Direct laying out more detail on the upcoming console. We're expecting to hear a launch date and price then - as well as more information on the games we'll all be playing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">other than the next Mario Kart</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/mercy-mains-rejoice-with-the-return-of-overwatchs-moth-meta/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you’re still absolutely addicted to Blizzard’s Overwatch 2, despite the shiny new pull of Marvel Rivals, then do we have some good news for you! Well, that is, if you’re a Mercy main and you’re not on an enemy team facing her. Anyway, Blizzard have announced the return of the ‘Moth Meta’ to the game, as part of the Overwatch Classic trawl through the game’s greatest hits/builds. </p>
<p><iframe title="When Mercy Broke Overwatch - The Moth Meta" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pubueAeyN8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>What is the Moth Meta? It was Mercy’s chance to shine, by utterly breaking the game with her resurrection ability. It let Mercy players resurrect teammates instantly, use her ultimate to recharge the ability, and then get another two shots at resurrection while that was running. This was obviously a nightmare for enemy teams, and there’s probably a good reason that it’s not a thing anymore. But! It was a hell of a time, and now you can experience that same joy/frustration while the mode runs from now until the 17th of February.</p>
<p>What else are we getting? Well, Overwatch Classic continues to experiment with 6v6, and this time you can try it out with Min 1, Max 3 team compositions, experimenting with the way different Tanks, DPS and Healers can achieve success, without filling your team with 6 Tjorbörns. It’s a great question as to whether we’ll get a permanent 6v6 mode at the end of this, that’s both modern and fun to play, but it’s a fun little trip either way. </p>
<p>Besides that, Doomfist arrives as a DPS, and Symmetra is once more equipped with her Shield Generator, mixing up the way these characters play, and how you’re going to need to respond to them. You can do that on three classic maps too, with Oasis, Junkertown and Eichenwalde returning to rotation. </p>


<p>Otherwise, at this midpoint in Season 14, there’s the arrival of the Mythic Lead Rose Ashe weapon skin, which does look suitably cool, and with the end of the Year of the Snake celebrations we’re moving onto Valentines Day which will run from the 4th of February until the 18th, bringing with it Love of Geometry which sees teams of four cupid Hanzos fight for love and supremacy. How romantic!</p>

			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard received strong reviews (including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my own</a>), but it failed to meet publisher Electronic Arts's sales expectations. This resulted in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-developers-and-writers-have-been-laid-off-while-development-of-next-mass-effect-continues-under-the-leadership-of-series-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job cuts at developer BioWare</a>, which now <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly has under a hundred staff members</a>, a worrying prospect for their upcoming Mass Effect project.</p>
<p>During yesterday's Q3 2025 earnings call, Electronic Arts finally&nbsp;<span>discussed the launch's commercial failure. In a statement (<a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/electronic-arts-ea-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcrip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transcript via Fool.com</a>), CEO Andrew Wilson outlined that it was a high-quality game that</span>&nbsp;failed to captivate a large audience, partly because players 'increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement.'</p>
<p><em>Our blockbuster storytelling strategy is built on three strategic objectives: first, create an authentic story experience for the core audience; second, build innovative groundbreaking features; and third, emphasize high-quality launches across both PC and console. In order to break out beyond the core audience, games need to directly connect to the evolving demand of players who increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement alongside high-quality narratives in this beloved category. Dragon Age: The Veilguard had a high-quality launch and was well-reviewed by critics and those who played. However, it did not resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market.</em></p>
<p>Later in the earnings call, Stuart Canfield, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Electronic Arts, added:</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard underperformed, highlighting the competitive dynamics of the single-player RPG market. [...] Historically, blockbuster storytelling has been the primary way our industry bought beloved IP to players. The game's financial performance highlights the evolving industry landscape and reinforces the importance of our actions to reallocate resources toward our most significant and highest potential opportunities.</em></p>
<p>The latter sentence is certainly worrying for fans of blockbuster single player games. It sounds like Electronic Arts might once again veer toward live service, and their previous attempts (like Anthem) were far from memorable. Still, the studio does have at least three single player games in production: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-action-adventure-game-confirmed-by-marvel-and-motive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iron Man game</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Panther game</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third and final entry in the Star Wars Jedi series</a>.</p>

<p>The memo, which was obtained by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-cto-metaverse-reality-labs-legendary-misadventure-memo-2025-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Business Insider</a> reportedly originates from November 2024, where META’s CTO, Andrew “Boz” Bosworth told staff that 2025 is its “most critical” year for the Metaverse.</p>



<p>In the memo Bosworth said, “”We need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR [Metaverse],” he said. </p>



<p>He continued, “And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance. If you don’t feel the weight of history on you then you aren’t paying attention. “This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.”</p>



<p>As reported by Business Insider, Meta’s Reality Labs reported a record $1.08 billion in revenue in Q4, however, it also had its biggest-ever quarterly loss of $4.97 billion. At the time of writing, the Meta Reality Labs division had accumulated a loss of $60 billion since 2020.</p>



<p>To put things into perspective, the <strong>ENTIRE</strong> US video game industry spent $58.7 billion on games and hardware in 2024, a 1% decrease from 2023.</p>



<p>The full memo to employee’s reads:</p>



<p><strong><em>2025: The Year of Greatness</em></strong></p>



<p><em>Next year is going to be the most critical year in my 8 years at Reality Labs. We have the best portfolio of products we’ve ever had in market and are pushing our advantage by launching half a dozen more AI powered wearables. We need to drive sales, retention, and engagement across the board but especially in MR. And Horizon Worlds on mobile absolutely has to break out for our long term plans to have a chance. If you don’t feel the weight of history on you then you aren’t paying attention. This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure.</em></p>



<p><em>I’ve been re-reading “Insanely Great,” Steven Levy’s history of the Macintosh computer. If you haven’t read it the book chronicles the incredible efforts of individuals working in teams of 1-3 to build a device that more than any other marked the consumer era of personal computing. What I find most fascinating about it is the way that even people who left the program on bad terms (it was not particularly well managed) speak about the work they did there with an immense sense of pride. There was a widespread cultural expectation, set by none other than a young Steve Jobs, that the work needed to be “insanely great.”</em></p>



<p><em>On paper 2024 was our most successful year to date but we aren’t sitting around celebrating because know it isn’t enough. We haven’t actually made a dent in the world yet. The prize for good work is the opportunity to do great work.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Greatness is our opportunity.&nbsp;</strong>We live in an incredible time of technological achievement and have placed ourselves at the center of it with our investments.&nbsp;There is a very good chance most of us will never get a chance like this again.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Greatness is a choice.</strong>&nbsp;Many people have been at the precipice of opportunity and failed to achieve. For the most part they failed to even challenge themselves.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>You should be doing the best work of your career right now.</strong>&nbsp;You should be pushing yourself to grow where needed and doubling down on your strengths. When you look back on this time I want you to feel like you did everything in your power to make the most of it.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>You don’t need big teams to do great work.&nbsp;</strong>In fact, it may make it harder. One trend I’ve observed the last couple of years is that our smaller teams often go faster and achieve better results than our more generously funded teams. Not only that, they are much happier! In small teams there is no risk of falling into bad habits like design by committee. You should be so focused on results that being in a bunch of docs or meetings is too frustrating to bear.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>The path is clear.&nbsp;</strong>You don’t need to come up with a bunch of new ideas to do this great work. Most people in the organization just need to execute on the work laid out before them to succeed. It is about operational excellence. It is about master craftsmanship. It is about filling our products with “Give A Damn”.&nbsp;This is about having pride in our work.</em></p>



<p><em>I will close with an Arnold Glasow quote: “Success isn’t a result of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire.” 2025 is the year. Let’s be on fire.</em></p>



<p>What do you think of the Metaverse? Do you think it can succeed with a $60 billion loss? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>&nbsp;if you have any success.</p>

However, it did not resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reading between the lines, Wilson is suggesting that if Dragon Age: The Veilguard had “shared-world features" and “deeper engagement,” it might have sold more copies. But it’s hard to understand that position when you consider EA backed BioWare’s major reset of Dragon Age. As IGN has reported, this reboot saw Dragon Age shift from the skeleton of a multiplayer game with repeatable quests, a tech base, and the outline of a story, to a full-blown single-player RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are already saying EA has learnt the wrong lessons from Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and are pointing to the enormous success of single-player only RPGs that have been released recently, including Larian’s all-conquering Baldur’s Gate 3. Either way, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-dragon-age-fans-fear-the-death-of-the-series-one-former-bioware-developer-offers-words-of-reassurance-dragon-age-isnt-dead-because-its-yours-now">it seems Dragon Age is now dead</a>, at least for the foreseeable future. But what does this all mean for Mass Effect 5?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA CFO Stuart Canfield touched on EA’s decision to restructure BioWare to focus on the next Mass Effect, which has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dev-bioware-reportedly-down-to-fewer-than-100-employees-following-layoffs-and-staff-exits">reportedly involved cutting the 200-person studio down to less than 100 people</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Historically, blockbuster storytelling has been the primary way our industry bought beloved IP to players,” Canfield said. “The game's financial performance highlights the evolving industry landscape and reinforces the importance of our actions to reallocate resources towards our most significant and highest potential opportunities.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that single-player only games make up a tiny portion of EA’s overall revenue. The bulk of the company’s cash comes from live service (74% in the last 12 months). Ultimate Team is doing the heavy lifting here, but there are live service contributions from everything from Apex Legends to The Sims. The upcoming Skate is a live service, and the next Battlefield will inevitably be treated as such, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Hot on the heels of announcing a community collaboration program, Electronic Arts has confirmed that the next <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield">Battlefield </a>game is expected to launch before April 2026.</p>
<p>Revealed with <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx">the third quarter FY25 results</a>, this release window puts it within the upcoming ’26 fiscal year, which could mean a game launch before the end of 2025.</p>


<p>Monday saw the announcement of Battlefield Labs,&nbsp;a community collaboration project aiming to get direct feedback and shape the development of the next Battlefield by a group of studios that includes Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios – now under the collective name of Battlefield Studios. As part of this announcement video, we also got to see some snippets of gameplay footage from the upcoming game, which has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/24/report-the-next-battlefield-6-is-already-in-pre-production-after-battlefield-2042-flop/">reportedly been in development since early 2022</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Battlefield Labs | Battlefield Studios" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_fGteYuaNxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Thanks to an interview with Head of Respawn &amp; Group GM for EA Studios Organisation Vince Zampella last year, we already knew that the next Battlefield has come back to a modern setting, will feature classes as opposed to character &amp; 64 players will be the largest mode. The latter two points were already elements that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/19/battlefield-2042-update-4-1-ditches-128-player-breakthrough-patch-notes-server-maintenance/">DICE rolled Battlefield 2042 back to</a> through the game’s post-launch support.</p>

<p>With this foundational reversion already in place, it seems that Battlefield Labs is more about putting the final touches onto the game, than it is really resetting the direction based on community feedback. There could still be overhauls to character class loadouts, balance changes to weapons and vehicles, amendments player progression, but the next Battlefield is already set to bring back the fundamental core structure of the game series that was at the heart of Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4.</p>
<p>The Battlefield Labs announcement also confirmed what each of the four Battlefield Studios teams is working on. DICE is in charge of the multiplayer, while Criterion is focussed on the single player, and Motive is supporting both of these efforts. The unknown is Ripple Effect (once known as DICE LA). This was the team that created Battlefield Portal for BF 2042, which transported classic Battlefield games, maps and modes into the new engine. A really fascinating side to the game that was one of the highlights from its launch. It’s not clear what they’re working on for the next Battlefield, but expect some kind of adjacent genre, as they say they’re looking to attract a new audience with this mode.</p>

            <p>Hoo-eee! The sequel to the rootinest-tootinest gassiest-guzzlingiest racecar rasslin' game is launching into early access in March this year. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a> is the follow-up to smashing racer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a>, which came out in 2018 but which I only discovered last year while listing our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">best racing games</a>. My friends, it got on the list. Developers Bugbear say they have "overhauled its physics engine to deliver the most intense crashes, deeper component damage, and absolute vehicular mayhem." We can see a little bit of that in a new trailer below, which also gives us an exact early access release date.</p>

<p>March 20th? That's soon! Immature drivers? That's me! At launch the game will have its usual multiplayer racing (my favourite), single player racetrack ruckusing, demolition derby modes, and car customisation. We aren't told how limited the pool of cars will be at launch but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203190/view/514074671752151741?snr=1_5_9_">the devs say</a> "new cars and other vehicles will be added as the game evolves". </p>
<p>They plan to add other cogs and bonnets as the early access trundles along, including: tournaments, a career mode, a skill-based matchmaking system, more car customising options, challenges (funny smash-ups like the first game's chaotic "lawnmower fights") and server queues. This last one being a basic online comfort the original sadly lacked. The one feature I would like to see is the ability to customise and tweak your car while spectating the final laps of a race after you've been knocked out. In the first Wreckfest, you have to quit the race to do that. A boy can dream!</p><p>I'm jazzed, even if it does look like the early access will be lighter on fun stuff than the previous game currently is. As I said in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-engineers-2-early-access-review-a-solid-and-solitary-box-of-building-blocks-yet-not-much-else">Space Engineers 2 review</a>, early access sequels can be a hard sell when the previous game already does so much. Recently the developers had to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203190/view/514074671752154678?snr=1_5_9_">remove some of the game's features from its Steam page</a>, because those features wouldn't actually be present in the early access version, and will come later. "Long awaited features like mod support or additional languages will come throughout the Early Access progress," they said, "or with the 1.0 full launch at the latest."</p>
<p>I'll slam the brakes on my judgements until I play, but know that I can forgive a lot if the cars feel good to swivel and smoosh satisfyingly into my enemies. I am the literal definition of their immature driver. After decades of casually enjoying the motoring machines of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/burnout-paradise">Burnout Paradise</a> or the upside-down antics of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grip">Grip</a>, I finally learned how to drive in real life only last year. It is both less fun and far scarier than video games have led me to believe. But <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playing-wreckfest-while-learning-to-drive-was-surprisingly-helpful">Wreckfest weirdly helped with that</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Capcom has released a PC benchmarking tool for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> so players can test out their machines ahead of release.</p>
<p>Performance has been a big concern for players since the game's last beta, with erratic framerates and visual glitches across both PC and console. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-specs-revealed">Capcom released the PC specs</a> last September, but has since stated it plans to lower GPU requirements.</p>
<p>Now, following last night's Capcom Spotlight, the company has released a benchmark tool on PC you can download <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">via Steam</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/benchmark/">free tool</a> provides a score of your computer's performance, from Excellent down to Difficulty Playing, along with an average frame rate.</p>
<p>The benchmark comes ahead of a second beta, <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/obt/">operating across two weekends in February</a> before the game's launch on 28th February.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-second-open-beta-ahead-of-february-release">various improvements made to the game won't be included in this beta</a>, including performance, weapon changes, Hitstop, and quality of life tweaks. As such, the benchmark tool is the best way for PC players to truly see if their machine is up to scratch.</p>
<p>Last night, Capcom confirmed this beta will give players a chance to go up against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-next-open-betas-will-let-players-fight-flagship-monster-arkveld-for-the-first-time">flagship monster Arkveld for the first time</a>. A new trailer (above) provides a look at the Iceshard Cliffs biome and new monster Hirabami.</p>
<p>For console players, director Yuya Tokuda previously confirmed performance targets across PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. There will also be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-director-confirms-ps5-pro-patch-coming-day-one">day one PS5 Pro patch</a>, for which further details have been revealed.</p>
<p>On <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, PSSR will be used to upscale the resolution with added ray-tracing effects. Unlike on base consoles where two settings will be available to prioritise resolution or framerate, the PS5 Pro will have an additional Balanced mode for a 40fps frame rate with ray-tracing enabled.</p>
<p>The three modes are as follows:</p>
<table data-mobile-mode="scroll">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Performance Settings</th>
<th>Ray Tracing</th>
<th>Output Resolution (Rendering Resolution)</th>
<th>Frame Rate</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prioritise Resolution</td>
<td>Enabled</td>
<td>3840 x 2160 (3072 x 1728)</td>
<td>30fps</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Balanced</td>
<td>Enabled</td>
<td>3840 x 2160 (1920 x 1404)</td>
<td>40 fps</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prioritise Frame rate</td>
<td>Disabled</td>
<td>3840 x 2160 (1920 x 1080)</td>
<td>60fps</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will release across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 28th February. I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">hands-on at Gamescom last year</a> and was impressed by its more streamlined approach.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Bloodborne PSX demake fan-project from tech artist and engineer Lilith Walther has become the latest legal takedown victim.</p>
<p>The Bloodborne PSX demake, you may recall, took the PS4 classic back to its roots, with a PS1 makeover that yielded some rather excellent results. Our Ian gave it a go on release, delighting in the demake's ability to combine two of his favourite things - retro games and spanking werewolves (see below).</p>
<p>But, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloodborne-demake-out-today">three years after it made its pixel perfect debut</a>, the Bloodborne PSX demake project has been hit by a copyright claim by MarkScan Entertainment. This claim comes soon after a fellow Bloodborne fan project from modder Lance McDonald, which enabled Bloodborne to run at 60fps, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-takes-aim-at-bloodborne-60fps-mod-released-in-2021">also hit with the legal take down notice hammer</a>. Eurogamer has contacted Sony for comment, but is yet to receive a response.</p>

<p>But, why is Sony suddenly so interested in Bloodborne-related fan projects that have been around for, let's be honest, quite some time now? Well, McDonald has a "copium" theory that Sony could well be working on an official 60fps Bloodborne remake of its own, and the company doesn't want any fan-related projects getting in the way of Google searches and such when the time comes for an announcement.</p>
<p>"Like if they plan on trademarking 'Bloodborne 60fps' and 'Bloodborne remake' they need to actually clean up in order to actually file a trademark request. Right??" the noted modder mused on social media platform X.</p>
<p>Gosh, I may now have my hopes up again...</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>My copium theory is that Sony DMCAed the 60fps patch and the video about the Bloodborne demake so that when they announce a 60fps remake, google searching for “bloodborne 60fps” and “Bloodborne remake” won’t have collisions with our fan projects.</p><p>Let me cope.</p></div>— Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1886240572660457506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Bloodborne will celebrate its 10th anniversary next month, which suddenly makes me feel old. In the time since, many have shared their hopes that Sony may give the game a remake, remaster, PC port or sequel of some description. After all, Sony has done all this for many of its other IPs, such as The Last of Us, Uncharted and God of War to name just three. However, Bloodborne has remained untouched.</p><p>Last month, former Sony Interactive Entertainment exec and PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida shared his thoughts on why Bloodborne hasn't had the same attention as other PlayStation releases. Speaking following his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">retirement from Sony after more than 30 years at the company</a>, Yoshida said he thinks a key factor in Bloodborne's lack of a remaster or similar comes down to one quite simple thing - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hasnt-playstation-done-anything-new-with-bloodborne-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-theory">the game's creator Hidetaka Miyazaki is "so busy"</a>, it has just not been possible.</p>
<p>"Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created. So I think he is interested but he's so successful and he's so busy, so he cannot do it himself, and he doesn't want anyone else to touch it," Yoshida reasoned.</p>
<p>As for the demake's creator, Walther released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloodborne-kart-back-without-bloodborne-and-with-a-new-release-date">Bloodborne-inspired racer known as Nightmare Kart last year</a>. This project initially had Bloodborne in its branding, but this was changed following a request from Sony.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Call me a cynic if you must, but I'm generally sceptical when someone claims to be "the greatest swordsman of all demons". It's the sort of boast most demon swordsman like to trot out, in my experience. And yet! I have to admit that this Gogandantess lad has a real flourish to him. He's going places, I reckon. Chief among those places being PC at some point in 2025, and he's bringing the rest of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny">Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny</a> with him.

<p>If the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> series passed you by in its heyday, it's basically peak early 2000s Capcom. It started life as a twinkle in Street Fighter 2 producer Yoshiki Okamoto eye, whose original concept was to create '<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sengoku">Sengoku</a> Biohazard' - a historical Japanese take on the Resident Evil series. Throw in a little of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>'s flashy theatrics and some proto-<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh">Nioh</a> combat based on parrying and slashing hulking Yokai, and you've got a series that's been rendered far less unique by time but felt very different for the day.</p>
<p>The first game in the series, 2001's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/onimusha-warlords">Onimusha: Warlords</a>, saw a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/onimusha-warlords-remaster-coming-in-2019">Steam remaster in 2019</a>. At Large Geoff's Muppetshading Fest last year, we got news that Capcom were working on their first proper series entry in years in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-the-capcom-action-rpgs-first-new-instalment-in-almost-20-years">Onimusha Way Of The Sword</a>. That one's slated for sometime in 2026.  Capcom teased a few more details <a href="https://youtu.be/QiLgq9b_62s">in a video yesterday</a>. It's set around Kyoto in the Edo period, and yes, you'll be hitting demons with a sword and sucking their souls through your gauntlet, as is the proper way of things.</p><p>It's a very exciting time to be a lapsed Onimusha fan. These were never my absolute favourites, although I do have found memories, and I'm generally excited when Capcom do basically anything these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Efn1OK2nsY4">There was something in that burger</a>, I tell you.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/adin-ross-faze-gta-6-rp-crypto-server/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Grand Theft Auto’s RP scene is what has kept GTA 5 so popular for all these years. If you venture onto Twitch, you’ll often see that Grand Theft Auto 5 sits at the top of the charts at any given time, and that’s because of the success of ‘GTA RP’. These servers offer a more immersive experience, allowing players to have jobs, join gangs, and generally live out virtual lives on modded servers.</p>



<p>Big streamers have enjoyed the amount of viewers they’ve accrued while exploring the GTA RP world. Now, one of the most prolific creators of them all, Adin Ross, has joined forces with FaZe Banks, and the pair plan to create a GTA 6 RP server backed by cryptocurrency, which players will be able to ‘earn’ as they play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-probably-not">But Probably Not</h2>



<p>During a recent stream, Adin Ross and FaZe Banks outlined their GTA 6 RP vision, expressing their desire to create a server linked with a token or two that you can use to earn money while you play GTA 6 online.</p>



<p>Adin Ross explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When GTA 6 drops, me and Rick here are going to make the biggest server together. We’re going to do the best s*** ever and I promise you, it’s going to be completely crypto — everything pro-crypto about it.</p>



<p>It’s going to change the game because GTA 6 – I promise you guys – they already bought FiveM, it’s going to be all RP.</p>



<p>I’ll have the best and biggest server, I promise you I will.</p>



<p>We’re going to put a lot of money into it.</p>



<p>This is my passion.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Currently, Rockstar Games supports the modding and RP communities that exist at the heart of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. However, the gaming titan <strong>does not </strong>allow cryptocurrencies to be integrated in any way with the slew of GTA RP servers out there. This will be a huge sticking point for Adin Ross and FaZe Banks’ plans.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Adin ross announces GTA 6 news</span></p></article></div>







<p>Historically, ventures linking games with the blockchain, NFTs, or cryptocurrencies have fallen flat on their faces. Ubisoft tried to set up an NFT marketplace tied to Ghost Recon, and it didn’t work at all. Recently, Midnight Society, the developer behind the NFT-backed DEADROP, announced a studio shutdown.</p>



<p>The most dedicated GTA RP players live out virtual lives on the platform. They’ll hold down a job, earn in-game cash, buy and customise houses, meet up with their friends, and even accept punishment from the police when they commit crimes. All of this is done in a world populated by other players.</p>



<p>It’ll be a big seller when GTA 6 is released, but if the track record represents anything, it’s that a solid RP ecosystem won’t exist until a few years after GTA 6 has hit the open market.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cankers-camp-location-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll eventually come across a quest named ‘Canker’. It’s a side quest given to you by Gules in Semine, and it requires you to head to the camp of a former associate of Gules and ‘get rid of’ the band occupying it. However, all you’re given by way of a location is a large, open area on the map.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll help you find Canker’s camp in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and teach you what to do with it when you get there.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-canker-s-camp-in-kingdom-come">How to Find Canker’s Camp in Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>Canker’s Camp is located north of Nebakov, in the lower half of the game world. It’s in a densely wooded area, set back under a rocky outcrop alongside a stream.</p>



<p>Here’s the map location for the camp:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Canker’s Camp location in Kingdom Come</figcaption></figure>







<h2 id="h-how-to-deal-with-canker-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">How to Deal with Canker in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</h2>



<p>Once you’ve tracked down the camp, you’ll want to take it slow and silent, especially if you plan on killing all the camp’s occupants.</p>



<p>The easiest way to deal with Canker is to approach the camp in the dead of night with a dagger. There will be one guard roaming the nearby area with a torch, making him easy to identify. Try to lead him away from the main camp, taking him out swiftly before he can raise the alarm.</p>



<p>Every other member of Canker’s camp – including Canker himself – will be asleep on the beds scattered around the camp, making it easy to stealth kill them with the dagger.</p>



<p><strong>Note: You MUST have a dagger to perform a stealth kill</strong>.</p>



<p>Once you’ve killed every bandit in the camp, you can secure Canker’s mace, which is the core goal of this quest. Then, loot the area and leave when you’re satisfied with the quest completion, heading back to Semine in your own time.</p>



<p>If you like Canker’s mace, you’ll have the option to keep it after the quest. Just ask Gules if you can hang onto it.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/find-nikvard-kingdom-come-deliverance-quest/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/where-is-nikvard-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-%E2%80%93-magnum-opus-quest.1100559/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/find-nikvard-kingdom-come-deliverance-quest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll pick up a quest relatively early on called ‘Magnum Opus’, but it’s a lengthy one that’ll sit in your quest log for quite some time. It could be many hours until you finish it, and there are quite a few steps along the way to resolving it.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I’ve put together a Magnum Opus quest guide, designed to help you conquer the most troublesome objective – finding Nikvard in Kingdom Come Deliverance. He’s a slippery character, but in this guide, you’ll learn Nikvard’s location in just a few steps.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-finding-nikvard-in-kingdom-come">Finding Nikvard in Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>Magnum Opus will be handed to you by the Lower Semine Miller if you follow his quest line.</p>



<p>It requires Henry of Skalitz to find his way into Trosky Castle and liberate a book that’s hidden somewhere within, but details are sparse. As the quest pieces itself together, Henry concocts a plan to get himself inside, but things quickly turn awry.</p>



<p>Once you’ve made your way into Trosky Castle (against your will), you’ll find yourself facing the objective with almost nothing to guide you on your quest. Talking to the Scribe and some of the castle’s occupants doesn’t reveal much, and ultimately, you learn that Nikvard has the book, <strong>but nobody knows where he is</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-where-to-find-nikvard-for-magnum-opus">Where to Find Nikvard for Magnum Opus</h3>



<p>Nikvard has the book – that much is obvious.</p>



<p>If you want to go through the various speech checks and minor actions to advance the quest and level up some skills, feel free to follow the quest as it was designed. If you’d rather skip that and head straight to Nikvard’s location to force the completion of the quest, then you’ll need to go here:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Look for the red flag!</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The red and yellow flag marker is where you’ll find Nikvard in KCD2</strong>.</p>



<p>The location of the Magnum Opus in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is actually <strong>outside </strong>the castle grounds. It seems that Nikvard had a spot of bother with his digestive health and the book ended up falling down a latrine, passing through the sewer pipe and landing on the floor outside the castle.</p>



<p>It’s sitting immediately alongside Nikvard’s dead body, which is a shame. He seemed like he would have been a nice guy.</p>



<p>Don’t worry, the guard standing nearby commenting on the dead body won’t mind you taking the book – but the Miller will comment on how badly it smells when you take it back to him.</p>

            <p>
We might not have seen a whole lot of EA's next Battlefield game beyond the few seconds of pre-alpha footage shared this week, but it turns out it's probably not all that far away. The publisher has confirmed it expect the series' latest instalment to arrive before April next year.
</p>
<p>
EA shared the news as part of its third-quarter financial earnings report, saying its new Battlefield is "expected fiscal year 2026 release". That means the game should - all being well - arrive sometime between 1st April this year and 31st of March 2026.
</p>
<p>
Specifics remain limited, but EA last year confirmed the long-running multiplayer shooter series would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">returning to the modern era</a> for its next outing, and that it'd feature traditional classes and more focused maps - a clear indication it would be revisiting a tried-and-tested formula after shaking things up in 2021's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-is-now-one-of-steams-worst-reviewed-games-of-all-time">poorly received Battlefield 2042</a>.

<p>
Last year's announcement also revealed EA was planning a series of playtests for Battlefield's next instalment, in order to "get the community back on [its] side" - and that initiative, now known as Battlefield Labs, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">officially unveiled this week</a> alongside brief early gameplay.
</p><p>
The next Battlefield game is being developed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-amassing-largest-battlefield-team-in-franchise-history-to-double-down-on-live-service-multiplayer">huge group spread across four major EA teams</a>, now working under the umbrella name of Battlefield Studios. That includes series creator DICE, splinter studio Ripple Effect, Dead Space Remake developer Motive, and Criterion - the veteran UK studio, which, as Eurogamer reported earlier this week, has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">paused work on its next Need for Speed game</a> in order to pitch in with the new Battlefield.
</p>
<p>
EA will be wanting to hit the ground running with the next Battlefield entry after it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">forced to admit 2042 "did not meet expectations"</a>. The publisher also had a difficult 2024, and last month said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard "underperformed"</a> as it lowered its financial forecast for the year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-coming-february-14-new-rumor-suggests/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>There’s yet another rumor suggesting that the next PlayStation State of Play is coming this month. This one, however, has a date tied to the claim.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxgL5aFU6I7_BMaJmsuX3xaYVbkLo9cv_Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PH Brazil</a>, PlayStation is set to host its next State of Play on Friday, February 14. His claims back up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prior ones from Nate the Hate</a> of an event happening in February.</p>



<p>PlayStation’s last State of Play took place in September 2024. That event included games like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a>, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Palworld, and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-revealed-at-state-of-play-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>. In total, they held four in 2024, with the first happening on January 31. </p>



<p>As far as what this State of Play would include, that wasn’t hinted at. There are plans for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-more-xbox-games-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more Xbox games</a> to make their way to the PlayStation 5, so it could be the time for some announcements on that front. Halo and Gears of War are two of the bigger names making the rounds online, though there is nothing to confirm those being the next games to come.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony for comment on these growing rumors. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>



<p>What would you like to see at the next PlayStation State of Play? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

It's been a bit of a busy one for Capcom, what with the publisher airing not one but two showcases to demo its latest wares this week. One half of that dealt with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> ahead of its release this month, but Capcom also had a few things to share about its other titles. So if you missed its latest Spotlight, you'll find everything announced and featured below.
</p>
<h3>Mai Shiranui's fighting pass for Street Fighter 6</h3>

We already knew Fatal Fury's Mai Shiranui was making the jump to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> this week, and we got a further look at her "agile movements, tricky projectiles, and quick attacks" in Capcom's latest showcase. Mai comes to Street Fighter 6 on 5th February PST, arriving alongside the Say Hello to Mai fighting pass - which includes customisation items relating to Mai and Fatal Fury. And as for what's next, Elena is set to complete the character roster for Year 2.

<p>
After a pause to highlight this year's Capcom Cup 11 - which will be determining the Street Fighter 6 world champion between 5th-9th March - it was time to move onto Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics. This seven-game compilation has been out on PlayStation, Switch, and PC since last year, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-now-coming-to-xbox-following-technical-discussions-with-microsoft">technical issues held back its Xbox release</a>.
</p><p>
Those have finally been resolved, however, and it's now available digitally on Microsoft's console - gathering together X-Men Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 New Age of Heroes, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/punisher">The Punisher</a>.

<p>
It doesn't have a name, and it's still probably years off, but that didn't stop Capcom re-airing the same <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">Okami sequel announcement trailer it debuted during December's The Game Awards</a>. The publisher paired this segment with a spotlight on its demo for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review">excellent Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, plus the news that Path of the Goddess and the original Okami are both now available in a two-game bundle.

<p>
This all-new entry in Capcom's fondly remembered Onimusha series was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-onimusha-game-in-development-from-capcom">another Game Awards debutante</a>. For its latest airing, though, Capcom highlighted some of the key areas it's focusing on to make Way of the Sword "as captivating as possible". These include its new protagonist (plus enemies that are interesting "more than just visually"), its setting, and its combat.
</p><p>
Set in a "beautifully eerie depiction" of Edo-period Kyoto, Onimusha: Way of the Sword tells the heroic tale of a samurai who wields an Oni gauntlet, feeding it the souls of monsters roaming the land of the living. Doing so involves swordplay with a particular emphasis on the satisfaction of slicing through enemies, and players can use the souls they collect to restore health and trigger special moves. Capcom says combat will be intense when Way of the Sword arrives in 2026, but stresses it's not trying to make an "impossibly difficult" game.
</p>
<h3>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is being remastered</h3>

If 2026 is just too long to wait for your Onimusha fix, Capcom has you covered. The publisher also used its latest Spotlight to announce a remaster of 
Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny, which  originally launched back in 2002. There's not a whole lot to report on this just yet, but it's coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC sometime this year.
</p>
<p>
And with that, we're pretty much done with the first part of Capcom's showcase. The publisher's having a digital sale across various platforms right now if you're in the mood to sample its wares at a discount, and if you missed it, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-next-open-betas-will-let-players-fight-flagship-monster-arkveld-for-the-first-time">round-up of Capcom's latest Monster Hunter Wilds' showcase elsewhere on Eurogamer</a>.

Specifically <em>Diablo </em>– in which many suspect him of spending real money to enlist the services of a “booster” to grind his character gear, levels, and rank for him – but also <em>Path of Exile</em>, where he was caught even more red-handed, prompting <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/29/elon-musk-video-games-diablo-path-exile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an eventual confession last month</a>.</p><p>This is fitting, considering that Musk has only one real ability, and it is not "intelligence" – <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3lhcfk62z7k2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whatever that means</a> – or even engineering, which he claims to be a generational talent at despite <a href="https://observationalepidemiology.blogspot.com/2018/06/elon-musk-is-terrible-engineer-and-why.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidence to</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/14/23458247/elon-musk-fires-engineer-correcting-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the contrary</a>. Instead, the man excels solely at finding loopholes in systems meant to maintain some semblance of order and ruthlessly exploiting them for his own gain. What he did in games and business before he is now doing to the government, because he's spent a lifetime achieving certainty that nobody will stop him.</p><p>He's remarkably bad at everything else, though.

			<p>There were some major announcements today during the Capcom Spotlight broadcasts, which was then followed by a Monster Hunter Wilds showcase that unveiled even more details about the upcoming game and what players can expect. It was also announced that there will be a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/obt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second Open Beta Test</a> for Monster Hunter Wilds later this month, where those who participate will be able to challenge Arkveld, as well as the opportunity to hunt the "White Wraith." There are some returning monsters, too. However, Monster Hunter Wilds wasn't the only thing that Capcom showed off during these showcases.</p>
<p>New details for <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> have been announced, as Producer Akihito Kadowaki and Director Satoru Nihei joined the show to give fans more details about the story. The title follows the story of a new protagonist who is wielding the Oni Gauntlet, and will have to fight off the demonic Genma. This title is set to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam in 2026.</p>
<p>Not only were there details for Onimusha: Way of the Sword, but it's also been confirmed that Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is receiving a remaster and is currently in development. Fans got a sneak peek of this 2002 title with enhanced graphics during the Capcom Spotlight with a trailer. The title will be coming to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam in 2025.</p>

<p>As of today, MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is now available via a digital download on Xbox One, where you can also purchase the game on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PC via Steam.</p>
<p>For more Capcom fighting goodness, it's been announced that the Capcom Fighting Collection 2 will be available as both a physical and digital title on May 16, with pre-orders for this game being available as of today. This collection will include titles like Capcom vs SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001 and Power Stone 2. There will be new features to help bring the games back to life, as well as online play with rollback netcode. In total, there are eight games in this package for you to play through.</p>
<p>On a slightly smaller note, Mai officially joins Street Fighter 6 tomorrow, so make sure to dust off your controllers and hitboxes as you learn Mai's combos and abilities on the streets. She will be the third Year 2 character for Street Fighter 6, with Elena being the last to join the roster. Additionally, the Street Fighter Capcom Cup event will be returning from March 5-9, 2025, with a grand prize of $1 million.</p>
