<p>
I was a diehard WipeOut player as a kid. Seriously, me and the boys used to roam the streets of Bradford looking for F-Zero players to bully, at least till the RollCagers rocked up and stole our lunch money. Mind you, I think I was probably less interested in WipeoUt's racing than its trackside landscapes, which remain exquisite decades on - all those sweeping album-cover facades with their animate fixtures that thickened and solidified into full-blown peripheral cities as the series progressed. 
</p>
<p>
I am similarly hooked by the worlds of Ghosts Ehf's Phantom Spark, which are a million lightyears from WiPeout in terms of their influences and atmosphere, much as the underlying hover-jockeying is a million lightyears away from WipeouT in terms of its gentleness and lack of combative elements. But these spaces are just as mesmerising to fly through and think about when not focussed on finding the perfect line through the next corner, or avoiding a patch of grass. Small wonder, given that the game's art director is Joost Eggermont, whose <a href="https://x.com/JoostEggermont/status/1790471922389557557">streaking astral contraptions</a> and <a href="https://joost-eggermont.itch.io/anywhere-the-moss-grows">"small interactive moments"</a> I've long admired, but never managed to write about until now.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
There's a Phantom Spark demo coming in Steam Next Fest from the 7th, but publishers Coatsink were kind enough to wire us a code ahead of schedule, which Ed Thorn was kind enough to pass onto me, possibly because he was busy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hollows-out-everything-you-loved-about-elden-ring-and-its-brilliant">getting his arse kicked by Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>. I've played about 15 minutes of Phantom Spark, and it's a lovely, dreamy little thing, a piece of rollercoaster worldbuilding that coaxes out your sense of perfectionism while maintaining a bullet-proof air of chill. Not that there are any bullets to worry about here.

It also has the faint dusting of a story campaign. You are a ball of light trapped inside a craft that consists of flexing triangular surfaces, like an aerodynamic Xmas decoration. As you're getting to grips with your new vehicular prison, a ribbon with a face appears and tells you not to sweat the whole imprisonment thing, because look, there's a race course to run, and rising up all around it, a graceful landscape of weathered and delicately mosaicked stone - a collapsed cyclopean expanse of cubed recesses, trefoil (I think?) arches and dangling, vine-draped pillars. 
</p>
<p>
The game's universe doesn't have a population beyond the ghosts of your previous times, but it does have ancestral guardians who preside over domains encompassing several time trial courses (there are 30 in all), unlocked in order of challenge. I met one during my quick try of the demo, an affable bearded spirit who asked me if the views made me feel "insignificant", which yes, they did, but in a good way. A soothing way. The last demo I played was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mech-engineers-demo-is-for-people-who-love-hateful-interface-design">Mech Engineer</a>. This is definitely easier on the nerves than Mech Engineer, though I'm sure later trials will ratchet up the tension. Beyond that, there are leaderboards to kindle your competitive instincts, and the nowadays-endangered charms of splitscreen multiplayer.
</p>
<p>
Joost Eggermont was the name that got me playing Phantom Spark. Not till writing up the demo did I remember that Ghosts Ehf's two in-house members, Torfi and Joon, are also among the creators of the amazing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nuts-review">NUTS</a>, a conspiracy sim for photographers who distrust squirrels. I would not have drawn a straight line between NUTS and Phantom Spark, but I'm glad to find myself here at the end of it. Take me higher, Ribbon Dude. Show me what's over that blissfully cloudy horizon.

The size of the DLC sounds massive, roughly equivalent to the base game’s Limgrave, Weeping Peninsula, and a part of Caelid combined. And as in past FromSoft DLCs, enemies here will be more dangerous and faster.</p><p>Here’s what previews have to say about <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdrtree</em>:</p><h2 id="h26798"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-first-impressions-of-the-big-dlc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-first-impressions-of-the-big-dlc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>IGN</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>It’s hard to get a sense for just how big the Realm of Shadow actually is, but I will say that my first steps out into it were definitely reminiscent of the first time I emerged from the elevator and opened the doors into Limgrave. There were obvious areas of interest right from the get-go for me to explore, like a crypt that was directly to my left, some scorched ruins directly up ahead, a large castle far off in the distance, and the towering flaming brazier enemy from the trailer roaming around just on the horizon.</p><p>Of course, in true <em>Elden Ring</em> fashion, the very first enemy I encountered ended up murdering me, as if to reassure me that despite my level 150 character with a +25 strength scaled axe, along with 80 points allocated to strength, this DLC wasn’t going to be a cake walk for people with end game builds that have run out of things to challenge them in the base game. It wasn’t even a boss, it was just a random enemy that decided to drop down from above while I was exploring some ruins, with its dual-wielded chakrams that kept me tumbling backwards as I tried to dodge its twirling dance that never seemed to end.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h26799"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-brings-further-depth-and-grandeur-to-fromsoftwares-masterpiece&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-brings-further-depth-and-grandeur-to-fromsoftwares-masterpiece" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Eurogamer</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>One thing that’s certain, however, is <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> already has the look and feel of an absolute epic. With its sombre atmosphere, intricate worldbuilding and cheeky level design, it has all the ingredients required for an additional chapter of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s sprawling narrative. Since putting down my controller at the end of the preview session, my mind keeps wandering back to the Land of Shadow to consider what could be hidden within its craggy cliffs and hills. There are few games that can conjure up a feeling of such vast mystery and potential. When the DLC releases in just a few weeks, I look forward to re-experiencing the trepidation of setting forth into these tantalising, unknown lands. And, of course, being stomped on once again. You’ve got to be realistic about these things.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h26800"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/04/a-three-hour-trek-through-the-land-of-shadow&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/04/a-three-hour-trek-through-the-land-of-shadow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Game Informer</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>My biggest takeaway from <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is that – surprise – it’s more <em>Elden Ring</em>. It’s the most unexciting take imaginable, but outside of the intriguing yet not immediately noticeable wrinkle added by the Scadutree upgrades, it’s a new excuse to revisit a world I love. It’s tough to get a sense of the expansion’s narrative implications and to be honest, that’s the last thing I care about in this game, as interesting as its lore is on the surface. All I want is to experience a new gauntlet of trials and surprises, and <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> seems poised to deliver that and then some.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h26801"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-of-the-erdtree-renews-the-awe-and-adventure-of-elden-ring/1100-6523901/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-of-the-erdtree-renews-the-awe-and-adventure-of-elden-ring/1100-6523901/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>GameSpot</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>So, yes, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is more of the same <em>Elden Ring</em> gameplay you know with new weapons, items, and areas to enjoy. But that is something that no other game has offered and no other developer has delivered. If <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s quality as a whole is consistent with what I played, From Software is on the cusp of reaffirming <em>Elden Ring</em> as one of the greatest open-world games ever made.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h26802"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-dlc-preview-hands-on/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamerant.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-dlc-preview-hands-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Game Rant</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Elden Ring</em> is a Game of the Year award winner, a rousing sales success, and it was a conversation piece for almost all of 2022. So, for most people, the promise of more content is tempting enough. Many players, present company included, are even amid new playthroughs to either get ready for the DLC, reacquaint themselves with the world and the controls, or both. Jumping back into the boots of the Tarnished was exciting and regardless of how brief my time in the Land of Shadow, it was a reminder of just how incredible <em>Elden Ring</em> is. There is no developer out there that can do what FromSoftware does, and<em> Shadow of the Erdtree</em> looks to prove that the developers are pushing themselves just as hard for the DLC as they did for the main game. If the first few hours of pain and punishment are just as exhilarating as the finished product, <em>Elden Ring</em> fans are in for another unforgettable ride.</p></blockquote><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Everyone wants to know the start time for the Summer Game Fest schedule, specifically the timeframe for the live broadcast. I certainly do! Here’s what everyone should know about the Summer Game Fest start time!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-summer-game-fest-start-time">What is the Summer Game Fest Start Time?</h2>



<p>If you live on the east coast of the USA, then you’ll find the start time for Summer Game Fest rather annoying, as it’s at 5 PM. That’s when most folks get off from work, and they’re usually rushing home to take care of children, finish daily chores, and cook the evening meal. But this Friday, make some time for Summer Game Fest. It starts at:</p>



<ul>
<li>2:00 PM PT</li>



<li>3:00 PM CT</li>



<li>5:00 PM ET</li>
</ul>



<p>We’ve confirmed that Summer Game Fest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lasts for two hours</a>, with countless video game reveals, trailers, and details to check out live. Of course, we fully expect a good chunk of wasted time watching celebrities and the chosen few deliver an epic monologue. </p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When is Summer Game Fest? – Answered</a></p>



<h2 id="h-what-games-will-we-see-at-summer-game-fest">What Games Will We See at Summer Game Fest?</h2>



<p>While there are no official reveals leaked just yet, we’ve heard word about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-summer-games-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, and there’s more to come. We expect to see the following titles:</p>



<ul>
<li>Concord</li>



<li>Black Myth: Wukong</li>



<li>Star Wars Outlaws</li>



<li>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</li>



<li>Helldivers 2</li>



<li>Stellar Blade</li>
</ul>



<p>Personally, I hope for a few niche titles, such as The Forever Winter, Beautiful Light, and Ill. Only time will tell!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[What is the XDefiant File Size? – Answered]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-file-size-answered/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-is-the-xdefiant-file-size-%E2%80%93-answered.889347/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-file-size-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>With game file sizes increasing annually, with the likes of Destiny 2 and Call of Duty requiring many hundreds of GBs of SSD space, it’s nice knowing precisely how much space the latest hit needs. With that in mind, what is the XDefiant file size?</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gbs-is-xdefiant">How Many GBs is XDefiant?</h2>



<p>Currently, XDefiant requires approximately 35GB of free space on an SSD, and that’s following its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-patch-y1s02/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most recent update</a>. If you’re playing the competitive first-person shooter on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, then you need 45GB to 50GB of hard drive space to download and install the game. It’s slightly bigger on the consoles, but not much so.</p>



<p>When you compare XDefiant to the staggeringly impressive Destiny 2: The Final Shape, which requests you have 300GB of space available to download the expansion, the 35GB isn’t all that terrible. Of course, we’d love to see file sizes drop significantly in the coming months and years, but that’s not happening.</p>







<h2 id="h-are-the-xdefiant-servers-down">Are the XDefiant Servers Down?</h2>



<p>Following the game’s recent update, Y1S0.2, which didn’t affect the XDefiant file size too severely, the XDefiant servers went down for a brief period for the team to install the update on the server side and give everyone time to download the patch.</p>



<p>It’s a rather small but necessary patch, with numerous bug fixes, social optimizations, and miscellaneous tweaks that will certainly improve the game experience for everyone!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-cryptic-tweets-spark-destiny-3-speculation-as-expansion-the-final-shape-launches<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>As Bungie launches <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> expansion <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2-the-final-shape">The Final Shape</a>, fans think one developer has teased Destiny 3 with a series of cryptic tweets.</p><p>The Final Shape concludes Destiny’s overarching story by placing the player inside the Traveler in a face-off against the mysterious The Witness. It’s the culmination of 10 years of often bewildering Destiny storytelling, and will hopefully provide answers for the game’s player base.</p><p>But in previous videos, Bungie developers have teased that The Final Shape is not the end of Destiny 2 or even the series, with the developer - now owned by Sony - also working on multiplayer game Marathon. In a series of <a href="https://x.com/thislukesmith/status/1797745471521468585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweets</a> marking the release of The Final Shape, Bungie executive creative director, Luke Smith, discussed the road to The Final Shape’s release and the effort its developers put in to make it happen. But it’s the mention of the word Hope three times, each capitalized, that has set the cat among the pigeons within the Destiny community.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Destiny 2: The Final Shape Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Here’s the tweet in question:</p><blockquote>Our Hope is always the same with Destiny games, expansions, seasons, DLCs, exotic missions, secret missions, in-game events, merchandise, et cetera - we genuinely Hope you enjoy the time you spend with it. Anything we've made or will make, that's the Hope. </blockquote><p>That tweet was enough to set off a number of Destiny content creators on the future of the series, and there's rampant speculation across social media and forums.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why you capitalizing "Hope" 3 different times? 👀</p>— KackisHD (@RickKackis) <a href="https://twitter.com/RickKackis/status/1797775373314498830?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.. can't help but notice you're capitalizing that word more than once 🧐</p>— it me: FALLOUT (@falloutplays) <a href="https://twitter.com/falloutplays/status/1797780563471778167?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Destiny: 3 Hopes</p><p>Releasing Fall 2027</p></div>— Destiny Bulletin (@DestinyBulletn) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1797762662924976336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Or, this could be nothing, and Smith may in fact be referencing Paul McCartney's infamous Destiny song Hope for the Future, which, if you're so inclined, can be watched below:</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560" data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>For anybody who doesn’t know in 2014 to coincide with the release of Destiny 1 Paul McCartney released “Hope For The Future” McCartney provided multiple bases for the iconic Destiny themes. </p><p> Link for full song: <a href="https://t.co/14bEdZaTYP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/14bEdZaTYP</a> <a href="https://t.co/0hW87QpQ1S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/0hW87QpQ1S</a></p></div>— Pengu (@Pengu0290482811) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pengu0290482811/status/1796693453767938422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>For now, the focus is on The Final Shape and its three planned episodes. Echoes kicks off next week on June 11, Revenant is set for October 2024, and Heresy rounds The Final Shape off in February 2025, although of course the plan may change.</p><p>Beyond that? Bungie is yet to say. Destiny 3 could be an opportunity for Bungie to reset the series with a potentially next-gen entry-point that would bring in a wave of new players. But, after 10 years of Destiny, the studio may decide to leave Destiny behind for new franchises, as it did when it left Halo behind all those years ago.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-look-at-the-dungeons-dragons-2024-monster-manual-cover<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A new and improved monstrous menagerie.</h2></div><section><p>Today, IGN can exclusively unveil the cover art for the upcoming 2024 edition of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5E Monster Manual. The core rulebook, which will serve as an essential bestiary for dungeon masters, is one of three Fifth Edition D&amp;D books that will be getting an updated version, and marks the first such update in ten years.</p><p>So without further ado, here's a look at the front cover in all its tentacle-covered glory:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/03/0-r5e-mm-cvrtrad-front-051724-1717447781293.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image courtesy of Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure></output><p>Josh Herman, head of art for D&amp;D, told IGN, "We were inspired by the 2014 cover, including the Beholder, which is just so iconic, but we wanted to kinda pull out a bit and show the epic action of D&amp;D versus the close-up. So instead of this sorta 'run for your life' and horror vibe from the old version, we wanted to put players in the center and showcase a couple flavors of hero fighting off this army of monsters."</p><p>Veteran dice rollers and Baldur's Gate fans will also notice some familiar heroes amidst the cover's villain stew, including Minsc and his furry friend Boo (both of whom seem quite undeterred by their current predicament), but there also appears to be a less fortunate hero in the clutches of a tentacle as well. Who might that poor soul be? According to Herman, that's up to you:</p><p>"We're really trying to push open storytelling, so we took the opportunity to include the player as a concept. So the hero in the clutches of the tentacle, we thought 'Well, maybe that's you.' It's really important to us that players feel like they're a part of this universe and these stories, so, who knows, maybe this will serve as inspiration to a dungeon master out there who includes a scenario like this in their campaign."</p><p>Meanwhile, the back of the monster manual focuses entirely on the beasts themselves:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/wotc-monarch-tradcvr-foil-240528-0006-1717462795628.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image courtesy of Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure></output><p>Though you'll find many familiar foes among the crowd, from owlbears and dragons to hags and mind flayers, you won't find any new faces just yet, like the blob of annihilation and vampire warlock teased in the rear cover's description. It seems we'll have to wait until the 2024 Monster Manual debuts later this year to come face-to-face with those horrors.</p><p>D&amp;D has seen a whole lot of renewed interest since the massive success and popularity of Baldur's Gate 3 last year, though <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-wont-make-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-expansions-or-baldurs-gate-4">Larian Studios won't be working on DLC or a sequel</a>. The tabletop game has also been in the news for their <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wizards-of-the-coast-admits-mistakes-around-dungeons-dragons-ai-art-while-releasing-new-faq">"mistakes" surrounding the use of AI in D&amp;D art</a>, and for their recently announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/destiny-2-the-final-shape-official-dungeons-dragons-crossover-trailer">crossover with live-service FPS Destiny 2, which is getting D&amp;D armor and other cosmetic items today</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Monster Manual Cover Slideshow</h3></div></output><p><em>Travis Northup is a writer for IGN.

                <p>Team Fortress 2 is approaching the age of your typical high-school graduate, but its still-vibrant community has a lot to say about its future. Now, the game's Steam Recent Reviews rating <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1798006015205785966" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has dropped</a> to "Mostly Negative" following a flood of thumbs-down reviews from players who are sick of its ongoing bot issues.</p><p dir="ltr">These negative reviews are part of a community effort called "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1d14iqw/its_time_to_stop_the_bots_fixtf2_june_3rd/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fix TF2</a>," which started on June 3. The effort's <a href="https://save.tf/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">site</a> claims that the game has been "nearly unplayable" for the past five years because its official servers are overrun by cheating bots that instant-headshot any player they encounter. The site then notes that Valve has done very little to fix these issues despite the game still making a large amount of money through microtransactions, calling its lack of effort "nothing short of appalling."</p>

<p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time that TF2 players have called for Valve to solve these bot issues. Back in 2022, the official TF2 Twitter/X account <a href="https://x.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted</a> a message of solidarity with players: "TF2 community, we hear you," it reads in part. "...We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things." However, players say that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1d7x24x/they_removed_the_community_note/" rel="nofollow ">little has improved</a> in the two years since.</p><p dir="ltr">First released in 2007 as part of the Orange Box, TF2 has remained one of the most-played games on Steam, often ranking in the top 10 on <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/440" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamCharts</a>. We've reached out to Valve for comment, and will update this story if we hear back.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Star Wars: Hunters sees players take on the role of a Hunter on the planet Vespaara, where high-intensity, high-stakes competitions take place in "The Arena," which features backgrounds that "evoke iconic Star Wars worlds," according to Zynga. These locations include battlegrounds set in locales ranging from a village of Ewoks to the Death Star itself.</p><p dir="ltr">Players squad up in groups of four, facing down enemy teams in third-person combat, and each player can choose from a range of varying Hunters, which can be further customized to suit individual playstyles. Hunters come in three self-explanatory classes: Damage, Support, and Tank. There are currently 13 Hunters to choose from, including Grozz the Wookie warrior, J-3D1 the one-of-a-kind droid, Sentinel the stereotypical Stormtrooper, Rieve the dark-side warrior, and a deceptively adorable pair of Jawa scrappers collectively referred to as Utooni, among others.</p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars: Hunters currently includes four game modes:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Squad Brawl:</strong> The first team to reach 20 eliminations wins</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Dynamic Control:</strong> Teams compete to capture rotating Control Points.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Power Control:</strong> Squads fight to maintain control of the most Control Points on the battlefield.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Trophy Chase:</strong> Two teams aim to hold the Trophy Droid (who is named TR0-F33, naturally). The first Squad to reach 100% wins the match.</li></ul><p>For more information on Star Wars: Hunters, check out <a href="https://starwarshunters.com/game" rel="nofollow ">the game's official website</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-mesa-prime-build-in-warframe.889323/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-mesa-prime-build-in-warframe/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-mesa-prime-build-in-warframe<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="248" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Before bringing your frames in <em>Warframe</em> to mid-late game content, you’ll want to figure out <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-protea-prime-build-in-warframe/">a good mod build</a>. These mods completely change how the frame functions, and can skyrocket its potential for helping your team or taking down enemies. </p> <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">One such frame that’s used by a lot of people has a unique build to spec into. Here’s the best build for Mesa Prime in <em>Warframe</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-mods-and-arcanes-for-mesa-prime-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">The best mods and Arcanes for Mesa Prime in Warframe</h2> <figure data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">All of Mesa Prime’s abilities are solid, but her fourth ability, Peacemaker, is easily her best. The raw damage output from the pistols is massive, and thus we want to focus on improving its stats. The following mods do just that:</p> <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true"> <li>Growing Power (Aura)</li> <li>Power Drift (Exilus)</li> <li>Fleeting Expertise</li> <li>Adaptation</li> <li>Umbral Intensify</li> <li>Vitality</li> <li>Primed Flow</li> <li>Narrow Minded</li> <li>Continuity</li> <li>Transient Fortitude</li> </ul>
 <div data-characters="1035" data-current-count="1035" data-injectable="true"><p>These mods will increase Mesa’s base <strong>Ability Duration, Efficiency, and Strength</strong> while lowering her Range. Since Range doesn’t affect her ult or much in the way of her abilities, it can safely be reduced. Otherwise, the Duration and Efficiency help slow the Energy drain. Vitality and Adaptation are added to give Mesa a bit of survivability since she’s a bit of a glass cannon otherwise. If you want to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-and-use-perspicacity-warframe/">Subsume</a> one of her abilities, a common choice is to <strong>replace her first ability, Ballistic Battery, with Grendel’s Nourish</strong>. Since having a single shot do increased damage isn’t great in most scenarios, the added survivability far outweighs its usefulness.</p><p>Moving over to Arcanes, the best two are <strong>Arcane Energize and Arcane Avenger</strong>. Arcane Energize is good on any frame thanks to keeping that energy value nice and high at all times. Meanwhile, Arcane Avenger grants a massive fire rate increase on pistols when hitting crits. Since your ult counts as pistols, this turns you into a fire rate machine.</p></div>
 <h3 id="h-what-about-her-regulators" data-injectable="false">What about her Regulators?</h3> <p data-characters="102" data-current-count="102" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking for a good build for her Regulators, the following mods will get the job done:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true"> <li>Galvanized Diffusion</li> <li>Galvanized Shot</li> <li>Anemic Agility</li> <li>Hemorrhage</li> <li>Primed Target Cracker</li> <li>Lethal Torrent</li> <li>Pistol Pestilence</li> <li>Pistol Gambit</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="false"><strong>Barrel Diffusion </strong>and<strong> Sure Shot</strong> are decent alternatives if you don’t have the Galvanized variants. Otherwise, we’re building for Multishot and those crits, since we want a lot of those. The Toxin and Status Chance is added to help trigger the Growing Power mod we have slotted into Mesa herself. We also reduce the damage slightly using Anemic Agility, but trade that for a major increase in fire rate.</p>

		<p>Coming off the backs of their two excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-walking-dead-saints-sinners">The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</a> games, expectations are naturally very high for Skydance’s Behemoth. Though it was quickly overshadowed by Half-Life: Alyx, Saints &amp; Sinners was an outstanding example of what virtual reality could do, with open areas to explore, tons of interactivity, and increasingly desperate combat against growing hordes of zombies. The new and original setting of Behemoth comes with a wholly different tone, but it could be another defining, must-play VR experience across all the major platforms.</p>
<p><iframe title="Skydance's Behemoth | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6w7RxfyVceA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Players will take on the role of a diseased wanderer lost in the frigid Forsaken Lands, filled with ruins and dominated by the towering creatures that give the game its name. The elevator pitch naturally gives plenty of Shadow of the Colossus vibes, but the pacing and the actual experience here will be completely different to the PS2 classic.</p>


<p>The combat is at the core of this experience, leaning even further into the melee-heavy nature of Saints &amp; Sinners. It’s immensely satisfying going toe-to-toe with the human foes who stand against you, with the need for a somewhat cautious approach to blocking incoming attacks – either with a shield by holding your blade perpendicular to the incoming attack – before striking back. Time it right and you can push back at an incoming strike, staggering your enemy and opening them up to your own swipe or stab. Single-handed short swords will be a go-to for many, and you have a magic sword that will always return to your inventory slot if you walk away too far. The rest of the time you’ll be scavenging two-handed broadswords, axes, wooden shields and everything else from the environment or fallen enemies. There’s also bows and arrows if you want to try and snipe at enemies, though I struggled to get my aim quite right.</p>


<p>One thing that I was particularly happy to see was that two-handed weapons don’t wave around uncontrollably when held single-handed. You do need two hands in order to actually use them, but you don’t have the visual disconnect between your own steady hand and some heavy weapon wobbling around in front of you.</p>
<p>As is so often the case with virtual reality games, you start to play with the possibilities and see how far you can push the game’s ideas and physical limits. Yes, you can absolutely throw weapons at enemies, grab them and then stab them brutally, even grab arrows out of the sky and then fire them back! Of course, some enemies will be more heavily armoured and need more hits to bash through their helmet, or there’ll be a tougher mid-boss, fully armoured that you’ll have to whittle away at. Some even have the ability to shrug off a certain amount of damage – I mean, I literally had a thrown axe stuck into one boss human’s face, and he kept coming at me!</p>
<p>You’re not just a regular guy either, though. Sure, this horrible disease is very visible across your skin, but you also have a superhuman strength, which allows you to fling enemies around, smash through weakened walls, pull down bridges, and more. It goes hand-in-hand with the grappling hook that is your means to reach more distant parts of the world, the wrist-mounted gadget able to hook onto elements wrapped in yellow rope and pull you up, let you down gently, or pull things towards you with a two-handed yank.</p>

<p>It’s all a nice and satisfying blend of realistic and intuitive elements and video game-y elements that just make sense and will feel familiar. it’s all brought together in an almost effortlessly slick fashion.</p>
<p>The world will also invite a natural curiosity and exploration. Without the day-to-day theming of Saints &amp; Sinners, or the sandbox locations to explore, it can be more tightly constructed by Skydance. That’s not to say that it will be a totally linear journey, as while my demo was limited to a single path, there were several off-shoots and areas that were blocked off at this time – an imposing looking tower, for example, which would be optional to explore.</p>

<p>Of course, the thing that will lure most people into this game are the Behemoths. Our demo concluded with a fight against the Seal Behemoth, a creature so large that it has a snowy peak on its back with what look like tufts of grass growing on it – admittedly, this could be hair. It’s also so large that the ball and chain it flings around is around the size of a house.</p>
<p>Fighting this massive creature gave a glimpse into how Skydance has taken inspiration from Shadow of the Colossus and other traditional games featuring gigantic boss battles. You can’t just get up close and stab its ankles, which probably wouldn’t feel that great as a tactic in VR, and must instead hunt out the weak spots and put to use everything you know how to do up to this point. You’ll also be biding your time, avoiding its sweeping ball attacks and floor stomps until you can hit those weak spots, climbing up craggy sections of its hide to strike those higher off the floor. Oh, and dealing with a few human enemies at the time as well.</p>

<p>It’s a satisfying battle that I greatly enjoyed – especially with the way you finish it off – and my time as a whole was a great introduction to what this game is about. Whether your VR headset sees regular use or has been gathering dust in recent months, Behemoth is shaping up to be a great reason to pop it on and fight through its blend of human-sized and gigantic enemies.</p>

		<p>Thunderful has unveiled a new deep dive for Steamworld Heist II, showcasing early mission gameplay, an overview of the upgrade system, and turn-based combat mechanics. The footage, approximately 13 minutes long, features Art Director Brandt Andrist as he narrates the on-screen action and game features.</p>

<p>One of the first upgrade screens we see is for the submarine, the main form of transportation to explore Steamworld Heist 2’s Great Oceanic Shard. As progress is made slots can be unlocked allowing for additional weapons to be equipped. Early on in the game, you will only have access to basic weapons but as progress is made torpedoes and lasers can be purchased. All of the submarine’s weapons are automated, allowing you to focus on navigating and aiming at enemy vessels, like those of the Royal Navy.</p>
<p>The mission showcased in the SteamWorld Heist II deep dive is titled “It’s A Trap.” Players are presented with a custom difficulty slider before starting the mission, which allows for the adjustment of various level elements to accommodate for different skill levels and playstyles. Additionally, players can outfit their crew with various items to enhance their chances of completing the mission successfully. In “It’s A Trap,” characters Wesley and Daisy stumble upon an outpost, which they recognise as a trap set by the Royal Navy. The footage reveals the turn-based gameplay, where each character possesses action points used for movement or actions like firing a weapon. Characters also have unique abilities that offer extra benefits. For instance, Wesley’s Warcry boosts his own attack power and that of his nearby allies. In combat, an aiming line will appear to show the pathway of your bullet, enhancing your accuracy to inflict damage on enemies. Additionally, if you’re interested in collecting hats, you can shoot them off the heads of enemies to add to your collection.</p>
<p>Missions can be replayed, and they will not always have the same layout as enemy spawns and cover spots are placed randomly. At the end of a mission all characters that took part will gain experience points, even if they fell in combat. Your crew’s reputation will grow as more missions are completed, and this leads to be more missions and opportunities being unlocked within SteamWorld Heist II. Once players have had their fill of exploring for the day, and have exhausted their crewmates, the base will provide sanctuary. Here, goods can be traded for upgrades, the submarine will be repaired automatically, and crewmates will get a much deserved rest, ready for the next day of adventure.</p>

<p>Steamworld Heist II will be released on August 8th for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-dev%E2%80%99s-game-shamelessly-cloned-and-released-for-free-by-grifter.889287/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/indie-dev-game-cloned-dire-decks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie roguelike deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>Dire Decks&nbsp;</em>has been stolen and released on Steam under a different name by "developer" Terry Brash, and he's apparently unwilling to take his version of the game down.</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;<em>Dire Decks&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://x.com/kindanicegames/status/1797831974259941674" rel="noopener" target="_blank">kindanice on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Brash stole the game without their permission, and though kindanice has "tried to get him to take the game down", Brash is "unwilling to do so".</p>

<p>In case you're wondering, the game in question is&nbsp;<em>Wildcard</em>, which you can find on Steam. I haven't linked it here because I don't want to send any traffic its way, but a quick search should reveal it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dire-decks-itch.io-indie-dev-stolen.jpg?itok=DbTDjCyO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dire-decks-itch.io-indie-dev-stolen.jpg?itok=_yGMJ2jD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dire Decks&nbsp;</em>has been stolen and put on Steam without its original developer's permission.</figcaption></figure><p>Earlier today, Brash <a href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797842468098265194" rel="noopener" target="_blank">advertised&nbsp;<em>Wildcard&nbsp;</em>on X</a>, promising a "free action roguelike deckbuilder with online leaderboards". Users quickly began to fill Brash's replies with allegations that the game was stolen.</p>

<p>Brash hasn't responded directly to any of these allegations, but he has posted a couple of bizarre memes on X, including <a href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797909490261745806" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an&nbsp;<em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia&nbsp;</em>clip</a> modded to include the line "did you copy another game?" and <a href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797981318439211335" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a&nbsp;<em>SpongeBob&nbsp;</em>meme</a>.</p>

<p>He also promises that&nbsp;<em>Wildcard&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797961921498325156" rel="noopener" target="_blank">will remain free</a> on Steam, and that it will <a href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797920140828299648" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"prominently" display the names</a> of the top four players on the leaderboard, although again, these messages are flooded with responses accusing Brash of stealing the game.</p>

<p>What's strange is that Brash hasn't made any kind of attempt to refute the allegations of theft (besides the aforementioned memes, which hardly count). His strategy appears to be just brazenly leaving the game up on Steam and hoping all of this blows over.</p>




<p>Brash's repurposing of&nbsp;<em>Dire Decks&nbsp;</em>is pretty barefaced, but it's not clear what's going to happen next. There's always the DMCA takedown route, although that would only work if art assets or code were directly copied from&nbsp;<em>Dire Decks</em>.</p>

<p>In any case, if you think&nbsp;<em>Dire Decks&nbsp;</em>looks at all interesting to you, then I'd urge you to go <a href="https://kindanice.itch.io/dire-decks" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out on Itch.io</a>. Whatever you do, just don't play the Steam version when it comes out.</p>

While there have been head, chest, gauntlet, and leg Exotic armor pieces since Destiny 2 first launched in 2017, Exotic class items look set to shake up the status quo of the game alongside the new Prismatic subclass, when they're introduced in the second week of The Final Shape.</p><p>What makes them special is that each Exotic class item will have two random Exotic perks from a selection of existing Exotic armor perks. Even better, there's a chance for your Exotic class item to have a perk that isn't normally associated with your Guardian class. For example, Hunters can gain improved damage when surrounded with a Synthoceps perk, while Titans can ready their weapons quickly with an Ophidian perk.</p><p>While Bungie has done some balancing to ensure that things don't go overboard, the potential to create finely tuned builds with these new Exotics is hard to resist. Here's how you can get one of these Exotics when you venture into the Pale Heart of the Traveler.</p><h2 id="How_to_get_an_Exotic_class_item_in_Destiny_2__The_Final_Shape">How to get an Exotic class item in Destiny 2: The Final Shape</h2><p>Getting your first Exotic class item is going to require some patience as it can be earned as part of a new activity that unlocks after the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-raid-launch-time-and-everything-we-know/1100-6522790/" data-ref-id="1100-6522790" data-mce-href="/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-raid-launch-time-and-everything-we-know/1100-6522790/">Salvation's Edge Raid</a> World First race is completed, at the beginning of Week 2 in The Final Shape.

<p data-characters="329" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Retro-Bit has announced the next in line for their retro reproductions. This time, they’re visiting Jaleco’s 1990 arcade classic-ish game, <em>Rod Land</em>, or as it’s known in Japan, <em>Yōsei Monogatari Rod Land</em>. They are re-issuing the NES version that was exclusive to Europe and Japan, as well as the Japan-only Game Boy version.</p> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false"><em>Rod Land </em>is a fixed-screen action game similar to <em>Bubble Bobble </em>or <em>The Fairyland Story</em>. You play as either Tam or Rit. Equipped with magic, er, rods, they grab hold of enemies and smack them around or into other enemies. Sometimes, enemies drop various explosive devices, which can be kicked to blow other enemies up. You can’t jump, but you can put up ladders to climb to higher ledges.</p> <figure data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via retro-Bit</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true">It’s a pretty good arcade title (available through the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/jalecos-cute-classic-rod-land-is-this-weeks-arcade-archives-release/">Arcade Archives series</a>), and the NES and Game Boy ports are solid, as well. They both need to make changes for the limitations of each platform, but they’re still a lot of fun. The Game Boy version has some scrolling and you can attack from ladders. It has some additional power-ups, and the enemies will walk directly to you, making them easier to clear.</p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">The NES version changes a lot of enemy behavior, adds some levels, and allows you to jump. It’s also a bit easier than the Arcade version, but the game continues after what would be the end of other versions. It helps to really extend the gameplay. It can also be played simultaneously with two players.</p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">Both Retro-Bit versions come on sparkly silver cartridges. They come with instructions, keep cases with a magnetic flap, and the NES version also comes with an acrylic stand. I’ve covered Retro-Bit’s releases in the past and they’re pleasing quality.</p>
 <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="217" data-injectable="false">Retro-Bit’s <em>Rod Land </em>reproductions will be available to preorder from June 4 to July 7, 2024 via Limited Run Games, Rondo Products, and Castlemania Games. The NES version will be $54.99 while the Game Boy is $44.99.</p>

<p data-characters="283" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of the big additions to <em>Fortnite</em> Season 3 was Mythic Nitro Cars, upgraded versions of the vehicles that have dominated the meta since the patch dropped. The Week Two Quests ask you to drive Megalo Don’s Behemoth, The Machinists Lockjaw, or Ringmaster Scar’s Lockjaw. </p> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, if you activate that challenge in the Quests screen, it won’t give you the locations on the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-fortnite-wrecked-season-3-battle-pass-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3</a> map—I know this because I tried it myself.

<p data-characters="316" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Ascension is one of the most important mechanics in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, and one players should take advantage of as soon as possible. Ascension is the primary way to upgrade a character’s stats, as well as allowing them to reach higher levels, meaning Ascending should always be a player’s highest priority.</p> <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="272" data-injectable="false">Your primary DPS is a good choice for Ascending first, and Calcharo is one of the best DPS in the game, meaning he’ll be on the shortlist for anyone with him unlocked. Here we’ll go over Calcharo’s Ascension materials and the best places to collect them.</p> <h2 id="h-what-materials-does-calcharo-need-to-ascend" data-injectable="false">What materials does Calcharo need to Ascend?</h2> <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">To Ascend, Calcharo needs Irises, Rings, and Thundering Tacet Cores, as well as a fair number of Shell Credits. The amount needed scales at higher Ascension levels, as shown in the table below:</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="6" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th>Ascension</th><th>Shell Credits</th><th>Irises</th><th>Rings</th><th>Cores</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5,000</td><td>0</td><td>4 x Crude Ring</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>10,000</td><td>4 x Iris</td><td>4 x Basic Ring</td><td>3 x Thundering Tacet Core</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>15,000</td><td>8 x Iris</td><td>8 x Basic Ring</td><td>6 x Thundering Tacet Core</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>20,000</td><td>12 x Iris</td><td>4 x Improved Ring</td><td>9 x Thundering Tacet Core</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>40,000</td><td>16 x Iris</td><td>8 x Improved Ring</td><td>12 x Thundering Tacet Core</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>80,000</td><td>20 x Iris</td><td>4 x Tailored Ring</td><td>16 x Thundering Tacet Core</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Where to Find Irises</h3> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">Irises can be found in the Whining Axe’s Mire region, the furthest southeast region of the map. Irises tend to spawn near water sources, meaning following the river that follows the northern highway or looking around the area of the storm should result in players finding a good number of Irises.</p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240604025604-edited-1.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;915&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;515&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">Irises can also be purchased from the Shifang Pharmacy in Jinzhou for 3,000 Shell Credits. There is a daily limit of 15 that can be purchased from here, so players with extra credits may want to consider stopping in daily to stock up on Irises.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Where to Find Rings</h3> <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true">Rings are dropped by Exile-type enemies, who can be found all over the map. You can use the Echo Hunting Tab of the guidebook to mark Exile encampments, it’s an easier way to farm rings.</p>
 <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false">If you have lower-tier rings, use them to Synthesize higher-tier ones. Players with an excess of rings can head outside Huaxu Academy, where extra rings can be turned into rings more suitable for current Ascension levels.</p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wuthering-waves-synthesizing-rings-edited.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1154&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;649&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Where to Find Thundering Tacet Cores</h3> <p data-characters="135" data-current-count="135" data-injectable="false">Thundering Tacet Cores are the hardest item to get, as they both require you to defeat a boss and are limited by your daily Waveplates.</p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">Thundering Tacet Cores are dropped by the Thundering Mephis boss, located beneath Qichi village. The main story quest takes you through the area, so it should be recognizable. Players can choose to fight the Thundering Mephis for several drops, with the most important being the Thundering Tacet Core. The boss itself is resistant to Electro damage, so using characters other than Calcharo will be the most effective strategy.</p>
 <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wuthering-waves-thundering-mephis-edited.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1154&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;649&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">You can fight the boss as many times as you want, though it does cost 60 Waveplates to gain access to the rewards. That means players will be able to claim their rewards four times a day from the full Waveplate amount of 240.</p>
 <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="211" data-injectable="false">At earlier Ascension levels, this won’t be a problem, but you may need to start planning, as later Ascension levels will require more Thundering Tacet Cores than any one player can get in a single sitting.</p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="false">Ascension is the single most important part of Character Progression in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, and should always be taken as soon as possible. With this knowledge, players should always have the right materials on hand, meaning that Calcharo players will always have their main DPS prepared for whatever tasks may lie ahead.</p>

<p data-characters="107" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Is there any better genre than science fiction? Reasonable people may disagree, but the answer is no.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false">Sci-fi novels take us out to the stars or force us to confront our pasts or lock us inside the dark cages of our minds. Sci-fi can do anything and everything, and the best novels of the genre can change your life.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="153" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">Because the rankings would completely change if you asked me again in a week, here are the 10 best sci-fi books of all time in chronological order.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="672" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Penguin Random House</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Frankenstein – 1818</h2> <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">No “best of science fiction” list would be complete without the book that unofficially gave birth to the genre. Some people might not immediately associate the story of Frankenstein with sci-fi, but when you read Mary Shelley’s original novel, all the hallmarks of the genre are there. <em>Frankenstein, or a Modern Prometheus </em>is basically the first speculative sci-fi novel all about how far some men are willing to go in order to pursue scientific discovery. It’s as prescient today as it was back in the 19th century.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Penguin Random House</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Dune – 1965</h2> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="775" data-injectable="true">Frank Herbert’s novel is a classic for a reason. <em>Dune </em>is not just an action-packed sci-fi epic set on one of the most memorable alien planets in the entire genre. It’s also a dense story about politics, religion, and intergenerational trauma. When his family is betrayed shortly after taking control of the desert planet Arrakis, Paul Atreides rises up against the planet’s imperial oppressors, but just because he saves Dune doesn’t mean Paul is really a hero.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Panther Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? – 1968&nbsp;</h2> <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="800" data-injectable="true">There is hardly any sci-fi author more influential than Philip K. Dick. He was a prolific writer who produced a seemingly endless amount of novels and short stories, many of which have been adapted into hugely popular sci-fi movies like <em>Total Recall </em>and <em>Minority Report</em>. <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? </em>was the inspiration for <em>Blade Runner</em>, and it tells the story of an ecologically destroyed Earth, super advanced robots, and tired bounty hunters struggling to make a life for themselves.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Penguin Random House</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">The Left Hand of Darkness – 1969</h2> <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="802" data-injectable="true">There are few sci-fi authors as beloved as Ursula K. Le Guin. She could expertly shift between genres, and though she’s created some great sci-fi novels, she’s also responsible for the enthralling Earthsea fantasy series. <em>The Left Hand of Darkness </em>tells the story of a human diplomat named Genly Ai, who’s sent to the planet Gethen to convince them to join his planet’s federation. Ai experiences extreme culture shock as the novel explores the utterly alien culture of the Gethen people.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Gateway Publishing</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Rendezvous with Rama – 1973</h2> <p data-characters="516" data-current-count="816" data-injectable="true">Arthur C. Clarke is probably best known for writing <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, but honestly any of his novels deserves a spot on this list. I’m particularly fond of <em>Childhood’s End</em>, a deeply haunting first contact story like no other, but <em>Rendezvous with Rama </em>might just be Clarke’s masterpiece. The book is set in the 22nd century and begins as a strange alien object enters the solar system. The crew of the <em>Endeavour </em>go to scout the object out, but they couldn’t be less prepared for what they discover.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bantam Books</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Dhalgren – 1975</h2> <p data-characters="586" data-current-count="886" data-injectable="true">You really can’t pin author Samuel R. Delany down. Sometimes he wrote silly space epics and other times he wrote hard sci-fi thrillers. <em>Dhalgren</em> is one of his most complicated, and most disturbing, works of fiction. The book takes readers on a journey through the city of Bellona, which has been completely isolated from the rest of the world after some unnamed catastrophe took place. An amnesiac man known only as the Kid wanders the streets and meets the city’s bizarre inhabitants. If you’re a fan of Joycean tales or unsolvable mysteries, then this one’s for you.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Beacon Press</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Kindred – 1979</h2> <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="762" data-injectable="true">Octavia E. Butler’s brilliant novel weaves together the world of 1970s Los Angeles and antebellum Maryland to explore themes of race, power, gender, and love. The book follows a writer named Dana who finds herself shifting through time, stuck between life with her white husband in California and another life on a plantation with her enslaved ancestors. Dana is forced to confront a dark history while trying to find a way to stay locked in the present.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crown Publishing Group</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy – 1979</h2> <p data-characters="512" data-current-count="812" data-injectable="true">Not every sci-fi novel needs to take itself seriously to tell a great story. Douglas Adams’s <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em> is a tongue-in-cheek romp through a wildly imaginative version of outer space. After Earth is destroyed for the construction of a hyperspace express route, surviving human Arthur Dent is thrust into the universe against his will. The novel’s world is rich with characters and exotic settings, and just about every page will have you laughing until you’re in tears.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Penguin Random House</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Neuromancer – 1984&nbsp;</h2> <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="845" data-injectable="true"><em>Neuromancer </em>is William Gibson’s debut novel and the book that really kicked off the cyberpunk subgenre. The story is set in a high-tech, low-life future where corporations control just about every aspect of modern life, and cyberspace cowboys are the stars of society’s criminal underbelly. <em>Neuromancer </em>elevates a typical heist plot into an enchanting tale about the birth of AI and how the past haunts people. Cyberpunk has never been more popular than it is today, but the genre’s also never been better than it was in <em>Neuromancer</em>.&nbsp;</p>

Her best-known work, <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>, leans into some sci-fi tropes while telling what’s essentially an alternate history story, but <em>Oryx and Crake </em>dives headfirst into heavy sci-fi elements. The book explores an Earth decimated by climate change and other apocalyptic catastrophes, but it’s as touching and human as anything Atwood has ever written.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/content-warning-sales-soar-past-two-million-in-two-months.889254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/content-warning-sales-two-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Spooky horror hit&nbsp;<em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>has managed to reach a pretty impressive sales number within its first two months on release, publisher Landfall has revealed.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/LandfallGames/status/1797602340197060916" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Landfall says&nbsp;<em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>has hit 2.2 million sales in two months, which means that more than 8.8 million players currently own the game on Steam.</p>

<p>If you're wondering how the math checks out,&nbsp;<em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/get-content-warning-free-for-april-fools-from-creators-of-tabs">available for free</a> during the first 24 hours of its release, and 6.6 million players redeemed the game during that period (including me, although to my shame I'm yet to play it).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/content-warning-sales-2.2m-field.jpg?itok=1hIZl-Q_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/content-warning-sales-2.2m-field.jpg?itok=Xjwweysp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>is selling pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>Following on from&nbsp;<em>Content Warning</em>'s free period, it maintained a pretty solid level of player interest, selling 100,000 copies within a 24-hour period and going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/content-warning-sales-footage">hit the 700,000 mark in a week</a>.</p>

<p>The game was originally released on April Fools' Day, but unlike many of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2024-gaming-roundup">other "announcements" on that fated day</a>,&nbsp;<em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>isn't a joke; it's a proper game you can actually play, and it looks like many people have done just that.</p>

<p>In case you missed out on the fun the first time around,&nbsp;<em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>is a game in which you and your friends explore spooky locations in order to try and "go viral", as the kids say.</p>

<p>If you've played&nbsp;<em>Lethal Company</em>, you're in similar territory with&nbsp;<em>Content Warning</em>, although instead of avoiding monsters, you'll be trying to film them as much as possible (without running out of oxygen, naturally).</p>




<p>The more you film, the more viral you'll go. If only things worked that way in real life, eh? You can use your ad revenue in order to upgrade your gear and film even more spooky stuff.</p>

<p><em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881650/Content_Warning/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Make sure to check it out if you're looking for&nbsp;<em>Lethal Company</em>-style shenanigans in a wackier setting.</p>

The way the player interacts with the world is through typing single words. You control a party of four adventurers, each with their own special attacks, but to trigger them you must first guess and then type in the specific word. Hints for letters in these words are gained as “drops” from slain enemies.</p><p>But X user @countzio discovered that if you never deduce those early attack words, the Cryptmaster gets really pissed off at you. “I refused to learn the first attack in <em>Cryptmaster </em>and my reward was the Cryptmaster calling me dumb and telling me how to refund the game (and an achievement),” they write in a post. The screenshots on the post show exactly that. First, the Cryptmaster breaks the fourth wall and complains that all the player had to do was type “HIT,” and that after a while they straight-up instructed the player to do so, still to no results. He then asks if the player has been playing for two or more hours, as that’s the limit for when you can no longer get a Steam refund. The Cryptmaster then suggests when asked for any additional comments the player should write, “‘I’m an imbecile’ or words to that effect.”</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Frankly, I don’t think this is the game for you. All you had to do was type in the word ‘hit’. I hinted and then I outright instructed you. I even used two separate tooltips. What I’m saying is, it isn’t my fault you didn’t get it. Now I do hope you haven’t been playing for more than two hours, have you?</p></blockquote><p>It’s a pretty hilarious moment, and seems to all be in good fun as a player would have had to actively go out of their way to ignore the instructions and reach this point. In some ways, it’s emblematic of<em> Cryptmaster</em>’s overarching approach to an open-ended structure that allows the player to use their own words to interact with the world in interesting ways. In response to @countzio’s post on the matter, the official <em>Cryptmaster </em>account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/thecryptmaster/status/1796956702924849322&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/thecryptmaster/status/1796956702924849322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a></span> succinctly, “You disgust me, but I like you.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Woods is then shot in both legs, consigning him to a wheelchair. The game later shifts to the year 2025 and we see an older Woods in a wheelchair.</p><p>This new intro suggests Woods <em>will</em> appear in the Black Ops 6 campaign, rumored to be set during the '90s Gulf War. The cutscene also acts as our first look at Woods in Black Ops 6. Perhaps Woods serves the function of being an ‘intel guy’ in the campaign, dishing out information to the player ahead of, and maybe even during, missions over comms.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Frank Woods in a wheelchair in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#BlackOps6</a> in the 90s means Black Ops 2 is canon.</p><p>This means:<br>- Jason Hudson is no longer alive.<br>- Alex Mason may no longer be alive. <a href="https://t.co/ZVN1EAfCxC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ZVN1EAfCxC</a></p></div>— Jon (@MrDalekJD) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrDalekJD/status/1797742778014937583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>There are some unanswered questions, however. Black Ops 2 has two different endings, one in which Alex Mason survives, the other in which he is dead. Perhaps Black Ops 6 will resolve this by making one of the two endings canon.</p><p>As for the Woods intro, Warzone players are currently trying to work out what causes it to appear. It seems random, but there may be some mechanic underpinning its appearance. Meanwhile, there are a number of Black Ops 6-related challenges in Warzone right now, encouraging players to jump in to connect the dots between releases.</p><p>Microsoft will fully unveil Black Ops 6 during its Xbox Showcase event on June 9. Microsoft has confirmed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-insists-it-wont-lock-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-behind-a-new-game-pass-tier-at-launch">Black Ops 6 is the first Call of Duty to launch straight into subscription service Game Pass</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-first-impressions-of-the-big-dlc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-%E2%80%93-first-impressions-of-the-big-dlc.889239/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-first-impressions-of-the-big-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>There was something magical about that first playthrough of Elden Ring – when everything was new and there was a prevailing sense of discovery and awe as I rode through The Lands Between, stumbling upon the horrors of Caelid, the beautiful vistas of Limgrave and Liurnia, and the treasures that awaited after a challenging dungeon. Which is why my three hours with Elden Ring’s DLC: Shadow of the Erdtree was so exciting, because it felt like I was playing Elden Ring again for the first time, in a brand new realm to explore, with new discoveries, new surprises, new gear, and you’d better believe new challenges, even despite my provided level 150 character with end-game level gear. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>My three hour play session began at the Cocoon of the Empyrean Site of Grace, which is where you do battle with the optional boss <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Mohg,_Lord_of_Blood">Mohg: The Lord of Blood</a>. But this time, instead of an empty boss room, there was an NPC named Leda there as well, who asked me if I too was beckoned by Miquella. By examining the cocoon with Miquella’s withered arm ominously hanging out, I was whisked away to the Realm of Shadow. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In true Elden Ring fashion, the very first enemy I encountered ended up murdering me.</p></div><p>It’s hard to get a sense for just how big the Realm of Shadow actually is, but I will say that my first steps out into it were definitely reminiscent of the first time I emerged from the elevator and opened the doors into Limgrave. There were obvious areas of interest right from the get-go for me to explore, like a crypt that was directly to my left, some scorched ruins directly up ahead, a large castle far off in the distance, and the towering flaming brazier enemy from the trailer roaming around just on the horizon. </p><div id="196665"><p><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree (Steam Code)</h3></p><div><p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is a paid DLC expansion for Elden Ring releasing on June 21 for PC and consoles. Players will seek out the god Miquella in a shadowed world full of new biomes, dungeons, and bosses.</p></div></div><p>Of course, in true Elden Ring fashion, the very first enemy I encountered ended up murdering me, as if to reassure me that despite my level 150 character with a +25 strength scaled axe, along with 80 points allocated to strength, this DLC wasn’t going to be a cake walk for people with end game builds that have run out of things to challenge them in the base game. It wasn’t even a boss, it was just a random enemy that decided to drop down from above while I was exploring some ruins, with its dual-wielded chakrams that kept me tumbling backwards as I tried to dodge its twirling dance that never seemed to end. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Story Trailer Stills</h3></div></output><p>Once I got my revenge and a paltry couple thousand runes for my trouble – again, this was just a normal run-of-the-mill enemy – I made a break down the beaten path and wound up at the first big dungeon of the DLC: Belurat. The ultimate goal of the DLC is to follow Miquella’s crosses, which essentially act as Miquella’s footprints and signpost the plot-critical path. The first one I found also came with a message that read: “The Gate of Divinity Lies in the Tower sealed by Shadow. That is surely where Kind Miquella is headed. We are no Empyreans but we must locate the path that will lead us there. I will follow the crosses east.”</p><p>Belurat itself was a fairly large dungeon that was somewhere between the size of something like Stormveil Castle and Castle Morne. It’s not quite the size of a Legacy Dungeon from the main game, but still pretty lengthy and filled with plenty of optional side paths, many of which I didn’t get the opportunity to fully explore. It was a fortress filled with all sorts of new nasties, from scorpions of both the small and gigantic varieties, to relatively weak guards that liked to hide around corners waiting to ambush me, to Gravebirds that sat perched on the ramparts, to heavily armored knights with giant weapons that would occasionally use shoulder charges to bash into me from 15 feet away. Every enemy I fought was a new encounter for me to learn, which was an exciting challenge to overcome.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every enemy I fought was a new encounter for me to learn, which was an exciting challenge to overcome. </p></div><p>The boss of Belurat is one that you no doubt will remember if you watched the reveal trailer. It’s called the Divine Beast, Dancing Lion. It was a difficult fight, and one that required me to make use of one of the new summons in Shadow of the Erdtree: Black Knight Commander Andreas, along with swapping my weapon from the heavy hitting Fireknight’s Fire Greatsword to the much more nimble Backhand Blade, which allowed me to hit and run much more easily. Perhaps the coolest aspect of this particular boss was the fact that its second phase has it alternating between ice and lightning power ups, forcing you to also have to contend with either random lightning strikes, or massive AOE ice attacks that build up frostbite, on top of also avoiding his heavy hitting attacks.</p><p>Eventually I prevailed, gaining the Lion’s head to wear as a helmet (horrifying, but cool), and his remembrance, and moved on to the second main dungeon: Castle Ensis. This place reminded me much more of the Caria Manor, minus, you know, all of the horrifying hand monsters. There were lots of magic-wielding enemies, including a giant in Carian Armor that was much like Bol’s from one of the evergaol boss fights, and an extremely difficult Carian Knight that brought to mind the fight against the enemy that guarded Renalla’s chambers in the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Fitting, because this enemy guarded Relanna, who I probably spent at least 30 to 40 minutes trying to beat. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Relanna was definitely the hardest boss to take down during the preview window, combining fearsome melee sword skills with extremely powerful magic attacks. In her second phase, her two swords would be imbued with red and blue flames, giving them all new attacks that would set the arena ablaze and make them extremely difficult to get out of the way of. And just when I thought I had the win in the bag, she’d float up in the sky and cast a version of Renalla’s Full Moon that would crash into the ground for three devastating shockwaves that could basically one-shot me from full health.</p><p>If it isn’t clear already, Shadow of the Erdtree is hard, but you’re not left completely without a lifeline. Scattered throughout the Realm of Shadow are Scadurtree Fragments that can be brought back to a site of grace and turned in, much like you would a Sacred Tear, or Golden Seed. These fragments will decrease the amount of damage enemies deal to you, but only while you’re in the Realm of Shadow. In addition to that, you can also find Revered Spirit Ash blessings, which can be turned in the same way, but these will instead increase the amount of damage dealt by your spirit summons. </p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Mitchell's Favorite Soulslikes</h3><p>My 15 favorite soulslike games, ranked. </p></div><p>While I didn’t get to explore the optional paths as much as I would have liked in my three hours of playtime, I still managed to find plenty of <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types">brand new weapons</a>, talismans, armor sets, cookbooks and crafting guides, and even an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone. The new weapons were very cool too, with some really unique properties and weapon arts that made them behave quite differently from anything in the main game. The Heavy Smithscript Axe, for instance, could be thrown with a press of the heavy attack button, without any sort of cost or resource tied to it, making it very effective both at a distance and close up. The Milady weapon art puts you into a stance with your arm stretched out to the side, and from the stance you can do a number of cool follow-ups, like a leaping and lunging stab that’s very reminiscent of one of Malenia’s attacks. The Backhand Blade actually can be split into two swords when you dual wield it and has a super sick weapon skill that has you dashing to an enemy’s side for a stab to their ribs. </p><p>I felt like I accomplished a lot in my three hours of playtime with Shadow of the Erdtree, but even then, it still felt like there was so much left on the table. Right when my time ended, I was just about to explore a path marked by another one of Miquella’s crosses that led down into what seemed like one of FromSoftware’s famous poison swamps, and just by listening in on other players at the event, it was clear that I missed at least one other dungeon with a seemingly exciting boss fight that I’m very much looking forward to attempting myself. Fortunately the wait isn’t much longer now as Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is set to release on June 21. </p><p><em>Mitchell Saltzman is a senior guides producer at IGN.

        <p>CEO Danny Kelleher on educating developers on music business models and its recent partnership with Remedy</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>While video game merchandise typically tends to centre around figures, apparel, and collector's items, there's an increasing demand for video game music – to the point where there are well established games-centric labels such as Laced Records.</p>
<p>Laced was founded by CEO Danny Kelleher in 2015, and has since worked on almost 80 IPs across 250 releases, with clients including Devolver, Bethesda, Capcom, Sega, Ubisoft, and Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>Of all the services that Laced provides, its record label is in the most demand. It recently partnered with Remedy once again to release the Alan Wake 2 soundtrack, which dropped on May 13 to mark the franchise's 14th anniversary.</p>
<p>The soundtrack features Petri Alanko's original score, in addition to songs featured in-game performed by singer-songwriter Poe and Martti Suosalo (who plays Ahti in both Alan Wake 2 and Control).</p>
<p>Laced last worked with Remedy for Control, releasing the vinyl and digital release of its soundtrack in 2020.</p>
<p>"Remedy are just really lovely people, and we pitched very hard to bring in Alan Wake 2 as it was something we really wanted," Kelleher tells <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>.</p>
<p>He notes that Remedy was really supportive and heavily involved throughout the whole process, particularly for the eventual vinyl release that both Remedy and Laced have alluded to online.</p>

<p>"We sent Remedy some copies of our previous vinyls because they wanted to put some of their artwork together," Kelleher explains. "Sometimes we do all the artwork, sometimes the client wants to. With Remedy, they love to get hands-on and have creative direction on the artwork, so we're excited to see what they come up with."</p>
<p>Laced has seen increased demand for physical content in the form of its vinyl and CD releases, but sales performance can "vary massively" between AAA and indie titles.</p>
<p>"It's not as simple as 'if it's AAA, it's going to sell really well, if it's indie it's not'," Kelleher notes. "We've definitely seen that if you get the right indie game, they can absolutely compete on numbers with a lot of the AAA titles we've signed. We just did Inscryption which has sold incredibly well and had a massive response from the community. Cult of the Lamb also did incredibly well."</p>
<p>Kelleher highlights that working with indie developers is a core part of Laced's business model in that it doesn't want to "neglect the indie market" and wants to maintain balance between clients.</p>
<p>"We do have a few indie releases that come out that haven't performed greatly, but we're happy to [produce them] because we want to support that side of the business," he says. "If a release supports an indie developer – especially one where it's literally just two or three people, sometimes self-published – we love getting behind those sorts of developers where possible."</p>
<p>Another area in which Laced wants to maintain balance is physical and digital.</p>
<p>Kelleher explains that physical media continues to succeed thanks to collectors within the gaming community, while releasing soundtracks on streaming services like Spotify provides developers with additional benefits when it comes to registering copyrights and collecting royalties.</p>
<p>"Historically, a lot of publishers have put their content out digitally, but may have missed opportunities or the metadata isn't correct," Kelleher explains. "That's not really the fault of the publishers – this is a new world for them. What we're trying to do is support them and show how to structure digital releases globally, make sure the composers are credited where possible, and that the royalties trickle through correctly.</p>
<blockquote>"It's not as simple as 'if it's AAA, it's going to sell really well, if it's indie it's not'"</blockquote>
<p>"Moving forward, digital is a big thing. We want to make sure that the big clients, as well as the indies, have a support network to be able to deliver the music properly."</p>
<p>Kelleher says that Laced's range of audio services outside of its record label has grown considerably over the past few years. This involves music composition, licensing, sound design and implementation, as well as finding composers and artists to make music for games.</p>
<p>However, the current wave of layoffs and studio closures has had an effect on this.</p>
<p>"We've had a few games that we were working on which were cancelled," he adds. "But we're expecting it all to pick up again as things begin to settle, hopefully towards the end of the year and going into next year."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Laced recently partnered with Remedy to release the Alan Wake 2 soundtrack</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Laced's record label has continued to grow in the meantime, which has been built specifically for the games industry in that it doesn't follow the business formula already in place for film and television.</p>
<p>This means that instead of issuing copyright strikes against content shared online, Laced has been building a system that "selectively monetises certain assets" as publishers and developers rely on players sharing their content which often features gameplay videos that includes licensed music.</p>
<p>"For example, if there's a gameplay video on YouTube or an influencer doing a dance to one of the songs TikTok, that's fine," Kelleher explains.</p>
<p>"But if someone has ripped the music from the game and just posted the music up on YouTube, that would be something that we wouldn't take down, but we can go in and monetise on behalf of clients."</p>
<p>Publishing is also a big sector for Laced, one that it wishes to grow alongside its audio services and record label.</p>
<blockquote>"We want the big clients, as well as the indies, to have a support network to deliver their music properly."</blockquote>
<p>"From releasing soundtracks, we realised that a lot of companies aren't registering their music copyrights, which means that they're leaving a lot of money on the table by not collecting it," Kelleher notes.</p>
<p>Last year, Laced set up a publishing business to register music copyrights on behalf of its clients, and began the process of collecting mechanical and performance royalties from societies such as PRS for Music.</p>
<p>"For the moment, [it's all about] educating our clients, showing them how the music and film world has done this for many years, what the model looks like, then building that within games," he explains. "So there's a proper ecosystem and business there for music and, at that point, it should become a serious revenue stream."</p>
<p>Aside from music, Laced also wants to open up to the more traditional side of gaming merchandise having partnered with Devolver to design, manufacture, and sell the developer's items.</p>
<p>"I had no real intention of doing it," Kelleher says. "But through the record label we had already set up manufacturing and e-commerce, as well as fulfilment warehouses in Europe. In the US, we had customer support and e-commerce there too. The only thing we had to change was rather than just making vinyl, we would also make cuddly toys and T-shirts.</p>
<p>"One of the focuses over the next 18 months is to start onboarding new merchandise clients."</p>
<p>Overall, Kelleher says that Laced's main focus for the future is to streamline the business as it works with so many partners across different departments which can result in "a lot of back and forth and approvals."</p>
<blockquote><p>"A lot of companies aren't registering their music copyrights, which means that they're leaving a lot of money on the table"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"When we're also doing publishing, audio, merchandise, you're usually speaking to very different departments which is like running four businesses, so that's been a challenge," he explains.</p>
<p>"What we're doing at the minute is bringing in more of a management structure so we can effectively manage each bit of the business independently."</p>
<p>On a more personal note, Kelleher just wants to see games music succeed as a medium. There are promising signs that video games music is enjoyed by an increasingly large audience, as demonstrated with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/from-the-last-of-us-to-baldurs-gate-3-the-success-of-the-game-music-festival">the recent Games Music Festival</a> and the Final Symphony concert in Birmingham over the weekend – the latter of which Laced put together a vinyl release for and helped the record of.</p>
<p>"I've been advocating for video games music for nine years now, saying this is a serious medium," he says. "Now I think we're seeing a shift to that, and what we're trying to do is put the business model and the structure behind it."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/nvidia-reveals-g-assist-its-new-ai-based-gaming-assistant/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=nvidia-reveals-g-assist-its-new-ai-based-gaming-assistant<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Everyone knows by now that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-beta-now-out-expect-shiny-remasters-of-classic-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nvidia is knee-deep in the active development and leveraging of AI technologies wherever and however possible</a>, but it’s been unclear what the company’s next major gaming step might be. Now, however, it seems that Nvidia Project G-Assist is its next push onwards.</p> <p data-characters="536" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true">For what it’s worth, Project G-Assist does seem like something that could be incredibly powerful in relatively short order. Notably, G-Assist is an on-board RTX machine learning algorithm that tries to provide contextual assistance while you’re actively gaming. “Project G-Assist aims to put game and system knowledge at players’ fingertips. Simply ask a question about your game or system performance, and the AI assistant provides context-aware answers,” says Nvidia’s own official G-Assist <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/g-assist-ai-assistant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false">Examples of G-Assist being useful include sourcing live information on how to progress in games, but also in real-time settings and PC hardware tuning, which is particularly interesting. Interesting <em>and</em> troubling in equal measure, as it were.</p> <figure data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Project G-Assist | Your AI Assistant For Games &amp; Apps" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RdsyJQWUUSs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h2 id="h-nvidia-s-project-g-assist-will-try-to-make-pc-gaming-much-easier-and-more-streamlined" data-injectable="false">Nvidia’s Project G-Assist will try to make PC gaming much easier and more streamlined</h2> <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">Project G-Assist is, from the looks of it, accessible at all times and can be activated either by pressing the assigned hotkey or by using a wake phrase. Immediately upon being called up, G-Assist can be tasked with a variety of jobs, from sourcing answers to gameplay questions to explaining lore in games you’re playing. </p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">If you, too, are wondering where this information would be coming from, that’s simple: from the Internet, of course! Is it going to be wrong? Possibly! Other AI models in the past have been caught <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/22/copyleaks-openai-chatgpt-plagiarism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skimming the Internet for other people’s work</a> with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">varying degrees of accuracy</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="605" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">To demonstrate G-Assist, Nvidia used <em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em>, and the AI helper provides concise, actionable answers to the user’s questions in the curated demo. G-Assist is apparently context-aware, and can respond to queries based on what you’re seeing and doing in the game itself: “Because the assistant is context aware, it can personalize its recommendations to the user’s playthrough: it can analyze skill points, the crafting menu and currently locked engrams, for example, and suggest what to pick next to help players conquer higher-level areas and foes,” Nvidia claims.</p>
 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">Further, the assistant appears to be capable of applying Nvidia’s optimized game settings on the fly, going so far as to track performance statistics to assess whether there’s anything you could be doing to improve your gameplay experience further still.</p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">“It can intelligently find ways to increase performance per watt, such as dynamically undervolting the GPU while respecting a frame rate target. For laptop users, power usage is of particular importance, determining how long they can play before their battery is depleted,” says Nvidia.</p>
 <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">We don’t know yet how, exactly, Nvidia might be aiming to release Project G-Assist to the masses, but given the demo, it doesn’t seem that we’ll need to wait all that long to see how it works in practice.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/should-you-turn-off-crossplay-in-ea-fc-24.889221/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/should-you-turn-off-crossplay-in-ea-fc-24/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=should-you-turn-off-crossplay-in-ea-fc-24<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="206" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Crossplay is indeed a double-edged sword when it comes to the general gameplay of <em>EA FC 24</em>. Matchmaking queues may go faster with the feature on, but veteran players may advise you to turn the feature off. </p> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">The feature was introduced for the first time in <em>FIFA 23</em> after periods of limited testing among players. Thanks to crossplay, players could play against each other without any platform restrictions (as long as they belong to the same generation of consoles). While enabling it definitely helps in matchmaking, there are a few cons, too. </p> <h2 id="h-should-you-disable-crossplay-in-ea-fc-24" data-injectable="false">Should you disable crossplay in EA FC 24?</h2> <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true">We suggest keeping crossplay on to expedite your queues in<em> EA FC 24</em>. However, if you’re having problems with matchmaking, you may want to consider toggling it off to see if adjusting the option helps. </p>
 <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">While I did opt to keep crossplay on when <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-javier-zanetti-birthday-icon-sbc-tasks-solutions/">EA FC 24</a></em> was released, matchmaking has been smoother since I turned it off. Even when the pings are the same, matchmaking between two players on the same platform seems to be a lot smoother. My players on the pitch are far more responsive, and network fluctuations appear to be almost non-existent.</p> <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">If you have a really smooth internet and don’t like to wait long for matchmaking, you can enable crossplay. As I said, the fluctuations are rare (unless the servers are experiencing severe issues), and your better internet might avoid the problems in my case.</p>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">Disabling crossplay in <em>EA FC 24</em> is pretty straightforward – just go to Matchmaking from in-game settings, where you can disable it. Do note that this feature is always enabled by default, so you need to turn it off at least once manually.</p> <h2 id="h-what-are-the-advantages-of-crossplay-in-ea-fc-24" data-injectable="false">What are the advantages of crossplay in EA FC 24?</h2> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">The most significant benefit comes from faster matchmaking as the available pool of players grows. Earlier, in games like <em>FIFA 22</em>, Xbox players could only play with other users on the same platform, and the same applied to PC and PlayStation. Once crossplay was enabled, the pool suddenly merged all these three player bases.</p>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Naturally, quicker matchmaking has many benefits. With crossplay, players can easily play with their friends in co-op sessions without having to worry about their platforms. This was not possible a couple of years back without the presence of crossplay.</p> <h2 id="h-what-are-the-disadvantages-of-crossplay-in-ea-fc-24" data-injectable="false">What are the disadvantages of crossplay in EA FC 24?</h2> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true">While crossplay allows you to play without any restrictions on your platform, there are certain issues with matchmaking. Several users have reported occasional data fluctuations within matches, especially when server loads are heavy.<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gunna turn crossplay off until it’s fixed</p>— GullitGang (@GullitGangFC24) <a href="https://twitter.com/GullitGangFC24/status/1789921831517884693?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="264" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="false">While such fluctuations don’t always occur, they can be problematic, especially if you’re playing competitive modes like Division Rivals and Champions Finals. That momentary drop in your connection could result in conceding goals and leading to losses.</p>

While you attempt to rebuild your ship and escape, you’ll need to find a way to survive through crafting and, particularly after the sun sets, fending off hordes of vicious creatures.</p>
 <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">There’s a lot of playing around with physics to be had here. Beyond just building structures, <em>Dig or Die </em>tasks you with making sure you actually do so thoughtfully. Build without care or consideration and your structures run the risk of collapsing, pushing your escape back even further. There are also water cycles—including threats of rain, underwater rivers, and other aquatic obstacles—that play into the integrity of your base and your basic survival.&nbsp;</p>

There are also custom game modes that let you start out under a massive ocean or in a world made up of flying islands. Or simply skip all the exploration and play the stripped-down Base Defense mode for concentrated building and defending.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="69" data-current-count="69" data-injectable="false">You can dig and/or die when <em>Dig or Die </em>hits consoles on June 5, 2024.</p>

<p data-characters="273" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The release of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-long-will-destiny-2-be-down-for-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an obviously monumental event </a>for the classic Bungie franchise, but it was never going to be a flawless event. Bungie admits as much, too, as the company’s announced the full list of known problems to be aware of as we go.</p> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">Unless you’re eager to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ive-been-playing-destiny-2-wrong-for-nearly-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">risk playing <em>Destiny 2</em> wrong </a>as you hop straight into <em>The Final Shape</em>, it’s good to be aware of these issues. Some of the listed problems are fairly inoffensive, while others straight-up warn you about one-and-done reward instances that you may well end up missing out on permanently, if you don’t know what you’re about. It’s not all bad, though: the list isn’t overly long, and it should be easy enough to stay on top of it.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destiny 2 YouTube</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-destiny-2-the-final-shape-s-known-issues" data-injectable="false">Destiny 2: The Final Shape’s known issues</h2> <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">As per Bungie’s recently updated <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/finalshapeknownissues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Final Shape</em> blog post</a>, there’s about two dozen different issues to be mindful of, as <em>The Final Shape</em> begins to ramp up:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="14" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0">Players enjoying <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s campaign mode should avoid joining missions in-progress or swapping characters; failing to do so could lead to progress and/or reward loss.</li> <li data-index="1">PC players with 3D audio enabled will not get audio output from <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>. Bungie recommends switching the option off while playing the game.</li> <li data-index="2">Placeholder art is present during the ‘Leaving the Final Shape Campaign’ pop-up.</li> <li data-index="3">Casting the Prismatic Hunter’s Blink Dagger Super with the Stasis Grapple active nullifies all momentum and causes the character to fall down.</li> <li data-index="4">The Knock ‘Em Down’ Solar Hunter Aspect does not affect the number of Blade Barrage projectiles.</li> <li data-index="5">The Hunter Arc Staff Super description does not mention that certain attacks (i.e. the ground slam and the three-attack combo) apply Blind</li> <li data-index="6">The Deconstruct Perk description does not mention the new effect of refilling loaded magazine ammo from reserves.</li> <li data-index="7">Vestiges do not auto-convert into Memory items if there’s a Memory item present in your Inventory. Players need to obtain a new Vestige after using the Memory for Vestiges to convert into a new Memory.</li> <li data-index="8">Certain old seasonal items and currencies will not be automatically purged from player invenotires</li> <li data-index="9"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shapes-exotic-khvostov-looks-like-a-proper-delight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Khvostov 7G-0X</a>‘s Trait incorrectly claims that the ricochet rounds deal more damage.</li> <li data-index="10">If you had any tracked Triumphs that got Vaulted with the release of <em>The Final Shape</em>, you will not be able to untrack them.</li> <li data-index="11">If you do not open the final chest of the The Blooming Deep Lost Sector before the cutscene plays in <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s campaign, the rewards will be permanently lost.</li> <li data-index="12">Warlocks picking up a Stasis Shard with the Glacial Harvest Aspect active will not receive the healing effect.</li> <li data-index="13">The Berserker’s Bladefury Super does not properly apply the Woven Mail effect on allies when combined with the Into The Fray Aspect.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">Nothing hugely game-breaking, then, but this is all stuff that we ought to be aware of. Hopefully, Bungie will be able to resolve all or almost all of these problems in the coming days and weeks, and in the interim, it’s at least good to know what we’re up against as <em>The Final Shape</em> finally rolls up.</p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="false">Note, too, that Bungie does not intend to keep this list up-to-date after the release of<em> Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>, so don’t expect it to meaningfully change or to be able to track future problems using it. Instead, it’s just a one-off snapshot of issues leading into the new campaign.</p>
