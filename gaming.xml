<p>It seemingly takes two people to replace one Jim Ryan. <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2024/new-leadership-structure-formed-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony has announced</a> that both Hermen Hulst&nbsp;and Hideaki Nishino&nbsp;will take over as joint CEOs of PlayStation starting June 1, 2024.</p>



<p>Hulst moves on from his role as head of PlayStation Studios to the role of CEO of the newly formed Studio Business Group. Hulst’s group will be responsible for all of PlayStation’s first-party games as well as PlayStation IP in TV and film. He had been the head of PlayStation Studios since 2019 and is also known as a co-founder of Guerrilla&nbsp;Games, the studio behind the Killzone and Horizon franchises.</p>



<p>“It’s a true privilege to be asked to lead the new Studio Business Group for Sony Interactive,” Hulst said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/hermenhulst/status/1790157531555500085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement on Twitter</a>. “I’m excited to continue working with incredibly talented teams and studios to deliver unforgettable game and entertainment experiences.”</p>



<p>Regarding Nishino, he moves into the role of CEO of the Platform Business Group. In his new position, he will be responsible for PlayStation console hardware, accessories, technology, the PlayStation Network, and third-party relations for both major publishers and indie studios. Before the promotion, Nishino was SVP of Platform Experiences.</p>



<p>“I am honored to be appointed such an important role alongside Hermen,” Nishino said. “By working more closely together, we will be positioned to build incredible experiences for an ever-expanding audience now and in the future.”</p>



<p>Both Nishino and Hulst will report directly to Sony Interactive Entertainment chairman Hiroki Totoki. Totoki had been PlayStation’s interim CEO since Ryan’s departure.</p>



<p>“Sony Interactive Entertainment is a dynamic and growing business that delivers incredible entertainment experiences through the connection of content and technology,” Totoki said. “These two leaders will have clear responsibilities and will manage strategic direction to ensure the focus remains on deepening engagement with existing PlayStation users and expanding experiences to new audiences.”</p>

It contains the <em>Samurai Warriors 4</em> base game, as well as more than 150 pieces of previously released downloadable content.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>A total of 55 different officers are featured in this rich depiction of the Warring States period. The new deluxe edition of <em>Samurai Warriors 4</em> contains more than 150 previously released downloadable content, including costumes, weapons, customization parts, scenarios, background music, and more.</p><p><strong>Interact With 55 Different Officers, Including Nobuyuki Sanada and Yoshitsugu Otani</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In response to popular demand, Nobuyuki Sanada and Yoshitsugu Otani are now among the many officers featured in this vivid portrayal of the Warring States period. Takatora Todo, Naotora Ii, and Munenori Yagyu, who previously appeared only in Japanese releases, also appear for the first time in the main <em>Samurai Warriors</em> series. In addition, character designs have been revamped and action elements have been enhanced for fan-favorite characters like Yukimura Sanada and Nobunaga Oda. The range of 55 unique officers, the greatest number of officers in a single game in the series, is a key component of <em>Samurai Warriors</em>.</p><p><strong>Journey Through the Colorful History of the Warring States Period</strong></p><p>In the main Story Mode, a tale based on historical events unfolds in two separate parts. While the regional stories focus on officers from regions across the land, such as Kyushu and Shikoku, the story of unification details the events leading up to the end of the Warring States period. Unlike previous <em>Samurai Warriors</em> titles, this game features battles between each faction, allowing for a more dramatic depiction of the relationships between officers. <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> firsthand the convictions, conflicts, and complex feelings of these officers.</p><p><strong>Experience the Most Exhilarating <a title="Genres > Action [1,831 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a> in the Entire Series</strong></p><p>The true thrill of this series, mowing down hordes of enemies in battles of one-versus-1,000, has been made even more exhilarating with the addition of new elements, including Hyper Attacks, which allow players to quickly close in on their enemies and cut them down, and Rage mode, which powers up attacks when the Spirit Gauge is full and allows players to perform the ultimate finishing move: Musou Frenzy Attacks. In addition, characters’ attack types and the overall progression system have been revamped. These new elements offer an unprecedented variety of attacks, along with the strongest sense of exhilaration of any game in the series, all while maintaining the simple controls characteristic of the <em>Warriors</em> series.</p><p><strong>Travel Across the Land in Chronicle Mode</strong></p><p>Explore the world of <em>Samurai Warriors</em> in the new Chronicle Mode by completing various types of requests, meeting officers, and collecting items in regions across the land. Leave a lasting mark on the history of the Warring States period by customizing officers via Create Character in the upgraded editing mode.</p><p><strong>Switch Between Characters in Real Time During Battle</strong></p><p>Use the Switch Character feature to switch between two different characters on the battlefield in real time as they strive for victory. By switching characters, players can gain an advantage in battle, discover hidden objectives, and receive various benefits. They can also set a detailed plan of action for the character not currently being played.</p><p><strong>Utilize the Strong Connection Between Morale and Combat</strong></p><p>Enemy camps are made stronger by higher Morale levels, but completing objectives and defeating standard bearers lowers enemy Morale and makes it easier to claim victory. As such, the player’s actions have a drastic effect on battle conditions.</p></div><p>Watch the launch trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Hermen Hulst, who currently serves as PlayStation studios chief, will be appointed as CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment’s (SIE) studio business group. Hideaki Nishino will be appointed CEO of SIE’s platform business group, and both will report up to Sony CFO and SIE chairman Hiroki Totoki.</p><p>The unusual appointment of co-CEOs comes just months after former PlayStation boss <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23893389/sony-playstation-jim-ryan-ceo-steps-down">Jim Ryan retired</a>. Totoki had been serving as interim CEO of SIE and was working to find the successor for the SIE CEO role, but Sony has now decided it wants to split up responsibilities for leading its PlayStation business across platform and games. Both Nishino and Hulst are Sony veterans, with Nishino having served multiple roles for more than 20 years at Sony. </p><p>This is the first time Sony has appointed co-CEOs to run its PlayStation business, and it comes amid a game industry that’s reeling from layoffs over the past 18 months. Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084494/sony-playstation-layoffs-2024">laid off 900 PlayStation employees</a> earlier this year and closed its London Studio in the UK that developed PlayStation VR games. Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">laid off 1,900 Activision</a> and Xbox employees earlier this year, and then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">shut down the Bethesda studios</a> behind <em>Redfall </em>and <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> last week in another round of layoffs.</p><p>Sony’s announcement of new PlayStation leaders also comes just hours before it’s due to report its latest earnings. Sony <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24072692/sony-ps5-forecast-cut-q3-2023-earnings">lowered its PS5 console sales forecasts</a> last quarter, so all eyes are now on the number of PS5 units that the company managed to sell in its 2023 fiscal year ended March 31st. We might also get further hints at Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24132846/sony-playstation-pc-overlay-shared-trophies-ghost-of-tsushima">ambitious</a> PlayStation PC plans.</p><p>During an earnings call earlier this year, SIE chairman Hiroki Totoki also <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1757842077121921231">discussed</a> the opportunity to grow PlayStation games on PC / multiplatform. “In the past, we wanted to popularize console... but there is a synergy to it,” said Totoki. “So if you have strong first-party content, not only with our console but also other platforms like computers, first-party can be grown with multi platforms and that can help operating profit to improve.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox Series X|S</strong></h2><h3>The Best Xbox Series X SSD Overall</h3><div id="189730"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox Series X|S" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/01/seagate-storage-expansion-card-for-xbox-series-x-1698863147358.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox Series X|S</h3></p><div><p>Grab this easy-to-install, official Xbox SSD to enjoy extra storage and speedy transfer rates so games feel like you’re playing directly from the console’s storage.</p></div></div><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Easy to install</li><li>Fast transfer speeds</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Expensive</li></ul><p>The Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox Series X|S is just about as fast as the console’s internal SSD meaning you can play games optimized for Xbox Series X|S</p><p>By offering plug-and-play installation, you don’t need to be a tech wiz to gain extra Xbox Series X storage. Extra storage is available with no setup, providing you with high data transfer rates and loading times, so it will feel no different to playing an Xbox game directly from your console’s storage.</p><p>Yes, it is expensive, but that’s really the only downfall of the expansion card. If you want to increase your Xbox Series X’s limited storage the “official” way,  this is how you do it. Working side-by-side with the Xbox’s Velocity Architecture and supporting Quick Resume, you can enjoy games how they were intended. You can also choose between the 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB versions depending on your requirements.</p><h2><strong>2. WD_Black 1TB C50</strong></h2><h3>The Most Portable Xbox Series X SSD</h3><div id="189731"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="WD_Black 1TB C50" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/01/wd-black-1tb-c50-1698863271281.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>WD_Black 1TB C50</h3></p><div><p>The WD_Black C50 is Western Digital's official Xbox Series X|S SSD, that promises to run your games just as fast as the native SSD.</p></div></div><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A cheaper alternative to the Seagate Expansion Card</li><li>Durable and pocket-sized</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Marginally slower boot times</li></ul><p>While Seagate previously owned the Xbox expansion card market, there is now a Western Digital drive with the WD_Black 1TB C50. Compact in size and durable in design, this expansion card comes in 512GB and 1TB storage options and is a more affordable option than Seagate’s offering.</p><p>This expansion card easily slots into the Xbox Series X’s expansion card port, meaning no setup is required. You can transfer games to the expansion card in a matter of minutes, so you can have a variety of games at your disposal. Compared to the Series X’s internal storage, the WD_Black 1TB C50 does offer slightly slower boot times, but this is really very marginal.</p><p>If you don’t need the 2TB option that Seagate offers, then the WD_Black 1TB C50 is the next best thing at a more appealing price. It will take a couple of minutes to transfer large 80GB files, and it’s small enough that you can easily transport it from your house to your friend’s, and enjoy a large library of Xbox games.</p><h2><u><strong>For Archival and Backwards-Compatible Games Only</strong></u></h2><h2><strong>3. Samsung T7 External SSD</strong></h2><h3>The Most Versatile Xbox Series X SSD</h3><div id="189732"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Samsung T7 External SSD" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/01/samsung-t7-external-ssd-1698863454574.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Samsung T7 External SSD</h3></p><div><p>If you're looking to play backwards-compatible games or store your games long-term, longtime favorite external Samsung T7 SSD is a great choice. </p></div></div><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Lightweight and portable</li><li>256-bit AES encryption for storing files</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Cannot play Series X games directly from the SSD</li></ul><p>When you move away from the Xbox Series X’s expansion card storage options, you’ll start to notice you get a lot more storage for your money. This SSD from Samsung, for instance, is around the same price as the WD_Black 1TB C50 but offers an additional 1TB of storage, but there’s a catch – you can’t play Xbox games directly from the SSD.</p><p>Instead, the Samsung S7 is best used for storing Xbox games that you might want to play at a later date, but don’t want to wait around installing them. For instance, you can install the latest Call of Duty game directly onto your Xbox Series X, then store the previous version on the Samsung SSD S7 and transfer it back to your console when you feel like playing it again.</p><p>Weighing a mere 2 ounces, the S7 is perfect for portability. And with 2TB of storage, you can easily store your Xbox games, photos, or work documents on the same SSD. Simply connect it to the Series X using a USB-C cable and enjoy read/write speeds of up to 1,050/1,000 MB/s. Plus, you can make the most of Samsung’s AES 256-bit encryption to secure your files.</p><h2><strong>4. Crucial X8 External SSD</strong></h2><h3>The Best Value Xbox Series X SSD</h3><div id="189733"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="Crucial X8 External SSD" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/01/crucial-x8-external-ssd-1698863650916.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>Crucial X8 External SSD</h3></p><div><p>The Crucial X8 External SSD is a value conscious SSD that's great for storing all your Xbox One and Xbox 360 games, clearing up your Series X SSD for newer titles that need the extra speed.</p></div></div><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Compact and quick</li><li>Storage up to 4TB</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>No encryption</li></ul><p>No different in speed from the Samsung T7, the Crucial X8 offers exceedingly good value for money. You can purchase the X8 in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities. This portable device is great for storing Xbox Series X games, but just like the Samsung T7, you can’t run current-gen games off of it.</p><p>However, you can use the Crucial X8 for your Xbox, PC, and Mac. Whether you need to store games, files, music, photos, or more, it’s easy to carry this little SSD with you. It’s also shock-resistant and durable, so you can sling it in your backpack without it getting damaged.</p><p>With 4TB of storage space potentially at your disposal, it’s an easy sacrifice to make if you have to wait a few more minutes for your Xbox Series X games to transfer over back to your console. In fact, you could store your whole library of Xbox games on the Crucial X8 and enjoy a more affordable storage solution.</p><h2><strong>5. WD_Black 2TB P40</strong></h2><h3>The Best External Xbox Series X SSD</h3><div id="189734"><div><p><img decoding="async" alt="WD_Black 2TB P40" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/01/wd-black-2tb-p40-1698863886136.jpg?width=220&amp;crop=1%3A1&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></p></div><p><h3>WD_Black 2TB P40</h3></p><div><p>With 2TB of storage, this external SSD is the perfect archival drive for your Xbox Series X, though please note you can't run current-generation games natively on it. That doesn't mean you can't store them there for later, though.</p></div></div><p>Pros</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fast transfer speeds</li><li>Robust and stylish design</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A little pricey still</li></ul><p>If you want to make the external storage on your Xbox Series X stand out, you might want to consider the WD_Black 2TB P40 for its stylish design, complete with flashy RGB lighting. Granted, the RGB lights aren’t going to offer better performance, but they do look pretty awesome. Plus, the P40 can be used for your Xbox, PC, Mac, and PS5. But, because it’s an external SSD, you can’t run Xbox Series X games off of this drive.</p><p>Options start from 500GB, and include 1GB, and 2TB capacities, too. The WD_Black 2TB P40 is relatively affordable when compared to the Xbox’s official expansion card SSDs, but in the realm of external SSDs, it’s still a little pricey.</p><p>But, thanks to the USB 3.2 Gen2x2 interface, you can enjoy speeds of up to 2,000MB/s, which is faster than the Crucial X8 and Samsung T7. The SSD is also encased in a shock-resistant material, which can survive drops of up to 2m.</p><p>If you appreciate style and want the substance to go with it, the WD_Black 2TB P40 offers both, with plenty of storage to house your Xbox Series X games and other files.</p><h2>How to Choose the Best Xbox Series X SSDs</h2><p>If you’re looking for a plug-and-play SSD ready to run the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-series-x-games"><u>best Xbox Series X games</u></a> and support features like Quick Resume and Velocity Architecture, you’re options are limited. That makes deciding on an SSD easy, as the <a href="https://zdcs.link/68y2d?_ga=549648315.1689878480" target="_blank"><u>Seagate Storage Expansion Card</u></a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/42q7J?_ga=549648315.1689878480" target="_blank"><u>WD_Black C50</u></a> are basically your only options. Unfortunately, they're both expensive and hover around the same price for 1TB of storage; we’ve found that 1TB is usually the sweet spot for these SSDs.  </p><p>However, if you don’t need to play your Xbox Series X games directly from the drive, there are a variety of other USB 3.2 SSDs to choose from. So, you’ll have an easier time finding budget or high-capacity options ready to store Xbox Series games as well as play older Xbox One and 360 titles. Luckily, these drives easily slot into the USB port on the Xbox Series X. </p><p>You’ll want decently fast read and write speeds for quick loads and saves. Other factors like durability and size should be taken into account, especially if you’re looking to take your SSD on the go. As mentioned, you’ll probably want a 1TB SSD or larger if you’ve got a decent gaming library, but there are drives up to 4TB for a massive amount of storage. </p><h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2><h3><strong>Can any SSD work with Xbox Series X?</strong></h3><p>You can only play Xbox Series X games directly from the console’s internal storage, or via a licensed external SSD, like the Seagate Expansion Card. However, you can use external SSDs to store your Xbox games so you don’t have to keep installing and uninstalling them to free up space.</p><h3><strong>Is the Xbox Series X SSD fast?</strong></h3><p>The Xbox Series X’s storage is a 1TB NVMe SSD, with an IO throughput of around 2.4GB/s.</p><h3><strong>Why does my Xbox Series X only have 800GB?</strong></h3><p>While the Xbox Series X’s advertised storage is 1TB, it uses some of this space for system software, reducing the available storage space to around 800GB.</p><h3><strong>Do You Actually Need Additional Storage for Your Xbox?</strong></h3><p>While the Xbox Series X|S comes with either 1TB or 500GB of storage, you may want to increase this if you plan to install multiple games on your console at any given time. Some AAA titles exceed 150GB in size, so after installing a handful of games, you’ll soon realize you need additional storage if you want to quickly access games and play them straight away.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-franchise-announcement-hinted-at-by-bethesda-trademark/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Doom franchise had a bit of renaissance with 2016’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom</a> and 2020’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/doom-eternal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom Eternal</a>, and with it now being over four years since the last entry in the series, fans are starting to get a bit antsy to shred some demon butt again. Well, a newly discovered trademark may hint something is on the way.</p>
<p>Eagle-eyed fans have discovered a <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/983/49/idkfa-98349237.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent pending trademark</a>, listed under the codename IDKFA, by ZeniMax Media (ZeniMax is, of course, the umbrella company for Bethesda). Beyond confirming that it’s for video game software, the trademark filing doesn’t reveal all that much, but we can infer quite a bit from the IDKFA title, as that is a classic Doom cheat code that gives players access to all weapons, keycards, and full ammo (<strong>ID</strong> <strong>K</strong>eys, <strong>F</strong>irearms, <strong>A</strong>rmor).</p>
<p>This speculation isn’t just coming out of nowhere, as there’s a big <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> coming up, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1789633764336795986" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliable Microsoft insider Tom Warren</a> and others have been teasing that something Doom-related may indeed be at the show. And again, if developer id Software sticks to their 4-year timeframe for making new Doom games, a 2024 release for the latest one would make sense. Of course, all that said, until Microsoft and Bethesda actually confirm something, consider this all speculation and take it with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Xbox has been facing quite a bit of blowback from once-loyal fans, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-flatlining-europe-publishers-questioning-support-ps5-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series X/S sales flatline</a>, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-ps5-xbox-exclusives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bring former exclusives to other platforms</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close studios responsible for acclaimed games like Hi-Fi Rush and Prey</a>. It’s widely expected the Xbox Showcase will provide a first look at the next Call of Duty and Gears titles, so adding Doom to that lineup really would make it an exciting show for shooter fans.</p>
<p>The Xbox Games Showcase will be streamed on June 9. What do you think? Excited to get your hands on the next thing from id Software? Just how crazy will the next Doom get?</p>

            <p>
It's been a funny few weeks for Helldivers 2; one day it was riding high on its well-deserved success, the next it was being reviewed bombed into oblivion after Sony decided to foist <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">mandatory PSN accounts</a> on PC players. But now that drama is starting to subside following a dramatic U-turn, all thoughts have turned to one thing: was the review bomb cape developer Arrowhead's CEO Johan Pilestedt previously hinted at real? It would certain seem so.
</p>
<p>
Talk of a review-bomb-inspired Helldivers 2 cape, if you're a little behind on events, first surfaced as fans celebrated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony's U-turn</a> on Tuesday - an unexpected reversal that followed one hell of a weekend for Helldivers 2, in which Arrowhead's was unusually, publicly frank about its frustration with Sony and its handling of the PSN situation, and in which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">over 200,000 negative Steam reviews</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-pc-players-secure-refunds-as-steam-waives-playtime-limit">mass refunds</a>, and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">absolute mess</a> of a situation in territories where PSN was unavailable finally forced Sony's hand.
</p>
<p>
As the drama began to subside, Pilestedt took to social media to <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1787370710597312605?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">share a community created cape</a> design - featuring four red vertical lines mirroring those of Helldivers 2's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/">Steam review sentiment graph</a> during the review bombing - offhandedly remarking when asked if it would become "a thing", that, "The team is talking about a good name for it right now." It just wasn't entirely clear to what degree he was joking. And it turns out he (probably) wasn't joking at all.
</p>
<figure><figcaption>Helldivers 2's latest Warbond recently arrived.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwQzxcWQook" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Over the weekend, Pilestedt <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1789406952243577164">posted a cropped image</a> seemingly teasing an official new Helldivers 2 cape design, which notably included three red lines bearing a suspicious resemblance to Helldivers 2's now legendary Steam review slump graph. And if that wasn't enough to convince that Arrowhead really is readying to commemorate the community's monumental collaborative achievement, Helldivers 2 community manager Twinbeard (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-is-actually-making-a-review-bomb-cape-to-commemorate-the-helldivers-2-psn-fiasco-complete-with-two-huge-negative-review-bars/">PC Gamer</a>) also popped up on the game's official Discord server to say, "We already have a name, should there ever hypothetically be a cape, that is."
</p> 
<p>
There's no indication of when - if - such a thing might eventually make it in-game but it'll give the Helldivers 2 community something to look forward to while Operation Clean-up, which has so far successfully managed to reverse around half of those negative Steam reviews, continues.

                <p dir="ltr"><span>For avid gamers who spend a lot of time sitting at their desks, investing in a quality gaming chair is a wise decision. A good gaming chair can keep you comfortable and supported through marathon gaming sessions--not to mention everything else you do at a desk, like working from home, streaming, or voice chatting with friends.</span></p><p dir="ltr">To help you find a good chair that fits your lifestyle and needs, we put together this list of the best gaming chairs available in 2024. The list features an array of choices from top brands, from the classic racing-style seats from Razer, sleek ergonomic chairs with lumbar support from Herman Miller, and even a giant beanbag that's perfect for lounging. We've also made sure to include picks from a range of price points. While the best gaming chairs often start at around $400, our comprehensive list includes options for every budget. However, if you're looking for a list full of cheaper alternatives, make sure to check out our guide to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-cheap-gaming-chair-2020-budget-chairs-under-200/1100-6476492/">best budget gaming chairs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Before we dive in, let's briefly discuss the benefits of gaming chairs.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Benefits of a gaming chair vs. office chair</strong></h3><p>The main benefit quality gaming chairs have over many regular office chairs is their ergonomic design, particularly <strong>lumbar and head/neck support</strong>. While a regular swivel office chair may do well for short intervals, a PC gaming chair is made for consistent, prolonged use. They generally have thicker cushions and, importantly, extra lumbar and head cushions. If you're finding that your lower back is sore after sitting in a regular desk chair, an ergonomic gaming chair is a great option for you.</p><p>Once you assemble your chair, there are a few things you should keep in mind when using it at your desk. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/office-ergonomics/art-20046169" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Mayo Clinic</a> recommends adjusting the seat height so that your feet lay flat on the floor. Armrests should be situated so that your shoulders can be relaxed while resting your elbows, and your knees should be parallel to your hips.</p><p>Gaming chairs are versatile, though. When not hammering away at the keyboard, they still provide comfort and support when reclined. While remaining upright at a desk is helpful, chances are you're looking at a gaming chair for more than just work, and most of the chairs on this list are designed for both work and play.</p><div title="6486393 - Best Gaming Chairs - Entries" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="797" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6486393 - Best Gaming Chairs - Entries" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Best Overall Gaming Chair</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Secretlab Titan Evo 2022 Series</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/3858696-titanevo2022.png">                             <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3RG3MD9?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20"></a>                        </p>              <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specs:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Upholstery:</strong> Secretlab NEO Hybrid Leatherette, SoftWeave Plus Fabric, or Secretlab NAPA Leather</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cushion:</strong> cold-cure foam</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Lumbar:</strong> Built-in dynamic lumbar support</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Backrest:</strong> 33 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Seat width:</strong> 19.3 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recline:</strong> 85 -165 degrees</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Armrests:</strong> Adjustable 4-directional armrests with hot-swappable armrest tops</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight limit:</strong> 200lbs (Small); 220lbs (Regular); 395lbs (XL)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>User height range:</strong> ≤ 5’6” (Small) / 5’7” - 6’2” (Regular) / 5’11” - 6’9” (XL)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Warranty:</strong> Up to 5 years</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Unique features:</strong> Memory foam head pillow; optional SoftWeave Plus fabric skins.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Secretlab Titan Evo gaming chair is our pick for the best gaming chair you can buy today. It's a relatively affordable chair, but it's rocking quality materials and great features that you would expect from something twice as expensive. Best of all, just about everyone can grab this chair. Instead of offering just a single model, titan Evo comes in three sizes of the same design--small, regular, and XL-- that fit a wide variety of users. Each size also comes in four upholstery options: NEO Hybrid Leatherette, SoftWeave Plus fabric, NAPA leather, and Exotic Ash Microsuede.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from the differences in physical measurements and fabric options, all three sizes share the same features, including built-in lumbar support that automatically adjusts to your sitting position. The Titan Evo also has 4D adjustable armrests and a memory foam neck pillow, all of which conveniently attach magnetically.</p><p dir="ltr">Titan Evo Leatherette models start at $429, SoftWeave Plus editions start at $469, NAPA Leather starts at $899, and microsuede editions are $1,700. Each of the fabric options comes in various color or theme options, which you can use to customize your chair, including skins based on games like League of Legends and Overwatch or popular pop culture franchises like Batman, Game of Thrones, and more.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secretlab-Titan-BLACK3-SoftWeave-Gaming/dp/B0CR6FGR4G?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Secretlab-Titan-BLACK3-SoftWeave-Gaming\/dp\/B0CR6FGR4G?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Secretlab-Titan-BLACK3-SoftWeave-Gaming/dp/B0CR6FGR4G?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Best Gaming Chair - Runner-Up</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secretlab-Titan-BLACK3-SoftWeave-Gaming/dp/B0CR6FGR4G?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Secretlab-Titan-BLACK3-SoftWeave-Gaming\/dp\/B0CR6FGR4G?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Secretlab-Titan-BLACK3-SoftWeave-Gaming/dp/B0CR6FGR4G?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Secretlab Titan Evo Lite</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1701/17013431/4302432-titanevolite.jpg">                             <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secretlab-Titan-BLACK3-SoftWeave-Gaming/dp/B0CR6FGR4G?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Secretlab-Titan-BLACK3-SoftWeave-Gaming\/dp\/B0CR6FGR4G?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Secretlab-Titan-BLACK3-SoftWeave-Gaming/dp/B0CR6FGR4G?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20"></a>                        </p>              <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specs:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Upholstery:</strong> Secretlab Prime Leatherette, SoftWeave Fabric</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cushion:</strong> Cold-cure foam</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Lumbar:</strong> Built-in dynamic lumbar support</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recline:</strong> 85 -165 degrees</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Armrests:</strong> 4-Directional, Soft PU Coated Armrest Tops</li><li dir="ltr">Weight limit: 220lbs (Regular); 395lbs (XL)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>User height range:</strong> 5’7” - 6’2” (Regular) / 5’11” - 6’9” (XL)</li><li dir="ltr">Warranty: Up to 5 years</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Unique features:</strong> Memory foam head pillow; optional SoftWeave Plus fabric skins,</li></ul><p dir="ltr">If the Titan Evo is too expensive or you want something a bit more streamlined, the obvious alternative in our minds is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/secretlabs-new-gaming-chair-is-more-budget-friendly-still-high-quality/1100-6520551/" data-ref-id="1100-6520551">Titan Evo Lite</a>. The Lite version is a more affordable option that maintains the standard Titan Evo's overall design and ergonomics, including cold-cure foam padding in the seat, built-in lumbar support, and memory foam head pillow that makes it great for long gaming sessions or general office use alike.</p><p dir="ltr">The main concessions between the Evo Lite and standard Evo is versatility and customizability. Whereas the standard Evo has three models to choose from, the Evo Lite only has two (Regulard and XL), which may limit its viability for anyone looking for a smaller chair. It also offers fewer upholstery options, but the Prime Leatherette and Softweave fabric are both solid choices. For those reasons, we're keeping the Evo Lite to just our "runner-up" best gaming chair option rather than the top pick, but if the sizing and fabric options match your needs, it's absolutely worth checking out. The chair is available at both Amazon and Secretlab, though you'll find more customization options available at Secretlab.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black\/dp\/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Best Premium Gaming Chair</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black\/dp\/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Mavix M9</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/3858697-mavixm9.png">                             <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black\/dp\/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M9-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09MDWBB99?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20"></a>                        </p>              <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specs:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Upholstery:</strong> M-Breeze Fabric</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cushion:</strong> Cool gel memory foam</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Lumbar:</strong> Dynamic Variable Lumbar support</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Backrest:</strong> 34 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Seat width:</strong> 21.74 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recline:</strong> Up to 127 degrees</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Armrests:</strong> 4-directional armests</li><li dir="ltr">Weight limit: 275lbs</li><li dir="ltr">Warranty: 5 years</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Unique features:</strong> Adjustable headrest angle; optional Elemax heating pad</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Mavix is a relative newcomer to the gaming chair space, but it's already made waves thanks to high-profile streamer sponsorships and a dedication to quality. Mavix currently has four gaming chairs, each of which share a similar design. The Mavix M9, the company's most extravagant and expensive chair, is the comfiest chair on this list and comes in as our pick for the best premium gaming chair.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike most of the other chairs on this list, the M9 doesn't have a racing seat look. Instead, it's designed to resemble a high-end ergonomic office chair with subtle flair. The back has a two-piece design, with an ergonomic lumbar support and a backrest that gets wider as it rises. It's supported by a thin mesh covered in premium fabric that has a far more cushiony feel than you'd expect. Meanwhile, the seat is covered with Mavix's M-Breeze fabric (similar to PU leather) and filled with cool-gel memory foam that helps keep your bottom comfortable through long gaming sessions.</p><p dir="ltr">The M9 is highly adjustable, allowing you to find the right settings that work for you. The backrest reclines to 127 degrees, and a tension dial provides even further customization for your recline. The backrest can easily be moved up and down, which changes the positioning of the lumbar support. The M9's construction also allows for seat depth customization, which can be important for ergonomics when it comes to leg comfort. It's also fitted with roller blade-style wheels for a smoother roll and comes standard with 4D armrests.</p><p dir="ltr">From a comfort standpoint, the Mavix M9 is a step above the other contenders on this list. It's also far more expensive, so it's ideal for those who sit at their desk for hours on end every day. Mavix M9's comfort and wealth of customization options make it a clear standout in its price range. The M9 is available in four fabric color schemes: black, white, black/blue, and black/white, and nine different wheel colors. You can also add an Elemax massage pad, footrest, and full-rotation armrests at separate costs.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black\/dp\/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Best Value</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black\/dp\/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Mavix M4</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/3925104-mavixm4.png">                             <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black\/dp\/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/MAVIX-M4-Gaming-Chair-Black/dp/B09PGQDM7S?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20"></a>                        </p>              <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specs:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Upholstery:</strong> Mesh fabric</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cushion:</strong> N/A</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Lumbar:</strong> Dynamic Variable Lumbar support</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Backrest:</strong> 30 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Seat width: </strong>19.5 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recline:</strong> N/A</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Armrests:</strong> Height-adjustable armrests</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight limit:</strong> 275lbs</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Warranty:</strong> 3 years</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Unique features:</strong> Locking wheel casters; optional Elemax massage pad and footrest.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">While the Mavix M9 is our pick for the best premium gaming chair, not everyone can (or wants) to shell out around $1,000 for a chair. If you like the M9's design, another great option is the Mavix M4. As Mavix's lowest-priced gaming chair at $444, the M4 is the best combination of performance and value on this list.</p><p dir="ltr">The Mavix M4 retains the shape and general features of the M9, including the wonderful dynamic variable lumbar support. Where it mainly differs is the materials. The M4 uses cooling mesh on both the backrest and seat cushion. While it doesn't have the superb memory foam seen in the M9, the seat base still the cleverly implemented curvatures that make it comfortable to sit on for lengthy gaming sessions.</p><p dir="ltr">The M4 has locking wheel casters, but these are conventional wheels unlike the rollerblade-style units featured on the M9. The M4 can recline back and lock into place, though not as far as some chairs on this list. It also has an adjustable headrest that removes the need for an additional pillow. You can go for all-black or grab one of the three two-tone designs with different colored backrests: blue, red, or green.</p><p dir="ltr">Mavix also offers a separate footrest for the M4 as an add-on, and you can add the Elemax massage pad, too. It's available in four fabric color options and 10 wheel colors.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built/dp/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built\/dp\/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built/dp/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Best Value</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built/dp/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built\/dp\/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built/dp/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Razer Enki X</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1701/17013431/4302434-enkix.jpg">                             <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built/dp/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built\/dp\/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Essential-Gaming-Chair-Built/dp/B0CGGPKBCZ?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20"></a>                        </p>              <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specs:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Upholstery:</strong> Leatherette</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cushion:</strong> High-density molded foam</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Lumbar:</strong> N/A*****</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Backrest:</strong> 33 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Seat width:</strong> 18 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recline:</strong> Up to 152 degrees</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Armrests:</strong> 2-directional armrests</li><li dir="ltr">Weight limit: Up to 300lbs</li><li dir="ltr">User height range: 5'2" - 6'4"</li><li dir="ltr">Warranty: 3 years for moving parts</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Unique features:</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Razer's Enki line are some of the best gaming chair's we've reviewed, but in terms of value, nothing beats the $600 Razer Enki X for us. The Enki X runs a smidge smaller than the standard Enki and Enki Pro models, but its supported height range of 5'2" to 6'4" tall and up to 300lb weight limit still makes it a highly versatile option. The leatherette upholstery and high-density molded foam padding also make for a comfortable seat. The integrated lumbar support is also decent, though it's a fixed support and its placement won't be ideal for all users.</p><p dir="ltr">Compared to its more costly siblings, the Enki X's rocking mechanism is simpler, its armrests only offer 2-directional adjustments--both the standard Enki and Enki Pro feature 4-directional armrests--and it does not come with a detachable neck pad. However, unless one of those features is a must-have for you, none are dealbreakers, and the baseline comfort and build quality are still higher than what you normally find at this price range.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're willing to spend a bit more, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-enki-chair-review-comfort-for-the-long-haul/1100-6497240/" data-ref-id="1100-6497240">standard Enki chair</a> is $500 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Enki-Gaming-Chair-Built/dp/B0CGH3KY8Y?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs%2FRazer-Enki%2FRZ38-03720300-R3U1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fbest-gaming-chair%2F1100-6486393%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer's online store</a>.

It's a stylish and innovative ergonomic gaming chair that features the best lumbar support we've tried. While most gaming chairs have a small, detachable lumbar pillow, the Iskur has an ergonomically designed lumbar support integrated directly into the seat's back. It's large and contours to the shape of your back, providing support across a larger area. The lumbar support is also unique in that it's adjustable, so you can position it to the shape of your spine--something you don't often find on other gaming chairs, including Razer's Enki line.</p><p>The fine-tuned customization extends far beyond just the lumbar support. You can easily tinker with the angle and height of the chair, and its 4D adjustable armrests allow movement in multiple directions so you can find your perfect position. The Iskur is made with high-density foam that molds to your body for optimal comfort, and it's wrapped in synthetic leather that is both soft and durable. The only major downside to the chair's design is its armrests, which we found caused some discomfort depending on how you position your elbows on them. However, this was a minor issue, and whether you experience it will depend on how hard you push your arms into them.</p><p>While the Iskur V2's dimensions can fit a wide range of users between 5'2" and 6'5", anyone taller than that should consider the XL model of the original Iskur chair, which is available <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Iskur-Gaming-Chair-Multi-Layered/dp/B099MV2Z1Ptag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs%2FRazer-Iskur%2FRZ38-03950300-R3U1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fbest-gaming-chair%2F1100-6486393%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer</a>.

gaming chairs, and at $1,995, the Embody is the most indulgent of the batch--though you may not realize that judging by its utilitarian design. The Embody is designed for long-term ergonomics, making it shorter and sleeker than the racing seat style most gaming chairs use.</p><p dir="ltr">The chair's fixed back only reaches 20.5 inches high, which will stop at or below the shoulders for most people--which, yes, means this doesn't have a headrest, but that doesn't mean it's not comfortable. The back is molded to contour to the user's back, featuring a curve for lumbar support that, coupled with the angle of the seat, makes for a chair you can sit in for long periods of time without aches or pains setting in from poor posture or pressure points. Of course, ergonomics and comfort are two different things, and though the Embody has great support for you back and shoulder, it's also padded with copper-infused cooling foam that feels good to sit on, and even designed to stay cool.</p><p dir="ltr">However, one ergonomic feature the Embody doesn't offer is four-directional armrests. Instead, it only offer two-dimensional adjustments. While that might seem like an odd omission--especially for a chair that costs this much--the lack of those extra adjustment vectors is moreso due to Herman Miller's fine-tuned ergonomic considerations rather than a shortcoming.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://foldablegamingchair.com/products/foldable-gaming-chair" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/foldablegamingchair.com\/products\/foldable-gaming-chair&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://foldablegamingchair.com/products/foldable-gaming-chair">Best Compact Gaming Chair For Travel</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://foldablegamingchair.com/products/foldable-gaming-chair" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/foldablegamingchair.com\/products\/foldable-gaming-chair&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://foldablegamingchair.com/products/foldable-gaming-chair">The Foldable Gaming Chair</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/4181297-foldablegamingchair.png">                             <a href="https://foldablegamingchair.com/products/foldable-gaming-chair" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/foldablegamingchair.com\/products\/foldable-gaming-chair&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://foldablegamingchair.com/products/foldable-gaming-chair"></a>                        </p>              <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specs:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Upholstery:</strong> 600D water-resistant polyester</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cushion:</strong> Foam back padding</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Lumbar:</strong> N/A</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight limit:</strong> 350 pounds</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Backrest:</strong> 22.5 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Seat width: </strong>22 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recline:</strong> N/A</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Armrests:</strong> Static</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight limit:</strong> 300 pounds</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Unique features:</strong> Folding design with carry bag; includes drink holders, retractable headphone/headset hook.</li></ul><p>For something a bit different, check out The Foldable Gaming Chair. This unique option resembles a traditional folding lawn chair, but it's far more comfortable than you might expect. With ample cushions and a clever shape that provides support for your back, bottom, thighs, and arms, The Foldable Gaming Chair is a great option for your game room. It's quite wide and supports up to the 350 pounds.</p><p>This chair has a couple of novel benefits. As the name suggests, it easily folds--just like a lawn chair--and comes with a bag to store it in. This design perk could prove useful for space-conscious users who might not necessarily want a bulky chair taking up precious floor space. Plus, it's incredibly light, which makes it an ideal travel companion.</p><p>The Foldable Gaming Chair has a built-in cupholder, and a stemware compartment for a wine glass. On the other armrest, you'll find a compartment for accessories and devices like controllers, cables, and your phone. There's also a spot to hang your gaming headset.</p><p>The Foldable Gaming Chair retails for $199, but right now you can get it for only $149.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moon-Pod-Adult-Bean-Bag-Chair-Large/dp/B08D1PM3CT?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Moon-Pod-Adult-Bean-Bag-Chair-Large\/dp\/B08D1PM3CT?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Moon-Pod-Adult-Bean-Bag-Chair-Large/dp/B08D1PM3CT?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Best Gaming Bean Bag</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moon-Pod-Adult-Bean-Bag-Chair-Large/dp/B08D1PM3CT?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Moon-Pod-Adult-Bean-Bag-Chair-Large\/dp\/B08D1PM3CT?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Moon-Pod-Adult-Bean-Bag-Chair-Large/dp/B08D1PM3CT?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20">Moon Pod</a>         </h3>                                                                                                        <p><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_medium/1595/15950357/3858718-moonpod.png">                             <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moon-Pod-Adult-Bean-Bag-Chair-Large/dp/B08D1PM3CT?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Moon-Pod-Adult-Bean-Bag-Chair-Large\/dp\/B08D1PM3CT?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Moon-Pod-Adult-Bean-Bag-Chair-Large/dp/B08D1PM3CT?tag=gamespot-gamingchairs-20"></a>                        </p>              <div><p dir="ltr"><strong>Specs:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Upholstery:</strong> Fabric</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cushion:</strong> Lightweight foam</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Lumbar:</strong> N/A</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weight limit: </strong>300 pounds</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Backrest: </strong>56 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Seat width: </strong>24 inches</li><li dir="ltr">Warranty: Up to 5 years</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Unique features:</strong> It's a giant bean bag!</li></ul><p>Bean bag chairs have long been a gaming staple, especially for kids and teens. Admittedly, the average bean bag chair isn't the most comfortable option for adults. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/moon-pod-review-is-this-300-ergonomic-beanbag-wort/1100-6480934/" data-ref-id="1100-6480934">Moon Pod</a>, however, is anything but an average bean bag chair. While not technically a "gaming product," the Moon Pod absolutely works as a high-end living room chair for those who want to sit closer to their TV while gaming (especially for those games where the text is annoyingly small). It also works well for those who are working from home and need to take a break from their office chair. Unlike most bean bag chairs, the Moon Pod's design is specifically aimed at providing an ergonomic lounging experience. The Moon Pod contours and adapts to your positioning, providing back and lumbar support. The bean bag, which is appropriately shaped like a pod, features high-density beads that are packed to simulate the sensation of weightlessness, and it's incredibly relaxing to sink into.</p><p dir="ltr">At $300, however, the Moon Pod is extremely pricey for a bean bag, and there are add-ons that raise the price even more. The Crescent back pillow, which is helpful for additional back support, tacks on another $129 to the price. For that reason, we recommend just getting the base product first to try it out before snagging any add-ons, though we will say the combination of the Moon Pod and the Crescent feels absolutely incredible.</p><p dir="ltr">The Moon Pod itself is also quite large, taking up approximately four square feet, so you definitely need to have a spot picked out for it or somewhere that you can store it between uses. That said, this is the most comfortable bean bag chair around and checks all of the boxes for a solid living room gaming chair.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4567">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-computer-speakers/1100-6499140/">Best Computer Speakers For Gaming</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-4k-tv-for-gaming/1100-6482374/">Best 4K TVs For Gaming</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-gaming-monitor/1100-6488680/">Best Monitor For PS5, Xbox Series X</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Tech Picks From GameSpot Links (6)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-gaming-chair/1100-6486393/">The Best Gaming Chair In 2024</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-cheap-gaming-monitor-2022-budget-monitors-for-gaming-and-productivity/1100-6474721/">Best Cheap Gaming Monitors In 2022</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-headset/1100-6486018/">Best PC Headsets In 2023</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-best-nintendo-switch-controller-you-can-buy-in/1100-6469264/">The Best Nintendo Switch Controllers You Can Buy</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-best-vr-headset-for-march-2020-half-life-alyx-/1100-6473057/">The Best VR Headsets In 2020</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-webcam-to-buy-in-2022/1100-6480048/">The Best Webcam For 2021: Top Picks For Streaming On Twitch And YouTube</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <p>Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino will jointly succeed Jim Ryan as the CEOs of Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>
<p>Hulst is CEO of the newly named Studio Business Group, which includes all of PlayStation’s first-party teams, plus covers the development of PlayStation IP onto other mediums, such as TV and film. Hulst was already head of PlayStation Studios. He was previously the co-founder of Horizon and Killzone developer Guerrilla Games, which was acquired by Sony in 2005.</p>
<p>"I am thrilled to lead the studio business group and continue to build on our success with PlayStation 5, while preparing for the future,” Hulst said in a statement. “The video game industry is one of the largest entertainment industries in the world and has been built on the marriage of content and technology, and I look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of play and entertainment.”</p>
<p>Hideaki Nishino will lead the Platform Business Group, which includes console hardware, technology, accessories, PlayStation Network and third-party relations (covering major publishers and indie studios). He was already SVP of Platform Experiences. He’s been part of the Sony business since 2006, holding numerous roles at Sony Network Entertainment, Sony Corporation and SIE.</p>
<p>"We will continue to connect players and creators through world-class products, services, and technology," Nishino said. "We always strive to grow our community even bigger with innovation in every area at Sony Interactive Entertainment.”</p>
<p>"I am honored to be appointed such an important role alongside Hermen. By working more closely together, we will be positioned to build incredible experiences for an ever-expanding audience now and in the future."</p>
<p>Both leaders will report to Sony Interactive Entertainment chairman Hiroki Totoki, who has been acting CEO of the division since Jim Ryan stepped down from the role at the end of March. Totoki is also president, COO and CFO of Sony Group Corporation. The latest changes will take effect from June 1st.</p>
<p>“Sony Interactive Entertainment is a dynamic and growing business that delivers incredible entertainment experiences through the connection of content and technology," Totoki said. "These two leaders will have clear responsibilities and will manage strategic direction to ensure the focus remains on deepening engagement with existing PlayStation users and expanding experiences to new audiences."</p>
<p>The fact both new CEOs are established PlayStation veterans is in-keeping with Sony’s approach of promoting from within. However, the decision to have two leaders is not something the business has done before and reflects the growing size and scale of the division.</p>
<p>PlayStation’s Studios business has grown exponentially over the past ten years, both in terms of headcount and scale of its brands. Its recent strategy has seen it port more of its titles to PC, develop TV shows and movies based on its IP and push into live-service game development, which included the acquisition of Destiny developer Bungie in 2022.</p>
<p>However, costs have also grown significantly, resulting in recent game cancellations, staff redundancies and the closure of its London Studio. The release detailing the new leadership says that this structure is designed to deliver 'sustainable growth'.</p>

It usually serves as an exit for Cool, Cool Mountain’s first stage, Slip Slidin’ Away, awarding players with a Star after they complete the slide and walk through the door. However, Mario is unable to walk back through from the outside, as this half of the door is uniquely missing a doorknob and is blocked by an invisible wall. Anyone who’s played Super Mario 64 has probably tried to walk through the door even if they don’t remember doing it, and now, after 28 years, a solution is here.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmqFoojMeD8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pennenkoek2012’s video</a> walks players through the struggles presented by the legendary door and how Alexpalix1 managed to bypass them. While players have been able to use the mother penguin to make Mario clip through the invisible wall and near the door, they’ve never been able to actually use the door itself to enter the cabin.</p><p>Alexpalix1’s new method still guides the penguin up against the cabin, while backflipping in between the blue bird and the building just as others have done before. What they change, though, is Mario’s animation just as he comes into contact with the door’s hitbox. There’s no floor on the other side of the invisible wall that blocks the entrance, and unfortunately for our plumber friend, he needs to be walking when opening a door.</p><p>Alexpalix1 tricks the game by turning Mario around just before he falls, allowing him to briefly walk in midair long enough to use the door. The player can levitate for one frame when triggering Mario’s turn-around animation, so even though Mario continues to fall through the floor, the door opens and sends Mario back inside the cabin. Voila!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Players have finally solved a mystery they were never intended to solve after nearly 30 years of work. Unfortunately, it looks like there isn’t really a good reason for anyone to try and replicate Alexpalix1’s strategy. Entering the cabin from the outside does not benefit the player in any way other than providing an alternate entrance to the bottom of the ice slide. As Pannenkoek2012 notes, the doesn’t seem to have any use as a speed-running strategy either, as it’s still quite a bit slower than simply taking the slide down from the top.</p><p>For more on Super Mario 64's endless mysteries, make sure you check out some previously long-lost footage that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-64-footage-seemingly-shows-off-a-multiplayer-mode-with-luigi-for-the-first-time">seems to reveal that Luigi was almost included in the game</a>.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

<p data-characters="307" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Supergiant Games is preparing its first patch for the Early Access of <em>Hades 2</em>, which will include new changes and address issues later in May. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072251730219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-patch notes are live</a>, and not quite as illuminating as you’d maybe like. But Supergiant plans to drop all the details when the date arrives.</p> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true"><em>Hades 2</em> has been in Early Access for about a week, with the developer tweaking the game here and there with minor hotfixes. The upcoming patch should notably be larger, as the studio announced its upcoming due date in a Steam community note earlier today. It’ll likely be the first of many regular patches for the game, but not necessarily a major one. Much of the game is still being worked on, but it just released so don’t expect to see new Regions or weapons yet.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-first-patch-for-hades-2-addresses-dashing-concerns" data-injectable="false">The first patch for <em>Hades 2</em> addresses dashing concerns</h2> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">The first <em>Hades 2</em> Early Access patch is focused on two aspects of the game: Resource gathering and navigation. According to the team, Supergiant doesn’t want “resource gathering to feel too frustrating, such as if you didn’t bring the right gathering tool along for the ride.” The studio also plans to change how Melinoë’s Dash and Sprint functions, so she’ll feel more “nimble” and “responsive” during combat. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-fight-on-the-rift.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="hades 2 first patch - dashing and resource gathering" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-fight-on-the-rift.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-fight-on-the-rift.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-fight-on-the-rift.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-fight-on-the-rift.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="802" data-injectable="true">Personally, I haven’t had too many issues with either concern. There are multiple tools to use in <em>Hades 2</em>, and taking one down into the depths or onto the surface is a progression choice. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-bronze-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do I need Bronze today</a>? Better bring the pick. I’m speculating that perhaps an upcoming change will allow you to swap tools between Regions. Sprinting and dashing also feel fine to me, but I will admit it took me a while to figure out that you hold Dash to continue Sprinting. I’m a professional.</p>
 <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="156" data-injectable="false">As for when these updates arrive, Supergiant Games hasn’t set a date yet, but it does say this first patch should be coming sometime later this month.</p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">Supergiant is also looking into balance changes, but isn’t ready to implement them with this first patch. Instead, it’s asking players to continue playing the game and sending feedback. Some of the items the studio will soon begin tweaking include boons, enemies, weapons, and more.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-first-patch.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="hades 2 first patch - feedback needed" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-first-patch.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-first-patch.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-first-patch.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-first-patch.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="false">The company mentions there will be a small hotfix after the upcoming patch, with a Major Update arriving “some months from now.” As part of the developer’s content roadmap, the Major Update will include “various new features and content.” </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/neha-patel-venba-music-sound-design-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to the latest instalment of <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our feature series 'What I Do'</a>, where individuals in and around the video game industry tell us what, exactly, they do for a living.</p><p>The purpose of this feature is two-fold. First, as we saw with<a href="https://aftermath.site/f2p-economy-live-service-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an RPG's economy lead</a>, individuals have interesting stories to tell! And secondly, it's my hope that by showing this business is made up of specific people with specific (and often wildly different) jobs, it can help dispel the idea that everyone is just a "dev". Video games are more complicated (and interesting) than that!</p><p>Today's feature is an interview with Neha Patel, a composer, sound designer and indie advocate<a href="https://www.nehapatelaudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> who has worked on games like <em>Venba</em></a>.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett</strong>: <em>Hi Neha! Please, tell our readers a little bit about yourself.</em></p><p><strong>Neha Patel</strong>: I’m a composer at heart and learnt sound design on the fly by doing a crap ton of game jams. But before that, I actually did my studies in classical piano. Fun fact: I begged my parents for piano lessons because I heard the soundtrack to <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>and absolutely wanted to play the piano version of “One Winged Angel.” They said no, you see we were poor and there wasn’t an understanding that music is beneficial to a child. Two years later I got hit by a car and the doctor commented on how long my fingers were, and asked if I played the piano. I got lessons immediately after, it was a sign!</p><p>Back to game audio, in 2018 I was finishing up my undergrad and on a whim applied for a scholarship to go to this thing called ‘GDC’. I knew I wanted to get into game audio but had no idea how. School wasn’t a place where I could openly discuss it (video game music is frowned upon in a music conservatory) so I spent countless hours online googling ‘how to be a video game composer’. That’s how I saw that scholarship opportunity, so I just went for it. It was completely life changing. The talks and people that I met changed my perspective on freelancing and what I could do with my life. The game audio community taught me to move forward with kindness, curiosity and respect. Game audio shouldn’t be a competition, it should be an inclusive space where we help and celebrate each other.</p><p>Somehow I was in an odd situation where, even though I was from Montréal, I did not know a single dev from the city (I was too busy practicing piano). I started my career abroad and it forced me to have this worldview and helped me see what other possibilities there were. I felt more prepared to enter the industry as a fresh grad. For example, I knew that unpaid internships were bullshit. If you truly want to help a junior, it should be a mentorship, not unpaid work. My point is, meeting all these different people and keeping up with them online truly helped me grow.</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>Wait, video game music is frowned upon at school?</em></p><p><strong>NP</strong>: Oh in most classical music schools, film and video game music is disregarded. Now look, I can only talk about my personal experience and things might have changed, but when I was there, it definitely was the vibe. My friend's composition teacher told him "Monkeys can compose film music".</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>If you had to put a job title on a business card, what would it be?</em></p><p><strong>NP</strong>: Depends on the gig! I call myself a composer/sound designer. I currently exclusively work in indie games (but I’m winking at you, Yoko Taro), so it depends on the contract.</p><figure><blockquote><p>A while back, a couple friends of mine were telling me how much they were underpaid by an established indie studio, whose entire imagery online was about wholesomeness and treating their workers well. And I’m sure that studio did treat their full-time employees well. But not their contractors. That pissed me off.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>So depending on the gig, then, what's an average day look like?</em></p><p><strong>NP</strong>: If it’s writing music, I usually get a couple sentences describing the scene or character and poof! I whip out something. I never write a complete piece immediately. I start with a small excerpt and send it to the devs just to make sure I’m on the right track. Sometimes I'll hit the nail on the head immediately and other times there’s back and forth. Rarely, when the budget permits, I get to hire musicians to play the main melodies.</p><p>With sound design, I often end up doing audio direction with it too. I’ll look at the build, scope out what’s needed, start a mediocre excel sheet and make a priority list. Sometimes I end up having to take a whole ton of videos to time the sounds to, so it helps a lot when the devs do that for me, haha! Depending on the software we’re using, I also do integration. Sometimes that means directly in Unity but ideally in a middleware (yay Wwise!). The programmers and I usually end up becoming very good friends by the end of the project, they help me out so much!</p><p>Whether I’m doing music or sound design, I think the most crucial aspect is giving us audio people time for pre-production. I need to take the time to look at other games that we can use as an inspiration, often playing them or at very least watching a playthrough. I’ll research the examples and see if the composers or sound designers wrote a blog or gave a talk about their work. With music, I listen to the reference pieces a LOT. I’ll put the music on when I’m doing chores or going on a walk, it’s a constant thing.&nbsp;</p><p>One more thing, if I’m writing the whole OST (Original Sound Track) I need to have a clear timeline of when the game is releasing and be given enough time to get the album ready. This is because I am in charge of releasing the album on all streaming services and timing is key to hitting a higher audience. Also, the music that you hear in-game isn’t the same as the one in the album. We do a completely different mix/master and it’s a lot of work! I have an entire GDC talk about releasing an OST and what you can do right before release to achieve peak revenue.</p><p>As for scheduling, I try to make my days align to the usual ‘9-5’ schedule and work from home. But that’s just a framework, I change it around depending on needs and deadlines. I don’t crunch but there are days I overwork, it happens. In exchange, I get so much flexibility and I value that a lot. Some weeks are heavier than others. On lighter weeks, it gives me time to actually play more games and take care of myself better. It’s hard giving an exact answer because it really depends on what’s happening. For me it’s less about ‘clocking in the hours’ and more about achieving tasks and milestones.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi im a video game composer and I charge ~1000$/min! </p><p>That number is not ✨wtf high✨it's an approx industry standard for someone who shipped + couple years of experience!</p><p>It's a number shared by a lotta vg composer who work ethically, i did not just make it up!</p></div>— Neha🍉 (@Nehapolitan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nehapolitan/status/1785026933027377541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>In addition to your music and sound work,</em><a href="https://twitter.com/Nehapolitan/status/1785026933027377541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> you've also become something of an advocate for indie development, especially when it comes to fair pay and conditions</em></a><em>. What moved you to take up that role, doing stuff like giving GDC talks, and what do you think you're bringing to these conversations?</em></p><p><strong>NP</strong>: Huh, I swear I never thought of myself as an advocate until I read your question. So I think it’s important to understand my personality. I am an empath. I feel everything, I’m a sponge that absorbs the emotions of others very intensely. It’s not fun at all but it leads me to the following: I feel very strongly about other people’s injustices, more than my own.</p><p>A while back, a couple friends of mine were telling me how much they were underpaid by an established indie studio, who’s entire imagery online was about wholesomeness and treating their workers well. And I’m sure that studio did treat their full time employees well. But not their contractors. That pissed me off. I couldn’t do anything and my friends were too scared to say anything. I also saw the effects of an unpaid internship and forced crunch a friend of mine had to endure at a local studio. These were people that were known in our community and it hurt so bad. My friend was so harshly exploited, they got sick. Again, I couldn’t do anything.</p><p>The only reason I wasn’t exploited at the start of my career was because I had met a wider game audio community that taught me about sustainable freelancing. I knew about the red flags before I started professionally. I knew when to say no, when to pass on ‘opportunities’ that in the long term might have burnt me out. Those friends that were exploited did not. They just took the first thing that was given to them, usually out of fear of missing out. So initially, I just started telling them everything I knew. Then I realized ‘oh crap, there’s a lot of people I need to tell this too’. So I started the easiest thing one could do: Write tweets.</p><p>I also knew that I wanted to keep going to these game conferences but good lord are they way too expensive. So…I applied with talks. I knew I had information about how Steam OST sales work and how to launch an album, so I kept talking about that! Sustainability in game audio freelancing is such an important topic to me. People were transparent and kind to me, so I’m just giving it forward. I don’t intend on being an advocate, it feels like a lot of pressure. I’m not inventing anything, I’m just sharing the numbers I have.</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>What do you think are the biggest challenges you're facing in your job in the games industry today? And how would you like to see them overcome?</em></p><p><strong>NP</strong>: Yikes. Uh, late stage capitalism? What stage are we even at?? Greed-fuelled layoffs, housing crisis, global warming??</p><p>Ok I’m going to try and scope smaller here. I don’t have that much experience, I only started my career around four years ago. Getting consistent gigs is difficult, I had one fall through just now, ha! I guess that brings me to how unstable the industry is. You never know what could happen. I don’t have a clean cut solution.&nbsp;</p><p>I do have to say, though: Be really good with your finances. Especially if you’re a freelancer. And even more so if you’re a freelance audio person that works in indie games!! The industry isn’t secure, but you can try and mitigate risks by looking at your personal finances. You should know your expense rate and be financially literate. It’s never too late to learn! Also don’t be swooned by the latest gear and software. If they are not going to be paying themselves off in the next 3 months, you probably don’t need it. You should have seen my old desk and how tiny my screen was. I am cheap with my gear, but not the humans I work with, if that makes sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>Thanks so much for chatting with us!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24155778/super-mario-64-secret-door-cool-mountain<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="qwdqGh">One of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch/22339948/mario-games-ranked-switch-super-nintendo-64-luigi-yoshi"><em>Super Mario 64</em></a>’s few remaining mysteries has been solved, thanks to a player who figured out how to open a previously “unopenable” door from the 1996 Nintendo 64 classic. We can thank a nearly four-hour YouTube video that exhaustively detailed how invisible walls work in <em>Super Mario 64</em>, and the tenacity of the game’s community for the new discovery.</p>
<p id="fsBrvu">That previously inaccessible door is located in the Cool, Cool Mountain world, where Mario memorably meets a mother and baby penguin duo — and also races against a giant penguin in the Big Penguin Race mission. (This serves as an amusing reminder that in the Mario universe, penguins are known as “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23391680/super-mario-bros-movie-trailer-penguin-64">penguins</a>.”)</p>
<p id="Di5poE">According to a new video from YouTube content creator and <em>Super Mario 64</em> expert Scott Buchanan (aka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pannenkoek2012">Pannenkoek2012</a>), the person who finally solved the game’s locked-door mystery was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PaLiX/videos">Alexpalix1</a>, an experienced speedrunner who’s developed dozens of tool-assisted runs. Alex exploited the hit box of Cool, Cool World’s mother penguin to push Mario through an invisible barrier, but added a quick turnaround move to pull off a frame-perfect maneuver that lets Mario open that door — and not plummet to his death.</p>
<p id="kdZV5N">Intriguingly, Alex was reportedly inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXCVsDFiXA">Buchanan’s earlier video on <em>Super Mario 64</em>’s use of invisible walls</a>. The three-hour-and-45-minute video offers a technical deep dive on how Nintendo designed the 3D platformer to prevent players from accessing certain parts of the game.</p>
<p id="6VbpyJ">Buchanan offers a very quick digest on how invisible walls work in <em>Super Mario 64</em> and how Nintendo intentionally used them to prevent players from accessing the unopenable door in question. But his nearly four-hour video on <em>Super Mario 64</em>’s invisible walls is also a fun and informative watch, if you have the time.</p>
<p id="AcGq8c">For now, though, just enjoy a community of video game players once again doing what was previously thought impossible.</p>

Some are tucked into the game’s manual, while others might be mentioned during optional Codec calls. If you forgot about some of these non-obvious mechanics or are playing <em>MGS2</em> for the first time, these techniques will help you remain sneaky and lethal.</p><h2 id="h64357"><a id=""></a>Leaning and peeking</h2><p>In <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em>, you’ll enter first-person mode with R1/RB/R on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch respectively. But by using R2/L2, R/L, or ZR/ZL on PlayStation, Xbox, or Switch respectively, you can lean to the side. If you press both at the same time, you’ll stand on your toes and can peer over objects. </p><p>This is very helpful for a quick peek around a corner <em>or</em> to get better angles, particularly during boss fights. Snake’s shootout with Olga is one such example. By using the trigger buttons you can easily get some better angles on her.</p><p>Note that you can easily be spotted while leaning or standing on your toes, so you’ll want to be quick when you’re taking a look around a corner.</p><h2 id="h64358"><a id=""></a>Snag those dog tags!</h2><p>If you run up to a guard and hold your weapon (pressing in the left thumbstick will see Snake or Raiden take aim), you’ll hold up a guard. If you then walk around to the front of them and point the gun at their head (or, um, crotch), they will do a little shake and will give up a dog tag. </p><figure id="" data-id="d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52" data-recommend-id="image://d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player aims a gun at a guard's head in Metal Gear Solid 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player aims a gun at a guard's head in Metal Gear Solid 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><span><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 37.31em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 37.37em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_1315/d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52.jpg"><img alt="The player aims a gun at a guard's head in Metal Gear Solid 2." data-chomp-id="d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52" data-format="jpg" data-height="717" data-alt="The player aims a gun at a guard's head in Metal Gear Solid 2." data-anim-src="" data-src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52.jpg" src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52.jpg"></picture></div></span></p><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52" data-recommend-id="image://d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player aims a gun at a guard's head in Metal Gear Solid 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can spot whether or not a guard has a dog tag by either equipping thermal goggles or looking for a shimmery effect just below their neck.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-mgs1-cardboard-box-a-b-c-fast-travel-1851458120&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-mgs1-cardboard-box-a-b-c-fast-travel-1851458120">The Original <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> Has A Fast Travel Mechanic You Probably Didn’t Know About</a></span></p><p>Some guards, however, won’t give up their loot so easily. If a guard says “are you going to shoot me?” make sure you have a lethal weapon equipped (be sure not to go unarmed when holding up a guard as they’ll immediately enter an alert status and will call for backup), aim away from their head and fire off a shot. This will scare them and they’ll give up their dog tag if they have one.</p><p>Also, you can get dog tags from select bosses by picking them up and putting them down after the fight.</p><p>At the end of the game, you can unlock the following equipment depending on how many dog tags you’ve gathered:</p><p><strong>Snake’s chapter:</strong></p><p>46 dog tags: Bandana (grants infinite ammo)<br>76 dog tags: Stealth camo (makes you invisible so long as you don’t bump into a guard).</p><p><strong>Raiden’s chapter:</strong></p><p>73 dog tags: Infinity wig (grants Raiden infinite ammo)<br>121 dog tags: Stealth camo<br>170 dog tags: Wig B (lets you hang without losing grip)<br>218 dog tags: Wig A (gives you infinite O2 when underwater)</p><h2 id="h64359"><a id=""></a>You can loot knocked-out guards</h2><p>Grab a knocked-out guard and put them down and you’ll likely earn an item such as ammo, bandages, or even a ration. You may have to do this once or twice for it to work.</p><h2 id="h64360"><a id=""></a>Spotted? Shoot their radios</h2><p>You may have come across this one accidentally by opening fire on a guard who spotted you. If you shoot a walkie talkie with a lethal weapon, you’ll disable it, preventing the guard from easily going into alert status. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-mgs1-master-aiming-body-armor-1851459198&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-mgs1-master-aiming-body-armor-1851459198">16 Things The First <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> Doesn’t Outright Tell You</a></span></p><p>But you don’t have to get spotted for a chance to disable their communications device. Guards keep their radios on their back, so fire off a shot directly at their radio and you’ll break it without them even realizing. </p><h2 id="h64361"><a id=""></a>Explore how interactive the world is</h2><p><em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> was notable at the time of its original release in 2001 for its wildly interactive world. You can often break various objects to create noise for guards to react to. Some guards will even investigate if you’ve smashed bottles, glass, or other breakable objects. </p><p>Another great (and useful) example is that in Olga’s boss battle, you can even shoot out the tarp she likes to hide behind by shooting the cords holding it down. </p><h2 id="h64362"><a id=""></a>Stash unconscious guards in lockers</h2><figure id="" data-id="fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11" data-recommend-id="image://fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Snake hides a sleeping guard in a locker." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Snake hides a sleeping guard in a locker." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><span><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 37.31em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 37.37em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_1315/fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11.jpg"><img alt="Snake hides a sleeping guard in a locker." data-chomp-id="fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11" data-format="jpg" data-height="716" data-alt="Snake hides a sleeping guard in a locker." data-anim-src="" data-src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11.jpg" src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11.jpg"></picture></div></span></p><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11" data-recommend-id="image://fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Snake hides a sleeping guard in a locker." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you want to put a guard to sleep for nearly forever without killing them, knock one out or put ‘em to sleep, then drag them to a locker, open it up, and hide them in there by pulling them into the locker. Once sealed away, they won’t wake up to resume their patrol.</p><h2 id="h64363"><a id=""></a>You can run <em>and</em> gun</h2><p>This is another detail that’s tucked in the manual but not expressly spelled out to you during the game. While you’re aiming your weapon, you can hold L1, LB, or L on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch respectively to run while aiming and firing your weapon.</p><h2 id="h64364"><a id=""></a>You can access the <em>Master Collection</em>’s menu options by entering the pause screen first</h2><p>The <em>Master Collection</em> has a wildly limited set of options but some, like toggling between windowed mode and full-screen on PC, are very handy. To access this, pause the game and press L1+R1/LB+RB/L+R on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch respectively. </p><h2 id="h64365"><a id=""></a>Wake guards up with coolant or by picking them up and putting them down</h2><p>Sometimes you want to wake a guard you just knocked out (often to get their dog tags, but sometimes it’s fun to mess with them). If you’re far enough in Raiden’s chapter that you’ve acquired the coolant spray, just use that on an unconscious guard’s face to wake ‘em up. If you don’t have it (or you’re playing Snake’s chapter), pick guards up and put them down repeatedly and you’ll wake them up faster. </p><h2 id="h64366"><a id=""></a>Quickly unequip and re-equip a weapon to tactically reload it</h2><p>Just like in the first <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, if you quickly unequip and re-equip a weapon with the shoulder buttons, you’ll refill your magazine even if you haven’t spent all of your bullets.</p><h2 id="h64367"><a id=""></a>Keeping rations equipped can save you from a game over screen</h2><p>This is particularly useful during boss fights: Just like in <em>MGS1</em>, keeping rations equipped will see them automatically used when your health drops to zero. There are pros and cons to this technique, but it can help when you’re fighting a tricky boss who demands all of your attention. </p><h2 id="h64368"><a id=""></a><em>Master Collection</em>: The left thumbstick toggles aiming</h2><p>Time for a history lesson! The PS2 (and PS3) each had analog face buttons, meaning that the console could detect how hard you were pressing a button like square or triangle. <em>MGS2</em> used this hardware quirk to allow you to easily raise your weapon with or without firing. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-mgs3-normal-camera-3rd-person-1851466478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-mgs3-normal-camera-3rd-person-1851466478">Here’s How To Play <em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em> The Right Way</a></span></p><p>Since the PS4, gaming hardware has chosen to become super boring, and we now have rigid, binary digital buttons. Konami has made up for this difference by allowing you to raise and aim your weapon by pressing in the left thumbstick. If you aim your weapon by holding down a face button and don’t wish to fire, you can also press the left thumbstick to lower your aim.</p><h2 id="h64369"><a id=""></a>You can do pull-ups to increase your grip strength</h2><p>While hanging on a ledge as either Snake or Raiden, you can press R1+L1/RB+LB/R+L to do a pull-up. If you do 100 of these, your grip strength will go up in level, allowing you to hang for longer. Grip level maxes out at Level 3.</p><h2 id="h64370"><a id=""></a>You can fast-forward Codec calls</h2><p>While you probably don’t want to skip Codec calls and cutscenes on your first playthrough of <em>MGS2</em>, you can breeze past them by first hitting X, A, or B on PS5, Xbox, or Switch respectively and then pressing the right-most face button (square, X, or Y for each platform) to fast-forward through a conversation.</p><h2 id="h64371"><a id=""></a>Toggle inverted camera in the options <em>before</em> playing</h2><p>If you want to invert your look controls for first-person, navigate to Options &gt; Own View before launching the game. You can toggle this option during Raiden’s chapter, but Snake’s chapter will lock you into whatever this setting is when you start the game. </p><h2 id="h64372"><a id=""></a>There are different radar options too</h2><p>In the same Options screen as the “View” options, you can also toggle between “Off,” “Type 1,” and “Type 2.” Off is self-explanatory, but in Type 1, you’ll still have your radar during “Intrusion,” which is when guards are keeping an eye out but are no longer in Alert or Evasion mode. Type 2 disables the radar during Intrusion mode for a greater challenge.</p><h2 id="h64373"><a id=""></a>Stinger missile hack: You can lock onto targets after firing a missile</h2><figure id="" data-id="6023175414e0fc032cdd3734184aeffd" data-recommend-id="image://6023175414e0fc032cdd3734184aeffd" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Raiden hits a target with a stinger missile." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Raiden hits a target with a stinger missile." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6023175414e0fc032cdd3734184aeffd" data-recommend-id="image://6023175414e0fc032cdd3734184aeffd" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Raiden hits a target with a stinger missile." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is a fun one, and very useful for Raiden’s battle against the Harrier jet. After firing a rocket from the stinger missile launcher, you can move the cursor to target an enemy. The missile will then break from its current course to hit whatever it’s locked onto. This is very helpful for shooting around corners.</p><h2 id="h64374"><a id=""></a>Don’t forget the VR missions and Snake Tales in the <em>Master Collection</em>!</h2><p><em>MGS2</em> as it appears in the 2023 <em>Master Collection</em> is actually an HD version of <em>MGS2</em>’s expanded release, <em>Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance</em>. As such, you’ll spot two options in the main menu: “Missions” and “Snake Tales.” The former features a vast amount of challenges for both Snake and Raiden (including some exclusive modes like an FPS take on <em>MGS2</em>’s gameplay). Snake Tales are short vignettes set on either the Big Shell or Tanker that see Snake take on different narrative sneaking challenges. </p><figure id="" data-id="972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107" data-recommend-id="image://972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Snake sneaks through the Big Shell while disguising himself as Pliskin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Snake sneaks through the Big Shell while disguising himself as Pliskin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><span><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 37.31em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 37.37em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_1315/972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107.jpg"><img alt="Snake sneaks through the Big Shell while disguising himself as Pliskin." data-chomp-id="972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107" data-format="jpg" data-height="720" data-alt="Snake sneaks through the Big Shell while disguising himself as Pliskin." data-anim-src="" data-src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107.jpg" src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107.jpg"></picture></div></span></p><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107" data-recommend-id="image://972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Snake sneaks through the Big Shell while disguising himself as Pliskin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One mission even lets you play as Snake dressed as Iriqouis Pliskin.</p><hr><p>That wraps our list of easily missed <em>MGS2</em> mechanics.

<p>Now that we have an official title for Assassin’s Creed Shadows and know more about the two main protagonists, Yasuke and Naoe, let’s delve into more of the game’s lore and story. For instance, was Yasuke a real samurai? The franchise has long toyed with real-life people, altering their history to suit the game, so why not this individual, too?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-yasuke-a-real-samurai">Is Yasuke a Real Samurai?</h2>



<p>The real-life Yasuke, a man of African origin, served as a samurai under Oda Nobunaga between 1581 and 1582. During the Sengoku period, Yasuke served as a sword-bearer, essentially a samurai, for approximately 15 months until Nobunaga’s passing.</p>



<p>Nobunaga reportedly liked the man after his appearance in Japan, as reports claim he was as “strong as a bull.” Nobunaga would speak with Yasuke often, though his Japanese was lacking, and eventually hired him as a vassal.</p>



<p>In 1582, Nobunaga was betrayed by his vassals, and Yasuke was inevitably disarmed and sent to the cathedral of Padre in India in custody. Following that, it’s unclear precisely what happened to Yasuke.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-when-is-the-assassin-s-creed-shadows-reveal">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When is the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Reveal?</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-yasuke-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Yasuke plays a significant role in the story. It’s said that he’ll ally with Naoe, a shinobi, to help unify Japan. </p>



<p>Like in real life, Yasuke is a samurai in-game. As such, he’ll play a more action-oriented role in the story and combat, compared to Naoe’s stealth approach to situations.</p>



<p>Of course, nothing is written in stone just yet. We’ll learn more about the game and its story in the coming days!</p>



<hr>



<p>We’ll follow the exciting storyline in Assassin’s Creed Shadows as we learn more. For now, check out what else Insider Gaming covers:</p>

                <p>One More Multiverse--a studio that developed TTRPGs and produced tools to make it easier to play tabletop games virtually with others--is shutting down. Game Masters and players who use the virtual tabletop have 90 days to download or screenshot whatever they want before they're gone for good in August.</p><p>"All tales come to an end, including ours," Team Multiverse wrote in a <a href="https://multiverse.com/letter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a> announcing the shutdown. "It pains us to inform you that One More Multiverse as a whole is closing down. Simply put, One More Multiverse isn't sustainable to run. We're proud of the team we've built and the players we've helped while bringing our wild ambitious dreams to life. We spent the past year working very hard to develop a new path forward, but after careful consideration it's become clear that it's not enough to support the OMM platform. For that, we are sorry."</p><p>Using One More Multiverse, a group could create their characters and maps with supplied pixelated assets. You could then play over Discord with your group, using your created world to lend an incredible cinematic feel to the experience. At the same time, One More Multiverse helped groups track information like character skills and dice rolls to make the experience of playing tabletop games more approachable. One More Multiverse created its own custom games for their virtual tabletop portal, but the portal supported other popular tabletop systems, like Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e and Blades in the Dark.</p><p>Though other virtual tabletops exist, like Roll20 and DnDBeyond, One More Multiverse possesses a charm and flair that no other competitor has managed to match. Seeing One More Multiverse have to shut down is deeply unfortunate--it was an awesome service helmed by talented individuals.</p><p>"We will be working to provide as much support as we can to our team as the studio closes," Team Multiverse wrote. "We will be providing severance, healthcare extensions, and dedicated support for job search. This was a team that led with kindness, built through collaboration, and bursted with talent. If you are hiring, please reach out--you will find no better problem solvers."</p>

                <p>Super Mario 64 is almost 30 years old, but the game still has some secrets to offer, especially for those who are willing to dig deep. A SM64 community member named "Alexpalix1" has managed to open a sealed door that's bedeviled players for decades, not to mention countless children across the world in the late '90s.</p><p dir="ltr">As shown by YouTuber pannenkoek2012 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFx7woWkZbc&amp;t=0s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent video</a>, the door in question is at the bottom of the cottage slide in one of the game's early courses, Cool, Cool Mountain. The door can be opened from the slide-side (which produces a Star), but since it lacks a doorknob, it remains stubbornly closed from the outside.</p>

The reveal was purely cinematic, however, but today’s new trailer shows off his gameplay.</p>

<p>The video not only gives fans a sample of actor Mark Hamill’s new voice lines, but also reveals that Joker has an alternate costume modeled after The Batman Who Laughs. The video also shows what appears to be unique dialogue interactions between Joker and his long-time sidekick, Harley Quinn.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Nshwsz-f7M" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>MultiVersus has other new characters joining the fray that will be revealed over time. Following a lengthy hiatus since its open beta concluded last year, the game will return in an improved form on May 28.</p>

We also know that Sukuna will have difficulty using his Cursed Technique, given that he recently concluded his Domain. It could mean another major character’s death is on the horizon, but maybe the two Jujutsu Sorcerers can finally stand against him. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/one-more-multiverse-vtt-platform-announces-closure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sad news for online tabletop gaming fans. The virtual tabletop platform <em>One More Multiverse</em> has announced that it will be closing the platform. Thankfully, it has provided users a grace period to back up any resources they have on the platform.</p>
<h2>The One More Multiverse closure announcement</h2>
<p>The closure of One More Multiverse was made public by an <a href="https://multiverse.com/letter" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official post</a> on their website. According to the post, the developers of the VTT mention how proud they are of their team, citing their ambitions for the digital tabletop platform.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/one-more-multiverse-campaign-page.jpg?itok=myOFD1x1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/one-more-multiverse-campaign-page.jpg?itok=R62oUDFj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="894ed126-7f8c-4f4f-84c0-3e95bb093cd1" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/one-more-multiverse-campaign-page.jpg?itok=R62oUDFj" alt="A screenshot from a campaign screen of the VTT One More Multiverse" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>This page now seems bittersweet.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, ambition can only do so much against the realities of keeping the lights on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We spent the past year working very hard to develop a new path forward, but after careful consideration, it’s become clear that it’s not enough to support the OMM platform. For that, we are sorry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those unaware, One More Multiverse launched in 2020 with a development team of just five people.</p>
<p>It stood out from other VTTs mostly in its aesthetic design and accessibility. It provided players with thousands of art assets made up of retro pixel art. These assets could be used to make different scenes and scenarios, as well as character sheets, maps, notes, and story handouts.</p>
<p>As for supported systems, it was relatively niche. Compared to <a href="https://blog.roll20.net/posts/roll20-is-coming-to-discord-activities/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Roll20's</a> comprehensive support of tactical maps and the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/alchemy-rpg-vtts-and-focus-on-roleplaying">Alchemy VTT's</a> emphasis on motion art and custom soundscapes, One More Multiverse had official support for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/humblewood-debuts-on-dd-beyond"><em>Humblewood</em></a>, <em>Blades in the Dark</em>, and <em>Yazebas</em>.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a grace period for players who share stories on this platform. All assets and verses will be up for 90 days. The developers encourage players to download character cards, take screenshots of their verses, and save any NPCs. In addition, they will answer any other questions in a Q&amp;A on their Discord server.</p>
<p>For those who worked at One More Multiverse, the post mentions that they will not be left to fend for themselves. Employees will be provided severance, healthcare extensions, and dedicated support for job search.</p>

<p>Now that we officially have a title for the upcoming Assassin’s Creed Shadows, formerly Assassin’s Creed Red, let’s dive into the main protagonist. Yasuke, a formerly enslaved person and now renowned samurai, takes center stage in the upcoming open-world adventure. But his story could use a little time in the light, so let’s learn more about this unique character in the game’s world!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-yasuke-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Who is Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</h2>



<p>Yasuke, a real-life samurai, underwent a significant rewrite for the story of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. In the game, he’ll supposedly play the role of a slave traveling across the ocean via a slave ship when an unknown force suddenly attacks it. In the heat of battle, everyone, including the man’s lover, is slain in battle. Everyone except for Yasuke, who is rescued and transported to Japan. There, he learns how to become a samurai under the tutelage of the famous Nobunaga.</p>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Yasuke will inevitably ally with Naoe in an effort to oversee Japan’s unification. </p>

<p>Yes! You will play as both Yasuke, the samurai, and Naoe, a shinobi. Yasuke is likely to be more of a frontline fighter—a focus on combat. Alternatively, Naoe likely allows for more stealth-oriented gameplay, as in past Assassin’s Creed titles. As a shinobi—a ninja—she’ll skulk in the shadows and attack from above.</p>



<p>While indeed not the first female protagonist in the franchise—see Kassandra in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey or Eivor in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla—it will be the first time the female protagonist provided a completely different playstyle from the male counterpart. It’s also not a singular character, like in past games, just the female version of the male. Naoe is a unique character alongside Yasuke!</p>

<p data-characters="298" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been fighting with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/disney-dreamlight-valley-gets-a-temporary-fix-for-oswalds-3d-glasses-bug/">the 3D glasses</a> glitch in <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>, which prevented you from progressing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-oswald-in-disney-dreamlight-valley/">Oswald’s Many Dimensions</a>, then rejoice! The May 13 update has fixed this issue and, in line with player feedback since the Thrills and Frills update launched, a few more tweaks.</p> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">Of course, the most important update from this <a href="https://disneydreamlightvalley.com/news/update-may-13-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch</a> is that buying the 3D glasses before Oswald prompts you to make the purchase longer prevents the progression of Oswald’s Many Dimensions. That’s not it for Oswald-related fixes, either, as many players were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamlightValley/comments/1chvkm6/white_pants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having issues</a> with another request from Oswald at a previous stage of the same quest. </p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">When asked to don a pair of white pants, players realized they didn’t actually own any, and Scrooge wasn’t selling any, either. This left them unable to progress until Scrooge coughed up the goods. However, this update also changed the requirement to “light colored pants”, widening the scope of choices for players.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="bwwhbU">The stage is set; the stakes are high; the mutants are fighting. Magneto, at least, believes he was right.

<p id="0l3i3N">Two men are trying to make 1960s South Korea a better place: Kim San (Byun Yo-han), an idealist who hopes American affluence can help the Korean people, and Uncle Samsik (<em>Parasite</em>’s Song Kang-ho), who works from the shadows as a political fixer and social chameleon.

<p id="mLceW5"><em>Young Sheldon</em>, the <em>Big Bang Theory</em> spin-off about (who else) Sheldon (but young) is coming to an end.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dubai-long-term-gaming-visa/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It was recently announced that Dubai’s government is aiming to deepen its reach in the gaming industry, and to do so, it has launched the ‘Long-Term Dubai Gaming Visa’. This new initiative aims to entice industry workers – from developers to artists – to life in Dubai, with the city playing a key role in the region’s massive and ongoing investment in the gaming and esports industries.</p>



<p>It has been referenced that companies ‘specialising in digital content creation’ are being actively leant on to join this initiative.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-dubai">To Dubai</h2>



<p>For months, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the esports and gaming industries. From tournaments and gaming events worth tens of millions to plans to create a thriving city focused entirely on video games and entertainment, the region is trying to establish itself as a figurehead of this lucrative, ever-growing market.</p>



<p>Recently, Dubai’s Crown Prince Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum announced the new ‘Gaming Visa’ that’s designed to help attract <strong>30,000 industry workers </strong>by 2033. It’ll be available for developers, programmers, engineers, and other industry workers and professionals who are aged at least 25 years old at the time of application. </p>



<p>It was highlighted that there isn’t a fixed tenure for the Dubai Gaming Visa, and it’ll vary depending on the individual applying. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.emirates247.com/uae/dubai-introduces-long-term-dubai-gaming-visa-2024-05-12-1.732308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a statement</a>, the Director General of Dubai Culture and Arts Authority, Hala Badri, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Dubai Gaming Visa embodies the vision and aspirations of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and contributes to enhancing the emirate’s appeal as a premier destination for entrepreneurs, investors, game developers, designers, and programmers. It also attracts individuals with innovative ideas and both established and emerging companies specialising in the development and production of content, gaming applications, and artificial intelligence. This helps achieve Dubai’s cultural vision of being a global centre for culture, an incubator for creativity, and a thriving hub for talent.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dubai’s ‘Program for Gaming 2033’ aims to turn the city and the surrounding area into a hub for developers and gaming organisations. It’s designed to boost the nation’s GDP considerably, but it’s admittedly still facing some scepticism and doubt from the wider gaming community.</p>

Even the image’s grim setting calls back to FromSoftware’s PlayStation 4 exclusive game, signaling to Elden Ring players that Shadow of the Erdtree will, of course, provide yet another challenging and gruesome experience.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Flashbacks… <a href="https://t.co/ij9sJwMxQK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ij9sJwMxQK</a></p>— Ziostorm (@Ziostorm1) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ziostorm1/status/1790035533634150902?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’d say they look more like the garden of eyes. <a href="https://t.co/ozSQ9OraPd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ozSQ9OraPd</a></p>— TBartels (@TBartels1) <a href="https://twitter.com/TBartels1/status/1790041284444324310?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>While it’s nice to see an enemy that calls back to Bloodborne, most fans are hoping this new nameless being isn’t quite as tough to deal with as something like the Winter Lanterns. Those enemies notoriously built up an annoying status effect known as Frenzy just by being near the player. There’s also the location that the new enemy resides in, which looks suspiciously swamp-like and may or may not be poisonous.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That thing will spam status effect, i just know it.</p>— MarzTheBanished (@martkillswitch2) <a href="https://twitter.com/martkillswitch2/status/1790054097543934286?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Please don’t be a winter lantern Please don’t be a winter lantern Please don’t be a winter lantern<br>Please don’t be a winter lantern Please don’t be a winter lantern Please don’t be a winter lantern</p>— Karna (@karna2666) <a href="https://twitter.com/karna2666/status/1790034648321446177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hears humming* <a href="https://t.co/dXapnkMg52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/dXapnkMg52</a></p>— TheColeBrew (@TheColeBrewTv) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheColeBrewTv/status/1790041889665696158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date-and-new-trailer"><u>announced in February</u></a> and has a PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S release date of June 21, 2024. In typical FromSoftware fashion, we don’t know much about how the DLC will build upon Elden Rings already great foundation. However, you can read some of what we do know <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/15-hidden-details-in-the-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-trailer">here</a>.</p><p>For more on Elden Ring, you can read our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review"><u>10/10 review</u></a>.
