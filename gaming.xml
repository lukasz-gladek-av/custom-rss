			<p>Newzoo's <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/trend-reports/newzoos-global-games-market-report-2024-free-version?utm_campaign=GMRF%202024&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_8iBt5oTDZS79Xe1-qVJstTTVYdzjQCnxI3tiqR4XPSPXszyDxzlMi1539oQAe8Hi8TDr9useQrVIYyZ9AUtGsgrlofQ&amp;_hsmi=318862100&amp;utm_content=318862325&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Games Market and Forecasts report</a> for 2024 has been announced. Non-subscribers can access a free report version, which still provides much information. This is one of the most highly anticipated financial reports for the gaming industry, as it contains predictions from 2022 through 2027, giving people some insights into how the gaming industry will perform over the years.</p>
<p>Looking specifically at 2024 for the gaming industry, the global games market will generate $187.7 billion, a 2.7% year-on-year growth. Considering the financial reports that have come out from some of the game industry's giants, this is a surprise. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-q1-2025-report-reveals-sales-down-by-46-5/">Companies such as Nintendo</a> and PlayStation are experiencing significant drops in places.</p>
<p>The dormancy in the console gaming market is no surprise. Most consoles have had a slow two years, leading to a 1% decline year-on-year. All things considered, this isn't too bad of a number.</p>
<p>PC gaming revenues are up by 4% year-on-year for a profit of $43.2 billion, which will outgrow mobile and console revenues this year. However, by the time 2025 rolls around, it's predicted that console revenue will again be significantly higher than they are now and have the possibility to take over PC gaming revenues.</p>
<p>The global number of players was 3.145 million in 2022. That number has increased to 3.422 million and is expected to continue increasing to 3.759 million by 2027. With this number growing exponentially, the amount of money spent on gaming has increased. In 2024, global paying gamers will increase by 5% to $1.5 billion, with the revenue expected to increase to $1.67 billion by 2027 as gamers spend more and more each year on games.</p>
<p>Regarding other statistics, the number of players across every continent continues to grow. Asia has the most gamers, making up 53% of the total, with a 4% increase. This year, the Middle East and Africa experienced the most growth, gaining an 8.2% increase year-on-year in the number of gamers.</p>
<p>What may come as a surprise is the fact that mobile gaming is the highest source of revenue across all gaming, totaling 49% of all revenue. This makes a total of $92.6 billion, which is a 3% increase year-on-year.</p>
<p>The Newzoo games report covers many topics and information, such as what is benefiting the games industry right now and what isn't succeeding as much as it should be. One of the main factors that continues to benefit the games industry is releasing games on cross-platform. While it's becoming increasingly more common to do so, huge IPs from Nintendo still continue to be console-locked, with PlayStation slowly stepping out of the box by putting their games onto PC.</p>
<p>Whether Nintendo will ever do something similar remains to be seen, but it seems highly unlikely.</p>

As a fan of Tolkien’s fantasy world, I thought it had its moments, but a lot of it felt like a waste. Season 2, based on the trailers at least, feels like it’s shaping up to be something else entirely. A second look at the upcoming episodes shows where all the action and drama that fans missed the first time around ended up. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>  <em>Rings of Power</em>’s second season 2 trailer shows Middle-earth heading to war as Sauron sets his plans in motion and unlikely alliances are forged.

<p>Valve is set to allow its SteamOS to function on rival handheld devices. After <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4361258795952118018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent update notes</a> mentioned support for ROG Ally keys, many wondered if this meant the operating system was going to come to the ASUS ROG Ally and other handhelds like the Lenovo Legion GO.</p>



<p>According to Valve itself, that’s exactly what’s happening.</p>



<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Valve’s Lawrence Yang says the team is working on bringing full support for other devices.</p>



<p>“The note about ROG Ally keys is related to third-party device support for SteamOS,” Yang said. “The team is continuing to work on adding support for additional handhelds on SteamOS.”</p>



<p>As far as how it would work, that’s unknown as it’s unlikely that any non-Steam Deck handhelds would come with the operating system preinstalled. Still, with future support, it would allow users to easily install SteamOS and know their device will still function properly even with a different layout.</p>



<p>There’s also no timeline as to when full support will be available. According to Yang, via The Verge, it’s not “ready to run out of the box yet.”</p>

                <p>Valve has confirmed that SteamOS--its Linux-based operating system for the Steam Deck handheld gaming PC--will be coming to the Asus ROG Ally. The company also plans to roll out SteamOS to other rival Windows handhelds, although it has noted that third-party support "isn’t ready to run out of the box yet". The confirmation comes after the recent release notes for a recent SteamOS beta update mentioned adding support for "extra ROG Ally keys" in the future.</p><p>"The note about ROG Ally keys is related to third-party device support for SteamOS", Valve engineer Lawrence Yang said to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>. "The team is continuing to work on adding support for additional handhelds on SteamOS."</p><p>While Asus has yet to comment on its ROG Ally being potentially turned into a Steam machine, an update like this would address a major criticism of the handheld. Asus ROG Ally devices use a Windows 11 operating system, and while that does allow for various game clients to be installed, using the OS can be cumbersome as it's optimized for desktops, not thumbs and smaller screens. In comparison, SteamOS is a more fluid and user-friendly experience.</p><h2>Asus ROG Ally X and Ally Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4349952-rog-ally-x.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349952" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4349952-rog-ally-x.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349952"></a><figcaption>Asus ROG Ally X</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4349952-rog-ally-x.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1844733087673373358%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fasus-rog-ally-to-get-steam-deck-os-support%2F1100-6525778%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Ally X</a> -- $800</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1820028544647762629%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fasus-rog-ally-to-get-steam-deck-os-support%2F1100-6525778%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Ally Z1 Extreme with free carrying case</a> -- $650</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1820028407127445674%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fasus-rog-ally-to-get-steam-deck-os-support%2F1100-6525778%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Ally Z1 with free carrying case</a> -- $500</li></ul><h2>Asus ROG Ally Accessories</h2><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1842771478471222497%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fasus-rog-ally-to-get-steam-deck-os-support%2F1100-6525778%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ROG Ally charger</a> -- $30 ($<strike>65</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.co0/?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Raikiri Pro controller</a> -- $110 ($<strike>150</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/officially-controller-remappable-sensitivity-Gaming-Console/dp/B0C6WQX5ZW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Raikiri standard controller</a> -- $75 ($<strike>100</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-Headphones-Low-Latency-Cancelation/dp/B0BRSCKG2D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Cetra earbuds (white)</a> -- $65 ($<strike>100</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-Headphones-Low-Latency-Cancelation/dp/B09VP3YXX9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Cetra earbuds (black)</a> -- $80 ($<strike>100</strike>)</li></ul><p>This news comes hot on the heels of the launch of the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1844733087673373358%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fasus-rog-ally-to-get-steam-deck-os-support%2F1100-6525778%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Ally X</a>, an updated version of last year's ROG Ally.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/korean-devs-report-a-burst-of-interest-in-single-player-console-and-pc-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image via ShiftUp/PlayStation.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The traditionally online and free-to-play-based game industry of South Korean game development may be shifting gears. According to a recent report from Wesley LeBlanc in the final issue of Game Informer, developers at multiple studios like Round8 Studio, Shift Up, and Pearl Abyss are seeing signs that players at home and abroad are attracted to single-player experiences on PC and console.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">LeBlanc reached out to developers after seeing these companies releasing single-player games like Round8 Studio's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lies of P</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Shift Up's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stellar Blade </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(published by Sony Interactive Entertainment), and Pearl Abyss' upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crimson Desert</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Even longtime online and mobile publishers are spreading their platform wings, with Nexon subsidiary Neople soon releasing the single-player </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The First Berserker: Khazan</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and NCSoft bringing the free-to-play PC game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Throne and Liberty</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to consoles in September.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers at these companies confirmed to LeBlanc that the trend is real—and more of them are joining the "traditional" console and PC market sometimes thought to be calcified here in the West.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But why are they making the jump? There wasn't one clear answer—instead a constellation of factors seem to be driving the shift. But those stars all orbit the same point: that players buying games on console and PC are hungry for fresh experiences.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="South Korean developers see market shifts across the globe and at home">South Korean developers see market shifts across the globe and at home</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The immediate economic argument for these games is that they open up new overseas markets for South Korean developers. Round8 Studio CEO Jason Park told Game Informer that there are a "fixed number of people" who play single-player games on console and PC in South Korea, and that number "won't change." He said Round8 made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lies of P</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for a global market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shift Up CEO and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stellar Blade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Kim Hyung-tae partly agreed with Park, explaining only 5 percent of the PlayStation 5 exclusive </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stellar Blade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s sales came from his home country, and console share in the country isn't growing. He does think the market for single-player PC games can grow, which is why the company is considering a PC port for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stellar Blade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Others do see market movement inside the region. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lies of P</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Jin Won Choi said a major indicator he saw was the shift in what games students are making at universities. At a recent showcase, only one out of 17 student groups was making a mobile game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hyung-tae said he thinks the shift inside South Korea correlates to an age and income shift in mobile players. Because popular mobile games in the country are so heavily designed around grind-based monetization, older players with lots of money to burn are more likely to play them. He referred to this demographic as being "middle-aged."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's continued for the past 20 years, and players have become older, so it's harder to acquire new and younger users for...games," he told Game Informer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pearl Abyss America CEO Jeonghee Jin disagreed with the idea that console growth in South Korea is inevitably stalled, estimating that the market share has grown 4-5 percent since the launch of the PlayStation 4. South Korean game developers didn't start making console games until that generation, she said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jin's emphasis on developer experience may hold weight. Hyung-tae explained to Game Developer that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stellar Blade</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s development was "difficult," and that the team had to learn much of the process "from scratch."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whatever's driving the growing single-player market, developers and game industry professionals have plenty of reasons to refresh their thinking about South Korean game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Normally this would be where we we would link to Game Informer's original reporting. However GameStop did not publish this story on the outlet's website before shutting it down, meaning it is only readable in the final print edition of Game Informer. If you wish to read the rest of LeBlanc's report, we urge you to seek out a physical copy.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/not-even-helldivers-2-can-escape-from-live-service-hell.952953/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-controversy-live-service<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember when everybody was <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-joel-pc-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awooga-eyes in love with <em>Helldivers 2</em></a>? When the whole world had <a href="https://aftermath.site/blaseball-helldivers-2-joel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joel Fever</a> and every inch given or taken in the game’s endless intergalactic tug-of-war elicited gasps from onlookers? That was six months ago. Now each week brings some new lamentation about <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-ceo-says-helldivers-2-balancing-patches-have-gone-too-far-recently-it-feels-like-every-time-someone-finds-something-fun-the-fun-is-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">balance changes</a> or <a href="https://x.com/Leuk0s/status/1823068806987796928" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declining player counts</a>. The honeymoon period is over, replaced by the kind of shapeshifting malaise that’s come to characterize pretty much every other live service game.</p><p>Right now <em>Helldivers 2</em> players are fuming over changes that weaken the game’s flamethrower, to the point that some have elected to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/let-super-earth-burn-helldivers-2-players-are-committing-treason-to-protest-its-latest-patch-allowing-a-tide-of-bots-to-creep-worryingly-close-to-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">let Super Earth itself burn</a> in protest. This follows controversy over balance changes <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-s-enormous-balance-patch-means-business-weapons-are-getting-buffed-galactic-map-supply-lines-are-here-solo-patrols-are-sensible-again-and-the-worst-mission-modifier-is-gone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in June</a>, which followed controversy over balance changes <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-ceo-says-helldivers-2-balancing-patches-have-gone-too-far-recently-it-feels-like-every-time-someone-finds-something-fun-the-fun-is-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in May</a>, and, well, you get the idea. Developers have responded with attempts at placation while continuing to push a Sisyphean pace only partially of their own making. While it’s true that Arrowhead came out the gate exceedingly hot, <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-automatons-win" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delivering twists and updates</a> at an <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-studio-wants-to-slow-down-the-pace-of-updates-we-feel-a-slightly-lower-cadence-overall-will-benefit-both-us-you-and-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">astonishing clip</a>, that’s not really the core of the problem here. Rather, <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s entire pitch – the promise of granular reactivity that it’s struggled to live up to, especially where balance is concerned – was born of a landscape that’s unsustainable.</p><p>The “live” part of live service, somewhat paradoxically, is pretty much guaranteed to result in a death spiral. Players will eventually get their fill of what’s available and become dissatisfied. They will then begin to let developers know, first a few at a time, until others catch up in terms of progress or even just hear about it on a subreddit, at which point the problem becomes an avalanche. After that, it’s a race against time to add more content and turn community sentiment back in developers’ favor – a race they will never actually win, because it always starts over hours after an update goes live.&nbsp;</p><p>The team behind <em>Helldivers </em>at least had the right idea: Instead of over-relying on <em>Destiny 2</em>-style expansions that take years to develop, they built a game around an ever-shifting conflict whose parameters are relatively easy to tweak. This ensures that the game continues to feel alive even when the team is mostly heads-down on additions that won’t see the light of day for months.&nbsp;</p><p>But even then, as <em>Helldivers 2</em> has shown us, there are simply <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/helldivers-2-s-loudest-players-are-going-nuclear-over-another-unpopular-nerf-but-arrowhead-s-ceo-is-keeping-calm-some-are-going-buff-everything-others-are-saying-it-s-too-easy-most-are-just-playing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too many competing interests</a> vying for developers’ attention. A vocal faction of the fan base will almost always be upset, giving off the impression that <em>something </em>is wrong, which content-hungry YouTubers, streamers, and websites will seize upon. They can support this claim with all sorts of supposed evidence, like the aforementioned dwindling concurrent player count – down from hundreds of thousands on PC when the game first launched to around 30,000-50,000 now. Never mind that most games <a href="https://x.com/tha_rami/status/1823134123554210284?s=46&amp;t=L-Xht24CY5-UBFgAlG58bg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would <em>kill </em>for 30,000-50,000 concurrent players</a> and that many will likely return when the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-third-faction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-awaited third enemy faction</a> makes its debut; people will still say that <em>Helldivers 2</em> has suffered one of the most precipitous falls from grace of all time, that it’s a “dead game.”&nbsp;</p><p>None of this should surprise anybody who’s played any other live service game, the most successful of which have bounced back from being “dead” too many times to count. The issue in the eyes of many, I think, is that <em>Helldivers 2</em> was supposed to somehow be different. On paper, it had everything figured out, not to mention a truly immense stockpile of goodwill to blow through. But the live service model doesn’t allow for happy endings – just bickering trudges up mountains whose peaks are shrouded in suffocating fog.&nbsp;</p><p>On multiple occasions, Arrowhead has attempted to demystify its process, to explain why elements of the game aren’t where players would like them to be yet. Most recently, CEO Shams Jorjani <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-ceo-says-we-need-to-do-better-after-incendiary-response-to-flamethrower-nerfs-in-helldivers-2-me-just-talking-about-it-isn-t-enough-actions-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s Discord</a> that “we have long lead times on development” and “some changes take time before they show” while, at the same time, the company is still trying to figure out how to cater to a much larger audience than it was expecting.&nbsp;</p><p>"We know the [three hour] a week casual dads play differently and want different things than the [thirty hours] a week [high difficulty] crowd,” Jorjani wrote. “We haven't quite figured this out, and it's really new territory for us."</p><p>This is a completely understandable state for an overnight success like <em>Helldivers 2</em> to be in after just <em>six months</em>. In a more reasonable gaming ecosystem, most people would react to this by either putting up with mild annoyances for a time or by stepping away to play one of a million other games until<em> Helldivers 2 </em>was more to their liking. Perhaps they have! But that’s not the portion of the player base that dominates the conversation or sets the pace at which developers are expected to work. What we get instead are communities that constantly rile themselves up, that live perched on the precipice of outcry. Developers – even ones as forward thinking as Arrowhead – find themselves on the defensive, rolling with the punches rather than putting their best foot forward. It’s exhausting to watch, let alone be a part of.</p><p>There are some bright spots. It’s been cool to see the developers behind <em>World of Warcraft</em> figure out <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2024/8/12/24209862/world-warcraft-wow-classic-20th-anniversary-retrospective" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unique ways to remix pre-existing content</a>, to find new means of keeping the game feeling lively during periods of between-expansion dormancy. Hopefully other studios can learn from their example, though obviously <em>WoW </em>has <em>a lot</em> more locales, quests, and characters with which to work than most other games. Sometimes you get redemption arcs, too; <em>Destiny 2</em> looked like it was on the decline for years until <em>The Final Shape</em> came out in June and was greeted with immediate adulation.&nbsp;</p><p>But <em>Destiny 2</em> is also illustrative of where live service games can end up in more dispiriting ways. It’s no secret that Bungie’s studio culture has spent serious time in the toilet both <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-Sony</a> – that whether it got acquired or not, there was perhaps not a world in which its approach to live service development was fully sustainable. Now the company is being ravaged by <a href="https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brutal mass layoffs</a>, and the future is not looking bright for any of its games. But that’s the thing: <em>some </em>sort of end awaits every so-called “forever game.” And ends, no matter how promising their starts, are rarely pretty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-sequel-unreal-engine-5/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth team may switch from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5 for the third and final entry in the remake project, and the decision will depend on some factors.</p>
<p>Speaking with Japanese publication <a href="https://cgworld.jp/article/202408-ff7reb-01.html">CG World</a>, as translated on X by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1823392560729194696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genki</a>, director Naoki Hamaguchi said that the development team is considering switching to Unreal Engine 5 for the next game but believes what players want most for them is to deliver the game in good shape as soon as possible. As such, the decision will be made based on whether it will be faster to switch engines or whether it is best to develop the game at once using UE4 as in the previous games. The first year of work will be extremely important, as it will be a prototyping period that will determine the direction of the game. The same was done with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, as its first year of development was conducted in parallel with the development of Intergrade, a decision that definitely paid off, given the game's high quality.</p>
<p>Very little is currently known about the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's sequel that will conclude the story. Earlier this month, we heard that it will include the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-revamped-part-3/">Queen's Blood card mini-game</a> in a revamped form, but that is the only thing that has been confirmed for what is likely going to become one of the most anticipated JRPGs of the coming years.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about it in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-knightling-is-an-adorable-looking-platformer-launching-next-year.952938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-saber-interactive-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and wonderfully-named developer Twirlbound have announced&nbsp;<em>The Knightling</em>, a fantasy action-adventure game with platforming and puzzle elements that's set to debut next year.</p>
<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>will offer "a mix of exploration, questing, combat and platforming", and will let you loose in a semi-open world armed only with your trusty shield.</p>
<p>The setup is rather sweetly straightforward; you are the titular Knightling, and your master, Sir Lionstone, has disappeared. It's up to you to discover what's happened to him and save the realm of Clesseia before monsters, bandits, and other beasties take over.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-knightling-announcement-bat.jpg?itok=LRuOLJtX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-knightling-announcement-bat.jpg?itok=mu4lKmH0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>has a rather sweet-looking&nbsp;art style.</figcaption></figure><p>Your main weapon in&nbsp;<em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>is a shield, contrary to expectations; it seems that you won't be wielding a sword in this particular adventure.</p>
<p>However, your shield is a very capable combat asset. It'll let you "block, bash, parry, and create openings in your enemies' defenses", according to Twirlbound and Saber, so it should serve you more than well enough.</p>
<p>You can also use your shield as a traversal tool. The lands of Clesseia are vast, and you won't be able to get around just by walking from place to place, which is where&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>-style shield surfing comes into play.</p>
<p>If you want to get a feel for what&nbsp;<em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>looks and plays like, then you can check out the game's debut trailer right here. It should be a treat if you're a fan of games like the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Breath of the Wild</em>.</p>

<p>Frankly,&nbsp;<em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>looks exactly like the kind of game I wish there was more of, so I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this one.</p>
<p>If you feel like you recognize&nbsp;Twirlbound's name, you might be remembering the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/twirlbound-launches-kickstarter-for-indie-game-pine">crowdfunding campaign the studio launched</a> for its previous game,&nbsp;<em>Pine</em>. It doesn't look like this one is seeking any extra funding, though.</p>
<p><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10004254/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/the-knightling/9nd5r4j0g5lv" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch sometime in 2025. Stay tuned for more info on this game as soon as we get it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/two-point-museum-lets-you-curate-your-very-own-historical-exhibits.952935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-museum-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Two Point Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum</em>, the latest in the&nbsp;<em>Two Point&nbsp;</em>series of light-hearted management sims. You'll never guess what this one's all about!</p>
<p>Yes, as the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum&nbsp;</em>will let you manage your very own arcade. Obviously, that's a joke; you're managing a museum, and it's up to you to curate the exhibits, design your museum's layout, and make sure your guests are having a good time.</p>
<p>Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/two-point-hospital">first</a> two <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/two-point-campus">games</a> in the&nbsp;<em>Two Point&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum&nbsp;</em>will combine an irreverent sense of humor and a cartoony art style with management sim gameplay, but there are a few new twists on the formula.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/two-point-museum-announcement-gameplay.jpg?itok=P4oskIoH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/two-point-museum-announcement-gameplay.jpg?itok=nThfwPTm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fancy going digging for some dinosaur skeletons?</figcaption></figure><p>Not only will you have to run your museum, but you'll also have to source the exhibits yourself, so you'll be sending your experts out on far-flung missions to discover objects you can display for your guests' wonderment.</p>
<p>Naturally, you'll also have to keep your exhibits clean and safe for the guests, and you'll need to protect them from thieves as well, so you'd better make sure your security is top-notch.</p>
<p>Since this is a management sim, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that you can arrange and design your museum however you want; you can create themed areas built around certain exhibits, or you can just display everything willy-nilly, you crazy anarchist.</p>
<p>You can also arrange guided tours for your guests to go on, and the experts you've sent to gather fossils and other exhibits can lead those tours as well, which is a nice touch.</p>

<p>Guests in&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum&nbsp;</em>can have a range of different interests and dispositions, and you'll have to keep them all happy if you want to succeed, even the children who put their grubby mitts all over your displays. The horror!</p>
<p><em>Two Point Museum&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, and while we don't have a release date yet, Sega and Two Point Studios have promised more info "soon". Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220250/amd-zen-5-cpu-reviews-ryzen-9-9950x<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AMD launched its first Zen 5 desktop processors earlier this month, and tomorrow, it’s about to release what looks like a disappointing flagship Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. Early reviews of the initial Zen 5 CPUs — the Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X — revealed a lack of performance improvements and efficiencies, and now reviews of the flagship Ryzen 9 9950X are coming to the same conclusion.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/43DFYvOoRhY">Hardware Unboxed has tested</a> a variety of productivity workloads and games with the 9950X, and the results make the previous generation Ryzen 9 7950X chip look like a better value in most cases. </p><p>Over a 13-game average running at 1080p with an RTX 4090, Hardware Unboxed found that the 9950X was just a single percent faster than the existing 7950X. AMD’s new flagship Zen 5 CPU is offering the same level of performance as two years ago, essentially. There are no real efficiency improvements on the power side, either. “From a gaming perspective, the 9950X is a complete and utter flop,” concludes Hardware Unboxed’s Steve Walton.</p><p>The 9950X is equally underwhelming on the productivity side, too. Hardware Unboxed found an actual regression in performance for compression and decompression work, and minor improvements over the 7950X in tests like Cinebench, Blender, and image editing in Photoshop. On average, the 9950X is just 3 percent faster than the 7950X during these productivity tests.</p><div><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DiyA9DRTJtyE">Steve Burke over at Gamers Nexus</a> has similar findings, concluding that the 7950X is better value for productivity workloads and that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/5/23668320/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">7800X3D that we reviewed last year</a> is still the better chip for gaming overall. </p></div><p>The results are a far cry from AMD’s big “monster” promises of performance gains in productivity as well as gaming. AMD described Zen 5 as a “big leap” it was “very proud of” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24168544/amd-zen-5-ryzen-9-9950x-cpu-computex-2024">in a press briefing with <em>The Verge</em></a> earlier this year. </p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPkOoEPTqB-Q%26t%3D505s">JayzTwoCents says</a> AMD has “fumbled this launch,” and it’s hard not to disagree. At a time when Intel’s 13th and 14th Gen CPUs have been suffering from crashing issues leading to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211616/intel-crashing-13th-14th-gen-cpus-warranty-two-more-years">extended warranties</a>, many were looking to AMD’s new Zen 5 CPUs to offer up some solid competition for Intel. Now, it’s all eyes on Intel’s Arrow Lake desktop CPUs that are expected to launch later this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And all of it is plugged into a single, comparatively small display so that he can swap between any system at any time. And it actually works. Guinness World Records <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.humix.com/video/k2-PQMOH4W2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.humix.com/video/k2-PQMOH4W2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently visited to make a video about his setup</a></span> and award him the rare achievement of having 444 consoles working through the same TV at the same time.</p><p>As the collector breaks down how the setup works, you can see how much planning and organization went into it all. A stack of switches and converters helps him route whichever system he wants to play to the TV with the flick of a button, while a massive Excel spreadsheet helps him keep track of what’s connected where.</p><p>This includes 30 RCA switchers and over 12 HDMI switchers running everything from a 1972 Magnavox Odyssey to last year’s PlayStation 5 Slim edition. The rest of the collection includes plug-and-play hardware like Namco joysticks and even off-brand systems that were quickly discontinued like the Super A’Can. To this day, though, Al-Nasser says his favorite console ever remains the Sega Genesis.</p><p>I think the thing I’m most impressed with about his setup is just how neat and tidy it is. Aside from the stacks of controllers that look more like modern art than mini-piles of mess, almost all of the cords are hidden. “I used all the tools available in the market in order to organize the cables,” he told Guinness. Al-Nasser said that while the idea was born from his retro gaming habits, the setup now functions as an unofficial museum. Hopefully, the Switch 2 comes out soon so he can make the record 445.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/visions-of-mana-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The next installment in the Mana series feels like video game chicken soup for the soul. </h2></div><section><p>When I first got my hands on Visions of Mana at PAX East 2024, I was pleased by how much I enjoyed the gameplay. A refreshing take on battle and class systems and a smooth overall flow to fights were just some of the highlights I experienced in the two hours I got to play. For my final preview, it was almost the opposite experience, but in a good way. I played right from the beginning of chapter one for about three hours, and what surprised me most this time was how much I enjoyed the characters and story.</p><p>The adventure starts with Val and Hinna, a duo who grew up in the same town and have known each other for a long time. As they set off on their journey to the mana tree, a bit of time is spent on their relationship and the connection they’ve built over the years. Based on the townsfolk's comments, it is clear that the two have great chemistry together, and they know it. The duo doesn't even flinch at the idea of being a couple at one point, making me immediately ship them.  What made me like them even more is how down-to-earth and relatable they feel. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Visions of Mana Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Val serves as the aloof player-insert character who will ask questions that any player who is new to the series might also have. Hinna works opposite him perfectly, giving exposition in the form of conversations as the two travel toward the manna tree, explaining the setting and its background along the way. While this method of worldbuilding can feel forced, as if the characters are unnaturally dumping information on you, it works in Visions of Mana due to how they craft their character's backgrounds and personalities. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Having something presented on a platter in perfect order is much easier than finding everything yourself and figuring out what works best.</p></div><p>It is explained that Hinna knows all of the information because she's been preparing to be the alm of fire and traveling outside of their hometown for a while now, and the role must be knowledgeable. On the other hand, Val has been in the village honing his abilities as the best swordsman so he can serve as her soul guard on the journey. She is the brains, and he is the brawn. It might seem like a small thing, but it helps build both the characters and the world of Visions of Mana while establishing how they fit in their roles. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Careena and Morley also benefit a lot from getting origin stories. Instead of just being thrown together eight hours in with a pre-established dynamic like in the last preview, here I got to meet each character individually and learn why they are also on the journey to the mana tree. Initially, I didn't like Careena's sarcastic attitude or Morley's brooding nature. Given the context of the struggles they both go through just to become alms in this preview, these flaws make much more sense and even provide room for attractive personal growth as the story progresses. </p><p>Getting to experience combat, leveling, and abilities from the ground up made me even more appreciative of the RPG elements that go into Visions of Mana. Instead of having powers unlocked and pre-assigned, I was now responsible for finding, unlocking, and figuring out who to give them to. Again, this might sound simple, but having something presented on a platter in perfect order is much easier than finding everything yourself and figuring out what works best. Thankfully, it is a pretty straightforward process, although it is slow. Throughout Chapter One, I found sigil seeds by defeating enemies, completing quests, searching for chests, or buying them at traders with the in-game currency. Figuring out which sigils to assign to which character became its own game within a game. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While I initially had issues fighting characters like the Blood Owls due to their speed, equipping the Thunders Saber to Val and Ice Smash to Careena made for the perfect one-two punch to slow it down and drain its health. Getting to assign these abilities myself instead of having them already given to the best character by the developers helped me better understand both the controlled and enemy character's strengths and weaknesses. </p><p>Now that I’ve experienced the early and middle parts of Visions of Mana, I simply can’t wait to sink my teeth into what the full game has to offer. The first preview showcased how good the combat and RPG elements are once they are established, and the second highlighted just how good the build-up is for the characters, setting, and ever-evolving tactics. Here is to hoping the story continues to develop as much as the gameplay does as the story reaches the later parts of the game. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Comparisons with the original game from 2015 can be seen below.</p><p>Perhaps most prominently, the remastered game features a reworked prologue, with adjustments to its narrative pacing. "We’ve given the Washingtons extra screen time to explore their close family bond and get to know them a little better," creative director Neil McEwan said in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/14/until-dawn-rebuilt-and-enhanced-for-ps5-and-pc-launches-october-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a> post. "We have also reframed some of the original scenes and developed the context around the infamous prank. We hope this enhances its emotional impact."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Until Dawn's updated version also has revised cinematography that uses a combination of fixed and over-the-shoulder camera views. "Blending the cinematography of the original with the introduction of a modern third-person camera, we hope to bring new life to characters and locations," McEwan said.</p><p>Myriad new accessibility and usability settings have also been added, as well as an alternative challenge to the Don't Move mechanic, which was a focal point of the original Until Dawn's criticism.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-announced-for-ps5-and-pc-alongside-a-release-window-state-of-play-2024">Until Dawn for PS5 and PC was announced in January 2024</a> as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-are-all-the-ps5-games">the latest in a long line of ports and remasters</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-review">In our 7/10 review of the original</a>, IGN said: "Until Dawn is an inconsistent horror game, but it's still a heck of a lot of fun."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p dir="ltr">Most people probably have a couple of video game consoles hooked up to their TV. But Ibrahim Al-Nasser is not like most people. The Saudi Arabian has connected 444 systems to a single television, making him the Guinness World Records holder for the feat.</p><p dir="ltr">But how exactly are hundreds of consoles working on a single TV when most these days have only a few HDMI ports--let alone the fact old systems used different connections? According to <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2024/8/gaming-is-serious-business-for-man-with-444-consoles-hooked-up-to-one-tv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Guinness World Records</a>, Ibrahim utilizes roughly 30 RC switchers, 12 HDMI switchers, and other devices. Additionally, he created an Excel spreadsheet to help navigate everything, which he shows off in a video (seen below) posted <a href="https://x.com/GWR/status/1823318344927195260" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Ibrahim has current-gen consoles like the PS5 connected to the TV, as well as 1972's Magnavox Odyssey. Other systems hooked up include Nintendo 64, Neo Geo, and Wii U. To get to 444, he also has plug-and-play devices and HDMI game sticks linked up to the TV, according to Guinness World Records.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what his favorite is, Ibrahim doesn't hesitate to say Sega Genesis. "For me, the best gaming console of all time, No. 1 always, forever, Sega Genesis," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">This is not the first time Guinness World Records has celebrated video games. In 2021, YouTuber and modder Gunnar Turnquist was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/behold-the-guinness-world-records-smallest-nintendo-64-console/1100-6488653/" data-ref-id="1100-6488653">honored for creating the world's smallest Nintendo 64</a>, for instance.

		<p>Two Point Studios and Sega have announced Two Point Museum, the next game in their irreverent management sim series. Two Point Museum is ‘coming soon’ for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | Announcement Trailer (PEGI - ENG)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oM5dGYAS-eY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The successor to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-hospital">Two Point Hospital</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/two-point-campus">Two Point Campus</a>, Two Point Museum will try to tickle your dinosaur’s funny bone while getting you to manage and curate spectacular exhibits that fill museum goers with a sense of entertainment and wonder.</p>
<p>You might wonder how Two Point Studios are going to make museums weird and humorous, considering the real world counterparts, but you can immediately see from the announcement trailer how they’re going to go about things. Dinosaur skeletons and recreations have been given quirky designs and humorous expressions, there’s truly gigantic foot prints, and even prehistoric computers made out of rock.</p>
<p>You’ll have to go out and hunt for those relics, sending archeologists and explorers to undiscovered areas to find unusual relics to match the styles and rarity types for your museum. A new ‘endless’ star scoring system will keep you trying to tweak the museum layout and improve on previous collections that you curated, and that star rating will also rely on keeping staff and guests happy – organise guided tours for the latter with guides feeding visitors information and generating buzz that can lead to donations.</p>

<p>You’ll have to keep a keen eye for naughty types, with vandals, thieves and mischievous children all potentially up to no good, and certain items (like frozen cavemen) will have to be kept in the right temperature.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t forget the gift shop.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing more of Two Point Museum, given our love of the first two Two Point games. We said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/04/two-point-campus-review/">Two Point Campus review</a>, “If Two Point Hospital was a triumphant return of the Theme Hospital style management sim, then Two Point Campus is a true heir. It takes the same tongue-in-cheek tone and applies it to a new setting, it learns from the journey its predecessor went through, and it deepens the experience for anyone that wants it.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/until-dawn-launches-on-playstation-5-and-pc-october-4.952872/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-launches-on-playstation-5-and-pc-october-4/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Until Dawn is one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-state-of-play-trailer-updated-characters-visuals/">most well-known games</a> created by Supermassive Games. It's time for the game to shine again. Released in 2015, it was a huge success for the PlayStation 4 and spurred Supermassive Games to make more games, such as The Quarry and The Dark Pictures Anthology. Now, it's time for Until Dawn to take the limelight again, as it's gotten an official release date for when it will launch on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>The story for Until Dawn will still be the same, but the game has been revamped massively to showcase the best cinematic experience of the game. To make the most of Until Dawn, the developers recreated the game in Unreal Engine 5, giving players access to a more intimate experience throughout the unfolding horrific events.</p>
<p>Using Unreal Engine 5, they have updated the character models and environments, improved visual effects and animations, and maximized the visual experience of Until Dawn for new and returning players. The developers spent much time on the character models, "bringing them in line with modern advances in character modeling and rendering," <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/14/until-dawn-rebuilt-and-enhanced-for-ps5-and-pc-launches-october-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says Neil McEwan</a>, the Creative Director of Ballistic Moon. Ballistic Moon is a British games studio that has helped with this massive project to deliver it in the Fall of 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Until Dawn - Comparison Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bIkuM5y0Bjw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To give Until Dawn an extra boost of realism, they added the injury mask system, which allows the characters in-game to look extra gritty. This system adds elements such as cuts, bruises, tears, and even snow to the characters for a more realistic finish.</p>
<p>Overall, the game looks to have a more polished experience with a new camera mechanic that will make navigating the game easier. Instead of the camera from before, players will now experience fixed shots and over-the-shoulder camera views so that fans can see the world of Until Dawn and give players brand new perspectives as they explore.</p>
<p>In addition to some fine-tuning narrative tweaks, they've also reworked their accessibility settings to help the game be more accessible and enjoyable to all horror fans. There is a new alternative to the "Don't Move" mechanic called "Stay Calm," which utilizes third-party peripherals that don't feature a gyroscope or for players who prefer a different challenge.</p>
<p>Until Dawn will be available for pre-order from August 21. It's important to note that if you want to play this game on a PC, you must have a PlayStation Network account to play the game. Until Dawn will be available on PC and PlayStation 5 on October 4.</p>

Your options are Maelstrom in Limsa Lominsa, Twin Adder in Gridania, and Immortal Flames in Ul’Dah. Your choice will have no bearing, as they all lead to a quest that unlocks Chocobos, however they do affect the next Main Scenario Quest (MSQ) with Maelstrom members receiving “Till Sea Swallows All,” Twin Adder members picking up “Woods Will Be Done,” and Immortal Flames members obtaining “For Coin and Country.”<br></p><p>Once these quests are completed, you can talk to each faction’s representative to accept a new Feature Quest titled “My Little Chocobo.” This is the quest that will reward a Chocobo on completion.</p><h2 id="h1802"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Complete My Little Chocobo</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="221cea4c37b91d4d084834da26905176" data-recommend-id="image://221cea4c37b91d4d084834da26905176" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a lovely shop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's a lovely shop." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="221cea4c37b91d4d084834da26905176" data-recommend-id="image://221cea4c37b91d4d084834da26905176" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a lovely shop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are some small differences in how you complete “My Little Chocobo” depending on which Company you joined. Each variation will require you to obtain a Chocobo Issuance, which can be purchased from your Company’s shop using “Seals.” Seals are a type of currency issued by your Grand Company for completing different in-game tasks that can be used to buy exclusive items such as the key item for this quest.<br></p><p>It should be mentioned that the Seals used are exclusive to that company, so you cannot use the currency from Twin Adder to buy items from the Immortal Flames. Each Company’s shop should be right next to the quest giver for “My Little Chocobo.” Once it is obtained, you will have to present it to that region’s Chocokeep to receive your mount. Below are the types of seals each Company uses, the type of Chocobo Issuance you will need, and who it should be presented to.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Maelstrom Members will need 200 Storm Seals to buy a Storm Chocobo Issuance and present it to Fraegeim in Limsa Lominsa.</li><li>Twin Adder Members will need 200 Serpent Seals to buy a Serpent Chocobo Issuance and present it to Cingur in Gridania.</li><li>Immortal Flames Members will need 200 Flame Seals to buy a Flame Chocobo Issuance and present it Mimigun in Ul’Dah.</li></ul><figure id="" data-id="7017dc91cd5892bf629cc10981228ec8" data-recommend-id="image://7017dc91cd5892bf629cc10981228ec8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1123" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Why look, a Chocobo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Why look, a Chocobo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7017dc91cd5892bf629cc10981228ec8" data-recommend-id="image://7017dc91cd5892bf629cc10981228ec8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1123" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Why look, a Chocobo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once this is done, you will need to name their Chocobo and then speak to their respective Chocokeep (Fraegeim, Cingur or Mimigun) to turn in their quest, at which point you will unlock Mounts and be awarded a Chocobo Whistle.<br></p><h2 id="h1803"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Obtain Seals?</strong></h2><p>That may have explained how to complete the quest, but now you may be wondering, “How do I get seals for my Chocobo Issuance form?”. Remember that quest you completed earlier to unlock “My Little Chocobo”? It provided a reward of 300 seals from your respective Company, so you should have enough to pick up the Issuance and turn it in for a Chocobo! If you already spent it, the easiest way to grind for more is by participating in small combat events called FATEs, scattered around the world.</p><h2 id="h1804"><a id=""></a><strong>How Do I Summon My Chocobo?</strong></h2><p>You may have noticed that the reward for “My Little Chocobo” was not the bird itself, but a Chocobo Whistle. This is an item that needs to be used to actually register the mount to your character. To do so, navigate to your inventory and find the Chocobo Whistle. Select the “Use” Option. Now you will have a Chocobo ready to ride! Note that any mount you receive will be provided to you in this way, so if you are confused why a specific one you should have isn’t showing up in your Mount Options, check your inventory and make sure you used its corresponding item.</p><figure id="" data-id="d3cd0ea14cd44b95f2b72343fb222f47" data-recommend-id="image://d3cd0ea14cd44b95f2b72343fb222f47" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's the menu tab.

Just remember to save the Seals you obtain from the MSQ until you are able to trade them for a Chocobo Issuance, or else you may have to grind some out to obtain your giant bird. Also don’t panic if you don’t see your Chocobo when you finish the mission. You probably just need to blow the whistle and then you’re off to the races!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another studio has announced major layoffs as TerraTech developer Payload Studios has laid off 25 percent (25%) of its staff this week. The announcement comes via the studio’s founder and CEO Russ Clarke <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7229083322172223488/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via LinkedIn</a>.</p>



<p>“We tried very hard to avoid this, and I won’t pretend that we got everything right over the last few years – but ultimately the games market has been very tough in recent times, and shows little sign of getting easier,” he said. “Small independents like us have no protection from this, other than ‘nailing it’ every time, which is much easier said than done.”</p>



<p>While Clarke said that 25% of the team would be let go, there was no specific number mentioned. According to Rocket Reach, the company has 48 employees. If that’s accurate, at least 12 people will have lost their jobs from this news.</p>



<p>“Payload will carry on, and bounce back from this, I firmly believe; but it’s a hard road and it will stay hard for a good while longer,” Clarke continued. “TerraTech and TerraTech Worlds will continue to be maintained and developed without interruption – we thank our wonderful community for their support, and we wish the best to those amazing co-workers with whom we have shared this incredible journey, but must now regretfully part ways.”</p>



<p>With the layoffs at Payload Studios, the gaming industry has seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">over 11,600 people</a>, at least, lose their jobs in 2024 alone.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uRI3WOfER0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Sega announced Two Point Museum from developer Two Point Studios with a new cinematic and gameplay trailer.</p>



<p>The trailer did not confirm a release window or date, but it does conclude by saying the game is “coming soon.” The rating is still pending in today’s footage, so it may take a little while for the devs to offer concrete release details.</p>



<p>The new trailer also reveals Two Point Museum will be available on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Fans can wishlist the game now.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>The announcement trailer showcases a variety of new objects for the museum theme, concentrating on a range of dinosaur skeletons. </p>



<p>It also features Two Point Studios’ trademark sense of humor, calling 3-year-old computers ancient history and teasing zany antics.</p>



<p>The trailer description elaborates on the game, revealing that players will “coordinate experts on expeditions to uncover exciting artefacts.” </p>



<p>Players must also “strategically decorate and plan your exhibits” for guests, keep staff happy, secure donations, and more. </p>



<p>There are options to customize decorations, manage tours and pricing. Some of the in-game obstacles include thieves and carnivorous plants.</p>



<p>Most recently, Sega also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-trademarks-yakuza-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a new trademark</a> for “Yakuza Wars” last week. Fans quickly speculated that Sega could be planning on a major announcement for the mystery project during September’s anticipated Tokyo Game Show.</p>

This is all while you keep your Exhibits safe, rooms clean, staff happy… and children off the dinosaur bones.</p><p><strong>Exploring for Exhibits</strong></p><p>As Curator, the design and management of your expanding museum is in your hands! Send your team of partially trained Experts on Expeditions in search of rare and mostly well-preserved artefacts. When (and hopefully not if) your Experts return from their adventure, proudly display their fantastic finds in your museum.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You’ll unlock new locations as you decide where the next adventure takes you, and complete a sticker book to document your journey as a souvenir of your discoveries.</p><p>Your work doesn’t end there; Exhibit maintenance is crucial. While some Experts are gallivanting across Two Point County and beyond, you’re in charge of managing staff back home to ensure Exhibits and the museum stay in tip-top condition. If taking care of the carnivorous Chomper isn’t enough, there are also meddling thieves to watch out for. Thieves, and more frequently, children, are known for touching and grubbing up the displays, so make sure enough security is guarding your prized collection!</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_905791"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Design-osaurs</strong></p><p>Get creative to design your museum layout your way! You have decorative freedom, so design thematic areas to guide your guests’ visit. Splash paint and lay carpet as you lovingly arrange each prehistoric fern, potentially melting iceman, and dinosaur remains wherever you see fit.</p><p>Once you’ve created the perfect atmosphere, arrange guided tours with custom routes led by a charismatic Expert.

		<p>Developer Pixelatom&nbsp;and publisher&nbsp;Blowfish Studios have announced that Anarkade, a platform fighter, will be available from September 23rd on PC via Steam, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anarkade - Coming 23rd September | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rejUkOamlck?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Anarkade&nbsp;is a fun, fast-paced party game at heart,”</em> said Javier Arias, Founder and Lead Developer, Pixelatom. <em>“We’ve crafted a balanced experience, mixing action, shooting, and platforming with unpredictable scenarios that make for an dynamic, ever changing experience for shooters to play over and over again.”</em></p>
<p>Anarkade will feature six different stages with each of them having their own hazards and quirks. For example, in the Space stage the battle wills be fought in low gravity, while ice stages have slippery surfaces. The layouts will change as each is procedurally generated. There will be various weapons available to use in the fights too including a knife, Python revolver, the gatling gun, and the bowling bomb. At the start of each fight, players will be randomly assigned their weapons and will have to fight to grab crates to change weapons.&nbsp;Anarkade will feature both local and online multiplayer. Game modes will include single matches, or tournament matches that include Deathmatches and collecting loot in Cratebox.</p>
