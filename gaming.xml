                <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>, PC gaming's premier destination for mods, is changing hands after almost 24 years. Site founder Robin Scott, aka DarkOne, announced the change in ownership but didn't make clear who the new owners are.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a> on Nexus Mods, Scott doesn't explicitly state who the site's new owners are, only that it took many months of meetings and face-to-face talks to find a new owner that would "respect the myriad intricacies of both Nexus Mods as a business and the wider modding community." The new owners are focused on "long-term stability, not changing the values or direction of the platform," Scott said, and that the site will continue to be "community-first and mod-author focused."</p><p>"So yes, the ownership of Nexus Mods has changed hands, but I want to be clear, this isn't some corporate 'exit' or a backroom deal," Scott said. "This is me doing something I probably should've done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself."</p><p dir="ltr">Scott cited burnout and health reasons for stepping away from running the site he founded. Scott said running the website since 2001 and always being "on call" has been an ongoing source of anxiety and "stress-related health issues." While the site was born out of personal excitement for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/" data-ref-id="5000-2508">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a>, it later transformed into a business that consumed his life.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's been rewarding, sometimes chaotic, often exhausting, and always personal," Scott said. "Somewhere along the way, I forgot to step back and breathe, or sleep properly. The dilemma of running a major social network that does not rest!"</p><p dir="ltr">Scott said that his burnout and exhaustion began to have a negative effect on the site and the Nexus Mods team, making him come to the realization that the "best thing" for the future of Nexus Mods was to step aside and bring in new leadership.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Scott is no longer the owner, he will still be involved in helping guide the overall direction of the site, just "without needing to be the person who signs off on every little thing." In terms of what will change, it doesn't seem like it will be much, at least according to Scott. He said he had already started stepping back in recent years and that the structural updates to the company's ownership are more of a formality to make sure the right people are in control to guide the site into the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Modding, and Nexus Mods, has only continued to grow in the last two decades. Massive RPGs like Skyrim, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fallout-4-mods/2900-5217/" data-ref-id="2900-5217">Fallout 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods/2900-6512/" data-ref-id="2900-6512">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-baldurs-gate-3-mods/2900-5661/" data-ref-id="2900-5661">Baldur's Gate 3</a> all having extensive modding communities that are made easily accessible thanks to sites like Nexus Mods, where mod creators can easily upload their creations and those looking to augment their games on PC can easily browse for new additions.</p><p dir="ltr">For those looking to make the jump into the wild world of user-made mods, be sure to check out our round-up of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-skyrim-mods/2900-6392/" data-ref-id="2900-6392">best Skyrim mods to play in 2025</a>, as well as similar lists for popular mod-friendly games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-mods/2900-5480/" data-ref-id="2900-5480">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-stardew-valley-mods/2900-5735/" data-ref-id="2900-5735">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>

The original games from developer Neversoft deftly captured the joy of building your skate style and exploring a popular destination transformed into a skatepark. Vicarious Visions' 2020 remake, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was a firm reminder that iconic THPS gameplay still hits—and we're getting the next bundle soon with the revamped </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During Summer Game Fest 2025, we had the opportunity to play Iron Galaxy’s take on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3 + 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. While checking out the renewed titles, we spoke with game director Kurt Tillmanns about stepping in for the previous remake developer and what makes the classic THPS gameplay so timeless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're huge fans of the franchise; most of the team have been playing the games their whole lives," said Tillmanns. "It's a great honor to be working with Tony Hawk to carry on with what Vicarious Visions had done on an amazing project [with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>1 + 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">], and then just carry it forward and make improvements and additions in every possible place we can."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developer Iron Galaxy has an extensive history of assisting developers and even taking over development from other teams, particularly Killer Instinct's final seasons. Much like the 2020 remake, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>THPS 3 + 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> focuses on revitalizing the original 2000s-era games with refined gameplay and more fleshed-out mechanics that incorporate features from later games in the series, such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk's Underground</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and its suite of wall planting and spine transferring.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/after-years-of-preparation-ioi-is-ready-to-apply-its-lethal-learnings-to-007-first-light" target="_self" data-discover="true">Lethal learnings from Hitman prepared IOI for making 007: First Light</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Iron Galaxy chose a novel approach in adapting the career mode from the fourth game of the series, which offered free-roam maps and other skaters hawking missions. It was a well-loved feature and even formed the basis of the skater story mode in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk's Underground</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but, as is, it couldn’t work with both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—so the developers opted for a more seamless blend between them. The compromise allows players to skate in parks for up to an hour, giving them the freedom to skate as they like.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The experience of exploring a sandbox skatepark filled with half-pipes and bizarre activities that lean into the rebellious nature of skate culture is at the heart of what makes the THPS games so enjoyable. When it came to delivering a remake of the third and forth games, the developers still wanted to deliver on the heightened reality of the "skater fantasy."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Humor and rule-breaking are part of the Tony Hawk formula">Humor and rule-breaking are part of the Tony Hawk formula</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Part of the legacy of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is that it has a sense of humor about itself, and it can break a bunch of rules," said the game director. "Some of that even starts with the level, like the way that we designate levels in Tony Hawk or think about the forbidden, fantastic places in them. You have forbidden places in real-world locations that you just want to skate in and feel like a real skater, and then we also have places like Area 51 or this Pinball Machine level."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-i-learned-during-a-marvellous-meeting-with-to-a-t-creator-keita-takahashi" target="_self" data-discover="true">What I learned during a marvelous meeting with To a T creator Keita Takahashi</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We can kind of break reality, and then the skaters are also an extension of that.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-out-now-after-a-strong-head-start-weekend/">Dune: Awakening</a> is a wonderfully immersive game that allows players to insert themselves in the world of Arrakis and play among the sandworms and political intrigue the series is known for, but before you get to any of that, you need to live long enough to see it.</p>
<p>Surviving on Arrakis in Dune: Awakening is, whether you like it or not, painfully accurate to what it would be like if you were to try living on the desert planet for longer than a day. And it doesn't exactly help your case that the game begins with your player character crash-landing on the planet, with barely anything but the clothes on your back.</p>
<p>While you are guided through some concrete survival steps in the game's opening hours, this guide will take you through the minutiae of what it takes to survive on Arrakis, and the new way of thinking you'll need to adjust to in order to make sure you'll be able to see the sun rise on a new day on Dune.</p>
<h2>Dune: Awakening - Tips for Surviving Arrakis</h2>
<h4>ABP - Always Be Prepared</h4>

<figure></figure>

<p>On one level, always being prepared means having the tools and resources you'll need to survive at the ready. But more accurately, it means developing habits that ensure you never get caught off guard.</p>
<p>For example, having enough dart ammo in your backpack or making sure your literjon of water is filled before heading out is easy enough to remember, but you also want to make sure you're not without survey probes. Surveying new areas is an absolute must because it'll clear away the fog from the new parts of the map you're exploring and give you a clear picture of how to travel safely.</p>
<p>If you don't know where the actual closest rock formation is to your current location, it's easy to get caught out in open sand for too long. And you do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> want to be caught in open sand for too long. That's a fast track to losing everything in the gullet of a sandworm.</p>
<p>This is also why your map is arguably your biggest support for everything you'll do in Dune: Awakening. Knowing where to go next so you're safely travelling across the planet is one thing, but another is the fact that your map will also show you where to gather resources you need to stay alive and craft the vehicles and devices you need to aid your survival. ABP means keeping your map up to date, your inventory stocked with essentials, and ensuring that you can handle whatever situations come your way.</p>
<h3>Store your vehicle(s)</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Take it from someone who has already gone through this experience. Store your vehicle, do not simply leave it next to your base in a shaded area, thinking that'll be enough to keep it safe from the elements on Arrakis. It isn't, and you'll return to your time away from the game with a bike that's wrecked beyond repair.</p>
<p>When you reach the point where you're crafting your first bike to drive across the sands, you'll also be able to craft a device that'll let you store your bike and redeploy it when you need to make those longer treks across Dune. You should consider this device now part of your permanent inventory, as it is a key piece of kit to have if you plan to do any kind of quick travelling between various points of interest on the planet.</p>
<h3>Build for mobility, not for settlements (at first)</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>When you first start building your own base, it's tempting to begin to design your dream home on Arrakis. There's already excellent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lcuvbl/first_base_ive_ever_been_proud_of_spent_so_long/">examples</a> on the<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lalsnm/people_here_are_posting_some_awesome_futuristic/"> Dune: Awakening Reddit page</a> of really impressive bases, in terms of design, and<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lcl2z7/who_needs_thopters_i_have_a_ramp/"> functionality</a>. These are not the kinds of bases you should look to grind out and build off the top.</p>
<p>In the same way you can store a vehicle, you can store a bases design - but not the base itself. That, you'll have to rebuild, using your construction tool as you move deeper into Arrakis and away from Hagga Basin.</p>
<p>You will reach a point where it is worth building a more <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-extensive-base-building-feature/">permanent settlement</a> that you'll return to time and again, but there's no point in trying to make your first base that permanent home. Not only will it make your attempts at keeping it with you as you move into Arrakis more difficult, since you'll almost certainly not be able to hold enough materials to build it all at once wherever you decide to put down your sub-fief, but abandoning your first base is in fact a mission objective in the early hours of the game.</p>
<p>So until it makes sense, don't get attached to your base. Oh, and as a side note for when you do build your permanent base, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l7tan4/example_immersive_build_without_ruining_pathing/">make sure you're not blocking anyone's path</a>. It's annoying enough to have to plan your travel across the sands around not being out in the open for too long. You don't want to add to that by being the person who build their base between two rock formations causing a route blockage for everyone else in your server.</p>
<h3>Keep the lights on in your base, or risk losing it</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Speaking of your base, you absolutely need to ensure it always has power. The generator you build for your base does more than just keep your fabricator or blood purifier working, it also generates a shield for your base to protect it from the elements on Arrakis. If you don't keep it powered up, you risk your base being picked apart by the elements - or worse, picked clean by other players raiding your stuff.</p>
<p>You'll be able to see how long your base can maintain power for, and if you don't have every machine in it crafting large-scale devices then the drain on its fuel won't be too dire at all. It's not a difficult thing to keep it powered, but it can be an easy thing to forget. And survival always seems to come down to not forgetting the little things.</p>
<h3>You won't win against a sandworm, a sandstorm, or the sun, so don't chance it</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are three elements of Arrakis that you simply won't win against and should not take your chances on. Sandworms, sandstorms, and the sun.</p>
<p>The sandworms are a pretty obvious one. They're huge, will swallow you and everything you have on you whole, and are to be avoided at all times. Shai-Hulud is respected and worshipped for a reason, and as far as we know, Funcom has no plans to add a skill-tree where the end goal is gaining the powers of Atreides descendant <a href="https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Sheeana_Brugh">Sheeana</a>. Make sure you have an escape plan, whether that's heading to the nearest rock formation, or flying out of there with an orinthopter, when sandworms are close by.</p>
<p>Sandstorms on Arrakis are to be feared just as much, and you'll need to ensure you have a way of taking shelter should you hear the warning that one is headed towards your area. Once the warnings begin, every moment spent out in the open to gather more resources or make it to your next destination is done at your own peril.</p>
<p>Lastly, the sun is the third part of this trifecta of terror that you need to always be aware of when travelling the sands of Arrakis. It will boil you faster than you think, dehydrate you faster, and slowly tick down your health if you're caught out in it for too long. This is why you should always travel at night, especially in the early hours of the game when you're working your way up to building your first bike. You travel, build, basically do anything, at your own peril in the heat of the Arrakis sun.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-has-been-sold-to-an-undisclosed-buyer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/">Nexus Mods</a>, likely the biggest and most popular repository for game mods that PC players have relied on for more than two decades, has been sold, the previous owner and creator, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed">Dark0ne, announced</a>.</p>
<p>Dark0ne ran the site for 24 years and made the decision to sell and step back from the day-to-day operations of the website after it took too much of a personal toll on them.</p>
<p>"<em>The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll,</em>"&nbsp;Dark0ne wrote in their blog post announcing the sale.</p>
<p>"<em>The stress of the job has been a regular source of anxiety and stress-related health issues. I realised that I have been burning out and this started to have an impact on my staff and Nexus Mods as a whole</em>."</p>
<p>While Dark0ne doesn't disclose who the new owner of the website is, they do make it clear that they are confident that the site is being passed into good hands.</p>
<p>"<em>One of the biggest reasons I've been doing this for so long is that I've never felt that I truly found someone who really "gets" the modding community the way I do. Finding a new owner who would be able to understand and respect the myriad intricacies of both Nexus Mods as a business and the wider modding community was essential.</em></p>
<p><em>After months of meetings, face-to-face talks, and a whole lot of soul searching, I am thrilled to say that I truly believe I have found the exact right people for the task.</em></p>
<p><em>So yes, the ownership of Nexus Mods has changed hands, but I want to be clear, this isn’t some corporate “exit” or a backroom deal. This is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself.</em>"</p>
<p>Dark0ne continues to say that on the player and modder side of things, there won't really be any changes, and that the biggest change is simply the ownership, and the fact that Dark0ne won't be the person who has to sign-off on everything happening with the website.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-has-crossed-the-10-billion-downloads-milestone/">Nexus Mods crossed 10 billion mod downloads</a> in its lifetime. An impressive feat, and a solid one for Dark0ne to leave on at the end of their tenure. It'll be interesting to see who is taking over the site, if/when the new ownership is disclosed. So many players around the world rely on Nexus Mods. For their sake, and the sake of the PC modding community, hopefully this new era for the site is even better than the last.</p>

It's not too surprising how many of them are references to previous Souls games, but some of the deeper cuts are certainly interesting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERbnwDLgao" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Souls YouTuber BonfireVN put together</a> a side-by-side comparison of Elden Ring Nightreign's Dark Souls skins with their origins in their respective Souls games. These skins unlock once you've cleared the final boss of Elden Ring Nightreign, and offer some big visual shake-ups for the various Nightfarers of the realm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These "throwback" skins are callbacks to various pieces of Dark Souls history, mostly through NPCs and armor sets seen throughout the games. It's a nice bit of nostalgia, and also a way to commemorate how Elden Ring carries the Souls torch forward. Some of the choices and details are fairly interesting to dig into, though, as BonfireVN shows.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Guardian's Solaire outfit, dubbed the Sunlight Knight Outfit, is a fairly obvious reference to everyone's favorite Dark Souls 1 NPC. The Catarina Outfit for the Raider is a similarly clear reference, to Siegmeyer of Catarina.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in sets like the Duchess' Wraith Outfit, you can see the evolution of the Darkwraith design over the course of Souls, and how the set evolved from its first appearance to Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others, like the Ironeyes' Sellsword duds, are surprising references to characters like Chancellor Wellager in Dark Souls 2. While it's not surprising to see firekeeper outfits, or characters like Solaire or Artorias, it's nice to see some deeper cuts. The Recluse's Heretic Sorcerer Outfit calling back to Dark Witch Karla may not even be obvious at first glance, but it's fun to see.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, the detail FromSoftware has put on these armor sets is impressive, especially side-by-side with previous Souls games.

Other fans responding to the post have reported similar issues, and an IGN staff member has had the same experience happen to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reddit post, by user ThatOtaku26, claims their save file had more than 1,000 hours of gameplay and over two decades of beloved Pokémon, brought over from generations of previous Pokémon titles stretching back to Pokémon Leaf Green and Pokémon Diamond, on the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For Pokémon fans, this is why their save files are so precious — as some players bring over creatures they have already been playing with in multiple previous games, some released years ago. At the same time, Pokémon games on Nintendo Switch are some of just a handful of titles not compatible with the console's in-built cloud save functionality (available if you subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online). Indeed, Switch games Pokémon: Let's Go Eevee and Pikachu, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Pokémon Sword and Shield, plus Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are all unsupported.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the Pokémon franchise does have its own cloud save offering, the Pokémon Home app, which comes with its own subscription plan that kicks in if you want to store more than 30 creatures. And it's this app that fans are now recommending to anyone wanting to continue their Pokémon save files on Switch 2, just to make sure their virtual creatures survive the move to Nintendo's new console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I just got a switch 2, did the startup and initial data transfer with no issues," ThatOtaku26 wrote. "My Scarlet save file is gone. It loads straight into the language selection and create a character screens. No data on my OLED. Just all gone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"THERE WAS NO ERROR IN DATA TRANSFER AT ALL," they continued. "IT WENT FINE. ALL MY OTHER POKEMON DATA IS STILL THERE, BUT NOT SCARLET. I had mons from my original GBA up to current on there. Literally 20 years worth of data. There's nothing I can do. I don't even know if i wanna play anymore."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet DLC Nintendo Direct Trailer</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans comiserated with the player, and said they had experienced similar issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This same exact thing happened to me when I was transferring from my original Switch to the OLED," wrote Grouchy-Cress-215. "Tears were shed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The same thing happed to me but literally all my saved data isn't there anymore like BOTW, TOTK, MK8, Pokémon Sword and Shield, Scarlet and Violet, and so on," added Existing-Possible550. "I literally have to play everything from the start."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many fans said the situation, however rare, meant that backing up beloved creatures to Pokémon Home was a necessity, just to be on the safe side.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm afraid of this happening to me so everything I have is going in Home before I do the switch," wrote Mexican_Chef4307.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If I get Switch 2 in the future, I will first transfer all my Pokémon to Home before data transferring," added TheJannikku. "I can't imagine how I would if that happened to me."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not all fans were as compassionate, however. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ngl the fact that you didn't transfer all of your important Pokémon to Home first is on you," wrote IAmTheWire. "We've known that this is the only way to preserve your Pokémon for sure in this kind of circumstance or if your old Switch broke, otherwise they’d be gone forever. I'd have done it just to be safe if nothing else since it's so obvious and easy to transfer them back if something was to go wrong."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch 2 released earlier this month and shifted 3.5 million consoles over its first four days on sale. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-outselling-the-og-switch-2-to-1-across-the-globe">Switch 2's launch sales have outsold the launch of the original Switch by two to one</a> — though Nintendo's previous console suffered at launch from hardware shortages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>Massive modding site Nexus Mods have announced a change in ownership, with founder Robin 'Dark0ne' Scott set to step back. As to who the new owners are, a couple of first names and modding profiles have been provided, as well as an assertion that these new overlords understand what makes Nexus Mods tick.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-on-paid-mods">Scott</a> - who founded the site as the Elder Scrolls-focused TES Nexus in 2001, and has owned it via his company Black Tree Gaming since 2007 - announced the news via <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301">a post</a> on Nexus Mods.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll," Scott wrote, "The stress of the job has been a regular source of anxiety and stress-related health issues. I realised that I have been burning out and this started to have an impact on my staff and Nexus Mods as a whole. </p>
<p>"So, I firmly believe that the best thing for the future of Nexus Mods is for me to step aside and bring in new leadership to steer the business forward with renewed energy to make Nexus Mods the modding community we all truly deserve."</p>
<p>Following "months of meetings, face-to-face talks, and a whole lot of soul searching", he believes he's found new ownership that will "understand and respect the myriad intricacies of both Nexus Mods as a business and the wider modding community".</p>
<p>Scott added: "I want to be clear, this isn’t some corporate “exit” or a backroom deal. This is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself."</p>
<p>So, who's taking over Nexus Mods? Well, further on in the post, Scott introduces folks called Victor and Marinus, linking to their Nexus Mods profiles under the handles <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Foledinho">Foledinho</a> and <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/rapsak">Rapsak</a>, and revealing that they've "come on board to lead this next chapter".</p>
<p>"They’ve got deep roots in gaming, tech, and most importantly, they give a damn; about the site, the community, and the future we’re trying to build here," he wrote, later adding "they’re about long-term stability, not changing the values or direction of the platform."</p>
<p>Taking a look at the profiles of these two, whose full names haven't been provided, you can see that they've been given the same 'site owner' tag Scott's account currently boasts. "For the past decade, I’ve been building platforms in gaming and UGC," Foledinho's profile bio says, citing his goal with Nexus Mods as being to "help make modding easier, where games evolve through the hands of players."</p>
<p>Rapsak, meanwhile, "started producing music on a PlayStation at eight years old and eventually became a DJ, touring internationally and playing shows with music I’d made myself. 

"At the same time, I was diving deeper into tech, building PCs at 13, launching my first business at 15 (a DJ booking system), and writing code every chance I got," he goes on. Rapsak also notes that he only ever wears black T-shirts, which is "not a fashion thing, just one less decision to make in the morning." Ok then.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Nexus Mods for comment.</p>
<p>According to Scott, the ownership change shouldn't result in much of a change in terms of the day-to-day user experience on Nexus Mods in the near future, with its "team of 40 incredibly dedicated people, some of whom have been here for over nine years" still in place.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/16/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Alongside the earth-shattering appearance of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, there has come a bevy of new peripherals. Nintendo’s submissions have included the new Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, alongside a brand new iteration of their Pro Controller, for those that think sticking two Joy-Con into a hand grip is beneath them. Or maybe, they just want to play multiplayer?</p>
<p>The first thing that hits you about the Switch 2 Pro Controller – henceforth the Pro Controller 2 – is the quality of the soft touch plastics Nintendo have used. The surface feels genuinely lovely, perfectly smooth and supple under your palms and a match for the feel of the Switch 2 and Joy-Con 2 themselves. The downside of that is that there are no textured sections or grips, so there’s a higher chance if your hands are of the sweatier persuasion that they’re going to start sliding about. Personally, I’ve had no problems through a heap of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/fast-fusion-review/">Fast Fusion</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/cyberpunk-2077-switch-2-review-ps4-xbox-comparison/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, but, well, you know your own hands.</p>



<p>The Pro Controller 2 is relatively plain, with black used through the main body, with a light grey panel across the top for the shoulder buttons and beneath the sticks. I don’t really like the two-tone look, if I’m honest, but when you’re playing you can’t see the white section at all, so I guess it doesn’t matter all that much.</p>
<p>The Pro Controller 2, like its predecessor, is here to make your Switch 2 gameplay feel a bit more familiar, aping the Xbox controller’s layout and giving you an experience that is closer to the other console manufacturers. Ergonomically, it’s similar to the original Switch Pro Controller, and I still think that’s amongst the most comfortable controllers out there, so we’ll take that as a win.</p>


<p>The Pro Controller 2 is ever-so-slightly less wide, though, and 15g lighter at 235g, making it just that little bit easier to live with through longer gaming sessions. It still has enough weight not to feel like a throwaway toy, but if you like a chunkier feeling controller, this might not be the way you wanted Nintendo to go.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that the new Joy-Con 2 and their included grip don’t feel good – they do – but there’s still the uncanny sense that something is slightly amiss and the dimensions might not meet what your hands want, or a little too cramped for larger hands.. The Pro Controller 2 completely remedies that, purely based on ergonomics, and if you’re planning on spending a lot of time with your Switch 2 docked, it takes a step towards essential.</p>

<p>The major improvements that the Pro Controller 2 has over its predecessor are a 3.5mm audio jack socket for attaching your wired headphones to, enhanced HD Rumble 2 and the addition of two ‘pro’ back buttons underneath each grip, labelled GL and GR. The audio out is a massive boon, and it was a major omission the first time around. The ease of attaching any wired headset shouldn’t be underestimated, and the audio being piped through sounds spot on.</p>
<p>On top of that, the improved rumble is much more powerful than that of the original Pro Controller, which I thought was interesting given the reduced weight. As <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review/">Welcome Tour</a> teaches you, it’s not all about how much things weigh, with the HD Rumble 2 altering the way the weight moves in order to create both more powerful and more nuanced feedback. I think the DualSense’s haptics are better than those in the Pro Controller 2, but this isn’t too far off.</p>

<p>The GL and GR buttons are also hugely welcome. They’re placed well beneath your fingertips, just out of a position where you would accidentally catch them, but easily pressed when you want them thanks to the generous proportions.</p>
<p>Even better, the programming for them is baked into the Switch 2’s UI, and you can clone pretty much any of the regular inputs. That’s been great for Cyberpunk 2077, moving the reload function to allow my fingers to stay on the analogue sticks. I’m not sure it helped all that nuch with my aim, but I think that’s more the game’s fault than mine.</p>

<p>Those analogue sticks feel great too, with smooth, frictionless motion, and a nicely weighted spring back to centre. Now, it is obviously disappointing that Nintendo haven’t opted for Hall Effect/TMR sticks, especially when they had serious problems with stick drift through the last generation, but only time will tell just how robust Nintendo’s manufacturing is. Right now the sticks feel great with a very smooth feeling action. Two years down the line? It’s hard to say, but when you’re paying £75 for a controller, you want to be certain that it’s going to last and Nintendo haven’t put the question to bed.</p>
<p>The other input buttons are responsive and comfortable in use, membrane buttons through the main face buttons, D-pad, shoulder pads and triggers. The shoulder buttons activate all the way along their length, and the triggers are quick while their wide surface makes them incredibly comfortable to use.</p>
<p>I do get to air my massive gripe here though – why don’t Nintendo like analogue triggers? They’re basically saying that they don’t want serious racing games on their platform, and when you’ve got a system that’s capable of handling realistic ports alongside Xbox and PlayStation, I think it’s a real misstep. Amusingly, they have set themselves up as a great place for FPS though, from the digital triggers on the Pro Controller to the Switch 2’s new mouse functionality, so I guess it’s a one step forward, one step back kind of thing.</p>
<p>Nintendo have tweaked things elsewhere with the Pro Controller 2. The face buttons are slightly larger, so they’re easier to activate, and they’ve raised the + and – buttons to make them easier to find without looking. I do not like how they feel though, as they stand a bit too proud from the controller for my liking, but then they’re better than on the original Pro Controller. Somewhere in between would have been the sweet spot, but I guess that will come with the Switch 3 in 2032.</p>

<p>Other than that, there’s the new Chat button, right in the bottom centre of the faceplate. This is actually a great little innovation from Nintendo, putting chat and communication front and centre for once, and with the added GameShare possibilities that let people easily play multiplayer from one copy of the game, I think that this is quietly the Nintendo Switch 2’s best feature (not including a working eShop).</p>
<p>Nintendo have once again priced the Pro Controller 2 at the top end of what I’d expect to pay for a console’s ‘standard’ controller, now coming in at £75 compared to the last generation’s pricing of £60. That’s going to be pretty rich for a lot of people, but it is definitely a very nice rendition of the Nintendo Pro Controller style, with the added benefit of audio out, onboard Chat button, and the easily remapped grip inputs. However, I really wanted to see Hall Effect sticks – or similar – and when Gamesir are putting out great options like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review/">Super Nova</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">Cyclone 2</a>, I think Nintendo have missed an opportunity to put their controller at the top of the tier list.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the original Pro Controller, and original Joy-Cons for that matter, all work with the Switch 2, and many third party controllers are getting firmware updates for compatibility as well. With Nintendo’s older controllers you’ll be missing out on the new bells and whistles – frankly, the 3.5mm output is enough for me to make the jump – and it’s always a bit fussy pairing third party controllers, but if you’ve spent all your money on a new console, and you’ve got some of the older peripherals lying around, there’s definitely less rush to upgrade than there might have been before.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/misc-a-tiny-tale-looks-super-smooth-on-switch-2-thanks-to-a-dev-hunch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We have been following development on the cosy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>-style adventure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/misc_a_tiny_tale">Misc. A Tiny Tale</a> since way back in 2021. The game is set to arrive on Switch on <strong>22nd July</strong> and, through the magic of backwards compatibility, you'll also be able to play it on Switch 2 with better resolution, frame rates and more responsive gameplay. That all comes despite it being in development for years. Why? Because developer Tinyware Games had a hunch about what Switch 2 would be capable of.</p>
<p>The new gameplay comparison (above) showcases the performance improvements in action, but they were only made possible after the team took a punt on Switch 2's upscaling features long before anything was confirmed.</p>
<p>That is according to Tinyware founder and Misc. lead developer Michael Pearce, who recently told us that the team "had a theory before the Nintendo Switch 2 was even revealed, that it may play backwards compatible Nintendo Switch games at a better and more stable resolution and frame rate, especially the games which had no cap put on their rendering". With this in mind, the team "purposely made our resolution on the Nintendo Switch version dynamic, letting it scale up for this theoretical new system," and it did the same thing to the frame rate, "uncapping it to give it room for a max of 60 FPS, which is more than the S1 could theoretically handle".</p>
<p>Like so many studios, Tinyware was not given access to a Switch 2 dev-kit before launch, so it had to wait until it could borrow a system to see if the gamble had paid off. And pay off it did. "The resolution had jumped from (in some cases) 480p at 30fps in handheld mode on Nintendo Switch, to 1080p at 60fps on the Nintendo Switch 2," Pearce told us. There were a bunch of other improvements too: "load times are much faster on the Nintendo Switch 2 system," he continued, "Texture pop in is practically absent, button presses are more responsive, and the overall experience is simply smoother and better".</p>
<p>According to Pearce, Switch 2 "runs the game like a dream". Of course, this isn't to the detriment of the Switch 1 version — "We’re really proud of the performance we’ve achieved over the last few years making the game for the Nintendo Switch," he clarified — but the Switch 2 improvements are apparently "really special".</p>
<p>Gosh, it sounds like quite a risk, but at least it paid off, eh! Misc. A Tiny Tale will arrive on Switch and Switch 2 (via backwards compatibility) on 22nd July.</p>

Chances are you’ve been forced out of every major city in Cyrodiil by overzealous guards who see your fangs and red eyes and want to slaughter your vampire butt, right? Well, if that’s the case, where else can you hide? The Vile Lair, with its Dark Brotherhood-esque decorations and monuments to Sithis, feels like an extension of the assassin’s guild, but it’s definitely designed with creatures of the night in mind.

Whichever path you take, it’s quite the trek through Blackwood to uncover this hidden den of infamy.</p><p>You’ll find the Vile Lair southeast of Leyawiin, at the southernmost tip of Blackwood. There, you’ll note a small island connected via a thin strip on the map, and that’s your destination.</p><p>Upon arrival, however, you’ll find nothing more than a burnt out town, slaughtered by unknown forces, some of it still smoking. If you dig through the wreckage, you’ll find a few chests with basic random loot spawns. But look to the south to the crumbling stone structures: That’s your target. Dive into the water, then swim down to where the stone meets the slope leading to deeper water. You’ll find a large tree trunk, open on one end, leading to a hidden door.</p><figure id="" data-id="be53a9778e36ae4661deef20a58fbb4c" data-recommend-id="image://be53a9778e36ae4661deef20a58fbb4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The secret underwater entrance to the Vile Lair in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The secret underwater entrance to the Vile Lair in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="be53a9778e36ae4661deef20a58fbb4c" data-recommend-id="image://be53a9778e36ae4661deef20a58fbb4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The secret underwater entrance to the Vile Lair in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s murky down there, but I promise, the door’s there.

When a fan asked him on social media about a possible $80 price tag on <em>Borderlands 4</em>, he infamously replied: “If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen.” This went over poorly with the internet. A few days later he said he didn’t mean to sound like an asshole. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855">A week later, he posted a 573-word tweet</a></span> apologizing and explaining that he just meant that <em>Borderlands 4</em> would be  fine even with the higher price tag, and that he didn’t intend to set off a firestorm of controversy and discourse. </p><p>That brings us to today, where 2K has finally confirmed that <em>Borderlands 4</em> is only $70. After all that hoopla and online drama, it turns out the game is going to cost what nearly every other AAA video game in 2025 costs: $70, plus tax. Was any of that worth it in the end? Not really. But hey, at least <em>Borderlands 4</em> isn’t going to hold the game hostage and force you to pay a ransom fee to play a few days early. That’s nice! </p><p><em>Borderlands 4 </em>launches (for everyone, at the same time) September 12 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC. </p><p>&nbsp;.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whenever a new game comes out, be it big like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> or small like <em>Blue Prince</em>, mods quickly become available on Nexus for everything from helping with inventory management to enhancing visuals. It’s been a cornerstone of PC gaming for many players for decades now, though Dark0ne suggested nothing much will change in the day-to-day now that he’s no longer running it. </p><p>“I started this project back in 2001, in my bedroom, with a 56k modem, an excitement for the upcoming release of <em>Morrowind</em> and with no grand ambitions or intentions,” he wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in an update on the Nexus Mods website</a></span>. “I didn’t set out to build a business, I just wanted to make a place where modders could share their work without worrying it would vanish into the internet either [<em>sic</em>] the next time a fansite went offline or a publisher decided they were done with it. That idea grew legs, sprouted arms, and turned into Nexus Mods.”<br></p><p>Dark0ne said he’s been looking for someone else to take over management of Nexus Mods for a while now due to all the stress of running a small online social network, but it wasn’t until recently that he found someone to take over who “really ‘gets’ the modding community the way I do.” He didn’t reveal who that someone is, though, or the price tag for the deal. Is Nexus Mods about to get way worse? Some users are already freaking out about paid subscriptions coming. Dark0ne claims not much will change in the immediate future, though. <br></p><p>“Behind the scenes, I’ve already been stepping back bit by bit,” he wrote. “Over the past few years, the team has taken on more of the weight and the site’s been doing better than ever. What’s changing now is simply the formality of it, making sure the right people are in place to guide Nexus Mods into the next era. That includes some structural updates to the company ownership that we aren’t shouting about, but I want to be transparent: they’re about long-term stability, not changing the values or direction of the platform. Nexus Mods is community-first and mod-author focused, that’s not up for negotiation.”</p><p>Some shifts have already been underway at Nexus Mods, which is run by a team of 40 people. A big one was moving to ease rules on modders <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13501488-publisher-approved-paid-modding-policy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13501488-publisher-approved-paid-modding-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting paid for their work</a></span>. Some modders now link to Patreons and other places where people can donate to them directly for ongoing updates to certain popular mods in games like <em>Starfield</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em>. Nexus Mods community managers said at the time that the goal was to find a way to balance compensation incentives with the desire to keep the modding scene free and open, even as companies like Bethesda try to monetize creator work in their games. </p><p>Nexus Mods has also recently taken stands again bigotry. The site refused to host a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nexus-mods-starfield-pronouns-removal-deleted-why-woke-1850843599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nexus-mods-starfield-pronouns-removal-deleted-why-woke-1850843599"><em>Starfield </em>mod back in 2023</a></span> that deleted pronoun options from the game. Nexus Mods told <em>404 Media </em>at the time that it wasn’t meant as a political statement, but as a way to protect its users. “[The] removal of diversity, while appealing to many, does not promote a positive modding community,” they said. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

These new additions to the roster won't be free, however, as they'll be added to the game through the $130 Super Deluxe Edition. Gearbox has not yet revealed if they'll be available as standalone purchases, but it's likely that the new Story Packs or an upgrade can be purchased for the Standard or Deluxe Edition of Borderlands 4.</p><p>In addition to the new Story Packs adding more Vault Hunters, these will also throw in an entirely new region of Kairos with extended narrative content, <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/pre-order/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gearbox said in a blog post</a>. Additional storylines and side missions will be included alongside various cosmetics and Bounty Packs that will feature "more tightly focused content" for players.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official 18 Minute Gameplay Deep Dive Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Each Bounty Pack will feature a new area with fresh missions alongside a unique boss fight, loot, a new type of personalized Digirunner vehicle, and a Vault Card with its own set of rewards for completing certain challenges. Bounty Packs will be included in the Deluxe and Super Deluxe Editions of the game.</p><p>The previous mainline Borderlands games have had four post-launch expansions. The first Borderlands game introduced fan-favorite character Moxxi in the Underdome Riot expansion, Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep from Borderlands 2 was critically acclaimed, and Borderlands 3 brought back everyone's favorite villain Handsome Jack--kind of--for a heist story.</p><p>Paywalling new Vault Hunters behind post-launch content isn't unusual either for the series, as characters like Gaige, Krieg, Handsome Jack's doppelganger Timothy, and Aurelia were all available as DLC or as preorder bonuses. The only exception to the rule is Borderlands 3, as all four playable Vault Hunters were available at launch and no additional characters were introduced as post-launch DLC.</p><p>Borderlands 3 also had a lot of free DLC added to it over the years, with one of the more notable examples being a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-science-a-puzzle-game-with-real-world-/1100-6475772/">block-shifting puzzle game</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/millions-of-borderlands-players-have-been-recognized-for-their-contributions-to-science/1100-6522765/">helped real-world scientists organize data</a>. Millions of players took part in this project, and they were officially recognized as scientific contributors for their help. Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Switch 2</a>, and ahead of its arrival, Gearbox has been sharing a few more details on the game.</p><p>We've already seen some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-will-feature-substantial-changes-for-co-op-players/1100-6531451/">big co-op changes that Gearbox has been working on</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/">more details on the new Vault Hunters have been revealed</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-loot-system-offers-more-variety-than-ever-before/1100-6531246/">loot system has also been overhauled</a>.</p>

                <p>2K Games has officially announced the price point for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a>, and it's not $80. In a <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/pre-order/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the publisher confirmed that preorders are now available, and the game's standard edition is $70.</p><p>Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal, but with Mario Kart World going for $80 and The Outer Worlds launching later this year at $80, many are wondering how many other games will follow suit. The pricing discussion for Borderlands 4 was further elevated by Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford, who controversially said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-says-he-didnt-mean-to-trigger-people-with-comments-on-the-price/1100-6531910/" data-ref-id="1100-6531910">"real fans" would find a way to pay $80 for the game</a> if it ended up costing that much.</p><p>Although Borderlands 4's standard edition is priced at $70, Gearbox is offering other options that cost more. There is a $100 deluxe edition that comes with various extras, while a $130 Super Deluxe edition has even more. A $150 Collector's Edition is also on the way, and it doesn't include a copy of the game.</p><p>Beyond the various editions of Borderlands 4, Gearbox is inviting people to pay even more on the game's post-launch content. Borderlands 4 is getting two Story Packs (included with the Super Deluxe edition), and each adds a new vault hunter, a new region of the game world to explore, more missions, and additional loot. There are also four Bounty Packs coming after launch, adding new areas with more missions and a "unique" boss fights. Pricing for these packs outside the game's premium editions was not disclosed, but be sure to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-post-launch-plans-include-new-vault-hunters-but-they-wont-be-free/1100-6532453/" data-ref-id="1100-6532453">read up on all the Borderlands 4 post-launch DLC information.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-price-is-a-mystery-even-to-randy-pitchford/1100-6531437/" data-ref-id="1100-6531437">Speaking at PAX East</a>, Pitchford said it's a "gnarly" time in the video game industry when it comes to economics.</p><p>"On one level, we've got a competitive marketplace where people who make [pricing] choices want to sell as many units as possible and they want to be careful about people that are price-sensitive," he said. "So there are some folks who don't want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are. There are other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing and there are tariffs for the retail packaging."</p><p>Borderlands 4 has "more than twice" the development budget of Borderlands 3, Pitchford said, adding that he hopes the game sells as many copies as possible so Gearbox can reinvest those funds into future products.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="712655663"

So with <em>Mario Kart World </em>kicking off the Switch 2’s launch this month, why not see if we can end a few more by trying to rank these games from worst to best?</p><p>The series has evolved over the years, from a simple racer based on the Mushroom Kingdom to a motorized <em>Smash Bros.,</em> drawing in racers and tracks from across the Nintendo universe. And as it’s got older it’s got bigger, going from a mere karting game to something that let us drive quads, bikes, hovercars and even two-seat mobile weapons platforms, and now to a full open world.</p><p>As is often the case with Pecking Orders, the idea here isn’t <em>really </em>to rank these games from worst to best, because even the ones down the bottom of the list are still loads of fun. It’s to pit these classics against one another, to not just see which one comes out on top, but <em>why</em>.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-super-circuit-yoshi-bowser-mario-peach-luigi-1850155523&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-super-circuit-yoshi-bowser-mario-peach-luigi-1850155523"><em>Mario Kart</em> Fans Aghast To Learn About Secret Points That Tilt The Scales</a></span></p><p>Note that we’ve excluded the arcade games on two grounds: one, that loads of us (and you) haven’t played them, and two, because so much of their content, from tracks to sound effects, is recycled content from mainline games (in a more literal way than newer console games including older tracks).</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-recommend-id="image://xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="787" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-recommend-id="image://xs5r8ettwsk9tetcn8ay" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="787" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We’ve got to start somewhere, and this is easiest place. Concessions had to be made to make the game work on mobile in an <em>economic</em> sense, we get that. You can’t release a phone game in the last decade without tying it to some kind of bizarre money-making scheme.</p><p>But the game itself could have been so much better. Emulation of classic Nintendo games is at the point where many people could play <em>Double Dash</em> on their phones if they wanted to, so to offer up such a compromised version of the series as an official release is a crushing disappointment.</p><p>By the standards of 2019 mobile game releases, it’s fine? But by the standards set by the rest of this series, <em>Mario Kart Tour</em> is a comfortable last-place finish, no red shell required.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-recommend-id="image://wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-format="png" data-width="960" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-recommend-id="image://wwmcarpuaxvoc3nbr5kf" data-format="png" data-width="960" data-height="640" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s many people’s least favourite (at least proper) <em>Mario Kart</em> game because it’s both so old and there’s so little to recommend it. The original has the purity of its vision and nostalgia to play on, while later games are just, well, better. <em>Super Circuit</em>, caught between the original’s pioneering release and releasing long after the series’ 3D debut, is trapped and a little lost, at least when we’re looking back on the series as a whole from our contemporary vantage point.</p><p>Know what’s really cool about it though? The original’s visuals haven’t aged that great, but <em>Super Circuit’s</em> cheery pixel art is one of the Game Boy Advance’s most underrated achievements. Everything is just so damn colourful and cute and pretty in the same way so many first-party SNES and GBA platformers were, only here it’s moving real real fast as well.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-recommend-id="image://h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-format="jpg" data-width="2050" data-height="1153" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-recommend-id="image://h72wtx6835zcdozzbfbr" data-format="jpg" data-width="2050" data-height="1153" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This game was so damn popular! It sold <em>37 million </em>copies! And you’d think, from the size of it to the funky motion controls, that it’d be higher up on this list. But again, like <em>Super Circuit</em>, <em>Wii </em>gets a little lost in the passage of time, as there’s very little reason to play this when <em>Mario Kart 7</em>, and then <em>8</em>, came along and did everything it did but so much better.</p><p>Not helping it here is that, despite the game being perfectly positioned to cash in on the Wii’s motion control hype with its iconic plastic steering wheel, the game’s motion controls—the one defining feature of the game that anyone remembers—were actually straight garbage.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-recommend-id="image://xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-recommend-id="image://xapmwlsegi2zpnlmig0r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In many ways the most limited mainline <em>Mario Kart</em> game, this could have been down the bottom of this list after all these years, as subsequent games have some along and slowly improved and built upon the foundations it laid.</p><p>But man, there’s still so much to love, and respect. While its lack of 3D terrain is a little jarring in this post-Nintendo 64 world, the slippery, slidey cornering might still be the best in the series, from its exaggerated reach to the way the entire camera is wrenched around to accommodate it.</p><p>It’s not the fastest, smartest of even the most fun <em>Mario Kart</em> game, not by a long stretch, but it’s somehow still the most kart-y game of the lot. And being the instigator of the entire series, in many ways the purest expression of the original vision, it felt wrong putting it any lower.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-recommend-id="image://fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-recommend-id="image://fmwjduge5mhmwp3slokt" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is going to start harsh for a game that’s a lot of people’s sentimental fave, but time has not been kind to this game. Where once it was a pioneer of 3D multiplayer gaming, now it just looks like shit and has a surprisingly high number of empty, boring tracks. </p><p>As we’re going to find as we get further into this list, though, even the weakest <em>Mario Kart</em> games (by 21st century standards, anyway) can often be saved by moments of inspirational course design, and while like I’ve just said many of <em>Mario Kart 64's</em> are a snooze fest, when it shines—like Toad’s Turnpike—it <em>shines</em>. </p><p>Also, this is the game that introduced the blue shell. We weren’t sure whether to praise or punish the game for that, so in very un-blue shell fashion it ends up dropping it in the middle of the pack.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-recommend-id="image://it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-format="jpg" data-width="917" data-height="517" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-recommend-id="image://it0jmzlf9wpxdbqqreqe" data-format="jpg" data-width="917" data-height="517" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s a pattern emerging here, born of the series taking relatively few major advances over the years: this is yet another entry that was ridiculously popular, and another where there isn’t much reason to play it today, coming as it did between everyone’s childhood favourites and the more expansive offerings on the Wii U and Switch.</p><p>But can we just take a step back and appreciate its online play? This was a DS game, from 2005, made by Nintendo, and to play it online was both a breeze and an absolute joy.<br></p><p><em>Mario Kart DS</em> was the first game in the series to open us up to a whole world, quite literally, of <em>Mario Kart</em> in a way that not even some more recent home console titles have managed.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-recommend-id="image://mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-recommend-id="image://mcjyhi0yxx7qcj4emq90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Can we just start this one by saying that more <em>Mario Karts</em> (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-vr-looks-nuts-1796865368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-vr-looks-nuts-1796865368">outside of VR experiences</a></span>) need first-person racing? This game had it, and it sucks that more don’t!</p><p>Anyway, <em>Mario Kart 7</em> had a lot more to offer than just that gimmick. <em>Mario Kart 7 </em>made some big innovations for a handheld game, most importantly in the way players were now able to drastically customise their cars, and also how you could drive underwater.</p><p>The game is often criticised for leaning a little heavily on the rest of the <em>Mario Kart</em> formula (as if every game barring <em>64</em> hasn’t done the same thing), but that was always a little unfair, coming as it did on a handheld system whose primary innovation—3D visuals—could never really be taken advantage of in a way that could have fundamentally changed the <em>Mario Kart experience</em>.</p><p>Indeed, for a game that at the time felt a little derivative, its introductions ultimately paved the way for a lot of the stuff that <em>Mario Kart 8</em>—which you’ll note we haven’t got to yet—does so well.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-recommend-id="image://bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="999" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-recommend-id="image://bagtpxefy4po0zicvlyq" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="999" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Wait, what?

It’s up here for two reasons.</p><p>Firstly, the two-player thing was great, and it’s a shame it hasn’t returned (outside of an arcade cameo) since, even as a secondary mode. Having one player concentrate on driving while the other handled the timing and direction of weapons might not have been ideal in every multiplayer circumstance, but when it did—whether your partner was less skilled than you or just wasted—it was glorious.</p><p>And secondly, as you’d expect from a game coming out on the GameCube, <em>Double Dash’s</em> course design is some of the wackiest—and thus best—of the series. From Baby Park through to DK Mountain, it’s not until you cycle through some of these tracks again in later <em>Mario Karts</em> that you realise so many of the absolute classics are from this one release.</p><p>But its GameCube-ness extends beyond just the course design (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9D3DC6664BCC050F&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9D3DC6664BCC050F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and its killer soundtrack!</a></span>).

But as the game gets bigger, with more players and entire modes that feel like they are meant to showcase the multi-track-spanning open world at the expense of more condensed races on bespoke tracks, playing the game requires you to get past some growing pains. It’s more experimental than it might seem at a glance, and for that, it deserves its flowers for injecting some really cool ideas into a 30-year-old franchise.</p><p>With 24-player races that let you ride on just about any surface you can reasonably get your wheels on, <em>World </em>is the most chaotic <em>Mario Kart </em>has ever been. This means there are plenty of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-clips-stunts-rewind-wall-1851783907&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-clips-stunts-rewind-wall-1851783907">incredible plays and happy accidents</a></span>, but also a fair share of upsets that make the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-shortcut-lakitu-free-roam-unlock-1851784321&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-shortcut-lakitu-free-roam-unlock-1851784321">feel lopsided and unfair</a></span>. There are so many players on the track at once that you can spend several minutes of a race doing alright, just driving along your designated path, then suddenly face an onslaught of item-based attacks that will send you back a dozen places in the blink of an eye.</p><p>This all then needs to be weighed against the new inclusion of a vast, open world, around which you can freely drive, finding bonus items, mini-missions, hidden secrets, and so many coins. It’s the biggest shake-up the <em>Mario Kart </em>series<em> </em>has seen in decades, but time will tell if it sticks as a favorite racing game.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-recommend-id="image://pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-recommend-id="image://pt8ibrl2rcpok7pvljqw" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Can you believe <em>Mario Kart 8</em> came out nearly a decade ago? That’s a mighty long and uninterrupted reign for a <em>Mario Kar</em>t game when you look at the release timeframe of so many of the games before this, but really, Nintendo hasn’t had to replace it, and might not need to for a while yet. An upgraded version on the Switch and some DLC has been enough to keep this one of the finest ever games, <em>Mario Kart</em> or otherwise. </p><p>And now, with all the sudden updates that have added a whopping 48 additional retro and unseen courses, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-4-dlc-birdo-yoshi-s-island-1850091298&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-4-dlc-birdo-yoshi-s-island-1850091298">alongside new characters like Birdo</a></span> (and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-five-new-characters-drivers-switch-nintendo-1850205794&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-five-new-characters-drivers-switch-nintendo-1850205794">five more mysterious additions to come</a></span>), the undying game has further cemented its spot as the number one <em>Mario Kart </em>ever. </p><p>Everything we’ve discussed previously on this list, from characters to courses, is done better here than anywhere else. It’s innovations are rare, but its perfections are everywhere, particularly in its course design, which features truly breathtaking moments as gravity is inverted, whole sections of track disappear and coins are turned into rupees.</p><p>Quite simply, if you want to play <em>Mario Kart</em>, online or solo, with traditional characters or newer introductions, classic tracks or modern masterpieces, this is the game to play.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The top three best-selling Switch 2 physical games sold during the first week in the US were Mario Kart World, Cyberpunk 2077, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Switch 2 Edition, according to Circana.

			<p>Borderlands 4, the next entry in the series launching later this year on PC and consoles, has become available for pre-order today, finally confirming the game's price.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/borderlandsr-4-now-available-for-pre-order-post-launch-content-to-include-story-missions-and-all-new-vault-hunters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> shared today, 2K and Gearbox Software confirmed the game's Standard Edition will launch in the United States for $69.99 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. For a few weeks, statements from Gearbox's Randy Pitchford <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-says-a-real-fan-will-find-a-way-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-if-that-ends-up-being-the-price/">suggested</a> the fourth entry in the series would be among the increasing number of games retailing at $80 at launch, but thankfully, that was not the case.</p>
<p>Besides confirming the price of the Borderlands 4 Standard Edition, 2K and Gearbox Software confirmed the details of the Deluxe Edition and the Super Deluxe Editions, which will retail for $99.99 and $129.99, respectively. The first will include the Bounty Pack Bundle featuring four separate post-launch DLC packs, each with distinct areas, new missions, and unique bosses; four Vault Cards with unique challenges and rewards; new gear and weapons; four new vehicles, and Vault Hunter cosmetics; and the Firehawk's Fury Weapon Skin. The second will include not only the Bounty Pack Bundle but also the Vault Hunter Pack featuring two new Story Packs, each featuring a new Vault Hunter, story, and side missions, two new map regions, new gear and weapons, more Vault Hunter cosmetics, and new ECHO-4 cosmetics.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on September 12th. The game will also be available at launch on the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud gaming service.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-mods-founder-steps-down-from-management-after-24-years.1219557/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nexus-mods-founder-robin-scott-steps-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Robin Scott, the founder of modding platform Nexus Mods, has announced he will be stepping down from his management role at the site after 24 years.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Scott says that he thinks the decision to step back from managing Nexus Mods is "in both [his] and the community's best interests". He says that the "strain" of responsibility for the "behemoth" he's created has "taken its toll".</p>

<p>According to Scott, running Nexus Mods for 24 years and having to be "on call" has caused "anxiety and stress-related health issues" for him, and that since he's been "burning out", it's best for him to "step aside and bring in new leadership".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nexus-mods-founder-stepping-down-front-page.jpg?itok=owbs5AIY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nexus-mods-founder-stepping-down-front-page.jpg?itok=Gagyq0q_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nexus Mods founder Robin Scott is stepping down after 24 years.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Scott, ownership of Nexus Mods has "changed hands", but he says the sale "isn't some corporate 'exit' or a backroom deal". He doesn't specify who exactly owns the site now, instead referring to "structural updates to the company ownership that we aren't shouting about".</p>

<p>Despite this, Scott says the changes are "about long-term stability, not changing the values or direction of the platform"; according to Scott, Nexus Mods will remain "community-first and mod-author-focused".</p>

<p>He says that from a user perspective, "not a lot" will be changing, and that behind the scenes, he was already beginning to reduce his involvement in the Nexus Mods platform. As such, the site will likely continue to run as it has done for the last few months.</p>

<p>As for Scott himself, he says he won't be "disappearing" from Nexus Mods altogether. He'll remain active on the site's Discord channel, and he'll also be "working with the team to help guide the overall direction" of Nexus Mods.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nexus-mods-founder-stepping-down-skyrim.jpg?itok=a-Oi3eT0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nexus-mods-founder-stepping-down-skyrim.jpg?itok=7rymQArt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nexus Mods plays host to mods for games like&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&nbsp;and many more.</figcaption></figure><p>Nexus Mods was founded by Scott back in 2001, at which point it was a fansite for&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</em>. Over time, it became a modding platform for that game, eventually expanding to encapsulate other games as well.</p>

<p>It hasn't been without controversy; Scott and Nexus Mods have found themselves in hot water numerous times over their decision to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nexus-bans-all-us-political-mods-going-forward" rel="nofollow">ban certain mods</a>, or, indeed, to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/nexus-mods-decides-to-allow-an-oblivion-remastered-mod-that-changes-body-type-options-to-male-female-declares-its-not-a-battleground-for-broader-cultural-or-political-debates/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">allow</a> certain mods. That's doubtless the kind of back-and-forth Scott wants to escape.</p>

<p>In any case, it's not clear how Nexus Mods will change in future, but one thing's for sure: it won't be changing under Scott's leadership. Stay tuned for more.</p>

        <p>Your firepower's still on the weak side, SteamyBladers</p>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> modders have made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/40-of-stellar-blade-mods-are-nsfw-but-dont-worry-weve-narrowed-that-down-to-three-guaranteed-to-raise-your-heart-rate">a lot of sexual stuff</a> so far. As it turns out, the game's director is cool with that, though he is hoping that despite the game not having any official tools, modders'll have a go at creating fresh wrinkles that add to what the Stellar Blade experience offers.</p>
<p>Hyung-tae Kim gave his opinion on where the game's modding scene is currently at in a recent interview with South Korean site <a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/special/nboard/5/?n=214039">This Is Game</a>, translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blades-director-doesnt-plan-to-police-modders-but-would-like-them-to-be-mature-and-stay-within-reason-with-what-they-make/">Automaton</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1934199332787679533">Genki</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the director's general view on Stellar Blade modding's pretty positive. He doesn't see the need to interfere with them except by encouraging folks from being careful with or avoiding stuff that could mess up their base game. Exactly the kind of view you'd hope a developer would have, rather than panicking and calling the lawyers the moment someone figures out how to replace a texture.</p>
<p>He's also cool with the idea of folks making reams of NSFW stuff like nice suits for the game, since Stellar Blade has a strong rating and is therefore aimed at adults. I'd caveat that as adults you might find a bit weird, but I digress. To be clear you can do the dirty to whatever floats your boat, as long as it's not doing any harm. The trouble with Stellar Blade has been misogynistic players and online dicks treating Eve, jiggle physics et al, as an example of how all women should look in games - see some of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3489700/reviews/?browsefilter=funny&amp;snr=1_5_100010_&amp;p=1">Steam reviews</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the director's less of a fan of paid mods that charge high prices, but generally seems to trust players not to engage with anything that crosses a line or involve material that could be classed as harmful or sensitive.</p>
<p>All of that said, Kim is keen to see Stellar Blade modders spread their wings a bit. While acknowledging that the game's lack of official tools will likely make this more difficult, the director's interested in seeing folks make mods that switch up what it's like to play the game, but without straying too far from its original vision.</p>
<p>According to Genki's translation, that wish was accompanied by Kim using the killer phrase "modders' firepower is still weak", as part of suggesting that he thinks the current crop of new cosmetics and minor tweaks don't go much beyond the stuff the base game offers. Which, to be fair, is the norm for games that haven't been out on PC long.</p>
<p>So, we'll have to see if the SteamyBladers accept this challenge, put aside their jiggle physics manipulation for a second, open up new tabs that cover their pretty out there desktop backgrounds, and set about pushing the limits of modding potential rather than the limits of taste. You can do it, high-five Stellar Blade modde...actually, you know what, maybe not. I don't know where that mitt's been.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As such, it makes for a good time to see which pulls from the long-awaited return of Team Rocket are fetching the big bucks, and how much you’re going to need to fork out if you want to add a specific special art to your collection.</p><p>All year long, <em>Pokémon TCG</em> has been plagued by issues of availability, and the accompanying misery of resellers wreaking havoc on the market. Destined Rivals is certainly no exception, and for once it’s not just because of people wanting to turn a profit at the expense of the real players: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001">this is a <em>damned</em> good set of Pokémon cards</a></span>, adding a huge amount of new fun to the live game, as well as being a set packed with stunning art, and most excitingly of all, better pull-rates.</p><p>When it comes to prices, I’m also pleased to report that things aren’t nearly as crazy as I’d expected. Now, for the sake of my own ego, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160">I did correctly call which would be the biggest cards</a></span>, but I’m  happy to say I got the pricing trends wrong. I’m not sure if that’s because of the better pull rates (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/Pok%C3%A9mon-TCG-Destined-Rivals-Pull-Rates/43ba832e-44c9-45a4-ae2e-594df2defdda/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/Pok%C3%A9mon-TCG-Destined-Rivals-Pull-Rates/43ba832e-44c9-45a4-ae2e-594df2defdda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they appear to be almost identical</a></span> to those of Journey Together, itself a big improvement since the removal of Ace Specs, but with twice as many cards in this newer set, there’s so much more variety to enjoy), or if perhaps at last the whole global fuss is finally calming down, but either way it’s great news for the hobby. So sorry, if you <em>did </em>pull a Cynthia’s Garchomp, you’re not quite as rich as you might have expected. Although not too sorry, since the numbers here are still double what we’d have seen a year ago.</p><p>I should note on prices, while the individual cards themselves aren’t going <em>quite</em> as mad, the sealed packs themselves still are. Right now, a booster box of 36 packs is selling for $250, over a hundred bucks over its RRP, while Elite Trainer Boxes are also 50 percent higher than they should be at $87. If you’re chasing particular cards, <em>please</em> don’t spend that—it’s far smarter just to pay for the specific card you’re after.</p><p>So, that all said, here are the highest-priced cards in Destined Rivals. All prices are accurate at the time of writing, but likely to change very quickly:</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-recommend-id="image://2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-recommend-id="image://2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>So, you know what, this one gives me a bit of hope. Prices of <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards are so often determined by two factors: the rarity, and whether there’s a pretty girl. But here, Ethan’s Typhlosion is <em>not</em> a super-rare card. There are very many cards in this set that are vastly more difficult to find, that are fetching far lower prices than the <strong>$42</strong> this is going for at the time of writing.</p><p>And why? Because it looks so fricking cool! The average price for Illustration Rares in this set is about ten bucks, and a lot of them look fantastic, but damn, this card is incredible. This feels like the sort of card that’s going to gain a lot more value over the next few years, as numbers thin out and people start to reflect on what a stunner it truly is.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-recommend-id="image://270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure Special Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-recommend-id="image://270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ethan’s having a good showing in the top ten, and he’ll be back yet. This card <em>is</em> a more rare pull, but with a Pichu and a Cyndaquil it’s definitely getting extra attention for the cute factor. (Sorry Slugma, but no matter how hard artist Kariya has tried to make you cute, you’re still a slug made of fire.)</p><p>It’s selling for much the same price as Ethan’s Typhlosion, at <strong>$42</strong>, although it had nudged ahead by a few cents at the time I put this together.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9a9f4ecc79396c0cd5dbad62bcfe5eff" data-recommend-id="image://9a9f4ecc79396c0cd5dbad62bcfe5eff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty’s Psyduck Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Misty’s Psyduck Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a9f4ecc79396c0cd5dbad62bcfe5eff" data-recommend-id="image://9a9f4ecc79396c0cd5dbad62bcfe5eff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty’s Psyduck Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>At <strong>$54</strong>, Misty’s Psyduck is a very expensive Illustration Rare. I already mentioned that the average price at this rarity is ten bucks. At the same time, my fears were that it’d end up going far higher thanks to the dark side of <em>Pokémon TCG </em>collection. Misty, in the fiction, is 10 years old. Let’s move on.</p><p>This is a completely lovely card; the colors, the realistic effects of the water over cartoon characters, and just the happy freedom it represents as Misty swims with a Psyduck that for once doesn’t look horrified.</p><p>$54 does represent a massive drop in price, the card first fetching around $95 before that was cut nearly in half, likely by the relative ease with which it can be found.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bde8b6cacf5b456d4686afd707513df1" data-recommend-id="image://bde8b6cacf5b456d4686afd707513df1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Gold" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Gold" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bde8b6cacf5b456d4686afd707513df1" data-recommend-id="image://bde8b6cacf5b456d4686afd707513df1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Gold" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The so-called “hyper rare” gold cards haven’t been desired by collectors for many years now, with the Scarlet &amp; Violet sets trying all manner of variants to see if they can ignite a new interest. Nothing’s really worked, and no other gold card has hit the top 10 (they’re actually faring a lot better than usual, with Cynthia’s Garchomp and Ethan’s Ho-Oh golds sitting at around $35, while even Jamming Tower gold is getting $17, and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/633042/pokemon-sv10-destined-rivals-team-rockets-crobat-ex-242-182?page=1&amp;Language=English&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/633042/pokemon-sv10-destined-rivals-team-rockets-crobat-ex-242-182?page=1&amp;Language=English" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hideous Crobat</a></span> $16), but nothing can stop the money-making power of Giovanni and Mewtwo.</p><p>So it is that this card, despite being pretty crass-looking, is currently fetching <strong>$63</strong> on the resale market.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="420ee3ee64bd4405a5d2eb1846455433" data-recommend-id="image://420ee3ee64bd4405a5d2eb1846455433" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Crobat ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Crobat ex Special Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="420ee3ee64bd4405a5d2eb1846455433" data-recommend-id="image://420ee3ee64bd4405a5d2eb1846455433" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Crobat ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Cards like this Crobat always tend to do well. Pack them with intricate background detail and people are far more willing to pay up. So the Golbat and Zubat flitting around behind, accompanied by a Team Rocket member, boosts this.</p><p>It also helps that it’s a real tank of a Pokémon. If you can get it in play (which requires two evolutions) you’ve got a 120 attack for just two energy, with a massive 310HP. It can dish out the hits while absorbing a lot itself, and the moment it’s looking vulnerable, you can return it to your hand for no cost and save a prize card. Neat.</p><p><strong>$65</strong> makes this a very expensive way to play the card, however! Thankfully, the identical ability is available on the regular version of the card, which is currently selling for 72c!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e7af90b4fb05556dd4950df94726bede" data-recommend-id="image://e7af90b4fb05556dd4950df94726bede" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Nidoking ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Nidoking ex Special Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e7af90b4fb05556dd4950df94726bede" data-recommend-id="image://e7af90b4fb05556dd4950df94726bede" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Nidoking ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Boast though I might, I did miss this card when predicting the big sellers.

While I expect this’ll drop to around a hundred bucks soon, I think those PSA 10 prices still have room to climb.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="84d0c542dffbb96ca9f9891b35fb1020" data-recommend-id="image://84d0c542dffbb96ca9f9891b35fb1020" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Ho-Oh ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Ho-Oh ex Special Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="84d0c542dffbb96ca9f9891b35fb1020" data-recommend-id="image://84d0c542dffbb96ca9f9891b35fb1020" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Ho-Oh ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I told you Ethan wasn’t done. Another legendary bird means another legendary price—this colorful card is starting at around <strong>$139</strong>, albeit well down from its early climb to $200.</p><p>Ho-oh ex is another superbly OP card in the set, with its ability to add piles of extra energy to other Ethan Pokémon cards, and a powerful attack that also heals 50 from every Pokémon you have in play!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="db2d70e241c2aa50e19f2c04aee53d85" data-recommend-id="image://db2d70e241c2aa50e19f2c04aee53d85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Special Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="db2d70e241c2aa50e19f2c04aee53d85" data-recommend-id="image://db2d70e241c2aa50e19f2c04aee53d85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>No big surprises in the top two, unless you count that these are selling for slightly less than their Japanese counterpoints, rather than the double I was expecting.

You’ll usually see these cards get a crazy price on day one, as silly people pay massively over the odds for a card that’ll cost half as much in a week. But in the case of this card alone, its current price is higher than where it began, and that’s <em>after</em> it took a dip. This means that unlike most of the prices here that are now levelling out, this one could still be climbing. The fluctuation hasn’t exactly been significant—it only dipped to $195—but breaking the pattern remains of note, and we could be about to see this climb much higher. At grade 10, it’s currently dancing around the $1,000 mark.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-recommend-id="image://7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Special Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-recommend-id="image://7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>So yes,  predictably it’s the the extra-rare Mewtwo that comes out on top. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160">But like I said before release</a></span>...it’s ugly, right?

Everything is available in a regular version, usually for cents, and even the Mewtwo will only cost you about $6.</p><p>Next up is the big finish for Scarlet &amp; Violet in the TCG, with the first ever international split set of Black Bolt and White Flare on July 18. It’s going to be <em>ridiculous</em>, with literally hundreds of full-art cards spread across the two sets, and no booster boxes to be able to buy them in. Urgh. See you then!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
