            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo held a brand new Indie World showcase packed with information about indie games coming to Switch 2 and Switch in the near future. Here's everything that was announced during that showcase!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>kicks the show off</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-indie-world-august-2025-mina-the-hollower.jpg?itok=FnIVgsaO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-indie-world-august-2025-mina-the-hollower.jpg?itok=Zb3iifeW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>arrives in October.</figcaption></figure><p>First, we get a new glimpse at Yacht Club's upcoming Game Boy-style top-down action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower</em>, which, as we know, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mina-the-hollower-release-date-yacht-club" rel="nofollow">launches on October 31st</a>. A demo will be available today for Switch 2 and Switch!</p>

<h2><em>Well Dweller&nbsp;</em>is a spooky Metroidvania coming next year</h2>

<p>Top hat Studios is up next, and it has revealed&nbsp;<em>Well Dweller</em>, a spooky-looking Metroidvania with more than a whiff of Tim Burton about it. Perhaps this will fill the&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>void? It's coming next year to Switch, anyway.</p>

<h2><em>Neverway&nbsp;</em>is a life sim with a difference</h2>

<p>Cozy games are gradually becoming spookier and spookier, it seems, and&nbsp;<em>Neverway&nbsp;</em>is a good example of that. It's a "nightmarish life-sim RPG" with a woozy color palette, co-created by the pixel artist behind&nbsp;<em>Celeste</em>, and it's coming to the Switch next year.</p>

<h2><em>Herdling&nbsp;</em>is the next game from the folks behind&nbsp;<em>Far</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/herdling-nintendo-indie-world.jpg?itok=G5Vs-y0G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/herdling-nintendo-indie-world.jpg?itok=o3kiy-Kx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Herdling&nbsp;</em>has you herding animals in a beautiful, yet desolate landscape.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, it's <i>Herdling</i>, an action-adventure game that comes from the devs behind the&nbsp;<em>Far&nbsp;</em>games. It combines&nbsp;Team Ico-style lonely vistas with the herding gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Herdy Gerdy&nbsp;</em>(remember that?), and it's coming to the Switch on August 21st.</p>

<h2><em>Is This Seat Taken</em>? brings "pleasant puzzle" vibes</h2>

<p>From Wholesome Games and Poti Poti Studio comes&nbsp;<em>Is This Seat Taken</em>?, a puzzler in which you must organize people depending on what they want and don't want. It comes to Switch later today!</p>

<h2><em>Little Kitty, Big City&nbsp;</em>will let you customize your cat and more</h2>

<p>A new update is coming to&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>, and it'll let you customize your cat, meet new friends, and take photos with new photo mode features. The update is heading to Switch later this year.</p>

<h2><em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch 2</h2>

<p>Landfall's&nbsp;<em>Content Warning</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/content-warning-sales-two-million" rel="nofollow">proved a massive hit</a> when it launched on PC last year, is bringing its "friendslop" fun to Switch 2. It's heading to Nintendo's console next year.</p>

<h2><em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>is an action roguelite with some big influences</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ball-x-pit-nintendo-indie-world.jpg?itok=LZIpriF6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ball-x-pit-nintendo-indie-world.jpg?itok=-iBy-wSL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Action roguelite&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch 2 and Switch.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've ever wanted to see&nbsp;<em>Breakout&nbsp;</em>rendered as an action roguelite that also blends influences like&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Loop Hero</em>, then&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>is for you. This one comes to Switch 2 this fall and to Switch on October 15th.</p>

<h2><em>Ultimate Sheep Raccoon&nbsp;</em>is a chaotic followup to&nbsp;<em>Ultimate Chicken Horse</em></h2>

<p>Yep, that's right - wacky racer&nbsp;<em>Ultimate Chicken Horse&nbsp;</em>is getting a followup, and it looks to bring even more ways to mess up your friends' day on chaotic race courses. It's coming to Switch 2 and Switch this winter.</p>

<h2><em>Glaciered&nbsp;</em>takes place on a wintry Earth 65 million years in the future</h2>

<p>Playism and Studio Snowblind have announced&nbsp;<em>Glaciered</em>, which takes place on a far-future Earth that's been completely overtaken by ice. You'll swim through waters filled with "ferocious marine beasts" in post-apocalyptic action RPG style this holiday on Switch 2.</p>

<h2>It's indie sizzle reel time!</h2>

<p>Lastly, we got to see a sizzle reel of indie games heading to Switch 2 and Switch in the near future. Here's everything that was included in that sizzle reel!</p>

<ul><li><em>Winter Burrow&nbsp;</em>(Switch - Winter 2025)</li>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-2-director-reveals-why-action-game-like-mechanics-were-cut-from-the-original-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-2-director-reveals-why-%E2%80%98action-game-like-mechanics%E2%80%99-were-cut-from-the-original-game.1264380/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Resident Evil 2 director recently stated that action-game-like mechanics were tested and then scrapped from the original game.  </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-1-experimented-with-action-mechanics-like-charged-attacks-before-the-devs-realized-it-was-comical-and-ruined-the-fear-factor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Resident Evil 2 director Hideki Kamiya recently spoke about one of the situations he remembered from the development of the original Resident Evil game. Kamiya’s new thread on <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1951891041583550541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), which comes as a response to Silent Hill F gameplay, states that several people in the development team of the first game requested features like a “sidestep” or a “charged knife slash”. The director of Resident Evil 1, Shinji Mikami, let them test out these features, only to make them realise why they were not necessary. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">バイオ1開発時チーム内で「サイドステップ欲しい」「ナイフ溜め斬り欲しい」と声が出て、三上さんは訝しみつつも試験実装を見守ってたんだけど、実際溜め斬りが実装されるとゾンビが全く恐怖の対象でなくなり…<br>三上さん「な？」<br>…というわけでボツとなって我々は大きな学びを得た…のを思い出した… <a href="https://t.co/UXlMCZ5kkz">https://t.co/UXlMCZ5kkz</a></p>— 神谷英樹🍀 Hideki Kamiya🍀 (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1951891041583550541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Kamiya explains that when these combat mechanics were added to Resident Evil 1, “the zombies immediately stopped being scary”, and hence, they were scrapped. The development team realised that these features would be “immersion-breaking and comical.” This situation also helped Hideki Kamiya understand why Shinji Mikami kept saying “the theme of this game is fear”. Mikami had also deliberately made the retreating animation slower, likening it to a “frightened backward stumble,” as this would help create fear.  </p>



<p>The Resident Evil 2 director also revealed another instance where Chris Redfield would receive a sword. The suggestion was that while Chris was exploring a mansion, he would have the option to pick up a European-style sword from the environment and use it to attack the zombies. However, as this made him look “too heroic”, the idea was ultimately scrapped. </p>



<p>In other news, Resident Evil 2: Deadshot has been introduced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-2-has-been-turned-into-an-arcade-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as an arcade version</a> of the popular survival horror title. Additionally,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-leak-reveals-link-to-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a new leak</a> suggests that the Resident Evil movie could be set around the events of RE2 and RE3. Do you think action game-like mechanics should have been a part of Resident Evil 1, or did the director make the right decision? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/07/battlefield-6-and-black-ops-7-both-need-secure-boot-and-tpm-2-0-for-pc-anti-cheat/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-and-black-ops-7-both-need-secure-boot-and-tpm-2-0-for-pc-anti-cheat.1264362/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA and Activision are both set to clamp down harder on cheaters in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> by requiring that PC gamers have TPM 2.0 hardware and have Secure Boot enabled within their system BIOS – this is also required for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/battlefield-6-launches-10th-october-see-the-multiplayer-trailer-beta-reveal-here/">Battlefield 6 Open Beta</a> that has just started today.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will lean on the latest version of Javelin Anticheat, while Black Ops 7 uses Activision’s Ricochet Anti-Cheat, both of which are kernel-level anti-cheat software. This provides the anti-cheat software deep level access to be able to spot and cut out cheating software in as many of its forms as possible.</p>


<p>Requiring Secure Boot takes things another step further, leaning on the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is built into all modern CPUs and is a key component for Windows encryption and digital rights management. Having TPM 2.0 hardware is a requirement for Windows 11 (albeit one that’s easily skirted past), but Secure Boot is technically optional, even if it does provide greater system integrity and security.</p>
<p>The further issue is that both EA and Activision are patching in the newer version of Javelin and Ricochet into previous games. Black Ops 6 and Warzone both require Secure Boot now, while EA added Secure Boot as a requirement for Battlefield 2042, and have previously rolled Javelin out for BF1 and BFV.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GeForce Now Thursday <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-mafia-the-old-country">adds five new games to the cloud streaming service</a>, including Hangar 13's prequel entry into the Mafia series with Mafia: The Old Country, Grimlore Games' recent shadow drop of Titan Quest II, Stormgate: Ashes of the Earth, and more.</p>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country was <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-grounded-2-mafia-the-old-country/">announced as being a part of GeForce Now just last week</a>, at the end of July ahead of its official launch tomorrow, and anyone wanting to jump into the Sicilian adventure who doesn't have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-pc-specs/">PC to stand up to its beefy requirements</a>, will be able to see the beautiful Sicilian countryside without issue. </p>



<p>That said, if you are going to try and run Mafia: The Old Country on your PC, then make sure you've downloaded the necessary drivers, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-new-game-ready-driver-optimized-for-mafia-the-old-country-and-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">latest ones just released from NVIDIA</a> to give yourself the best chance at a smooth experience.</p>

<p>Titan Quest II joins the service after being <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-early-access-release-date/">shadow dropped last week at THQ Nordic's Digital Showcase</a> event for 2025, and has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-sold-over-300k-less-3-days/">sold over 300K copies in less than three days</a> from its early access surprise launch. </p>



<p>Stormgate: Ashes of the Earth is another addition that is practically launching into the service, though in its case, it is launching out of early access and into its 1.0 version, since the game's 1.0 update arrived just a couple of days prior to the time of this writing on August 5, 2025. </p>



<p>Stormgate was previously available to stream on GeForce Now, so technically it's only the 1.0 update that's a new addition. But a 1.0 launch for an early access game is akin to a second launch, which is why it still makes the list, even as the sixth entry on a list of five new games.</p>



<p>As for the remaining games that are totally brand new to the service, along with its arrival in <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-adds-assassins-creed-mirage-rain-world/">Xbox Game Pass,</a> Assassin's Creed Mirage is joining the roster of games that can be streamed on GeForce Now through a Game Pass subscription.</p>



<p>The five new games are then rounded out by the horror classic Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and fighting game HUNTER X HUNTER: NEN X IMPACT.</p>



<p>Here's a full list of the new games added to GeForce Now today: </p>



<ul>
<li>Mafia: The Old Country</li>



<li>Titan Quest II</li>



<li>Assassin's Creed Mirage</li>



<li>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</li>



<li>HUNTER X HUNTER: NEN X IMPACT</li>



<li>Stormgate: Ashes of the Earth v1.0</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want to learn more about this week's headline game, Mafia: The Old Country, then you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/">check out our review,</a> which just went live shortly before this post. Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo checked the game out, and noted it as a narrative-focused experience that succeeds in that endeavor while still having strong gameplay. </p>

<p>What's that? You're still catching up on the news from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer"><em>last</em> Direct</a>? There's no time for that! Nintendo has another showcase up its sleeve, an Indie World to be precise, and it's right around the corner!</p>
<p>Yes, Nintendo is keeping the presentations coming today, with the Indie World set to kick off in a little under half an hour at <strong>6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST / 3pm CEST</strong>. There's only 15 minutes put aside for this one, but we can expect "new announcements and updates on indie games coming to Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch", so that's something.</p>
<p>All of this will be heading to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (or your regional equivalent), but if you'd rather watch with us Nintendo Lifers — and have a bit of a natter along the way — you can do exactly that by checking out the stream below.</p>
<p>We are just minutes away from our second Nintendo presentation in two weeks, so make sure you're sitting comfortably, and let's get ready for some indie news.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/media-molecule-david-smith-leaving</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/media-molecule-co-founder-david-smith-departs-to-focus-on-personal-projects.1264314/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Media Molecule co-founder David Smith has announced that he's leaving the studio after nearly 20 years in order to focus on his own personal projects.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mediamolecule.bsky.social/post/3lvqf3rzp622e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Smith says that while he's "proud" of everything Media Molecule has created, he has been "feeling a growing itch to explore truly wild ideas and make things based on [his] personal whimsy".</p>

<p>He says that while he still "greatly enjoy[s] the creative dynamic of working at Media Molecule", he doesn't have enough time to do so and work on his personal projects "without entirely giving up on pursuing that mythical creature called 'work-life balance'".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/media-molecule-david-smith-leaving-dreams.jpg?itok=zxymWiTs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/media-molecule-david-smith-leaving-dreams.jpg?itok=f-8xYf8m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Media Molecule is best known for games like the PS4 creative sandbox&nbsp;<em>Dreams</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Although he's leaving the studio, Smith says he "hope[s] to be involved with Media Molecule in future", and that he wants to "drop in from time to time", praising the "positivity and free exchange of ideas" that he says "remains true to the founding spirit of the company".</p>

<p>It's not clear exactly what personal projects Smith will be working on; whether he intends to start a new studio away from Media Molecule is unclear. We may well learn more about his plans in the coming months.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with Media Molecule, it's a development studio that was founded back in 2006 by Smith and three others: Mark Healey (who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/media-molecule-co-founder-mark-healey-leaves-studio-after-17-years" rel="nofollow">departed the studio himself back in 2023</a>), Alex Evans, and Kareem Ettouney.</p>

<p>The company's first game as Media Molecule was 2008's PS3 exclusive&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet</em>, a platformer that emphasized user-generated levels, although it did also offer a campaign of its own created by Media Molecule staffers.</p>

Live support for&nbsp;<em>Dreams&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/media-molecule-says-dreams-live-support-is-ending-in-september" rel="nofollow">ended in 2023</a>, but Media Molecule said at the time that it was moving onto an "exciting new project", although we still don't know what that might be.</p>

        <p>They hope to announce a date this autumn</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sony remain confident that Bungie's live service shooter reboot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> will launch within their current fiscal year - that is, before March 31st 2026 - and are fairly sure they'll be able to share an exact release date this autumn. They've factored it into their financial forecasts, see. </p>
<p>They're also pretty upbeat about their live service business at large, which accounted for around 40% of first-party software revenue in their last financial quarter, though they acknowledge that they screwed the pooch with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, which got to exist in public for a whole couple of weeks before Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">kicked it into the sun</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>All this comes from the publisher's latest financial earnings call, via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-its-live-service-shift-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly-but-pledges-to-carry-on-and-learn-from-mistakes/">Vengeful Giraffe Computing</a>. "First, about Marathon, how we factored it in the forecast, we expect the launch to happen within the fiscal year," Sony's chief financial officer Lin Tao commented through an interpreter, when pressed about the game's release date by an investor. "But, having said that, this is not a commitment. No official announcement has been given yet."</p>
<p>She added: "We are now doing modifications in development and, based on the progress, in the autumn time frame we believe we can communicate when we can launch [Marathon], either from Bungie or PlayStation."</p>
<p>All this comes in the context of on-going restructuring at Bungie, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">laid off hundreds of people last summer</a> and transferred others to a new studio within Sony. Bungie used to be a "very independent environment" when Sony acquired them in 2022, Tao observed, but "this independence is getting lighter, and Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios, and integration is proceeding." Slight undertones here of the Emperor in Star Wars commenting that the deflector shield will be quite operational, when your friends arrive.</p>
<p>We here at Rock Paper WSTE-M5 Combat Shotgun were moderately enthused about Bungie's recent closed Marathon alpha, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-is-real-looks-ridiculously-stylish-has-a-release-date-and-is-getting-a-closed-alpha-this-month">in terms of the art direction at least</a>. But then came news that it had made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">unapproved usage of somebody else's art</a>, and then came an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">indefinite delay</a>. </p>
<p>In the earnings call, Tao assured that this is unlikely to be another Concord situation. "We are now fixing the problems, so we believe this launch will happen," she told an investor. "If this launch is cancelled we'd need to do the revision of the valuation, however as of now this is not expected."</p>
<p>As for Sony's transition toward live service gaming, she acknowledged that there have been missteps, but pointed out that "if we look at the past five years, five years ago live service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios. We [now] have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, MLB The Show and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>, and Bungie's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, so we have these four live services contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner."</p>
<p>The aforesaid 40% proportion of Sony's revenue represents Sony's most recent financial quarter. Tao conceded that "for the full year it's a little less, probably between 20-30%. So in terms of the transformation, it's not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years you see that there's definitely been a change." Tao did not discuss the reported recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-put-the-axe-in-a-live-service-god-of-war-game-alongside-a-project-from-the-days-gone-studio">cancellation of two live service games from Sony Bend and Bluepoint</a>, the latter rumoured to have been working on a new God Of War.</p>
<p>My highly original, sage and hilarious closing thought is that Sony could have just told investors that "it's a Marathon, not a sprint", then surprise-released some kind of playable teaser called Sprint. What kind of game could Sprint have been? Unfortunately, I have now run out of originality, sagacity and hilarity, so must turn the completion of this sketch over to the comments.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-confident-marathon-will-release-by-march-2026-and-that-their-live-service-transition-is-paying-off]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Sony’s chief financial officer has suggested that live-service gaming hasn’t been a&nbsp;<em>complete</em> unmitigated success for PlayStation. With quite some impressive understatement, following a year that saw <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-sony-biggest-flop-failure-box-office-1851676475">the overwhelming failure of <em>Concord</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674">serious delays to Bungie’s&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em></a>, CFO Lin Tao told shareholders on a Q&amp;A call following the release of <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-sold-over-80-million-ps5-in-five-years-2000616264">Sony’s latest financial results</a> that “it’s not entirely going smoothly.”</p> <p>She did, however, defend the company’s continued forays into the genre, pointing out that while there have been a few hundreds of millions of dollars <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">hiccups</a>, there have been successes too. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-its-live-service-shift-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly-but-pledges-to-carry-on-and-learn-from-mistakes/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>, acknowledging that “somewhat negative news has been coming out,” Tao pointed out, “if we look at the past five years, five years ago live-service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios. We [now] have <em>Helldivers 2</em>, <em>MLB The Sho</em>w and&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, and&nbsp;Bungie’s&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;2</em>, so we have these four live services contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner.”</p> <p>Fair play on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>. The game is listed in <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_supplement.pdf">the latest financial report</a> as having sold 12 million copies across PS5 and PC, although is thought to have sold more than 15 million, and is obviously a massive hit. But it’s worth noting that <em>Destiny 2</em> came out eight years ago in 2017 from Activision, for Xbox and PlayStation, and Bungie was only bought by Sony in 2022.&nbsp;<em>MLB The Show</em> comes out with a new edition annually, so makes for an odd “live-service” proposition, and it’s notable that Sony doesn’t include its sales in its report. <em>Gran Turismo 7 </em>however, launched in 2022, still receives monthly updates, so that counts.</p>

 <p>Given rumors that&nbsp;<em>Concord</em> cost anywhere from $200 million to $400 million, and possibly made back around $1 million, it does seem like perhaps this doesn’t entirely balance the scales. But Tao makes the argument that this is still a new revenue stream that Sony didn’t have five years back, so it’s not to be sniffed at. “For Q1 the live-service ratio was about 40 percent,” <em>VGC</em> reports she told the call. “For the full year it’s a little less, probably between 20 to 30 percent. So in terms of the transformation, it’s not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years you see that there’s definitely been a change.”</p> <p>Thankfully, Sony isn’t pretending it’s all roses. “Of course, we recognize that there are still many issues,” Tao went on to say, “so we should learn the lessons from mistakes and make sure that we introduce live-service content where there’s less waste and it’s more smooth.”</p> <p>This likely explains the extreme measures taken following&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775">extremely badly received alpha</a> in April this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-concord-sony-live-service-ps5-hermen-hulst-1851784483">not risking another&nbsp;<em>Concord</em></a>-scale disaster so soon after. The game has since been “indefinitely” delayed, but not before it was met with <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">plagiarism accusations</a>. Sony also <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">cancelled multiple live-service projects earlier this year</a>, further casting doubt on the format as a viable medium.</p> <p>Still, the company seems upbeat about the prospects! And it’s certainly got the money to waste. If only it could figure out a way to do it without causing hundreds of people to lose their jobs.</p>

<p>A new Elden Ring Nightreign datamine reveals that developers are working on an endless ranked mode called ‘Deep of Night’. </p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign’s developers, FromSoftware, have been constantly churning out new content for the game for players to immerse themselves in. They recently added the highly requested <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-1-02-patch-notes-july-31-update-duos-finally-added-along-with-relic-filter-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duos mode</a> and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-set-of-everdark-sovereigns-arrive-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new set of Everdark Sovereigns</a>. Interestingly, the latest development reveals that FromSoftware could be cooking a brand new game mode for the title. </p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign-s-endless-ranked-mode-has-skill-based-matchmaking">Elden Ring Nightreign’s Endless Ranked Mode Has Skill-Based Matchmaking </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-have-uncovered-plans-for-a-new-endless-mode-with-armored-core-6s-rank-system-and-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, a new post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Adminisitrator/comments/1mh908l/elden_ring_nightreign_new_mode_deep_of_night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> talks about Elden Ring Nightreign’s upcoming endless ranked mode, which was datamined from the duos mode patch. The upcoming game mode is called ‘Deep of Night’ and it will be added to the Expeditions menu. The description states that players will not be able to choose these targets, and “difficulty increases with depth”. The player’s rating will increase with every victory, allowing them to proceed to “even greater depths”. The last statement says, “The boundless dark stretches out unto infinity.” </p>



<p>The player ratings in Elden Ring Nightreign’s endless ranked mode will be recorded through ‘Depth’. Victories will increase the player’s Depth rating, and losses will decrease it. There are 5 Depth Tiers to progress through: Depth 1 (Rating 0-999), Depth 2 (Rating 1000-1999), Depth 3 (Rating 2000-3999), Depth 4 (Rating 4000-5999), Depth 5 (Rating 6000+). Once a player is promoted to a higher tier, they cannot be demoted. Also, players will be matched with others of the same Depth; however, if there aren’t enough players in the same Depth, then the pool will be expanded.  </p>



<p>Regardless, players should take this information with a grain of salt as it doesn’t come from an official source and wait for an announcement from FromSoftware. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Since its debut, the Mafia series has steadily marched forward through the decades – the original is set in the 1930s, its sequel spans the ’40s and ’50s, and Mafia III unfolds during the late ’60s. If the next step was going to be the ’70s, or the ’80s – or both – I was certainly ready. Casino intrigue, shine boxes, borrowing huge kitchen knives from Martin Scorcese’s mother in the middle of the night – whatever it was, I was up for it. However, instead of moving closer to the end of the 20th century, Mafia: The Old Country takes us back to the beginning. And not just the beginning of the century, but to the formative era of the Mafia itself. Part mob drama and part Western, The Old Country may be a safe and conventional third-person action adventure on the surface, but it’s a moody and engaging one that makes great use of its uncommon setting and is brimming with old school atmosphere so heady you can practically smell the sun-dried tomatoes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After experimenting with a more freeform open world structure in the divisive Mafia III, Mafia: The Old Country returns to the format of the original Mafia and Mafia II. That is, it’s linear and tightly story-driven, and the open world is largely just a vivid backdrop to move through between objectives, and during some missions. This has always worked well for the Mafia series, and The Old Country is no exception. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This approach gives The Old Country an effective sense of place and scale – immersing you in a rich and evocative Sicilian countryside – but without bloat.  It’s a very detailed, varied, and convincing map, but there are no towers to scale or arbitrary icons to visit and clear. Your attention is simply required on the story, and the story alone. As a single-player sucker who inhales this kind of thing for its story, setting, and style, I was quickly hooked. If you’re the kind of person who might be tempted to use the Sicilian language option alongside subtitles in the language of your choice, you’re in the right place. If you’re the kind of person who pounds through cutscenes craving their next chance to slap the citizens of Steelport with a giant purple dildo, it’s possible the Mafia series may not be your speed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Family Splatters</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Beginning in 1904, The Old Country charts a chronicle in the life of young Sicilian Enzo Favara, who escapes a life of slavery in the region’s dangerous sulphur mines – run by the ruthless Spadaro crime family – to find himself working for their local adversaries, the Torrisi family. The story hits a lot of standard beats, and all the usual suspects are here. The fair and kindly mentor, and the loyal best friend with a habit of testing the patience of others around him. The stern and powerful Don and his cynical consigliere. The slimy and treacherous rival boss, and the forbidden love. There are some neat connections to the existing games in the series too, for fans who pay close attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yes, it’s a fairly familiar and predictable 13-hour saga for anyone with a basic level of gangster movie literacy, but the writing is strong and the voice performances are stronger. The highlight is arguably Don Torrisi himself, whose English voice actor Johnny Santiago injects with a quiet, husky intensity that is as credibly intimidating as a man in his position would need to be. He stalks the screen as the kind of guy that men who kill for a living would actually take orders from.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a fairly familiar and predictable 13-hour saga for anyone with a basic level of gangster movie literacy, but the writing is strong.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Familiar too is the third-person action, as The Old Country plays like any typical cover shooter from the last decade or so. This was the case in 2020’s Mafia: Definitive Edition, and it’s the same again here, albeit with a wild west flavour thanks to the era-specific arsenal (like revolvers, repeaters, and various shotguns) and the fact that shootouts sometimes occur on horseback, and/or against fellas who look like they’ve just stumbled home off the set of a Sergio Leone picture after a full day of making Clint Eastwood look cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even without engaging much with its rosary bead system of minor combat buffs (which I <em>did </em>regularly forget about), it’s not a massive challenge with the default, soft-locking aiming controls. However, I don’t play these sorts of games to be relentlessly punished. Some enemies will hunker down behind large objects and walls, and others will stoically stride towards you to be blown out of their boots. The AI isn’t always sharp (and it’s definitely a little janky to find yourself completely flanked but still have the time to stand up and clumsily blast a bloke who had you dead to rights at point blank range) but the shootouts are nonetheless serviceable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Old Country’s stealth doesn’t rewrite the rule book either, but it does strengthen the action overall. Stealth is sometimes required by the design of the mission at hand, but on other occasions it’s available as an option. There are a number of encounters throughout with environments that have been laid out for us to be able to sneak around and pick off all the enemies one by one, but also seamlessly pivot to hosting an out-and-out gunfight should you flub it and be spotted.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can toss coins and bottles for distraction, but unfortunately only <em>some </em>bottles (that is, the ones arbitrarily marked). It’s always a bit of an immersion breaker when levels are decorated with inconsistent props. I’d vastly prefer to just be able to pick up any bottle. Failing that, just delete the bottles we can’t pick up during missions. Crucially, you <em>can </em>pick up and move bodies, and there are boxes to stash them in. The stealth is pretty standard, but with distractions and body hiding it <em>does </em>feel like a proper stealth system and not a tacked on afterthought.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The stealth is pretty standard, but with distractions and body hiding it does feel like a proper stealth system and not a tacked on afterthought.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Enzo can temporarily highlight nearby enemies in the environment, which is essentially a superpower that’s handwaved away as his impeccable instincts (it probably could’ve been more logically introduced during the underground intro as some kind of innate ability he honed after spending the bulk of his childhood in a dark sulfur mine, but no matter). At any rate, once you have a feel for where your enemies are and which way they’re headed, all that’s left is to sneak around, grab them, and either button-bash to strangle them or tap your knife attack to speed up the process. That said, I actually rarely used the latter. Not because I was feeling merciful, but because stabbing your victims costs you a block of “durability” off your knife (which needs to be sharpened with a whetstone if and when it “runs out” of… stabs). It’s not a gamebreaker, but I’m not really into the idea of not being able to stab a bloke simply because my knife is immediately no longer pointy enough to do so after slaying a few of his mates (and whetstones were a consumable I didn’t always have). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I mainly just strangled my enemies to avoid this issue, but it feels like a slightly unnecessary system – particularly when durability concerns disappear during The Old Country’s new one-on-one knife fights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These knife fights are essentially boss encounters, presented as a one-on-one showdown with another man. They occur outside regular third-person action gameplay, and you’re locked into these battles until there’s a result (or your opponent is scripted to scarper). The attacks, parries, and dodges in knife fights are bespoke to this mode alone. They’re flashy and bloody, but a lot of the time I did just feel I was simply dodging and slashing my way to a cutscene, where a further complication or a switch in momentum will occur. Sometimes you’ll trigger an animation that makes you a passenger for a while, then Enzo’s health bar recharges while your enemy’s does not. I’m not sure what the thought was there. The knife fights look cool, and they’re not like anything in the series to date, but they do feel a little low stakes at times.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mafia: The Old Country – Meet Your New Family</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Red Dead Redenzione</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As a linear adventure, The Old Country admittedly doesn’t share the same scope of Rockstar’s genre-defining Westerns – but it’s certainly adjacent to them in tone and atmosphere. There’s a certain undeniable swagger that comes with riding into town on horseback (and on the wrong side of the law), and The Old County captures this with similar effectiveness to the Red Dead series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The early 1900s setting doesn’t just shine a spotlight on the early days of the Sicilian Mafia, it’s also a window back to the Edwardian era of automobiles – when cars began competing with horses as the primary method of transportation. Developer Hangar 13 has done an exceptional job in this department, especially with the sound.</p><div id="rank-these-non-gta-open-world-actiondriving-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank these non-GTA open world action/driving games</h3><h3>Rank these non-GTA open world action/driving games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These 120-year-old cars have primitive engines, whining chain drives, and open cabins with no sound deadening, and The Old Country has captured their raw and lumpy burbles immaculately. It definitely can’t be understated how much richness this adds to driving around the map. It’s not just engine sounds, either. When a gramophone is brought on a drunken car trip, be sure to listen as it misbehaves when you bounce around off road. There’s a lot of consideration here, and I respect that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, there’s a race mission – but it’s not been shoehorned in here to taunt those who are still haunted by the infamously tricky racing event in the original Mafia. Sicily was the home of the Targa Florio – established in 1906 and one of the oldest motor racing events in the world – so it makes perfect sense in context.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Old Country’s riff on this race is sadly all too brief – it’s over in less than seven minutes – but it is one of the most memorable and thrilling missions. It certainly made me wish Enzo could’ve cut ties with the Cosa Nostra and raced around Europe full time. I don’t know what’s more dangerous: betraying your oath to the family or trying to tame an aircraft engine that’s had four tyres and a steering wheel strapped to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of engines, however, it should be noted that The Old Country shifts the Mafia series off its previous proprietary one and onto Unreal Engine 5. From my perspective, the impact isn’t a dramatically profound one – 2020’s Mafia: Definitive Edition remains a handsome looking game, and so is The Old Country. What I can say is that I haven’t experienced any of the minor bugs that occurred during my first playthrough of Mafia: Definitive Edition, and that I haven’t had to restart checkpoints to overcome unexpected jankiness (or fallen through the map) – at least on PC, as we weren’t provided access to the console versions ahead of launch, so we’ll have to wait and see how those run. But outside of the occasional framerate flutter and some light pop-in, my time with The Old Country has been quite robust. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although, perhaps not quite as robust as the incredible array of food and produce on display throughout. Games rarely make me this hungry. A game may have <em>never </em>made me this hungry. I’m craving cannolis and cake. I’m wading through arancini ball recipes. I’m considering a vegetable garden to grow tomato varieties I can’t find.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve officially turned into my dad, and The Old Country is the game that did it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-review]]></content:encoded>

And now, speaking via an English interpreter during Sony's latest financial results briefing, the company's chief financial officer Lin Tao has seemingly agreed (thanks, <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/sony-on-marathon-live-service-strategy-its-not-entirely-going-smoothly/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThisWeekInVideoGames</a>). </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a>," Tao began, mentioning the Guardians of the Galaxy-inspired live-service shooter Sony launched after eight years of development, then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">binned alongside developer Firewalk Studios</a> within weeks of its failure. "And this year, Marathon was postponed. Somewhat negative news has been coming out, but if you look five years ago, live-service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>, MLB, [Gran Turismo 7] and Bungie's Destiny 2," Tao continued. "So we have these four live services contributing to sales and profit in a stable manner... In terms of the transformation, it's not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years, you see that there has definitely been change."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, questions remain over Sony's future live-service prospects, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026">Bungie's delayed Marathon</a> and also heist shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgame$</a>, the debut project from Haven Studios of which we've heard nothing for some time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Founded in 2021 and acquired by Sony a year later, Haven had been helmed by Assassin's Creed producer and games industry veteran Jade Raymond — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-woes-continue-as-playstation-executive-jade-raymond-exits-fairgames-developer-after-external-test-sparked-concern">until her exit from the company back in May</a>. Little has been seen of what Haven has been developing for the past four years, and now Fairgame$ has reportedly been delayed until at least 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing the status of Marathon specifically, Tao said Sony still expects the game to launch before April 2026, during the current financial year, but cautioned that this was "not a commitment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Based on the progress [made] in the autumn timeframe, we believe we can communicate when we will be launching," Tao said. "We are now fixing the problems. So we believe this launch will happen. If this launch is cancelled, we need to do a revision of the valuation. However, as of now, this is not expected."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Tao mentioned that Sony was in the process of gaining a much tighter grip on developer Bungie, after previously offering it "a very independent environment." This tallies with past comments from a former Bungie lawyer, who stated that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-forcing-bungie-to-get-their-heads-out-their-asses-and-run-destiny-2-like-a-business-is-very-much-a-good-thing-studios-ex-lawyer-says">Sony was now "forcing" the studio to "get their heads out their asses" and run Destiny 2 like a proper business</a> — something he said was actually a good thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This type of independence is getting lighter," Tao said. "So Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios. In the long term, you can see this as an ongoing process, so the direction is to become part of PlayStation Studios."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Behind the scenes, Sony has recently cancelled a slew of projects that never made it into the public eye. These include a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games">live-service God of War title in development at Bluepoint</a>, and another live-service title being made by Days Gone developer Bend. Firesprite previously <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-cancels-twisted-metal-live-service-game-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">ditched a live-service Twisted Metal project</a>, while Insomniac was known to have worked on a <a href="https://in.ign.com/marvels-spider-man-2/203705/news/spider-man-the-great-web-new-leak-reveals-another-gameplay-trailer-for-the-cancelled-title" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live-service co-op Spider-Man game titled The Great Web</a>. Most high profile of all, though, was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-but-naughty-dog-canceled-it-after-bungie-explained-what-it-takes-to-make-live-service-games-ex-playstation-exec-says">Naughty Dog's live-service The Last of Us multiplayer effort</a>, which the studio also ultimately ditched after years of work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, recent PlayStation events have focused more squarely on the company's upcoming slate of single-player blockbusters, such as the highly-anticipated Ghost of Yōtei and Naughty Dog's sci-fi game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-wouldve-tried-to-resist-sonys-live-service-push">former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida said he would have tried to resist Sony’s controversial live service video game push</a> — and mulled that "maybe that's one of the reasons they removed me from the first-party!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The DLC introduces Paint Junior as a new playable character, complete with a new weapon and unique magical moveset. Paint Junior is the first new addition to the Castle Crashers roster since Blacksmith and Pink Knight were added in 2011.</p><p>The meat of the DLC is the brand-new Painter Boss Toolkit--a feature that allows players to design their own custom characters and weapon skins. Players will be able to customize their character's head, body, weapon, shield, portrait, beefy form, and Back Off Barbarian art, by using a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/204360/view/655950199566373626" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">template</a> provided by The Behemoth. The DLC also integrates Steam Workshop for the first time, allowing players to explore and enjoy other fans' custom creations.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OYpEUMQhz8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6OYpEUMQhz8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Painter Boss Paradise comes with a handful of pre-loaded custom characters designed by The Behemoth's art team, but the indie studio is encouraging fans to get their own characters into the game. Any characters who are uploaded in the first week of the DLC may have a chance to be featured on the studio's next livestream.</p><p>The DLC also includes brand-new art for playable characters, weapons, and the world map, but players will have the option to toggle off the DLC at any time if they wish to go back to the vanilla Castle Crashers experience.</p><p>Players who choose not to purchase the new DLC will still get to benefit from a general update to the base game, including refreshes to art and animation, UI improvements, and a few other quality-of-life improvements.

The eye-catching, bright yellow retro system was unveiled in July as part of Bandai Namco's year-long celebration of Pac-Man's 45th anniversary. The console comes with a matching <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CX40-Wireless-Joystick-PAC-MAN-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FJP4JQBK?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CX40+ Wireless Joystick</a> and the new Atari 7800 game <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PAC-MAN-Double-Feature-7800-Atari/dp/B0FJPR24FM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pac-Man: Double Feature on cartridge</a>. The Pac-Man Edition Console releases October 31.</p><p>As the name suggests, Pac-Man: Double Feature comes with two games on one cartridge.

The other game is the first edition of Pac-Man for console, Pac-Man 2600 (1982).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4545528-atari2600%2Bpac-maneditionconsole.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545528" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4545528-atari2600%2Bpac-maneditionconsole.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545528"></a><figcaption>Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition Console</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4545528-atari2600%2Bpac-maneditionconsole.jpg"></figure><p>Additional CX40+ Wireless Joysticks themed around <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CX40-Wireless-Joystick-Ghost-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FJPL1JV7?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inky</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CX40-Wireless-Joystick-BLINKY-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FJPH369B?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blinky</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CX40-Wireless-Joystick-Ghost-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FJPQTRY1?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pinky</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CX40-Wireless-Joystick-Orange-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FJPC9LB4?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clyde</a> launch alongside the console for $40 each, so the Ghost Gang will come out to play on Halloween, too.

The trio of Namco classics were launch titles for the 7800 nearly 40 years ago, so it's pretty cool they are launch titles for the Pac-Man Edition Console. Unlike Pac-Man: Double Feature, these are simply new editions, so they will play just like the 1986 originals.</p><ul><li><strong><a

            <p>
Sony's chief financial officer Lin Tao has admitted PlayStation's live-service strategy - which has seen a string of high-profile flops, delays, and cancellations after a bullish start back in 2022 - is "not entirely going smoothly". Tao has also confirmed Destiny developer Bungie's independence is to be reduced as it's folded into PlayStation Studios.
</p>
<p>
Former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan infamously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">announced an ambitious live-service-focused future</a> for the company in 2022, shifting many of its studios - best known for their acclaimed single-player titles - onto live-service development in order to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">release a planned 12 games by 2026</a>. It also set up new live-focused studios, even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">acquiring Bungie for $3.6bn</a>.
</p>
<p>
However, it didn't take long for rumblings of discontent at the company to surface following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-march">Ryan's decision to step down as PlayStation boss</a> in 2023. Just days later, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-pivot-may-not-pay-off-the-way-jim-ryan-had-once-hoped-says-industry-insider">Sony was "uncomfortable" about Ryan's dramatic live-service gambit</a>. By the end of that year, one high-profile live-service game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-former-playstation-exec-says-but-naughty-dog-couldnt-make-it-alongside-new-ip">standalone multiplayer The Last of Us title</a> - had already got the chop, and other projects followed.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">live-service Twisted Metal Project was axed</a>, alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">live-service Spider-Man game from Insomniac</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-london-studio-working-on-online-co-op-combat-game-set-in-fantasy-london">multiplayer project from PlayStation Studios' London Studio</a>. And in the wake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Concord's dramatic flop</a> last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-layoffs-at-playstation-following-live-service-cancellations">significant layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">studio closures</a>, and more live-service cancellations - reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">including a God of War game from Bluepoint and something from Days Gone developer Bend</a> - followed. Throw in reports of Sony's increasing frustration with Bungie management, which seemingly peaked with Marathon's recent delay, and it's clear Ryan's vision of a live-service future for PlayStation has been less than successful.
</p>
<p>
All of which brings us back to today, and concerned questions from investors regarding PlayStation's live-service plans as part of Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_sonypre.pdf">latest financial results</a> Q&amp;A. Speaking via an interpreter (as detailed by <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/sony-on-marathon-live-service-strategy-its-not-entirely-going-smoothly/">TWIV</a>), Sony's chief financial officer and corporate executive officer Lin Tao acknowledged the "somewhat negative news" its live-service strategy has so far generated, specifically referencing Concord and Marathon's recent delay. "In terms of the transformation [toward live-service games]," she later added, "it's not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years, you see that there has definitely been change."
</p>
<p>
As to the significance of that timeframe, Tao explained, "Five years ago, live-service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios... We [now] have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, MLB, [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>] and Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>. So we have these four live services contributing to sales and profit in a stable manner."
</p>
<p>
"Of course," she added, "we recognise that there are still issues – many issues – so we should learn lessons from mistakes and make sure that we introduce live service content, where there's less waste and it's more smooth." This follows comments from PlayStation Studios boss Herman Hulst earlier this year, saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-remains-committed-to-diverse-and-resilient-live-service-games-including-forthcoming-marathon-and-fairgames-despite-high-profile-failures">company remains committed to building "a diverse and resilient" portfolio of live-service titles</a>, including the upcoming Fairgames.
</p>
<p>
As for Bungie's roll in PlayStation's live-service future, its previous autonomy is set to be reduced. Bungie has moved from controversy to controversy since its acquisition in 2022, facing ongoing reports of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue">mismanagement and executive toxicity</a>. That's alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reportedly-delays-destiny-2s-final-shape-expansion-and-marathon">delays</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">layoffs</a>, cancellations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">claims of tumbling staff morale</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">plagiarism scandals</a>, the reported underperformance of its releases, increasing fan frustration around the handling of its flagship title Destiny 2, and more. It's long been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-staff-reportedly-worried-about-bungies-future">reported</a> Bungie's autonomy could be on the line if the studio failed to turn things around, and it seems Sony is now ready to take control.
</p>
<p>
"At the time of acquisition, we were offering [Bungie] a very independent environment," Tao explained of the studio's relationship with PlayStation. "However, thereafter, we have gone through structural reform, as we announced last year. So this type of independence is getting lighter. So Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios. In the long term... the direction is to become part of PlayStation Studios".
</p>
<p>
Next up from Bungie, of course, is its PvP-focused Marathon reboot, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">delayed indefinitely following a poor reception to its big unveiling earlier this year</a>. At the time of its delay, Bungie said it would have more news to share this "autumn", and Tao has now confirmed Marathon's launch is  expected to happen within Sony's current fiscal year. "But having said that," she added, "this is not a commitment, and no official announcement has been given yet."
</p>
<p>
"We are now fixing the problems. So we believe this launch will happen. If this launch is cancelled, we need to do a revision of the valuation. However, as of now, this is not expected."

			<p>Neverwinter Nights 2 is a game I didn’t play when I was younger. I don’t know why, because I loved the first game when I was a teenager despite not really knowing what I was doing, but I just never grabbed the sequel back in the day. I did eventually venture in about two months ago, loading up the original game with a bunch of mods, and that very recent experience has me questioning why Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition is really necessary.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition - Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TgSqwnpjxyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Neverwinter Nights 2 is a CRPG built around the Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 ruleset. It’s big, complex, and incredibly satisfying provided you know what you’re doing. The star here is the story and writing, which is incredibly deep and has more detail that’s just mentioned in passing than you’ll know what to do with. Starting in a village that is inevitably attacked, you recover a macguffin and are sent to the city of Neverwinter by your almost comically disinterested adoptive father. From there begins the kind of fantasy adventure you’d expect, although sometimes with enemies you might not, such as the lizardfolk which are a scourge upon your progress early on.</p>



<p>It’s an excellent game, truly a classic, but this remaster has done the absolute minimum. For one, I played this game on PC three months ago and I’m not certain there’s much of a visual difference between what I saw on my PC then and this enhanced edition. It still looks pretty dated, despite improvements to texture quality, which have counterintuitively made environments look strangely sparse. Characters fare a little better, honestly looking quite good when you’re zoomed out considering, but when you’re in conversation and the camera is zoomed all the way in, they’re still a bit rough. They’re still better than the ones in the first game and its remaster, though that’s more down to the leap in graphics tech between 2002 and 2006 than this remaster.</p>

<p>Little seems to have been done to improve the actual gameplay experience as well. There are also bugs, such as one from just the first fifteen minutes of play that forced me to repeatedly murder a villager who kept getting back up. I was supposed to beat him up a little and then he gives up and agrees to go help defend the town, but instead he continued attacking me afterwards, constantly distracting my party members so they weren’t with me when I triggered combat.</p>

<p>There’s also annoying little things wrong as well, such as having to open a door, then interact with the door again to actually use it, which is dumb on its own (just go through the door the first time!) and fiddly because positioning yourself to interact with it is awkward and the camera has a habit of suddenly zooming all the way in when I’m standing in front of a door so I can’t see. This happened on literally the first door I used.</p>
<p>As a console port of an old PC game, the controls are about what you’d expect for a keyboard and mouse game on a controller. It works just well enough that you’ll be able to put up with the awkwardness if you love the game. It’s definitely not ideal, but it does the job.</p>

<p>Outside of all this, it’s Neverwinter Nights 2 with all of its expansions playable on consoles with a controller. That’s nice. It would’ve been nicer to see some real attention given to these games to perhaps iron out some now almost twenty year old bugs and really improve things, but at least it’s playable and exactly how you remember it. For better or worse. Of course you could just play the original on PC and benefit from all the mods that have released over the years, no doubt some of which will also improve the game’s textures.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition does the bare minimum as it brings the game to consoles. It looks a bit better, but that's about it. It's still buggy and rough around the edges, but it is at least Neverwinter Nights 2. If you really want to sit back and play it with a controller, this will do it for you. If you want anything more, the original is more than playable on pretty much any PC, and has deep mod support.	</p></div>

					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X</span>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/mafia-the-old-country-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-return-of-the-gangster-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a> launches tomorrow, nearly nine years after the last mainline entry in the franchise, making fans more than eager to get their hands on this new game. Sure, in 2020, there was the Mafia: Definitive Edition remake of the original classic from 2002, but this is a new story, albeit one set in the past.</p>



<p>As the title suggests, Mafia: The Old Country does not take place in America's fictional cities of Lost Heaven, Empire Bay, or New Bordeaux. Instead, it is an origin story of the Sicilian Mafia set on Italy's island very early in the 1900s.</p>



<p>In that light, it is more interesting from a narrative perspective because it shows the true roots of the Mafia. Most American movies have focused on the American side, but the Italian side is where you really understand what it's all about - chiefly, the unyielding adherence to certain values of that world, for better and for worse.</p>



<p>As an Italian myself, I was doubly glad that Hangar 13 chose this setting. Sicily has long been neglected in videogames, and there's hardly a better chance to portray it than in a new Mafia title. To do so, the developers from Hangar 13 (headquartered in Novato, California, but with two offices in the Czech Republic) partnered with local game developer Stormind Games, known for titles like Remothered: Tormented Fathers and Broken Procelain, Batora: Lost Haven, and A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.</p>



<p>Through a joint effort documented in a developer diary, Stormind helped Hangar 13 recreate turn-of-the-twentieth-century Sicily, and I'm pleased to report that the results are excellent. In fact, Mafia: The Old Country may very well include the best, most accurate rendition of Sicily ever seen in a game. Everything from the visuals to the dialect and the music is faithfully reproduced. To that end, I would recommend selecting the extremely well-done Sicilian voiceover and add to that whatever subtitles you need to maximize immersion.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mafia_The_Old_Country_Hillside_Church-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>That's particularly useful because the game is heavily narrative-driven. All the games in the franchise were, albeit to a different extent. Mafia III, for example, included a proper open world experience, whereas previous entries allowed for open world exploration but only offered minimal side activities. </p>



<p>For this new game, Hangar 13 cut all that. There are no real side activities to be found in Mafia: The Old Country, unless you consider gathering hidden fox-like statuettes or Trinacria symbols such a thing. No, the game is very linear, jumping straight from mission to mission. It can be compared to the Uncharted series in this regard (though the very last one, 2017's The Lost Legacy, actually allowed a decent degree of open ended gameplay that is absent here), with plenty of car chases and setpieces to mark pivotal moments in the story.</p>



<p>The game does occasionally allow you to roam a bit of the countryside of San Celeste (a fictional town located in the vicinity of Mount Etna, which would put it in Eastern Sicily) by car or horse, but there really is nothing to do there except look at the gorgeous environments. I can't help but think that's a bit of a shame - while I understand why the developers decided to go with a full linear design (and a lower price), I believe there's a lot of potential in an open world game set in Sicily, provided that it is filled with enough content to make the exploration worth it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mafia_The_Old_Country_Horse_Riding-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>During missions, gameplay consists of a blend of stealth and shooting, just like in the aforementioned Uncharted franchise (platforming, however, is entirely absent). In most missions, you're given the chance to either go in guns blazing or get the drop on the enemies first. Sneaking behind an enemy triggers a little mini-game where you must mash a button repeatedly to fill a bar to knock out the unlucky foe. You can then grab the body and hide it somewhere it won't be seen; otherwise, some other guard could alert the whole map against you. The developers have conveniently (perhaps even too conveniently) placed a great many trunks throughout the levels where bodies of knocked-out foes can be hidden. This is where I noticed something odd: not only could each trunk fit as many as three bodies before becoming unavailable for further disposal, but the previously deposited bodies simply disappeared, with the trunk looking empty each time. A missing detail, albeit a small one, to be sure. </p>



<p>Whenever multiple enemies are looking in the same direction, you can distract one either with a coin toss or by grabbing an empty bottle from the environment and launching it elsewhere. If stealth fails, it will come to shooting. Here, Mafia: The Old Country includes various era-appropriate weapons, from small pistols to sawed-off shotguns, regular shotguns, and long-range guns. These can either be acquired by spending denari (the in-game currency that can be looted off enemies and acquired from small chests after breaking them open with a knife) or by simply looting from the ground weapons used by defeated foes. The shooting component is solid enough, if not quite exceptional. Enemy AI is not the smartest during stealth, but it appears to be more proactive when fights break out, advancing at a steady pace and even flanking the main character's position. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, the game lacks a seamless transition from stealth to melee combat, which is a bit jarring. If, for some reason, the enemy you're sneaking on turns early enough, you cannot really switch to fist-fighting like you would in another action/adventure title such as Uncharted. In that case, you'd have to switch to guns instead, as there is no bare-handed melee combat. </p>



<p>The game does include extensive knife fights, but only in one-on-one, cinematic duels against key characters. In these instances, the camera switches to focus solely on the two fighters, not unlike a fighting game. The moveset is a conventional one: the player can select two types of strikes, and also parry and counterattack, and dodge, which is particularly useful against those attacks that cannot be parried (as with most games, they are highlighted in red). They are, effectively, 'boss fights', including two big bars for each contender.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mafia_The_Old_Country_Knife_Fight-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country does feature some character progression, but it's honestly paper-thin. You can equip a few items that provide small boons, such as the chance to dodge a bullet or the ability to carry extra ammunition or bandages. These items can be found scattered throughout the levels, but they do not make much of a difference. Overall, the challenge level is decent when playing on Hard.</p>



<p>By far the best reason to play this game is witnessing the rise and fall of Enzo Favara. The protagonist of Mafia: The Old Country is an orphan youngster who spent long years toiling as an indentured laborer, practically a slave, in the sulfur mines. Following the death of his one and only friend in the mines, Enzo takes his chances and escapes, ending up under the protection of Don Bernardo Torrisi. He begins as the lowliest laborer there, but soon proves his worth in increasingly challenging circumstances. </p>



<p>Without spoiling anything, the plot is pretty much what you can expect from the genre: a talented low-born's tumultuous rise all the way to the top, only to fall again in the end. That said, even without any big twists, the story is told exceptionally well, especially during the cutscenes (the dialogues outside of the cutscenes have worse facial animations). The characters are memorable, if a bit trite, and will stay with you even after reaching the game's ending, which took me twelve hours.</p>



<p>From a technical standpoint, Mafia: The Old Country is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and looks suitably appealing, showing off gorgeous environmental details. Stuttering is thankfully minimal and perhaps that's mostly due to the lack of any open-world elements, which might have complicated matters. The PC version does not feature any ray tracing, offering only standard UE5 options. When it comes to upscalers, all main options are available: Unreal Engine's TSR, NVIDIA DLSS (with Frame Generation selectable in-game and the Multi Frame Generation override available via NVIDIA app), AMD FSR and Intel XeSS (both without frame generation). Even at max settings and 4K resolution, the game only needs about 6.4GB of VRAM.</p>



<p>Finally, the soundtrack is owed a well-earned mention for complementing the mood and ambience in such a striking way.</p>

				<p>Mafia: The Old Country aims squarely at being a narrative experience, and largely succeeds in that while also providing solid gameplay. It is a bit of a shame that we don't get to explore Sicily in this game, but if you're into Mafia narratives, this is among the best you can find in games, and the price isn't so high to boot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released its financial statement for the first quarter of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and sales are up compared to last year, with the company pledging to continue focusing on its live-service offerings in the future.</p>

<p>As revealed in the statement's accompanying financial <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_sonyspeech.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">documents</a>, overall sales for Sony's gaming segment are up by 8% compared to the first quarter of 2024-25, and operating income more than doubled for "a new quarterly high".</p>

<p>These numbers are up due mainly to "increased sales of third-party software", and while Sony doesn't specify which games sold particularly well, it's very likely that games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Oblivion Remastered</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur</em></a>, and the PS5 release of&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>bolstered its numbers for this quarter.</p>

<p>In a Q&amp;A following the release (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-its-live-service-shift-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly-but-pledges-to-carry-on-and-learn-from-mistakes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Sony CFO Lin Tao said the company will continue to pursue live-service games despite "negative news" about its two most recent live-service releases, namely&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Marathon</i>.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">unceremoniously shut down last year</a> following a disastrous launch, while Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed following negative feedback</a> from its alpha test, as well as news that the game contained <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">art stolen from an online artist</a>.</p>

<p>Tao says that despite these problems, live-service games are "contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner", citing the aforementioned three still-operational live-service games, as well as&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>.</p>

<p>With the arrival of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a>'s season five today, August 7, EA are initiating a "phased rollout" of secure booting and Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 as mandatory requirements when hopping into an entry of the series.

Then, when Black Ops 7 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-been-announced-can-someone-please-explain-the-plot-of-these-games-to-me">prone-crawls its way out of the gulag</a> later this year, it'll be mandatory to have both enabled to play.</p>
<p>"These hardware-level protections are a key part of our anti-cheat efforts, and we’re asking all players to get compliant now," Activision wrote. They also provided <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/trusted-platform-module-and-secure-boot">instructions</a> as to how to check whether you've got secure boot and TPM 2.0 enabled via your BIOS settings, and turn them on if not.</p>
<p>If your game-playing box's specs are fairly up-to-date, and especially if you're running Windows 10 or 11, it shouldn't be too much of a faff to sort. That's provided you're open to taking these extra steps with your own hardware as part of publishers' efforts to try and combat cheating by, in Activision's words, enacting measures to "strengthen security and protect the experience, without impacting performance."</p>
<p>As of right now, the company don't have any immediate plans to make secure booting and TMP 2.0 mandatory for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>, but they indicate that could change in future. They also wrote that they'll "share more details on additional protection measures we’ll be putting in place for Call of Duty as we get closer to the Black Ops 7 launch", and that enabling two-factor authentication on your Activision account might become mandatory down the road.</p>
<p>If it helps, maybe imagine it's Captain Price ordering you to do all of this admin just to shoot some folks dressed in swanky tactical getups. Also, if you've been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-battlefield-6-beta-queues-stretching-around-the-block-a-substantial-increase-in-server-capacity-should-just-have-helped">sitting in a Battlefield 6 beta queue all morning</a>, some server messing about by EA should hopefully help you get in soon.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> has passed another round number milestone, as Sony has announced that they have shipped 80.3 million consoles.</p>
<p>The past quarter – ending on 30th June – saw Sony ship 2.5 million more PS5s, up from 2.4 million in the same quarter last year, which is good news for the continued appeal of the platform.&nbsp;Digging back through <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/18q2_supplement.pdf">Sony’s older financial statements</a>, the PS4 would have been at 79.6 million consoles sold by the same point in its lifetime, so the PS5 is sneaking ahead of the last generation at this point.</p>


<p>Even better, of course, is that people are still massively engaged with PlayStation gaming in general. There were 123 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network last quarter, up by seven million from the year before. Similarly, game sales for both PS5 and PS4 combined for 65.9 million games sold, up by 12.3 million from last year. Of that, 6.9 million were first party titles, and we’re now at the point where 83% of games sold are digital downloads.</p>
<p>All good stuff for Sony and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony’s CFO has stated that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> is expected to release by the end of March 2026, as Bungie’s independence from PlayStation Studios is now “getting lighter”</p>
<p>The statements came from CFO Lin Tao as part of a Q&amp;A following Sony’s latest financial statements, in which she said that launch is still expected within the current fiscal year, ending on 31st March 2026. However, as this was in response to a question over what would happen if Marathon was cancelled outright, she added, “this is not a commitment. No official announcement has been given yet.”</p>


<p>She also said, “We are now doing modifications in development and, based on the progress, in the autumn time frame we believe we can communicate when we can launch [Marathon], either from Bungie or PlayStation.”</p>
<p>For Bungie as a studio, there’s been plenty of speculation and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/bungies-independence-reportedly-under-threat-developers-suffering-low-morale/">reporting over their independence</a> and ability to operate separately from the rest of PlayStation Studios. Through 2024, the company went through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">a painful round of layoffs and game cancellations</a>, while some teams were branched off into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/07/sony-founds-new-studio-teamlfg-from-former-bungie-incubation-project/">separate studios</a>.</p>
<p>Tao explained Sony’s longterm plan for Bungie and that “at the time of acquisition we were offering a very independent environment, so that was one way of thinking. However, thereafter, we have gone through structural reform, as we announced last year, so this independence is getting lighter, and Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios, and integration is proceeding.</p>

<p>“So in the long term, if you can see this as an ongoing process, the direction is to become part of PlayStation Studios.”</p>
<p>It’s definitely concerning times for Bungie, with the launch of Destiny 2’s latest expansion, The Edge of Fate, seeming to do poorly, both from the point of sales and reaction from the game’s fanbase. Marathon was intended to be the big shining hope for the company, but the extraction shooter revamp of the studio’s mid-90s FPS series has struggled to gain traction. Having been announced for release in September, closed testing drew strong criticism such that Bungie was forced to delay the game. There was also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/bungie-pins-marathon-art-plagiarism-on-former-employee-promises-to-do-right-by-original-artist/">a whole art plagiarism scandal</a>.</p>
<p>“Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear,” the team wrote in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/marathon-has-been-delayed-as-bungie-commit-to-building-on-player-feedback/">a Marathon Development Update in June</a>. “We’ve taken this to heart, and we know we need more time to craft Marathon into the game that truly reflects your passion.”</p>
<p>It’s expected that Bungie will be able to make fresh announcements on the game this autumn.</p>
