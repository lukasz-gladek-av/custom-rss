            <p>
Amid its push toward mobile and free-to-play titles and away from the "volatile" AAA space, Warner Bros. has announced the acquisition of MultiVersus developer Player First Games.
</p>
<p>
MultiVersus - which has had an unusual, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">sometimes</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-relaunch-comes-with-character-restrictions-and-people-arent-happy">controversial</a> development journey since the start of its open beta back in 2022 - is Player First Games' debut title. It finally got its full free-to-play release this May after disappearing for over a year, and while its current player numbers don't appear to be anywhere near those seen during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-relaunch-comes-with-character-restrictions-and-people-arent-happy">height of its open beta popularity</a>, Warner Bros. is clearly happy enough to acquire the studio behind it.
</p>
<p>
Full details of the purchase haven't been disclosed, but Warner Bros. confirmed (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-multiversus-player-first-games-acquisition">via IGN</a>) Player First Games' co-founders Tony Huynh and Chris White will continue to lead the studio.

<p>
"Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall," Huynh said in a statement accompanying the announcement. "We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players."
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros' latest acquisition follows the company's announcement back in March that it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-focusing-on-mobile-and-free-to-play-instead-of-volatile-aaa-console-games">shifting its focus</a> to mobile, free-to-play, and live-service titles to combat what it called the "volatile" AAA market. That came after February's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">admission</a> the publisher was bracing for a "tough year", after it revealed sales of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League had failed to meet its expectations.
</p>
<p>
Despite Warner Bros' shift in strategy, reports surfaced last week that it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-studio-netherrealm-hit-by-layoffs">laid off the entire mobile team</a> at Mortal Kombat developer NetherRealm. And while neither the studio or publisher has publicly acknowledged the job cuts, NetherRealm has now confirmed its free-to-play live service mobile game Mortal Kombat: Onslaught will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netherrealm-is-shutting-down-live-service-mobile-game-mortal-kombat-onslaught">shutting down</a>. 
</p>
<p>
News of Warner Bros' Player First Games acquisition came ahead of MultiVersus' second season, which launches today and introduces a ranked mode, plus new fighters Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice. They join a sizeable roster of other playable characters from Warner Bros' library, including Bugs Bunny, Tom and Jerry, Superman, Joker, Gremlins' Gizmo, The Matrix's Agent Smith, Jason Vorhees, and Game of Thrones' Arya Stark.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-named-eos-review-quick-charming-puzzle-fun</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-star-named-eos-review-quick-charming-puzzle-fun.934275/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-named-eos-review-quick-charming-puzzle-fun<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Finding a good, story-based puzzle game is like a reward for those who love the genre. The subtle art of exploring puzzles and learning a story bit by bit can be satisfying, and <em>The Star Named EOS</em> is a good example of what the genre can offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Star Named EOS</em> has a good balance of challenging puzzles and narrative, and the graphics and music support the rest of the game well. While it’s a solid puzzle game and one that those in the genre will enjoy, it struggles to stand out or above other games as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Meet Dei, his mom, and puzzle galore</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-star-named-eos-train-stage.jpg?itok=s98NZlos 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-star-named-eos-train-stage.jpg?itok=PSUPxVKC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The train stage was where&nbsp;<em>The Star Named EOS&nbsp;</em>took off.</figcaption></figure><p>The story begins with the player’s character, Dei, following in his mom’s footsteps. Every stage starts with a picture that Dei’s mother took, and his goal is to recreate the picture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Players complete a variety of puzzles as they try to take the perfect picture. All of these are found by exploring the environment of each story chapter. The puzzles strike a good balance of being complex without being frustratingly difficult. While a few puzzles are much more difficult than others, most of them are about the same difficulty level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two puzzles in particular were so frustrating that I was nearly in tears thinking I’d never solve them. However, after spending some time solving them (and inputting random things), I eventually got to the answers. They didn’t seem like they were supposed to be as difficult as they were, the hints just didn’t give quite enough information to make sense.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-star-named-eos-radio-puzzle.jpg?itok=eKb1s8W7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-star-named-eos-radio-puzzle.jpg?itok=hj8zonq4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The morse code radio puzzle was particularly fun.</figcaption></figure><p>Other than those two puzzles, <em>The Star Named EOS</em> flowed well. I didn’t get too hung up on any particular area, and the progression felt natural and not too difficult. This kept my focus on the story instead of thinking too hard about most of the puzzles.</p>
<p>While exploring, there’s often dialogue for the things Dei interacts with. For the most part, the dialogue was well-written. However, a few parts of dialogue were reused with items that were the same but in different areas. They weren’t important items, but it was one of the small things that could have been polished.</p>
<p>Besides the few instances of repeated text, the environments themselves had a quant charm to them. Each area felt thoroughly investigated by the end of a chapter, which was both satisfying and a good use of space.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Art and Sound</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-star-named-eos-night-sky.jpg?itok=OF2yqH2U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-star-named-eos-night-sky.jpg?itok=Qn7RUlfu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Something was particularly charming about the stars in&nbsp;<em>The Star Named EOS</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The art style of <em>The Star Named EOS</em> is pretty, and certain areas stand out more than others. Most of these were at the end, making for a pretty climactic end, which went well with the story. The music did the same, not quite standing out but doing a good job of subtly enhancing what was happening at any given moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same theme showed up here. <em>The Star Named EOS</em> had good graphics and music, but it was just that: good, not great.</p>
<h2><em>The Star Named EOS </em>| Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, <em>The Star Named EOS</em> doesn’t do enough to stand out. It’s not a bad game – the story has a meaningful lesson by the end, and the journey to get to it isn’t bad. It’s got a charm to it that most <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/puzzle?page=9223372036854775807">puzzle game</a> enthusiasts will probably enjoy, but that charm won’t translate well to people who don’t get the same satisfaction from these types of games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it doesn’t do anything to stand out from other games, even in the genre. It’s good and worth a play if you’re looking to cozy up with a puzzle game, but it’s rather average. That isn’t a bad thing – sometimes a solid puzzle is the best way to relax, and <em>The Star Named EOS</em> is perfect for doing just that.&nbsp;</p>

The Star Named EOS is a quick, charming puzzle game, but it doesn't stand out in the genre. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p>It has been less than a month since Dr Disrespect vanished from the internet following the surfacing of extremely damaging allegations of sexual messaging with a minor – which in part, he admitted to. </p>



<p>Now, MrBeast’s team has come under fire following the emergence of claims that Ava Kris Tyson, a co-host of the super-sized channel and close personal friend of Jimmy ‘MrBeast’ Donaldson, formed a relationship with a 13-year-old fan and spent years communicating with them and interacting with suspicious and at times immoral ‘art’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-has-kris-tyson-done">What Has Kris Tyson Done?</h2>



<p>In recent days, a series of clips and videos have emerged online alleging that Ava Kris Tyson – formerly known as ‘Chris Tyson’ before their gender transition started in 2023 – knowingly and nefariously interacted with a young fan over a series of years. Per the reports, the fan won a competition at 13 years old, and Kris Tyson formed a relationship with the minor, going so far as to ‘co-run’ a Discord server with them and stay in touch on social media.</p>



<p>This is where the core of the concerns begin, as evidence has surfaced online showing Tyson sending risque comments to the minor – known as ‘Lava’ – on social media. There are also some screencaps showing questionable messages on Discord between Tyson and Lava.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress right off the bat that Lava has come out on social media in defence of Ava Kris Tyson, stressing that no wrongdoing took place aside from ‘edgy jokes’ that bordered on being inappropriate:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>These videos are massive lies and twisting the truth. Ava never did anything wrong and just made a few edgy jokes. I was never exploited or taken advantage of. </p><p>Can you do me a favor and comment on these videos and tell them to stop spreading lies. </p><p>This situation takes away… <a href="https://t.co/FID7uBlc6h">pic.twitter.com/FID7uBlc6h</a></p></div>— Lava (@LavaGS) <a href="https://twitter.com/LavaGS/status/1815429514614501500?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>It’s easy to write this off as being fake, but MrBeast reportedly <a href="https://x.com/KEEMSTAR/status/1815452450620338565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">connected KEEMSTAR to Lava</a> after confirming that he is indeed the minor in question – but he’s now 20 years old. After talking at length to Lava, it was determined that he <strong>was not </strong>groomed by Tyson, he <strong>did not </strong>meet Tyson by himself all those years ago, and the furthest it went was with ‘<strong>edgy inappropriate jokes</strong>‘.</p>



<p>That’s walking the line that’s very close to what got Dr Disrespect booted out of the gaming community. It was just a few weeks ago that Guy ‘Dr Direspect’ Beahm revealed that he’d messaged a 17-year-old years ago and that the conversation took inappropriate turns at times. That earned him a ticket out of the industry – for now.</p>



<p><strong>It doesn’t end there with Ava Kris Tyson, though</strong>.</p>



<p>As eagle-eyed hunters dug into the story, darker references were found online. For instance, Ava Kris Tyson has on many occasions interacted with ‘Shadman’, an artist known for drawing young characters in provocative or downright sexual poses and styles, <a href="https://x.com/realExate/status/1814064935376138552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">and in one post</a>, it looked as though Tyson was <strong>begging </strong>Shadman to ‘draw a 10-year-old anime girl’. </p>



<p>KEEMSTAR was one of the more prolific creators who <a href="https://x.com/KEEMSTAR/status/1815490471273066919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">backed up the claim</a> that Tyson supported the ‘CP artist’. </p>



<p>In one of the <a href="https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/1815439023554355414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more recent posts online</a>, Jake Franklin, a former member of MrBeast’s team, said ‘Jimmy knew.’ This is a direct reference to MrBeast himself, and it’s a potentially damaging claim that suggests he knew what Tyson was up to – but it’s vague. What did Jimmy know? If he knew about Tyson and Lava but Lava has discredited the claims, what’s there to know?</p>



<p>Ava Kris Tyson has since made their Twitter profile private and has been removing many of the posts that people have been referring to in videos and screenshots. Fans and critics worldwide are now awaiting the inevitable explanation video or post that’ll surface following this debacle.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Should COD Champs Be a Neutral Event?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cod-champs-neutral-event/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/should-cod-champs-be-a-neutral-event.934263/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cod-champs-neutral-event/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Last weekend, the Call of Duty League Championship took place in Texas, and in an epic fashion, OpTic stormed into the grand final and dominated the New York Subliners to secure the trophy. It was a monumental event that pulled in hundreds of thousands of viewers, but with it being hosted by OpTic Texas, the branding, special events, and crowd weighed heavily in the favour of the Green Wall.</p>



<p>Now, several pro players from the past and present have taken to social media to condemn this, stressing that OpTic Texas had a serious home advantage. Others have stressed that if the team had <strong>lost</strong>, this wouldn’t be a discussion whatsoever. Ultimately, many are calling for COD Champs to be a neutral event going forward.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-all-comes-out">It All Comes Out</h2>



<p>On social media, users were quick to highlight that when the LA Thieves won COD Champs during the Vanguard season, it was on home turf and the event featured 100 Thieves-themed activations, but nobody has been complaining about <strong>that</strong>. For one thing, OpTic is the team that many fans love to hate, and that’s seen during every Call of Duty event – except the ones that are played at home in Texas.</p>



<p>Most of this discourse was kicked off by ACHES, a former Call of Duty world champion now working on XDefiant – but still neck-deep in the world of competitive COD. His opinion that Activision should host a neutral Champs event every year went down fairly well, with some pro players coming out to support him:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You’re right and every pro will tell you as well. Tippable fs tho</p>— Ultra Scrap (@ScrappyNJ) <a href="https://twitter.com/ScrappyNJ/status/1815535506148729090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Of course, he also suggested that OpTic ‘bought the win’, which didn’t sit well with fans.</p>



<p>Others pointed out that OpTic fans were nothing short of toxic at the event and effectively went unpunished – even those in the VIP areas heavily dominated by OpTic Texas fans. In one post, the Subliners’ Sib mentioned that <a href="https://x.com/SibDMDL/status/1815536756558532885" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">racial slurs were being thrown around</a> and security was doing nothing about it. Of course, that’s not necessarily a failing of OpTic Texas specifically, but more the venue’s choice of security contractors.</p>



<p>Even prominent OpTic members agree that COD Champs should be neutral – while insisting that the location <strong>didn’t </strong>‘help OpTic win’ Champs:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>if the argument is “The CDL should make champs neutral to keep a common theme”… i agree </p><p>if the argument is “the fact that 24 Champs wasn’t neutral helped OpTic win”… i strongly disagree</p></div>— OpTic Hitch (@hitchariide) <a href="https://twitter.com/hitchariide/status/1815548860917293271?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>This feedback will undoubtedly cause something of a shift going into the next season, which will unfold using Black Ops 6 as a competitive platform. Will we be heading to a neutral COD Champs in twelve months?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/warframe-1999-romance-dating-tennocon-soulframe<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Warframe </em>rules. I <a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-no-im-hooked-on-warframe-now-1844458537" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first realized this in 2020</a> while stuck inside, absolutely fiending for something to occupy my time. I proceeded to sink nearly 100 hours into the game, which had by that point already been around for nearly a decade. What I discovered was a co-op shooter MMO so rich with inventively implemented systems that it boggled the mind. Then I fell off playing it. Since then, I’ve repeatedly told myself that I’ll one day return to<em> Warframe</em>’s beartrap-like embrace. But four years’ worth of additions mean it’s something of an intimidating proposition, especially when the game keeps adding even more new systems.</p><p>This is, to be clear, not a bad thing unless you are in my specific position. I have always respected <em>Warframe</em>’s dedication to kitchen-sinking so many different game genres that, if you try to describe it to a regular person, it barely sounds real. That in mind, I responded to this weekend’s announcement that the game’s next expansion – the amusingly throwback-y <a href="https://www.warframe.com/1999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Warframe: 1999</em></a> – will include a dating system with both a knowing nod and a sigh of exasperation.&nbsp;</p><p>"Unlike other syndicates, when you arrive, we want you to be able to get a little closer with them,” creative director Rebb Ford said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi0fgygNwvk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a live demo of the expansion</a> at developer Digital Extremes’ annual TennoCon event. “So for this syndicate, because we are in 1999 ... we figure you should be able to use instant messengers and build a romance system with any one of them. If you play your cards right, one of those six, including [expansion protagonist] Arthur, could be your New Year's kiss."</p><p>So basically, the expansion is introducing a whole new cast of characters, and you can romance any of them via a fleshed-out dialogue tree and text interface. It’s more than just a gimmick, a recurring theme with <em>Warframe</em>’s teetering tower of systems. Here, for the uninitiated, is a non-comprehensive list of the others:</p><ul><li><span>Space ninja combat</span></li><li><span>Cover shooter combat</span></li><li><span>Hoverboarding (with tricks)</span></li><li><span>Fishing</span></li><li><span>Open-world exploration</span></li><li><span>Linear corridor crawling (with <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Mission" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dozens of variations</a>)</span></li><li><span>Cinematic story quests</span></li><li><span>Character creation (one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/warframes-big-twist-knocked-my-brain-clean-out-of-my-he-1844882545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest twists in video games</a>)</span></li><li><span>Moral alignment</span></li><li><span>Faction reputation ranks</span></li><li><span>Mining</span></li><li><span>Clans</span></li><li><span>First-person crime scene investigation</span></li><li><span>Pet capture/raising</span></li><li><span>Weapon upgrading</span></li><li><span>Additional weapon upgrade systems that each <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Incarnon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">require their own wiki pages</a> to fully explain</span></li><li><span>Flesh mech collection/upgrading</span></li><li><span>Bigger mech collection/upgrading</span></li><li><span>Flesh mech ability mixing/matching (after you feed them to <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Helminth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a giant, pustule-spotted mouth</a>)</span></li><li><span>Flesh mech fashion</span></li><li><span>Ship battles</span></li><li><span>Bigger, cooperative ship battles</span></li><li><span>Ship upgrading</span></li><li><span>Adversaries (basically <em>Warframe</em>’s version of <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>’s Nemesis system)</span></li><li><span>Hacking</span></li><li><span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPTCq3LiZSE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Musicals</a></span></li><li><span>Kahl's Garrison</span></li><li><span>Duviri (a roguelike mode)</span></li><li><span>Pool parties (with floaties)</span></li></ul><p>Now, some of these systems have at various points fallen by the wayside or proven to be less than the sum of their parts due to the inescapable gravitational pull of the game’s grind-y core, but you can’t accuse Digital Extremes of resting on its laurels.

            <p>
Developer NetherRealm has pulled the plug on its free-to-play mobile game Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, just days after the studio reportedly laid off its entire mobile team.
</p>
<p>
Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a character-collecting RPG featuring faces from across the fighting series, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-new-mortal-kombat-role-playing-game-coming">announced</a> in October 2022 and arrived <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-onslaughts-free-to-play-rpg-battling-is-officially-available-now">almost exactly one year later</a>. It promised a "mobile-exclusive" story and "massive real-time group battles" for up to ten fighters.
</p>
<p>
Nine months on, however, and Onslaught is officially shutting down. NetherRealm <a href="https://x.com/mkonslaught/status/1814057567422750937">announced the news</a> on Twitter/X, writing, "We are sorry to inform you that Mortal Kombat: Onslaught will close its operations in October. It has been an honour creating this game for our Kommunity, and we appreciate the enthusiasm from our fans."

<p>
Onslaught will be pulled from iOS and Android stores today, 22nd July, but in-app purchases will continue until 23rd August. The game will be playable until 21st October this year.
</p>
<p>
News of Mortal Kombat: Onslaught's impending closure comes after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-studio-netherrealm-hit-by-layoffs">claims from NetherRealm employees</a> last week that the studio's mobile division had been laid off. At the time, it was noted the team was responsible for live service operations on three games - Mortal Kombat Mobile, Injustice 2, and Mortal Kombat: Onslaught - and while NetherRealm is yet to comment on the job cuts, it did <a href="https://x.com/MKMobileGame/status/1814387218443821252">move quickly</a> to assure Mortal Kombat Mobile players the game would "continue operations and have full support."
</p>
<p>
Those layoffs followed parent company Warner Bros. Discovery's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">admission in February</a> it was bracing for a "tough year", after it revealed sales of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League had failed to meet its expectations. The cuts appear to be a part of <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-lays-off-1000-employees-finance-max-1236074169/">wider job losses at the company</a>, but the decision to lay off NetherRealm's mobile team is perhaps surprising given Warner Bros' announcement in March it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-focusing-on-mobile-and-free-to-play-instead-of-volatile-aaa-console-games">shifting its focus to mobile, free-to-play, and live-service titles</a> to combat what it called the "volatile" AAA market.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Multiversus is the first and <a href="https://multiversus.com/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only game made</a> by Player First Games studio. Initially announced in 2022 after leaks, it was put into beta from June 2022 to June 2023. As of May 2024, the game is fully released. Considering the number of characters from Warner Bros. IPs in this game, it is no surprise that Warner Bros. has officially acquired Player First Games.</p>
<p>Those curious about what it means for Player First will remain under the guidance of co-founders Tony Huynh and Chris White, who will be the studio head and head of technology. They will now report to Warner Bros. Games San Diego's studio head and VP, Carlos Barbosa, in these new roles.</p>
<p>Fans are concerned about this acquisition and what it means for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/multiversus-stuck-in-a-betaverse/">Multiversus</a>. While it was in a significantly better place during the beta, there could still be hope for the game. However, under WB, it's possible that a multitude of things could happen.</p>
<p>The games industry is an incredibly volatile workplace, with layoffs across game companies. From Riot and EA to even smaller companies like Tango Gameworks being closed down completely, it is difficult to tell whether projects will be viable or whether companies have enough livability in the industry as it currently stands.</p>
<p>"We have worked with Player First Games over several years to create and launch Multiversus, and we are very pleased to welcome this team to Warner Bros. Games. The bright and creative team at Player First Games adds to our extensive development capabilities," says Warner Bros. President David Haddad. Whether this team will be exclusively working on Multiversus or whether they will be invited to work on other projects remains to be seen. However, the statement suggests that there could be other games for Player First Games to work on.</p>
<p>In response to David Haddad's announcement, Huynh also added to the statement, expressing his positive outlook on the company's future and the development of Multiversus. "Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, which is great for Multiversus overall. We are working to make Multiversus the best game experience it can be, and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players."</p>
<p>We're unsure what updates are planned for Multiversus and whether premium content will be added to the game or a price tag will be introduced for the base game overall now that they are working entirely in collaboration with Warner Bros. Games.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/cascadero-board-game-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cascadero-board-game-review.934149/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cascadero-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Dr. Reiner Knizia might not be a household name, but it’s one of the most recognizable monikers in board gaming, thanks to his astonishingly prolific career, peppered with highly acclaimed titles like auction classic Ra, heavyweight tile-layer Tigris &amp; Euphrates and other great <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults"><u>board games for adults</u></a>. In recent years, the good doctor has slowed the pace of hits a little, but he still pops up with the goods from time to time, such as 2021’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witchstone-board-game-review"><u>Witchstone</u></a>. Cascadero is his newest fare, and the big question is whether it’ll measure up to those big Knizia titles of yesteryear.</p><h2>What’s in the Box</h2><div catalogid="c77b0238-0f78-470e-b589-673c2948b522" id="202260"><div id="202260" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Cascadero</h3></p></div><p>Cascadero comes in a worryingly slimline box, but the rich and vibrant cover art by Ian O’Toole, depicting a medieval messenger on a rearing horse, should allay any concerns about the quality of the contents. And once that lid slides off, any lingering doubts should vanish as the tray is packed with high-quality goodies.</p><p>There’s a bright fold-out, double-sided board with artwork to match the box cover, and a sheet of plain punch-out hex counters which is used on one of that board’s sides to play a variant. Some people might find the mix of vibrant player colors and muted background a little garish and others might find it affects readability a little, but these are minor complaints.</p><p>The rest of the components are wooden. Each of four player colors comes with a troop of little figures on horseback, and a bunting of flags to mark scoring achievements on the board. There’s also a bag of fake wax seals, resplendent in red and gold. Everything is neat, and nicely cut, and while it won’t win over folk who want legions of super-detailed miniatures on their tables, it’s great visual design in the European gaming tradition.</p><h2>Rules and How it Plays</h2><p>Like most Knizia titles, Cascadero has a theme that can rapidly be tossed aside to reveal an engaging semi-abstract design beneath. In this instance, you are placing messengers onto a hex grid studded with towns, trying to win the inhabitants over to the glorious reign of El Cascadero, the new ruler. But the townsfolk are suspicious, and will only listen to messengers who travel in groups. In game terms, this means that you get to score if you place a messenger piece next to a town, and it forms a group of at least two pieces of your color.</p><p>But there’s a catch. You can only score if it’s not only a group of two, but also if no other members of that group were adjacent to that town before. In other words, if you place one piece next to a town, it does nothing and if you then place a second piece next to the same town, it still does nothing. The initial piece of your group can’t be adjacent to the town you want to score. </p><p>While there are obvious reasons for this – it’d be impossible to track whether you’d scored a town before, otherwise – it also offers the first deliciously painful edge to dig into your decision-making. That board is pretty cramped. Aside for a few edge hexes, it’s hard to put a piece down that’s not immediately adjacent to a town, and that in itself is inefficient as you can’t then score it, only use it as a launchpad for neighboring towns.</p><p>Why is this important? Because the towns come in different colors, and scoring one will advance your token on the matching scoring track. The number of spaces you climb depends on the situation. One space if it’s the first piece to make contact with the town, two if there are other messengers already adjacent to the town and three if the town contains a herald, marked on the board by a star icon. Four of the scoring tracks offer the same bonuses, while the fifth, white, has extra goodies to snaffle. The catch is that you need to advance the track that matches your player color to the top space in order to be in with a chance of winning.</p><p>Remember how that board is cramped? Well, now you have additional dilemmas in deciding where to place your one precious piece each turn. Because you get a bonus space on the scoring track if there’s already a messenger adjacent to the town, pieces you put down that don’t score yourself aren’t merely inefficient, they’re a positive boon to your opponents. Not only that, but all of you will be champing at the bit to claim scarce territory around those herald towns, and those of your own player color, and so it’s a race to get them, but it’s also a race where every step gifts your enemies with possible scoring opportunities, while you try and digest this endless stack of problems and your eyes turn to saucers just thinking about it.</p><p>Yet there’s more. Moving up a scoring track doesn’t necessarily score you any points. There are other bonuses to net on your climb, from extra turns, to extra spaces on the track, to moving one of your pieces to a new board space. You can also gain seals, which are extremely useful as they allow a single piece to count as two, meaning you can score a town with one placement. But you can only get these if you land exactly on the matching space, not if you skip up by two or three, adding another headache to deal with as you plot your moves. </p><p>You might imagine that the dynamic, interactive nature of play, where you’re all jostling for position while trying not to let each other score, would make this chiefly a game of tactics rather than a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy board game</a>. But thanks to those bonuses on the scoring track, that’s not the case. When you gain extra on-board moves or on-track spaces, if you’re well set up, it can trigger a cascade of scoring opportunities as one advancement earns a free one, which earns a free move, which earns another free advancement and so on. These chains can be absolutely devastating if you’ve planned and timed it right, letting you bag a majority of those precious seals, or score the big points by closing off an achievement.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All this goodness, and we haven’t even mentioned the included variants.</p></div><p>That’s right: while you can earn points on the tracks, the bigger payouts are available for being the first to reach certain milestones, such as connecting all five colors of town with a single group, or being the first to the top of a given track. There are less high-pressure goals for connecting two matching color towns with a group, which anyone can earn at any time, with a fat ten points extra if you do this with all five colors. But remember: unless you reach the top of your own color scoring track, it doesn’t matter how many points you have as the victory will go to the high-scoring player who has, making denial of scoring opportunities a valid and punishing end game strategy.</p><p>All this goodness, and we haven’t even mentioned the included variants. The advanced version allows you to move those important heralds each time they’re scored, creating an even more pressured race environment as you look to corner those bonuses for yourself. And there’s the farmer variant, where you flip the board, replacing some cities with a random placement of farmer tiles that earn you similar rewards to the scoring tracks. This results in a much more varied and cerebral experience. The striking thing is that each of the three ways to play is clearly the same game, but each feels like it has its own style and approach, offering three distinct challenges to master.</p><h2>Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/yLEpw?object_uuid=298059a5-4aca-439a-99d5-332c5aed76cd&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/joEyv?object_uuid=298059a5-4aca-439a-99d5-332c5aed76cd&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 22, 2024 8:30 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Although it’s quite straightforward to learn, Cascadero peels back new layers of unforeseen depth each time you play it, and that combination is the mark of a truly great game. Like a chameleon, it differs markedly depending on player count and variant, meaning there’s a whole lot of game to enjoy in this deceptively slimline box. Those who only want to game for thrills and spills need not apply, but for anyone else, this is an easy recommendation. And in a market dominated by high production value games with complex, interlocking rule sets, it’s great to have an older master designer remind us that in board games less can still be more.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tiny-garden">Tiny Garden</a> is a puzzle game about planting flowers and crops you can then sell to buy seeds for new types of flowers and crops. That would be charming enough on its own, but your agricultural endeavours are set inside a Polly Pocket-style toy, with crops also able to be exchanged for furniture with which to decorate your diorama home. After blowing past its Kickstarter target, there's now a playable demo.

<p>It's only 20-minutes or so long, more of a "proof-of-concept" than a full demo, say the developers, with many unfinished features. It'll also only be available for the remainder of the Kickstarter pledge drive, which comes to an end on August 2nd.

<p>That said, I've just played it and I had fun. Plopping down plants to modify adjacent tiles, to irrigate soil or grow grass, and thus create platforms for planting new types of seeds, is a satisfying challenge. It reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concrete-jungle">Concrete Jungle</a>, which used a similar system as the underpinnings of a citybuilder.
</p>
<p>I'm also just in love with the presentation. I did not have Polly Pockets as a kid, or the so-called boy equivalent, Mighty Max, which swapped the makeup cases and domestic scenes for monster heads and creepy dungeons. We ignored such boneheaded gender essentialism with our own son and bought a sackful of old, secondhand Polly Pockets from eBay however, and he adored them. I must have spent dozens of hours hunched over them with him, acting out stories, our imaginations lit up by their intricate construction. 
</p>
<p>Matt beat me to covering Tiny Garden when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tiny-garden-plants-a-charming-cozy-farming-sim-inside-virtual-polly-pocket-toys">it launched on Kickstarter</a> earlier this month, but officially I'm writing about it again now because it's got a playable demo. Unofficially I'm writing about it so that I can say: a Polly Pocket mansion with a secret room behind a bookcase is infinitely cooler than a Mighty Max skull dungeon.</p>

                <p>Epic recently announced an unexpected collaboration with Tesla, the electric car company. Starting Tuesday, July 23, players will be able to drive a Cybertruck in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/"> Fortnite</a> and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rocket-league/"> Rocket League</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The<a href="https://x.com/RocketLeague/status/1815386430710874530" rel="nofollow "> Rocket League</a> and<a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1815386568263110908?t=KLQ6PtB8nv0z2Bm5Oq5yng&amp;s=19" rel="nofollow "> Fortnite X/Twitter accounts</a> posted teasers about what players can expect. The Rocket League collaboration looks to be a standard one for the game, as real-life and fictional cars have been released as premium DLC in the past.</p><p dir="ltr">But as for Fortnite, the collab could be anything, seeing as the most current season is heavily tied to vehicle combat. As of this writing, it's unclear if the Cybertruck will serve as a boss car or if it can be modified with weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Although these announcements may seem completely random at first, both games had <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1815084377535078540/photo/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teased a similar image</a> on its X/Twitter accounts of a tire mark across some white spray paint.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Epic has teamed up with a real-world car company. In Fortnite, players can purchase a Ferrari 296; in Rocket League, they can buy Aston Martin Valhalla, BMWs, and much more.</p><p dir="ltr">The Cybertruck's unusual, blocky looks have been compared to those of low-poly video game cars in the past, so its appearance in games seems fitting. The real-life version has been impacted by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tesla-cybertruck-recall-fourth-time-f3709f24063695bc231763fb07d7d700" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a number of recalls since it launched last year</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This wasn't the only collaboration Epic has recently announced.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/7th-sea-price-of-arrogance-is-first-major-campaign-for-pirates-ttrpg<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <em>7th Sea</em> book has been announced. Chaosium and Studio Agate's high-seas swashbuckling TTRPG will receive its first major official campaign. The campaign, called <em>7th Sea The Price of Arrogance, </em>is packed with world-spanning peril, danger, and exciting action.</p>
<h2>7th Sea The Price of Arrogance Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, <em>7th Sea The Price of Arrogance</em> is a 300-page adventure book. The campaign is broken up into three acts and contains different gameplay options. These include Paths, which lets Game Masters tailor the story to their favorite playstyle.</p>

<p>As for the adventure itself, it is described as a mix of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/indiana-jones-and-great-circle-coming-in-2024-for-xbox-and-pc-details-and-gameplay" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Indiana Jones</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sea-of-thieves-pirates-life-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em></a>, and <em>Treasure Island</em>. Adventurers will travel from Montaigne's imperial courts to the New World's jungles. The journey may hold priceless treasures, but seekers of fortune will do well to keep their pride in check. The price of arrogance is quite high on the seven seas.</p>
<p><em>7th Sea The Price of Arrogance </em>won't be arriving in retail but through a Kickstarter campaign. According to Chaosium, the book is already written and illustrated; the campaign is there for players who want to pick up extras, which includes dedicated game master screens, maps, handouts, and storage boxes.</p>
<p>The book will also be available in two different collector's editions. The first is the Montaigne edition, which will feature alternative cover art. The second is the Pirate edition, which comes in black faux leather. The latter is similar to the collector's edition of the <em>7th Sea</em> Core Rulebook which was offered in its initial Kickstarter campaign.</p>
<p>Lastly, the campaign will offer core books. Allowing curious players to get a taste of the freedom that is the pirate's life. These core books not only include gameplay mechanics, but worldbuilding details, illustrating different locations, nations, and organizations.</p>
<p>If you miss the <em>7th Sea The Price of Arrogance</em> Kickstarter campaign, it will be coming to retail stores in 2025. At the time of writing, the campaign has not gone live.</p>

Nintendo originally created only 26 of these gold cartridges as prizes for <em>Nintendo Power</em> magazine readers in 1990. They’re so hard to come by that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/2/5/5380924/nintendo-world-championships-cartridge-sells-for-100k-on-ebay">one sold on eBay for $100,088</a> a decade ago.</p><p>Hundreds of cartridges were created<strong> </strong>for the 1990 Nintendo World Championships, an event that toured the United States trying to find the country’s best gamers. Players competed for high scores in timed versions of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, <em>Tetris</em>, and <em>Rad Racer,</em> which were all bundled onto special cartridges featuring physical switches, allowing the games’ time limits to be modified. </p><p>Most of these cartridges featured standard gray NES shells, but 26 of them were upgraded with a shiny gold housing and given away to winners of <em>Nintendo Power</em> magazine’s “Player’s Poll Contest” that same year.</p><p>According to Goldin, this particular gold cartridge was the one awarded to Patrick King of Cheyenne, Wyoming, whose <a href="https://archive.org/details/Nintendo_Power_Issue001-Issue127/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20018%20November-December%201990/page/n103/mode/2up?view=theater">name appeared in volume 18 of <em>Nintendo Power</em></a>, along with the other Player’s Poll Contest winners. </p><p>These games were never sold in packaging, which partly explains why this particular cartridge, which appears worn and is missing its label, was given just a 4.0 grade by <a href="https://www.cgcgrading.com/en-US">CGC Grading</a>. (A grading of 10 would indicate mint condition.)</p><p>Despite the cartridge’s rough shape, bidding tonight will start at $10,000. According to the <a href="https://goldin.co/faq">FAQ page on the auction house’s website</a>, at that level, potential buyers will be prescreened to ensure they can pay up. That will help protect the cartridge’s unknown seller, but what about buyers? </p><p>Faking a rare cartridge like this and fooling CGC Grading would be a huge but profitable undertaking given the current demand for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24194869/nintendo-playstation-gaming-auction-rare-snes">rare retro games and hardware</a>. The easiest way to confirm that this one is legit is to win the auction and plug the cartridge into an actual NES, but that could end up being a budget-busting approach best left to deep-pocketed collectors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Alongside Team Of 3 mode, and other new characters</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Fighting game tournament EVO 2024 took place this weekend, an annual event marked by fierce competition between the best players in the world and several update announcements for just about every fighting game going. The most exciting this year, to me: Lucy from Cyberpunk 2077 anime Edgerunners is joining the roster of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guilty-gear-strive-">Guilty Gear Strive</a>.

<p>Season four of Guilty Gear Strive will introduce a new Team Of 3 mode, new stages, a new character called Unika, two fighters returning from previous Guilty Gear games, Queen Dizzy and Venom, and Lucy from Edgerunners. It's out today, and it'll cost £23 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1384160/GUILTY_GEAR_STRIVE/">from Steam</a>. The base game is currently 50% reduced, meanwhile, at £18.49.
</p>
<p>I'm a big Cyberpunk fan, but I've only seen a couple episodes of Edgerunners and I have no particularly affection for Lucy. My interest here lies mainly in how stunning Guilty Gear Strive looks. It's the game I tuned into watch at this year's EVO, because although I have only a passing understanding of fighting games, and no ability to parse high level tournament play, its character design and animation are worth the effort of trying. I feel similarly about Studio Trigger, the Japanese animation studio behind Edgerunners and Lucy's character design. She doesn't seem to have heard of trousers or to know what belts are for, but I want to see her in Strive.
</p>
<p>Guilty Gear is getting its own anime. Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers is coming next year from Sanzigen Studio, and new character Unika is apparently a key character from the show. A teaser trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODo4fjcPkbI&amp;ab_channel=arcsystemworks">dropped a couple of weeks ago</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> development studio Player First Games has been acquired by the game's publisher, Warner Bros. The studio's co-founders will continue to lead the studio. The platform figher's second season is due to go live tomorrow, adding a ranked mode and new characters Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall. We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players," said game director Tony Huynh in a statement <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-multiversus-player-first-games-acquisition">sent to IGN</a>.
</p>
<p>MultiVersus is a free-to-play, live service brawler that draws its roster of characters from across Warner Bros. properties, from Looney Tunes to DC superheroes, Adventure Time to Rick &amp; Morty. It's had a protracted development so far, launching in open beta back in 2022, postponing its first season of updates in response to feedback, then going offline entirely in early 2023 for re-tooling.
</p>
<p>It returned on May 28th of this year, with revamped art, new characters and levels, and a PvE mode. We haven't paid it much mind around here since, although we liked the initial beta well enough. Our cousins over at Eurogamer were less kind towards the relaunch, calling it a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-is-a-smash-bros-clone-that-feels-like-a-smartphone-game-spoiled-by-its-monetisation">Smash Bros. derivative spoiled by its monetisation</a>.
</p>
<p>I like Smash Bros. a good amount, both as a knockabout couch experience and as baby's-first-fighting-game to play with my kid. It's nice MultiVersus is an entry in the genre that's available on PC, but I can't imagine ditching Nintendo's take for a microtransaction treadmill with characters like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-smash-bros-fighter-multiversus-adds-friday-the-13ths-jason-and-the-matrixs-agent-smith-to-its-already-preposterous-roster">Jason from Friday The 13th</a>.</p>

            <p>
Just weeks after Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">major Xbox Game Pass shakeup</a>, a new report claims the company is mulling over a variety of additional subscription tiers in a bid to expand the service's reach, including a tier offering access to the Game Pass catalogue exclusively via cloud gaming.
</p>
<p>
That's according Windows Central's Jez Corden who, in a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/whats-next-for-xbox-game-pass-tiers-and-return-of-family-plan">lengthy article</a> discussing Game Pass' future, claims to have heard from sources that Microsoft's is "working towards" a cloud-only version that would be "cheaper and more approachable" than Game Pass Ultimate.
</p>
<p>
The aim is said to be two-fold, with Microsoft hoping the tier will appeal to those put off by the upfront costs of a console, as well as to existing owners of competing consoles who don't want to buy an Xbox but might find the Game Pass catalogue appealing. It's reportedly also intending to monetise the cloud-only service further by offering digital ownership of individual games in its catalogue, should a user wish to buy something outright.

<p> 
Furthermore, it seems Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass Friends and Family Plan experiment isn't dead either, based on what Corden calls "very tentative" rumours. A version of the plan, which would enable five people to share access to Game Pass Ultimate at a significant discount, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-friends-and-family-preview-ends-next-month-microsoft-confirms">trialled between September 2022 and August 2023</a>, but it never progressed to a worldwide release. Additionally, Corden says one initiative Microsoft had previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-may-be-introducing-cheaper-ad-supported-xbox-game-pass-tiers">hinted it was considering</a> - an ad-based tier for Xbox Game Pass - isn't something it's "actively working towards" right now. </p>
<p>
Talk of further expansions to Microsoft's existing Xbox Game Pass tiers comes just two weeks after the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">confirmed sweeping changes</a> to its subscription service in the run-up to October's launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. These changes included the removal of day one releases for its overhauled basic tier, plus price increases across the board.
</p>
<p>
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-slams-microsofts-xbox-game-pass-tier-changes-calls-it-a-degraded-product">slammed Microsoft's revised Game Pass tiers</a> in a filing with the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, calling the new offering a "degraded product" and "exactly the sort of consumer harm from the [Activision Blizzard] merger the FTC has alleged". In response, Microsoft told the court the FTC's claims were "wrong" and "misleading", insisting the agency "barely mentioned [concerns about] subscription[s] at trial".
</p>
<p>
Away from the drama, Microsoft has announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flock-leads-day-one-releases-still-to-come-to-xbox-game-pass-this-july">strong month of additions for Xbox Game Pass</a>, with July bringing the likes of Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn , Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Dungeons of Hinterberg, Flock, The Case of the Golden Idol, Neon White, and more.

He pounds down a bottle of pills, takes a swig of alcohol from his flask (while another unopened bottle of moonshine sits in the background), gets sad about his dead wife, and talks about being a disgraced detective who plays fast and loose with the law. This all happens before he gets a call from the police chief letting him know that he’s getting reinstated for a high-profile case. I love it.<br></p><p><em>Nobody Wants to Die</em>, from developer Critical Hit Games, is a loving homage to classic noir films. Sure, the game is set in a retro-futuristic New York City full of floating cars and science that makes people live forever, but at its core it’s just a pulpy crime thriller. It doesn’t subvert the tropes of the genre and it’s better for it, instead opting to be a fun, tropey mystery that plays it all incredibly straight. Critical Hit has built a wonderfully gritty noir world here, one that’s worth spending time in.</p><figure id="" data-id="d45cd42a6ec81f655a56374153de5ed4" data-recommend-id="image://d45cd42a6ec81f655a56374153de5ed4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large foyer with two staircases and a tree in the middle burn down" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large foyer with two staircases and a tree in the middle burn down" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->PLAION</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d45cd42a6ec81f655a56374153de5ed4" data-recommend-id="image://d45cd42a6ec81f655a56374153de5ed4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large foyer with two staircases and a tree in the middle burn down" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The crime that kicks off the story is the death of a man named Green, responsible for this futuristic city’s biggest achievement: immortality. In <em>Nobody Wants to Die</em>, people are able to transfer their consciousness between bodies. Even when your body dies, you can just buy a new one, though it isn’t cheap. Now Green is dead, and the killer did the job so well he won’t get a chance to come back. From here, the five-to-six hour tale sprints towards its conclusion. That short runtime is a godsend, as it feels perfectly fit for the pulpy adventure.<br></p><p>As disgraced but temporarily reinstated detective James Karra, you go to a series of crime scenes in order to unravel a grand conspiracy. What starts as an apparent suicide quickly becomes something more sinister, with the entire upper echelon of New York society somehow involved. In this regard, <em>Nobody Wants to Die </em>is doing its own take on noir classics like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(1974_film)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(1974_film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Chinatown</em></a></span>, and it works really well. Of course this story has the added element of sci-fi detective tools, so Karra gets to rewind crime scenes to reconstruct what happened. This is the main thing you’ll be doing: scrubbing backwards and forwards through the events of a crime in search of clues that help you piece together exactly what happened. </p><p>There are a handful of other tools at your disposal (a UV lamp to see old blood trails, an X-ray to find secret compartments, etc.) but the gameplay itself is fairly straightforward and hand-holdy. I don’t actually have a problem with that, as each clue is primarily an excuse for Karra and his partner Sara to talk through the case and its particulars, giving you new information. You’re given just enough to do to feel occupied without focus being pulled from the main draw, the elaborate mystery at the game’s center. Most of my time at crime scenes was spent listening attentively to dialogue and trying to wrap my head around the case.<br></p><p>Crime scenes are also <em>Nobody Wants to Die</em>’s most stunning moments to just look at. That is true even with the game’s first big set piece, a massive penthouse with a grand staircase and a huge cherry tree in the center of it all. When you first get there the entire room is ablaze, including the tree. As you reconstruct the timeline, you can rewind and watch the flames flicker and die down in reverse as color comes back into the tree’s leaves. It’s pretty spectacular. A floating bar and a secret sex club also make appearances, and each one is a delightful playground to walk around in, even if it’s just to look at all the details while listening to dialogue. That dialogue is also wonderfully written. Karra and Sara do the bulk of the talking, and they constantly hit on noir tropes without making them seem tired.</p><figure id="" data-id="4244e7bb3346796e8941206ae9f8fcfb" data-recommend-id="image://4244e7bb3346796e8941206ae9f8fcfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A mustachioed man stabs another man under him" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A mustachioed man stabs another man under him" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->PLAION</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4244e7bb3346796e8941206ae9f8fcfb" data-recommend-id="image://4244e7bb3346796e8941206ae9f8fcfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A mustachioed man stabs another man under him" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That visual splendor extends to the rest of <em>Nobody Wants to Die</em>, it’s part of its very essence. The entire world of the game is built on a stunning aesthetic that blends 40’s flare with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/blade-runner-enhanced-edition-remake-rerelease-pc-steam-1849111500&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/blade-runner-enhanced-edition-remake-rerelease-pc-steam-1849111500"><em>Blade Runner</em></a></span> grit. It’s a mashup of art deco decor and purely industrial metal. It’s incredibly evocative just on sight, in much the same way that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/there-s-always-a-lighthouse-there-s-always-bioshock-sw-1843763314&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/there-s-always-a-lighthouse-there-s-always-bioshock-sw-1843763314"><em>BioShock</em></a></span>’s Rapture is. The path through the world you take is just as directed as the gameplay segments at crime scenes, but it never feels constricting thanks to the incredible level of detail in every space you do get to explore. Everything in <em>Nobody Wants to Die</em> has a place in a larger tapestry, be that the conspiracy you are trying to solve or the city of New York itself. The game’s ending (or endings, since there are multiple) don’t quite tie up all the fascinating threads and world-building with the same excellent execution as the rest of the narrative, but it didn’t put too sour of a taste in my mouth. I had a good ride, even if the finale was a bit lackluster.<br></p><p>What surprised me most in my time with <em>Nobody Wants to Die</em> was its deep lore. The premise of a future without death isn’t just a shallow idea that starts the mystery, it’s a moral and ethical quandary that Critical Hit Games investigates at every turn. In 2329 New York, we hear talk of bodies as literal government property. That’s as horrific an idea as you would imagine, and the game digs into this with further details like drinking and smoking being illegal so as to not ruin a body for its next owner, a subscription fee you must pay to use your body, and the emergence of a new death kink for rich people who can afford to buy poor bodies and take them over just to get killed in for a quick high before returning to their old body. It’s a biting allegory of wealth inequality and how rich people see poor people as a literal commodity to control. Learning more about this world is one of the best parts of <em>Nobody Wants to Die</em> and the flavor text you can find is full of interesting tidbits that only add to your understanding of the crimes at its center. This game came out of nowhere for me, but its tightly paced film noir mystery is built on such a fascinating world that it’s quickly become one of my favorite sleeper hits of 2024.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

During the day you explore the map with your troops, killing nearby enemies and salvaging resources, while also building up your settlement and preparing for the onslaught of Horrors at night. Balanced development means having the resources you need to build strong defenses, while the battles at night are mostly about sitting back and watching your best laid plans creak and crumble under the stress of the the hordes. </p><figure id="" data-id="34e1cb053480ff8679bf67542eae1670" data-recommend-id="image://34e1cb053480ff8679bf67542eae1670" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bridge crosses a chasm of mist.

What sets <em>Cataclismo</em> apart isn’t necessarily what you build but <em>how</em> you build it. While buildings like homes and barracks are standard, pre-made units, walls, towers, and bridges for crossing the game’s fractured world are all constructed individually block-by-block. And because maps are so dense, the most efficient way to build up a settlement while also keeping it secure is to expand upwards instead of outwards. The result often looks like dark fantasy shanty town held up by a labyrinth of stone walls and wooden scaffolding. Maybe this sounds tedious to you. I promise it’s not.<br></p><p>I mentioned air purifiers earlier. Clean air is a key resource in <em>Cataclismo</em>. Buildings need it. Soldiers need it. And researching upgrades also requires a big chunk. Capturing it requires building an air purifier high enough off the ground that you get as much air harvested per minute as possible. Building it high off the ground means creating a tall block of wood scaffolding and, because all buildings must be accessible to ambient workers controlled automatically by your settlement in order to produce resources, it also needs a staircase that reaches all the way to the top. You get to control all of this by linking together each individual piece, which clicks into place with the satisfying precision (most of the time) and sound not unlike actual Lego.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="e3ad9bb81ed0de9281e4be9165bd43a0" data-recommend-id="image://e3ad9bb81ed0de9281e4be9165bd43a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wall stands tall in a post-apocalyptical landscape.

Build stone windows and you get to stack multiple lines of archers. But then you also need to make the stairs for them to get up there, and make sure they’re not so close to the action that they fall and tumble to their death if and when the Horrors start chewing through the outer layers of your defenses.<br></p><p>The third leg of this is trying hard to maximize the space you have by stacking everything as close together as possible. Homes and barracks have stone roofs you can build on top of. Wood and stone arches let you build your base into mini-cathedrals that feel like <em>King Arthur</em> meets <em>Blade Runner</em>. And the myriad other buildings, technologies, and unit types (which I’ve only begun to explore the latter stages of in my playthroughs) build on that fantasy and the satisfaction of grafting together short-term and unwieldy medieval city planning solutions into a community that manages, against all odds, to repel the darkness each night.</p><figure id="" data-id="fae7a77654c3ded49a75394a4fa437fe" data-recommend-id="image://fae7a77654c3ded49a75394a4fa437fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Horrors storm the castle walls.

But <em>Cataclismo</em> is also tailor-made to worm its way into my head and make me obsessed. As a kid, before <em>Game of Thrones</em> even existed, I was building massive walls in my bedroom patrolled by army men who used an elevator made out of my erector set to carry them up to the top level. At the beach I didn’t just make towering drippy sand castles surrounded by sea walls, I also separated them into districts and carved out sewers for drainage. I have spent many hours with my kids stacking Duplo blocks into Jenga-like towers held up by precarious staircases and stilts, searching for the invisible point between something breaking and it being strong enough to survive.<br></p><p><em>Cataclismo</em> channels a bit of each of those experiences into a well-balanced strategy game where planning and building is often even more rewarding than watching battles you’ve spent so much time preparing for play out. It takes a lot of what worked so well in <em>They Are Billions</em> and adds a whole new layer of verticality to the proceedings. The shift makes for a more aesthetically interesting city builder where creativity and self-expression have as much of a role in the decision-making as simply trying to min-max resources and defensive capabilities. </p><p>I’m not sure if <em>Cataclismo</em> will ultimately have the same legs in terms of combat and tactics in its latter stages that that game had. For now though, its Early Access journey is off to a great start. </p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Rumors that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 began to surface first by Windows Central's Jez Corden, <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1815175561607618798" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who reported</a> earlier this month that Modern Warfare 3 was coming to Game Pass in July.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is the latest mainline entry in Activision's wildly popular first-person shooter series and is a reboot of the Modern Warfare sub-series of games. In our review of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-multiplayer-review">multiplayer component for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a>, my colleague Stella Chung wrote: "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 reheats and reserves the same multiplayer from Modern Warfare 2 with some extra maps and tweaks as garnishes. This smooth combat remains gaming comfort food, but slower unlock progression makes it harder to get excited about."</p><p>Rumors of a previously released Call of Duty game come a week after Xbox announced that it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike">once again raising the prices of Xbox Game Pass</a>. The Ultimate tier will increase its monthly fee by $3, while the Game Pass Console tier will be replaced with Xbox Game Pass Standard, which will cost subscribers $14.99 per month. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.
