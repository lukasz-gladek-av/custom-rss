			<p>CI Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-gets-first-look-at-gameplay-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debuted the first gameplay trailer of Lords of the Fallen II</a> at The Game Awards 2025, confirming the 2026 release window <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-debut-trailer-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned earlier this year</a>. </p>



<p>The trailer showcased some of the improvements confirmed for this sequel, including the introduction of a brand new dismemberment feature, which enables players to neutralize their opponents in a more decisive and expedient manner. This feature is complemented by the addition of novel executions, which further refine the combat experience. The press release also promised an even greater diversity of enemy types and boss battles of such remarkable intricacy that they will challenge even the most hardcore player, whether engaging in solo play, shared progression co-op, or optional PvP multiplayer.</p>



<p>However, there are also some philosophical changes in Lords of the Fallen II. CI Games CEO Marek Tyminski discussed those, as well as his more active role in the development of the sequel, <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/2000284433052758033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>Many of you asked why the game initially had body type A/B. Hexworks started early 2020 as an autonomous studio owned by CI Games. Early on, political correctness and filtering meant not every decision reached me on time. I got a lot more involved from late 2024 and now act as Head of Studio alongside my CEO role. Things are very different now and the studio got fully integrated. We reverted a lot of wrong decisions and will continue improving. Lords of the Fallen II is being built on real player feedback, and it’s crystal clear in the last two trailers.</em></p>



<p>Later in the X thread, a follower asked whether the game would feature attractive female characters and revealing armors, and the executive <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/2000294076826997103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied affirmatively</a>. In another response, he confirmed that enemy placement, one of the most common complaints levied against the predecessor, would be improved in the new title.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the Lords of the Fallen II trailer, publisher CI Games and developer Hexworks have also released a new update for Lords of the Fallen (2023). Enemies and bosses in particular received 'extensive behaviour updates' throughout the game, increasing the level of challenge. Several boss weapons also feature brand new signature attack animations. Lastly, Veteran Mode's bosses have been further empowered with faster transitions, highly aggressive behavior, and new attack patterns.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-expands-its-star-wars-starship-clearance-the-dark-falcon-hits-a-record-low-after-the-millennium-falcon-2000653383</link>
            <guid>1383388</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Millennium Falcon has gotten a dark, evil makeover by LEGO, something we witnessed in LEGO Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy series. You can now bring this sinister piece home for less, thanks to a nice 17% discount on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/">The offer brings the price of the The Dark Falcon Buildable Starship set to $149, making it much more approachable.</a> Grabbing it right now will ensure it arrives before Christmas, which is ideal if you’re planning to surprise a fan of the galaxy far, far away with it. All shoppers get to enjoy free delivery, which adds even more value to the purchase.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Incredible Attention to Detail</h2>
<p>The set is designed for ages 10 and up. A total of 1,579 pieces bring it together, which includes some minifigures, too (more on that later). Over 1500 pieces means it’s not exactly going to be a small, quick build. This is honestly a good thing because this way, you can spend cozy holiday evenings by the fireplace building it with loved ones while talking about Darth Vader’s shenanigans.</p>
<p>You will be building the dark version of the Millennium Falcon as seen in the Rebuild the Galaxy Disney+ special, which features a removable cockpit for 2 LEGO minifigures, 2 spring-loaded shooters, 2 rotating cannons, a gunner post for 2 LEGO minifigures, and a radar dish. Speaking of minifigures, these include Darth Jar Jar, Bounty Hunter C-3PO, Darth Dev, Darth Rey, Beach Luke, and Jedi Vader, plus their cute accessories, lightsabers, and a blue milk carton.</p>



<p>The exterior looks absolutely stunning and realistic, and the interior is just as impressive. You can flip the top panels to play with the details inside. Maybe place Darth Jar Jar on his throne, or help Jedi Vader rescue Beach Luke from the jail cell. There’s a command center, a hyperdrive, and an entertainment area as well. Once put together, this set measures over 5 in. (12 cm) high, 17 in. (43 cm) long, and 12.5 in. (32 cm) wide. It’s going to look incredible as a display piece on your bookshelf with Star Wars books, or even in the kids’ room. The set comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step of the process one by one. It’s quite easy to follow, so if you’re planning to let your kids build in, they can do it without your supervision. LEGO also has its own Builder app, which offers interactive 3D instructions for an even better building experience.</p>
<p>This set is part of the LEGO Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy collection. If you’re looking to go all out this holiday season, you might also want to grab the 75388 Jedi Bob’s Starfighter and 75393 TIE Fighter &amp; X-Wing Mash-up sets, too. There are quite a few options going for less right now, so it’s a good time to create an entire setup without spending a ton. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/">As for this discount, it’s better to grab it sooner rather than later. Holiday rush is already in full swing, and deals are moving fast.</a> This one (like many others) is likely not going to be around for too long. Snap it while it’s still live.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Build To Climb monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Stumps, Pets and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Planting the tallest Stumps to reach the top and potentially to the next map is the primary goal of Build to Climb. Purchasing different Stumps will deplete your treasury and will take some time to earn all the money back. Plus, you will need the help of Pets to boost your Cash income. This is when you should use the active Build to Climb codes. Claim free Stumps and Pets using these codes. You’ll easily reach 9.6km and progress further within a few hours after redeeming the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-sorcerer-battlegrounds-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game codes.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="h-active-build-to-climb-codes-nbsp">Active Build To Climb Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>WELCOMEBUILDTOCLIMB – Mint Stump and Cat</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-inactive-build-to-climb-codes">Inactive Build To Climb Codes</h2>



<p>There are no expired codes in Build to Climb. If any active code goes inactive, it’ll be added here. Redeem all the active codes in a single sitting as they risk going inactive at any moment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-build-to-climb-codes">How To Redeem Build To Climb Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roblox Build To Climb Code Redemption Menu | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="h-more-about-build-to-climb-codes">More About Build To Climb Codes</h2>



<p>Stumps are very important and contribute heavily to the Build to Climb gameplay. Players can easily increase the overall height of their giant stalks by using the free Stumps obtained from codes. The core principle of Build to Climb is that the more distance you cover, the more Cash you earn. You can easily earn thousands of Cash and invest it into new Stumps, however, note that certain Stumps must be unlocked by reaching specific height milestones.</p>



<ul>
<li>Blue Stump – 1km – 10,000$</li>



<li>Chocolate Stump – 2.8km – 40,000$</li>



<li>Purple Stump – 3.9km – 130,000$</li>



<li>Lemon Stump – 6.8km – 800,000$</li>
</ul>



<p>With that sorted, try purchasing Eggs to obtain Pets that provide Cash multipliers. The Cat, which is redeemed from an active code, is part of Egg 1. Below are all the Eggs, their Pets, and their hatch chances:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's the burning question.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian publishing director Michael Douse has explained the studio’s thinking in the wake of the gruesome reveal trailer for Divinity, the Baldur’s Gate 3 studio’s next big role-playing game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity">Divinity</a> was announced at The Game Awards with a CG trailer that features extreme gore and sex. It begins with medieval fantasy villagers preparing for a ritual sacrifice, which involves burning a man alive. The villagers celebrate the occasion by playing music and dancing, laughing and chatting, feasting and drinking. At one point, someone throws up into animal feed. A mother and child look on with anticipation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The burning of the man begins, and here things get very gory indeed. As his flesh tears and he screams in pain, some of the villagers are seen having sex. Others whip themselves. There’s more vomiting. Everyone seems thrilled, but as the burning man dies, something goes horribly wrong.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Disgusting wounds appear on the man. As his arm rips off we get a quick cut to an extreme closeup of someone eating meat. More sex. More vomiting. More pigs eating the vomit. And then the burning man explodes in a shower of gore. Something terrible is pouring out of his body. This, clearly, is not what was supposed to happen, and the villagers flee in terror. In the aftermath we see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yup-that-weird-statue-was-teasing-a-new-divinity-game-the-game-awards-2025">the statue Geoff Keighley has teased ahead of The Game Awards itself</a>. It has not gone well for the villagers, but the pigs look like they're still having a good time mopping up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say the trailer has sparked a great deal of debate. While some have praised the studio for not holding back when it comes to its dark themes (something Baldur’s Gate 3 won plaudits for), others have said the trailer goes too far. Indeed some have accused Larian of "pushing the morale line" with the trailer, labeling it “gore porn.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Douse has explained what Larian was going for here. In a <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2000000527409807405" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet response</a> to illustrator and YouTuber Kala Elizabeth, who had praised the studio for refusing to “hold back or sanitize stories to make them more palatable,” Douse said the Divinity trailer wasn’t about shocking the audience, rather “treating the audience with a level of intellectual respect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The phrase ‘treating the audience with a level of intellectual respect’ came up a lot in planning,” he said. “It isn’t about trying to shock them, it's about trying to match their powers of comprehension so that it resonates. We know people are capable of appreciating a three dimensional world.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Divinity Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This appears to have gone down well with Larian's fans. "I love this," Elizabeth replied. "As someone who plays durge, evil and renegade options I'm sad that more games don't seem to push that nuance and trust the audience anymore. Can't wait to see what y'all do next."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s still a great deal we don’t know about Divinity, of course, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-think-they-know-who-the-burning-man-in-the-divinity-trailer-is-supposed-to-be">fans think they’ve worked out who the burning man in the trailer is supposed to be</a>. Larian has said Divinity is its next “major” game after Baldur’s Gate 3, and it is set in the world of Rivellon. Here’s the tagline: “the gods are silent. Rivellon bleeds. New powers stir.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Built by the team who brought you Baldur's Gate 3, Larian Studios unchains its ambitions to bring you an RPG with greater breadth and depth than ever before,” reads the official blurb.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Divinity is a brand new game that doesn’t require experience with previous Larian titles, those who’ve played Divinity: Original Sin and Divinity: Original Sin 2 will be able to enjoy “greater understanding and continuity,” Larian added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Swen Vincke, founder and game director of Larian Studios, said: “Despite our long history with the series, this is our first game entitled Divinity. We’re ready to bring everything we’ve done previously into one place. This marks the beginning of something with more breadth, depth, and intimacy than anything we’ve created before. We’ve been building toward this moment ever since we took our fate into our own hands. This is the Divinity we’ve always wanted to make and you're going to have loads of fun with it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic: Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>There's no concrete release date yet for Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, and it's still very early days for the project. The reveal trailer at The Game Awards was a CGI teaser for the game--<span>similar to how Quantic Dreams <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quantic-dream-announces-star-wars-eclipse-with-trailer/1100-6498850/">revealed Star Wars Eclipse at The Game Awards 2021</a>--and the developer behind Fate of the Old Republic is Arcanaut Studios, a company </span>founded by Hudson and his partners in July. While it's not impossible, properly staffing a new studio and developing a game expected to be a AAA Star Wars experience will be challenging.</p><p>In a post on the official Star Wars website, Hudson did touch on what fans can expect from the studio. "Our goal is developing the kind of games I love making: emotionally powerful, cinematic adventures driven by player agency, narrative depth, and immersive world-building," <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer" rel="nofollow ">Hudson said</a>. "Conversations between our team and Lucasfilm Games led to an incredible opportunity to return to Star Wars, and once again, we can hardly believe we’re working on such a special project."</p><p>Billed as a "narrative-driven single-player action RPG," Fate of the Old Republic will see players take control of a Force-user during a turbulent time of rebirth in the galaxy.</p>

<p>If you were perhaps hoping to see Avatar on the Switch 2, however, then you might want to just temper your expectations somewhat. According to a brief interview at <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/could-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-come-to-nintendo-switch-2-ubisoft-genuinely-dont-know-if-its-even-possible/">FRVR</a>, Ubisoft currently has no plans to bring the game to Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>When asked about a potential port, Game Design Lead Amandine Lauer simply said “Honestly, I don’t really want to wonder there, because I don’t know". Director Aoife O’Friel then followed up with “That’s something we don’t know about" when asked whether Avatar would even be possible on the Switch 2.</p><div><figure data-videoid="yv59MOA4ebw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytyv59MOA4ebw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed773c0eoivqsn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>So yes, if the director and game design lead don't know, then chances are it's probably not in the works at the moment. That's not to say it's completely off the table, mind you, with Ubisoft providing solid support for the Switch 2 since launch with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.</p>
<p>On 16th December 2025, Ubisoft will also be launching <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> from developer Evil Empire, famed for its work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a>.</p>

            <p>If you're in the mood for more TWar following the recent reveals of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-is-real-and-features-orks-space-marines-the-aeldari-and-for-some-reason-david-harbour">Total War: Warhammer 40,000</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-medieval-3">Total War: Medieval 3</a>, one of Total War: Attila's most ambitious mods has finally made it to 1.0 release. It's taken a decade for Lord of the Rings conversion The Dawnless Days to deliver its full ring-warring campaign, but that day's arrived at long last.</p>

<p>As you can see in the trailer above, which is gloriously heavy on armies marching, The Dawnless Days version 1.0 went live on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/totalwarattila/mods/1?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a> as of Friday. As spotted by our buds at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lord-of-the-rings-rts-total-war-attila-mod-dawnless-days">European Videogameplayer</a>, that appears to have contributed to a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/325610/charts/#1w">bunch of folks</a> deciding to boot up Attila over the weekend just gone.</p>
<p>"Over ten years of passion and commitment. Countless people contributing to this project, all of them believing in it every step of the way. From the testers to the moderators, from the developers to the leads, to the interns, the scribes, the voice actors, and the translators...it all led to this moment," the mod's team wrote upon making it to this milestone.</p><p>This 1.0 update adds in the full War of the Ring campaign mode the modders have spent the past decade building up to, with nine factions for you to choose from as you take to the landscape of Middle Earth and battle to hold the thing Gollum's rather fond of. There's the option of single player or multiplayer campaignage. The modders say you should expect an experience that's "based on the books whilst relying on the visuals of the films". In line with that, cameos from Aragorn, Saruman, Sauron, and Gloin - all looking like their filmy selves - have been added to a list that already looks to include the likes of Legolas and Boromir. </p>
<p>The modders note that as of this release, the region of Eriador remains "desolate and not playable", but they do have plans to incorporate it into the campaign down the line. Extra playable factions, more "iconic settlements" and further fleshing out/polishing also remain on the to-do list.</p>
<p>As someone who's not yet taken the plunge and tried Tolking myself into sitting down to read all of the Lord of the Rings books, I'm no expert on whether this is the dream of every ringer worldwide. That said, even I can see how cool it'd be to lead some troops into TWar as Sean Bean, given how fun it was to fight the comparatively very titchy battles in Oblivion at his side.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-clears-out-g50d-odyssey-gaming-monitor-at-42-off-the-32%e2%80%b3-model-is-now-cheaper-than-the-27%e2%80%b3-2000653260</link>
            <guid>1383340</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is unloading its Samsung gaming monitors in a big way, with huge discounts for last-minute holiday shoppers. It’s working, too — supplies are dwindling so quickly that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6186/">Amazon’s placed its big red “Deal Selling Fast” sign on this one that’s carving 42% from the price of the Samsung 32-Inch Odyssey G50D Series QHD Fast IPS gaming monitor</a>. The $250 price on a gaming monitor that’s considered a terrific deal at its full price of $430 is going go run out sooner than later, and it’s one you’d regret missing.</p>
<p>The Odyssey G50D is G-Sync compatible in addition to having AMD FreeSync built in, and it moves at a crisp 180Hz with a 1ms response time to keep you at peak performance in those fast action and shooter games. The QHD resolution delivers 1.7 times the pixel density of Full HD for amazing sharpness and color, and the VESA DisplayHDR 400 technology amps up the contrast levels to reveal details you’ve probably never noticed before in your favorite games.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6186/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real-Time Action</h2>
<p>Nothing’s more frustrating than lag and delay when you’re in the middle of an action game or shooter. Pound that button as fast as you like, but if your monitor just a fraction of a second behind the action, you’re cooked. That’s why the 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time of the Odyssey G50D is so crucial. It keeps you completely on top of the action down to the microsecond and gives you a huge advantage over anyone who’s playing on a lesser screen.</p>
<p>The VESA DisplayHDR 400 tech is another valuable weapon in your arsenal. It gives you a field of view with deeper blacks and brighter whites, and an overall brighter, better look of the entire screen, so you can detect enemies lurking in the shadows, or snipe rivals from great distances that you would have missed entirely on your old monitor.</p>



<h2>Creature Comforts</h2>
<p>You might not immediately associate a gaming monitor with physical comfort, but when you’re able to make fine adjustments to the height and angle of your monitor to line it up precisely to where you’re seated, you’ll notice that your neck and shoulders aren’t barking at you nearly as quickly as before. The Odyssey G50D is able to swivel, tilt, and adjust to get exactly into your line of vision, and it also has Eye Saver Mode to minimize blue light and reduce flickering, thereby reducing eye strain and irritation. Settle into your gaming chair, get the Odyssey G50D lined up exactly where you want it, and prepare for a long, comfortable grind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6186/">During this time-limited Amazon deal, the 32-inch model of the Samsung Odyssey G50D is $40 below the price of the 27-inch version</a>. That’s an invitation to swoop in and grab one, because it might be the last chance you get to grab a monitor of this size and quality for just $250.</p>

<p>Hyung-tae Kim, the CEO of Shift Up and the director behind Stellar Blade, has received a Presidential Commendation in South Korea. This prestigious awardwas presented by the South Korean President himself, and it was given for Kim’s services to the domestic game industry. </p>



<p>While Stellar Blade was mentioned, the award was also given amidst recognition of Shift Up’s other games, like Goddess of Victory: NIKKE.</p>







<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-was-a-game-changing-title">Stellar Blade Was a Game-Changing Title</h2>



<p>Stellar Blade first dropped in April 2024, before being released on PC a little more than a year later. The game would go on to sell millions of copies, with players being pulled in by the visuals and staying for the combat and intriguing story.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that much of the attraction in Stellar Blade rests with the game’s protagonist, Eve. Her character model was built around a scanned representation of a South Korean glamour model, which gives you an idea of why the character was such a hit with gamers.</p>



<p>As revealed by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-director-hyung-tae-kim-receives-award-from-president-of-south-korea-for-contributions-to-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton Media</a>, Hyung-tae Kim, the visionary director behind Shift Up’s Stellar Blade, recently received an award from the South Korean President, Lee Jae Myung. This commendation was bestowed upon Kim because of his contributions to the industry and ‘achievements in overseas expansion’.</p>



<p>In the report, it was stressed that Kim ‘humbly thanked his development teams and Shift Up’ for their pivotal work on bringing Stellar Blade to life.</p>



<p>In September, it was confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/">a Stellar Blade sequel</a> was in development and moving along quite nicely. In November, reports were circulated suggesting that Shift Up was targeting more platforms for further Steller Blade expansion, eyeing up the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform-shift-up/">Xbox and Nintendo</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Red Bull has created the world’s largest game of Tetris powered by 2000 drones as a part of the Red Bull Tetris World final.</p>



<p>The special event saw Red Bull use the iconic 150-metre high Dubai Frame, which opened in 2018, as the border for the Tetris game, which Red Bull says made the game the “world’s first open-air, live playable Tetris game”.</p>







<p>A grand total of 2800 drones were used for the game, with each player needing 1400 drones per game due to the drones’ battery life.</p>



<p>Fehmi Atalar of Türkiye went home as the champion of the game, achieving a score of 168,566 during the five-minute game. Leo Solórzano of Peru managed a score of 57,164.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.redbull.com/int-en/red-bull-tetris-world-final-recap-and-winner-fehmi-atalar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Red Bull</a> described the event as “phone to drone, with Qualifiers featuring participants in 60 countries playing directly on their mobile devices. </p>



<p>“This event was one of a kind. It’s not a thing you can describe in words,” said Red Bull Tetris World final winner Fehmi Atalar.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“Over [my] five years of Tetris experience, this was the best moment, and this event was one of a kind. It’s not a thing you can describe in words,” Atalar concluded. “I managed to play like a machine, and although I could have done things a bit cleaner, I achieved a flawless run and did not miss a single point in any of my matches, so I am very happy.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Thief VR Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/15/thief-vr-review/</link>
            <guid>1383322</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Thief is a series that I’ve always I loved as an idea, but lack the patience to play properly. They’re the kind of game where if you’re spotted by just one guard you are in a bit of trouble, and will likely be reloading a save if there are more than that. It’s the kind of hardcore stealth experience that encourages ghost runs whilst also hoovering up every last valuable you can find on the way. Thief VR isn’t that, really, but it is still pretty good. And it’s also incredibly immersive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow - Launch Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvLlHUUmP9M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Thief VR casts you as the wanted thief Magpie, completing jobs for your handler Cassandra. The voice acting for all the main parts is great, particularly Cassandra and returning classic Thief protagonist Garret, who quickly becomes a magical voice in your head. The story isn’t going to be the biggest draw here – it’s a touch predictable and some of the dialogue is poor – but it does its job well enough, giving you a variety of things to steal and a vague reason for doing it.</p>


<p>What this game nails is how you move through its levels. You grab a window and slide it open, grab the ledge and climb through, crouch and then walk over to a chest and pull out your lockpicks. It might not sound like much, but this sequence of actions can vary wildly between VR games. Thief VR just manages to make all of this feel slick and intuitive. The locomotion here is unobtrusive enough that just climbing through a window, peaking through a door, listening to a nearby pair of guards chatting feels incredibly immersive and natural.</p>


<p>The levels looks pretty good as well. They’re not the best visuals I’ve seen in VR, but certainly aren’t the worst either. I occasionally stopped to have a look at some of the views, which is a good sign. You will find some poor textures, especially if you stop and look at the foliage as I did exactly once, and the characters all look a bit odd. Even a main character like Cassandra feels a bit like a waxwork model come to life, though she specifically fares a little better than some characters in other games I could mention. Whilst it won’t blow your mind by any stretch of the imagination, the game looks good enough to be immersive.</p>
<p>But then there are the immersion breakers, and they’re everywhere. Locomotion is great, but opening drawers is a nightmare. Grabbing a drawer, you open it towards you, let go and… it slams shut again because your hand, which you didn’t move, caught it slightly. You open it again and the loot inside is jittering about and jerking side to side slightly. You collect the loot and try to close the drawer, but it bounces open again despite you being incredibly careful. In the worst case scenario, the loot is clipping through the bottom of the drawer, causing the drawer to either be stuck frozen in space or randomly opening and closing slightly, whilst also stopping you from collecting the loot because it’s stuck inside the wood. Each drawer is usually part of a cabinet that has one to three more drawers on it. It’s difficult to feel like a thief when it looks a lot like you’ve never encountered drawers before and are acting like my nan trying to work a computer.</p>

<p>This situation is a microcosm of Thief VR where smaller details break through the great work done elsewhere. Climbing up walls, you can actually grab empty space next to a handhold to keep climbing. If you use a horizontal rope to make your way over a gap, the angles that your in-game wrists stick out at are ridiculous. Sneak up behind a guard, bonk him on the head with your truncheon and he stops to draw his sword before falling to his knees. For everything Thief VR does right there is something else that dims your lantern of enjoyment, leaving you in moodily lit awkwardness.</p>
<p>If you can ignore the constant immersion breakers there is a pretty good thief game here, but that’s home brand thief, not Thief the series. The light gem on your hand is binary now, visible or practically invisible, where being lit just means “You are standing in the light, fool!”, which makes getting close to enemies without being spotted rather easy. You quickly get a bow with all the requisite arrows – water, fire, bludgeoning, rope, and those boring pointy ones that don’t do anything special – and your trusty truncheon hangs from your hip so you can sneak up on a guard and bonk them on the head once or twice, depending on whether they’re wearing a helmet.</p>

<p>The guard AI is, frankly, abysmal when it’s working, and then sometimes just breaks. A guard walked within a few feet of me while I was knocking out another guard and didn’t notice, but then another guard heard me doing the same one room over.&nbsp;You can hit guards in the legs to bring them down to their knees – handy to knock them out whilst crouching – but sometimes it doesn’t work and they still get their swords out before falling. You can turn the difficulty up, removing assists, but the AI is so poor it still isn’t the challenge it should be. Sometimes, when a guard spots you, he freezes in place, not approaching, attacking, or even speaking.</p>
<p>Upgrading your skills and gear doesn’t rely on the money you earn from stealing, but rather on rewards from Cassandra for stealing a certain amount and snagging a relic. These are upgrades like moving quicker whilst crouched (which is absolutely essential, obviously), making less noise when sprinting or landing, or starting a mission with two water arrows. That’s a big one, since you can’t buy more water arrows and have to instead find them lying around in levels, which is just three layers of silliness.</p>
<p>All that said, I have found that stealth in VR has made me far more patient than in non-VR games because I’m so much more immersed. I’m not staring at a screen waiting, I’m pressed up against the actual wall myself. The moments where you encounter a tolerable amount of quirks, meticulously sneak into a building, steal your prize, and get away without a sound are still very enjoyable. There are one or two good moments in the story as well, even if it isn’t overly impressive overall – I particularly enjoyed losing my equipment and having to reclaim it whilst escaping from a prison, which is an overused trope, but made it marginally more challenging and enjoyable.</p>

			<p>Although it was only a CGI trailer featuring no gameplay, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the reveal of Larian Studios' Divinity</strong></a> was undoubtedly among the highlights of this year's The Game Awards, and for good reason, as the game is set to be even bigger than Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>It is not only the promise of a much bigger game that has got fans excited about Larian's next game. In true studio fashion, the reveal trailer held nothing back regarding dark and mature themes, and not to shock players, but to treat them with a level of intellectual respect, according to a studio representative.</p>



<p>Replying to a user on X, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://x.com/Cromwelp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Larian Publishing director Michael Douse</a></strong> commented on the trailer's emphasis on dark themes, saying that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"treating the audience with a level of intellectual respect"</em> came up a lot during planning. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"It isn't about trying to shock them, it's about trying to match their powers of comprehension so that it resonates. We know people are capable of appreciating a three dimensional world."</em></p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The phrase "treating the audience with a level of intellectual respect" came up a lot in planning. It is about trying to shock them, it's about trying to match their powers of comprehension so that it resonates. We know people are capable of appreciating a three dimensional world</p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/2000000527409807405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>This commitment to intellectual respect isn't surprising, considering how Larian has approached player agency in the past. Playing the "evil" or morally complex path in titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/"><strong>Divinity: Original Sin 2</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/"><strong>Baldur's Gate 3</strong></a> is often designed to be just as interesting and nuanced as the selfless hero route. It is great to hear that the massive success of Baldur's Gate 3 hasn't changed the studio's approach in creating three-dimensional worlds and stories that don't need to be sanitized to appeal to a wider range of players.</p>



<p>Divinity will mark Larian Studios' return to the franchise after Divinity: Original Sin 2, which launched in 2017 on PC and consoles. Despite the studio's long history with the franchise, the new game will mark <em>"the beginning of something with more breadth, depth, and intimacy than anything we’ve created before,"</em> and the <em>"Divinity we’ve always wanted to make,"</em> according to Larian CEO Swen Vincke.</p>

              <p>We can officially consider it to be last-minute holiday shopping season now, and that’s when some truly epic deals sneak up on you. Here’s one of the best ones from the audio department at Amazon — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6392/">the top-rated Bose QuietComfort wireless headphones are a limited-time steal at just $170</a>. These are among the very best wireless headphones for Active Noise Cancellation, and it goes without saying that the sound quality is absolutely peak, because they’re from Bose.</p>
<p>The Bose QC wireless headphones are backed by more than just the Bose name. They have over 15,000 Amazon reviews that clock in at an average of 4.5 stars, among the very best in the category. That elite-level Active Noise Cancellation, deep bass, and 24 hours of playtime on a single USB-C charge are big reasons for that lofty rating, but they’re hardly the only ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6392/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Amazingly Customizable</h2>
<p>The Bose app isn’t just a good way to work the controls on the QuietControl headphones. It’s also where you can find the Adjustable EQ that lets you play producer and take the controls to fine-tune your favorite music. Make tiny tweaks to the bass, treble, and mid-range to suit your personal tastes, and then save the settings to your profile. The Bose app is also the route to the latest firmware updates so you can ensure your QC headphones have all of the latest features and tech.</p>
<p>Some of that recent tech that makes the Bose QuietControl wireless headphoes such a great buy at half price at Amazon? How about multipoint Bluetooth connectivity so you don’t have to go through the disconnect-reconnect toggle every time you want to switch your headphones from your laptop to your smartphone or other device. There’s also the Aware Mode that works hand in hand with the legendarily good Quiet mode — switching to Aware mode keeps your sound at pro levels while reducing the level of noise cancellation to allow enough sound in for safety or conversations.</p>



<h2>Listen All Day Long</h2>
<p>The Bose QuietComfort headphone have a literal full-day battery life on a single USB-C charge — up to 24 hours so you can listen to your music, podcasts, or audio books as long as you like. If you forget to recharge them and find the battery level is low or even dead, a 15-minute quick charge will give you a 2.5-hour boost. Those lengthy listening sessions are also exceptionally comfortable, thanks to the exceptionally plush ear cushions and lightweight construction of the Bose QuietComfort headphones.</p>
<p>Of the 11 different color models of the Bose QuietComfort wireless headphones, only three are priced this low during this Amazon deal (Moonlight Grey, Pink, and Sandstone), so be sure you’re clicking the right one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6392/">And do it quickly, because this $170 deal on a pro-level set of Bose wireless headphones is going, and going fast.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Phantom Blade Zero Isn’t A PS5 Console Exclusive Forever, Could Come To Xbox]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-isnt-a-ps5-exclusive-forever-could-come-to-xbox/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>S-GAME is looking to deliver its A-game with Phantom Blade Zero. The hack ‘n’ slasher looks slick and quick, and will be the action game to watch out for in 2026. PS5 gamers are eyeing it up, but it might not stay this way forever.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-release-date-trailer-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantom Blade Zero release date</a> was finally revealed at The Game Awards 2025. It’s going to add to an incredibly stacked year of gaming, and the pre-release hype is already big. Early marketing has made it clear it will launch on PS5—and PC—and not Xbox. Yet.</p>







<h2 id="h-phantom-blade-zero-could-release-on-xbox">Phantom Blade Zero Could Release On Xbox</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There’s always an asterisk. Credit to S-GAME</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s amazing how often little details are picked up on by players days after a new trailer or announcement. The Game Awards 2025 is well behind us, but only now is it apparent that Phantom Blade Zero’s Release Date trailer had new information in plain sight.</p>







<p>At the very end of the four-minute trailer, a big blue screen pops up with an interesting message: “PlayStation 5 Console Exclusive.”</p>



<p>This was already known. However, as you should with all contracts, if you read the fine print, there’s more than meets the eye:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Also available on PC. Not available on other consoles until at least 12 months after the release date.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Simply, this means Phantom Blade Zero is a timed exclusive. Like Silent Hill 2 or Square Enix’s Final Fantasy Remake games, it will launch on PS5 first (on consoles), and then we could easily see an Xbox port later down the line.</p>



<p>More than likely, this is what will happen. The console wars are over, and it seems to be about maximizing profits for Sony and Microsoft. It will get to the point where pretty much every game is on every other console—apart from Nintendo, don’t expect Mario on PS5 anytime soon!</p>



<p>Here’s the full Phantom Blade Zero trailer from TGA 2025.</p>

<p>Will Phantom Blade Zero be a day-one buy on PS5 or PC? Or does this revelation give you enough hope to hang on for a possible Xbox port later down the road?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Over the past few years, we have seen various performance improvements promised in patch notes, only to find that these improvements were so minor that they made no difference. Given <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/">the long-standing performance issues in Monster Hunter Wilds</a></strong>, there is obvious skepticism surrounding the <em>"over 100 performance improvements" </em>arriving <a href="https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/"><strong>tomorrow with Title Update 4. </strong></a>Fortunately, fresh comparison videos released directly by CAPCOM confirm that these optimization steps are significant.</p>



<p>The two comparison videos, which can be watched below, compare performance between Title Update 3 and Title Update 4 in three fights against Arkveld, Xu Wu, and Lagiacrus on the recommended system configurations listed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/"><strong>Steam</strong></a>:</p>



<p><strong>First Configuration</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</li>



<li>GPU: AMD Radeon RX 6600（VRAM 8GB）</li>



<li>Resolution: 1080p (Upscaled) *AMD FSR: Performance</li>



<li>Graphics Settings: Medium</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Second Configuration</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: Intel Core i5-10400</li>



<li>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super (VRAM 8GB)</li>



<li>Resolution: 1080p (Upscaled) *NVIDIA DLSS: Performance</li>



<li>Graphics Settings: Medium</li>
</ul>



<p>On both system configurations, all three scenarios see noticeable performance improvements. In the fight against Arkveld, the first configuration increases from an average of roughly 40 FPS in Title Update 3 to approximately 50 FPS in Title Update 4, with the second configuration experiencing similar performance improvements. Although the improvements in average FPS are promising already, performance stability also seems to have been improved, which should make the experience more enjoyable for all PC players.</p>

<p>The performance improvements of Title Update 4 are only the beginning, as Monster Hunter Wilds is set to get more enhancements in January and February, when the game's final Title Update will launch on all formats, coinciding with the game's first anniversary.  Hopefully, all the performance improvements and additional content will be enough for lapsed players to return, which is something <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>the producer wishes for</strong></a> and the game definitely deserves, as I highlighted in my launch <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds review</a></strong>.</p>

            <p>Amid the maelstrom of things happening last week, the original Doom blasted out the candles on a big cake commemorating its 32 years of demon destruction. As part of those celebrations, the shooter which can be played on (inhales) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-on-a-captcha-is-the-most-frustrating-though-admittedly-raddest-way-to-prove-your-humanity-to-an-algorithm">human test</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-weird-device-to-run-doom-your-lawnmower">lawnmower</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/before-you-brush-your-teeth-tonight-remember-to-install-doom-on-your-electric-toothbrush">electric toothbrush</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-can-now-run-on-a-jailbroken-tractor">tractor</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tweet2doom-lets-you-play-doom-via-twitter">bad social media place</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yup-a-pregnancy-test-is-the-weirdest-device-ive-seen-running-doom">pregancy test</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-play-doom-using-gut-bacteria-but-the-framerate-is-atrocious">gut bacteria</a> - it's gained another way in which to be appreciated. There's now a website called DoomScroll which lets you dive into a bunch of fan-made level WADs via browser.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/im-never-getting-any-work-done-ever-again-thanks-to-this-website-that-lets-me-play-thousands-of-user-made-doom-levels-in-my-browser/">Pewpew Caboom Gamer</a>, <a href="https://doomscroll.cx/#timeless">DoomScroll</a>'s the brainchild of software engineer James Baicoianu and internet archivist Jason Scott. Fire it up, and you're served a list of DOOM levels folks have created over the years. You click into one, such as <a href="https://doomscroll.cx/#warehse1">"Where? The Warehouse!"</a> - created by Giant Bomb co-founder <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeffgerstmann.com/post/3m7osiz5rnk23">Jeff Gerstmann</a> over 30 years ago - and there's an info blurb about it presented via Doomified laptop screen. From there, you click the map's spinning outline, then play, and the demon blasting commences.</p>
<p>Other levels on offer include <a href="https://doomscroll.cx/#xmas1">Christmas Doom</a>, <a href="https://doomscroll.cx/#11bones">Yet Another Doom Level</a>, and <a href="https://doomscroll.cx/#01ratlte">Missouri Rat Light</a>, just to pick a few at random. As you can imagine, the word hell crops up rather often in the list.</p>
<p>"Our goal was to make decades of work from one of the most creative communities in gaming history more accessible and visible to everyone," Baicoianu wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bai.dev/post/3m7obk3gq7227">BlueSky post</a>. "There's so much stuff here - everything from simplistic maps made by kids just learning how game development works, all the way up through full total conversions with all-new music, textures, and sprites, made by volunteer teams that went on to become full-fledged game studios."</p><p>It is worth noting that at least one of the WADs included in the site simply serves you with a black screen, rather than loading properly. This is the case with <a href="https://doomscroll.cx/#aodtclv1mac">Army of Darkness</a>, as Doom modder and YouTuber Major Arlene has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/majorarlene.net/post/3m7oyqwaktk27">pointed out</a> in a reply to Scott's BlueSky post announcing the site.</p>
<p>Major Arlene also raised the matter of whether all of the included modders' permissions in terms of redistribution of their works and/or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-modders-are-annoyed-at-the-chum-bucket-of-wrongly-credited-mods-in-the-latest-doom-remaster">proper credit being given</a> are being stuck to in every instance. Having scrolled through some of the entries, a number of the 'read me' files with info about each map do include guidelines on redistribution and written out web addresses detailing places you can - or at least could - get the WAD. The addresses aren't hyperlinked up, and I've been greeted with a webpage that wouldn't load in trying to test out following the one listed by Gerstmann's level.</p>
<p>So, DoomScroll currently looks to be relying on the level of detail the old creators included in their old text files to do the legwork, which isn't ideal. Baicoianu has said in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bai.dev/post/3m7qqvjne722k">a reply</a> that he plans to add in "a 'flag this wad' option if you turn up anything that's not supposed to be there" soon.</p>
<p>I've reached out to both Baicoianu and Major Arlene for comment.</p>
<p>Now, back to the less blasty form of doomscrolling.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-m4-macbook-air-joins-the-holiday-price-war-at-an-all-time-low-to-compete-with-windows-pc-deals-2000653263</link>
            <guid>1383286</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s willingness to cut huge deals on their newest tech gear has been one of the biggest and most pleasant surprises of the 2025 holiday shopping season. It’s still not too late to cash in on this surprising new trend, if this latest Amazon deal is any indication. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/">The 2025 M4 MacBook Air is still just $749 at Amazon, its lowest price ever and a big $250 step down from its usual $999.</a></p>
<p>The M4 MacBooks are one of the best places to look for amazing deals since being supplanted at the top of the Apple ecosystem by the M5 chip last October. But the price drops on the M4 models go way beyond the step down from the M5 to the M4, because the M4 machines are still absolutely elite-level computers, loaded with Apple Intelligence, Apple’s industry-best Liquid Retina display, outstanding cameras and speakers, and enough memory and power for heavy-duty creative work.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Small Step Down</h2>
<p>The talk in techworld has been all about the M5 MacBooks since they debuted in October, and rightfully so. The M5 machines are industry-best laptops, so when we see a huge deal on an M4 model like this one, the question becomes, just how big is the difference? The M5 chip is a faster CPU by up to 20% and faster in terms of AI thanks to new integrated Neural Accelerators. Big numbers to be sure, but how noticeable to the everyday user? Answer: Not very, unless you’re completely immersed in exceptionally heavy AI work, and even then it’s an incremental difference.</p>
<p>So while there may be an M5 MacBook Air coming in the early months of 2026, it’s a fairly safe bet that the resulting price drop on this M4 model won’t go any lower than this Amazon deal for $749, and the performance difference won’t come near meeting the price difference. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/">The time to grab the M4 MacBook Air is now, during this last-minute holiday sale at Amazon.</a></p>



<h2>All the Bells, All the Whistles</h2>
<p>It’s been less than a year since the M4 MacBook Air dropped, so it has all of the perks and tech that make the MacBooks so coveted. The M4 chip itself has a 10-core CPU and up to 10 cores of GPU, with 16GB of unified memory and a 256GB SSD. It’s the ideal machine for photo and video editing and other content creation-related tasks. The 12MP Center Stage camera, four built-in speakers with Spatial Audio, and studio-quality mics make the MacBook Air the perfect video conferencing or video call laptop, along with its slim, lightweight design.</p>
<p>We’ve all been so used to a $749 MacBook either being 2 or 3 generations old or having the words “refurbished” or “scratch and dent” attached to the deal that the idea of that price being on a brand-new 2025 model is a little surreal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6030/">But this Amazon deal taking $250 off of this 13-inch M4 MacBook Air is the real deal, and it’s real close to being real gone.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <p>Nothing spreads the festive cheer quite like spooky things, right? Well, ok, I can think of a few other things that are probably higher up the festive list, but for Megabonk fans, spooky is what's on the cards.</p>
<p>Megabonk's "Spooky Update" was initially meant to arrive on a smaller scale around Hallowe'en, but solo developer Vedinad decided they wanted "to make it bigger", and as things grew, naturally so did the work involved. Anyway, while later than first intended, the spooky update for Megabonk is now here.</p>
<p>As for what it includes, along with some general bug fixes such as the Giant Fork's Megacrit not working as intended, this update also adds new items, a new character and a new map.</p>

<li>Calcium's passive has been changed slightly. Instead of losing half of his momentum upon taking damage, he now loses about 25 percent, which decreases the higher you level up. At level 110 (max) you lose about 6.6 percent</li>
<li>Cursed grabbies now has a proc per tick limit of 250. Similar items (Spicy Meatball, Ice Cube, etc) already have a limit like this (at 50). It's to improve FPS, but it is probably a slight nerf to Cursed Grabbies if you're veeeryy late game.</li>
<li>Poison Flask starting projectile speed increased 12 -&gt; 16</li>
<li>Dragon's Breath now has 200 percent faster rotation speed, and automatically targets enemies instead of following the player rotation. Damage buff 15 -&gt; 16, duration buff 1s -&gt; 1.5s and damage upgrade offer also buffed 3 -&gt; 4</li>
<li>Noelle passive gives less size per level: 1 percent -&gt; 0.75 percent, and the damage she gains per frozen enemy has also been reduced a bit: 2 percent -&gt; 1.5 percent</li>
<li>Max Silver Multiplier in Final Swarm has changed from 16x -&gt; 8x. People seem to have way too much silver, so it doesn't make sense to have such a high multiplier anyway. At some point it would be nice to create some features that use silver, but im not sure what that would be yet</li>
<li>To address some of the flying meta: Final swarm ghosts will start increasing their speed after 20 minutes have passed. Also, normally, an enemy can only be stunned or frozen 15 times (CC cap) before it becomes immune. After this update, starting at 20 minutes, the CC cap will slowly decrease until they can no longer be stunned or frozen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Console</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can press f10 to open the console</li>
<li>At the moment, this is only really used to set a specific seed for the dungeon if you wanna speedrun it or something</li>
<li>Type "help" in the console to see all the commands and how to use them</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The action roguelike Megabonk recently made headlines after Vedinad <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-megabonk-developer-withdraws-from-the-game-awards-following-incorrect-nomination">withdrew from The Game Awards after being nominated for Debut Indie Game</a>. Vedinad admitted Megabonk was not in fact their debut game, as they had already been making games under different studio names for several years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Winter Wildcards has been expected to make its return to EA FC 26 for weeks, but new leaks now suggest the festive promo is officially next in line. Set to begin on Friday, December 19 at the usual 6 PM UK time, this year’s edition is shaping up to be the biggest Winter Wildcards event the series has ever seen.</p>



<p>And for once, it’s not just the player list doing the rounds. The leaks for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-26-announces-12-new-icons-including-francesco-totti-andres-iniesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC 26</a> have been unusually broad, hinting at everything from significant new card upgrades to multiple versions of the same players with differing positions and stat tweaks. With so much information surfacing early, anticipation for this year’s Winter Wildcards is building fast—if the leaks hold true, you’re in for a truly wild festive promo.</p>











<figure><figcaption>Some big Icons will be getting major upgrades. Image by EA.</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/FutSheriff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FUT Sheriff on X</a>, a flood of new details has emerged about the upcoming Winter Wildcards promo in EA FC 26—and there’s plenty to get excited about. The standout reveal is the suggestion that three full promo teams are on the way. With EA recently sticking to rapid-fire, one-week promos, a longer, more substantial festive event would be a welcome change and give players something meatier to dig into over the holiday period.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨WINTER WILDCARDS INFORMATION 🎄🎅🥶</p><p>• ✅ 3x Promo Teams<br>• 👶 Baby &amp; Prime Icons<br>• ⚡️ ONLY 1 PS+ <br>• 🔥 DAILY PLAYER SBC’S 💣 <br>• 👀 Some normal players also have 2x versions <br>• 👑 Best Of in packs<br>• ➕ More 👀💣🔜</p><p>Thoughts on Power Curve? Only one PS+ 🥶</p><p>Follow… <a href="https://t.co/57OBPVR8bo">pic.twitter.com/57OBPVR8bo</a></p></div>— Fut Sheriff (@FutSheriff) <a href="https://twitter.com/FutSheriff/status/1999883932926435378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>But that’s far from the only headline. Another major leak claims that a select group of Winter Wildcards cards will become the first items in EA FC 26 to receive <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/winter-wildcards-breaks-ea-fc-26-trend-with-game-changing-playstyle-boosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two PlayStyles+</a>, marking a significant shift in the game’s power structure. It appears EA is experimenting with gradually introducing higher-tier cards without abruptly breaking their slower power-curve philosophy—and double PlayStyles+ could be their first step in that direction.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for player names, the leaks are coming thick and fast. Icons like Zidane, Ibrahimović, and Ronaldinho have already been mentioned, and more are expected as we get closer to launch. If you want to stay on top of every new Winter Wildcards leak, <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/winter-wildcards-promo-team-1-in-ea-fc-26-ultimate-team-leaked-players-start-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Gaming Zone</a> will be updating fans with all the latest information as it drops.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi has stated his latest game, To a T, "didn't sell well" and "wasn't a good fit", expressing the difficulties of releasing more experimental games.</p>
<p>Takahashi is best known for the surreal Katamari Damacy series, which sees players rolling a ball around environments collecting increasingly bigger objects. Takahashi left publisher Namco in 2010 and has since lived in Vancouver and San Francisco while working on other projects.</p>
<p>However, speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/i-wish-i-had-the-katamari-damacy-ip-to-a-t-was-meant-to-counter-the-downer-vibes-of-2019-america-but-keita-takahashi-says-it-didnt-sell-well-and-fears-it-just-wasnt-a-good-fit/">Games Radar</a>, Takahashi revealed he doesn't own the Katamari Damacy IP (with Namco continuing the series itself). What's more, he's now had to move back to Japan due to To a T's lack of success.</p>

<p>"I don't think anyone tries to make a niche game," said Takahashi of his output. "The title 'niche game' is just a result. I know my games are far from mainstream.</p>
<p>"I recently returned to Japan, and one of the reasons I had to do was because To a T didn't sell well. This is a risk of being independent, and I'm willing to take it, but I don't think it's a question of niche or traditional, it's a question of whether people like it or not."</p>
<p>Takahashi believes there's "still room for new ideas", but "unfortunately To a T just wasn't a good fit".</p>
<p>Published by Annapurna and developed by his own studio Uvula, To a T follows a young child who's stuck in a T pose. It's full of joy and humour, but it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/katamari-damacy-creators-to-a-t-is-full-of-colour-and-joy-but-is-also-a-serious-and-affecting-depiction-of-living-with-disability">also a game about living with a disability</a>.</p>
<p>Takahashi told Games Radar he was inspired by the "downer mood/vibes/atmosphere of the place where we live" and so wanted to "make something very positive and silly".</p>
<p>"I'm not sure, but it's definitely getting harder for me," he said, when asked about the difficulties of releasing experimental games. "If anyone wants to invest in a Uvula, let me know. Let's make more fun and weird games!"</p>
<p>"What ultimately worked for me about To a T, about this frustrating, bewildering, clumsy and ingenious game - and I see this in glimpses, and in little starbursts of my own triggered memories - is its abiding sense of just how luridly weird life is when you're young, how boundless and loosely-ruled it seems," wrote Christian Donlan for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/my-main-challenge-with-to-a-t-was-trying-to-work-out-what-to-a-t-actually-is">Eurogamer about understanding the core of To a T</a>.</p>

		<p>Christmas is that wonderful time of year where everyone waits for a man covered in a bed sheet to come down their chimney and put some presents by the carved pumpkins, and 3D bullet heaven <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/megabonk">Megabonk</a> is getting right into the spirit of things with a new Spooky Update that’s out now!</p>
<p>Well, OK, so this was actually intended to be a more timely Halloween update developer vedinad says, “but I wanted to make it a bit bigger so it turned into a bit more work than i initially planned. anyway hope you like it!”</p>


<p>So that means there’s a new map, new character, new weapon, items, enemies and bosses and all of that on top of the bug fixes and new settings. Seems a pretty hefty update, which does actually tie in with the Christmas gift-giving spirit this time of year. Nice!</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Megabonk Spooky Update:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Map<wbr></li>
<li>New Character<wbr></li>
<li>New Weapon<wbr></li>
<li>New Items<wbr></li>
<li>New Enemies and Bosses<wbr></li>
<li>New Achievements and challenges<wbr></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>
<p>Made a lot of improvements to FPS late-game<wbr></p>

</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where Giant Fork’s Megacrit didn’t work<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could buy items you didnt have unlocked<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Frost Walker reset opacity when changing attack speed<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Holy Book was not affected by Particle Opacity<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed weird text popup when trying to microwave an item that has already hit its max cap (for example Overpowered Lamp)<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a “bug” where you could just use the full map on the Blind Challenge<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could reset as you teleported to the next stage to keep your progress and not move to the next stage<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you got an error if you banished every item except one in a specific rarity and then talked to a shady guy.<wbr><wbr></li>
</ul>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li>New Game Setting: Advanced Settings – Will enable certain settings that most players don’t need to use. This is disabled by default to avoid making the settings cluttered for new players.<wbr></li>
<li>New Game Setting: Shrine Counter -&gt; Shows you how many of each shrine is available, and how many you have used<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show HUD -&gt; Shwo or hide the HUD<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Chest Animation -&gt; Skips the chest animation. Note: You won’t be able to banish items from chests if you use this setting.<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Portal Animation -&gt; Skips portal spawn animation (on stage 1)<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Enable Silver Pots -&gt; Enable / Disable silver pots (Ghost Item in shambles if you do this)<wbr></li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show Item Feed -&gt; Show what items you picked up in a feed at the left side of the screen.<wbr></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>Tried to fix the “caveman” bug / exploit where you could hide in caves and enemies wouldn’t be able to spawn close to you or reach you<wbr></li>
<li>Increased Diceheads passive minimum reward potential (0.02 -&gt; 0.04). Basically his late level up rewards will be twice as high, surely won’t be OP<wbr></li>
<li>Chunkers now start with one more projectile<wbr></li>
<li>Amog Passive now increases in radius every level, from 4 to 12 over 220 levels. Previously it was always 4. Also gain 1% Posion Damage per level.<wbr></li>
<li>Calcium’s passive has been changed slightly. Instead of losing half of his momentum upon taking damage, he now looses about 25%, which decreases the higher you level up. At level 110 (max) you lose about 6.6%<wbr></li>
<li>Cursed grabbies now has a proc per tick limit of 250. Similar items (Spicy Meatball, Ice Cube, etc) already have a limit like this (at 50). It’s to improve FPS, but it is probably a slight nerf to Cursed Grabbies if you’re veeeryy late game.<wbr></li>
<li>Poison Flask starting projectile speed increased 12 -&gt; 16<wbr></li>
<li>Dragon’s Breath now has 200% faster rotation speed, and automatically targets enemies instead of following the player rotation. Damage buff 15 -&gt; 16, duration buff 1s -&gt; 1.5s and damage upgrade offer also buffed 3 -&gt; 4<wbr></li>
<li>Noelle passive gives less size per level: 1% -&gt; 0.75%, and the damage she gains per frozen enemy has also been reduced a bit: 2% -&gt; 1.5%<wbr></li>
<li>Max Silver Multiplier in Final Swarm has changed from 16x -&gt; 8x. People seem to have way too much silver, so it doesn’t make sense to have such a high multiplier anyway. At some point it would be nice to create some features that use silver, but im not sure what that would be yet<wbr></li>
<li>To address some of the flying meta: Final swarm ghosts will start increasing their speed after 20 minutes have passed. Also, normally, an enemy can only be stunned or frozen 15 times (CC cap) before it becomes immune. After this update, starting at 20 minutes, the CC cap will slowly decrease until they can no longer be stunned or frozen.<wbr></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>You can press F10 to open the console<wbr></li>
<li>At the moment, this is only really used to set a specific seed for the dungeon if you wanna speedrun it or something<wbr></li>
<li>Type “help” in the console to see all the commands and how to use them</li>
</ul>
