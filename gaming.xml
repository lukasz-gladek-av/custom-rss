            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-might-be-the-series-coziest-jrpg-yet-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After over two dozen mainline games, I can only imagine how difficult it must be to innovate and stay relevant in an era where a great game is coming out every few weeks, but that’s exactly what KOEI TECMO aims to do with the next entry in its long-running Atelier JRPG series, Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories and the Envisioned Land. After spending over six hours gathering resources, doing Sailor Moon-esque magical dancing rituals, and riding around on a motorbike, I’m inclined to believe they’ll pull off just that, yet again. With more engaging combat, improved visuals, more convenient crafting, and an entirely new building system that lets you put your own personal touch on the world, there’s quite a bit to be optimistic about, even if what I saw of the story and characters was, at least so far in the opening hours, pretty boilerplate stuff for the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played any of the recent Atelier games, then you probably won’t be shocked by Atelier Yumia at first glance. All three of the pillars that have been around since its conception are still alive and well: exploration, where you run around collecting resources and solving puzzles; combat, where you fight baddens with a party chock-full of pretty anime friends, and synthesis, where you combine your hard-won resources into alchemical creations that make you stronger. But each has been given a substantial overhaul (not to mention a serious facelift) that breathes new life into a familiar formula.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat seems to be getting the biggest rework, with action-based systems that let you perfect parry, dodge out of the way, and switch to different range bands depending on whether you’d like to thwack enemies in melee or take them down from a distance. At lower levels, combat seemed fairly undemanding, as I was able to just unload every ability I had, swap to other characters to do the same, then repeat it all again, ending most encounters in a matter of seconds, but later on (and especially when I wasn’t properly leveled) I seriously got rinsed if I wasn’t paying attention to enemy attack patterns and working on my timing. It never got especially challenging so long as I was properly leveled, but it was nice to see a less passive combat system that I couldn’t just steamroll through while on autopilot.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat seems to be getting the biggest rework.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploration also had some improvements, like having a gun to stun enemies and collect resources at a distance, ziplines that help you navigate the map more easily once you find and activate both sides of the line, and, crucially, a badass motorcycle for you to speed around on that makes getting around much easier. Finally, there’s Synthesis, which in typically Atelier fashion is so dang complicated, you could spend quite a bit of time customizing and min-maxing every aspect of your gear and crafting new items and attacks to use in battle. Or, if you don’t have the patience like me, you can just hit “auto mode” and it’ll automatically optimize all of it for you. Not that I don’t enjoy this aspect of the series, but it’s certainly nice to have the option of leaping back into the action quickly for times where I wasn’t in the mood to tinker.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Atelier Yumia also shakes things up by adding a fourth fairly significant activity to the list of things to do as you explore and level up: the ability to build and customize settlements throughout the world map. That’s right – Atelier Yumia seems to be leaning into the cozy craze, so now you can have a little bit of Animal Crossing or Sims with your JRPG by constructing your fantasy cottage on a patch of land and spending some quality downtime with your party members. I was only able to dabble in this a bit, given the constraint of the resources available to me in the early part of the story, but I could definitely see myself sinking quite a bit of time into taming the wilds with an elaborately decorated home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all Atelier has going for it, I will say that it did very little to make itself stand out in terms of story. The characters and foreshadowing of the undoubtedly epic and convoluted story that starts to develop in the opening hours aren’t bad by any means, but at least so far everything has been quite predictable and retreads a lot of ground we’ve seen from JRPGs of the past. This is especially true of the characters I met during my explorations, like the ditzy by wholesome Isla and the stoic and no-nonsense Viktor, both of whom I feel like I’ve seen half a hundred times already. But this is the beginning of a JRPG, so in all likelihood it’s just going to take a while for the story to start rolling or for characters to show their true colors to any level of satisfaction, leaving plenty of opportunity for my concerns to disappear given more time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that Atelier Yumia marks the first time the series will appear on the Xbox platform, and as a Westerner who would quite like more JRPGs to be readily available, that’s pretty awesome to see. Achievement unlocked!</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The option to romance NPC characters in RPGs has been around for a long time, and even recent titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/" data-ref-id="1900-6418333">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> offer that feature to players.

According to Avowed director Carrie Patel, she made the decision to downplay romance because she felt it takes away from the experience of playing the game.</p><p>While appearing on IGN's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB9qwiskL18&amp;list=PL99PCYdTX-vcBZW5aQAHlTHZr08eO4Vnj&amp;index=1&amp;pp=iAQB" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unlocked</a> podcast, Patel revealed that she believes the romantic options in RPGs "undermine that core experience" and practically invite players to focus more on the romance than on the story or even the characters themselves. Instead, Patel favored a more natural form of bonding with the player's companions that doesn't end with two characters in bed.</p><p>"My hope with players and their companion relationships in Avowed is that they would feel natural, and players would get out of them exactly what they want and exactly as much as they put in," said Patel. She added that it was supposed to be like "you're getting to know some new friends."</p><p>That decision may make Avowed an outlier in the genre, especially since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> had so many romantic options to choose from. Thus far, Xbox Game Studios and Obsidian Entertainment haven't announced how many copies Avowed has sold since its release on February 18. The game received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-companions-wont-nag-you-as-much-about-getting-better-armor-after-day-one-patch/1100-6529570/" data-ref-id="1100-6529570">a day-one patch earlier this week</a> to address some of the issues found in it.

            <p>
There've been strong hints a new Tony Hawk project is in the works for some time now, but it looks like an official announcement could finally be looming - based on a sneaky tease that's appeared in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s latest map.
</p>
<p>
Hints that Activision might be looking to revive its dormant skating franchise first emerged last September, when Tony Hawk <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-has-been-talking-to-activision-again-as-pro-skater-25th-anniversary-looms">revealed he'd "been talking to [the publisher] again"</a>. That was followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-tony-hawk-remaster-now-mentioned-by-pro-skater-involved-in-the-game-even-though-activision-hasnt-announced-it-yet">pro skateboarder Tyshawn Jones' claims earlier this month</a> that he was "in a Tony Hawk coming out... a new one they're remastering".
</p>
<p>
And it now looks like Activision may finally be readying to make things official. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Season 02 Reloaded update went live earlier today, introducing a remastered version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-2">Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</a>'s skatepark-themed multiplayer map, Grind.
</p>

<figcaption>And there's a Black Ops 6's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles collaboration too.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FeOzkKmOtY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Although the skatepark serves as Grind's focal point, the map also hosts several other notable areas - including a skate-themed store that appears to be teasing some big things. To the rear of the unit hangs a large TV screen showing the date 03.04.25, alongside the unmistakable branding Activision used for 2020's well-received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> 1+2 remake.
</p>
<p>
The obvious inference is that Activision will be announcing its new Tony Hawk project on 4th March this year (or possibly 3rd April, if it's suddenly come over all European). And as to what it'll be revealing, it's hard not to suspect - given the branding and Tyshawn Jones' previous talk of "remastering" - we could be looking at an announcement of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a>+4.
</p>

Tony Hawk himself previously revealed a Pro Skater 3+4 remake had been in the works at one point following the success of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2. However, plans were reportedly scuppered when Activision merged developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard, turning it into support studio for the Diablo franchise and other Blizzard games.
</p>
<p>
Whatever Activision is teasing, it doesn't look like we'll have too long to wait before everything is revealed. And in the meantime, there's always Black Ops 6's Season 02 Reloaded update, which - alongside its new Grind map - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-calling-on-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">playing host to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>.

			<p>As the dawn of a new Atelier alchemist JRPG entry comes to pass, Koei Tecmo recently invited Wccftech and a few other journalists from RPG Site and IGN, among others, to go hands-on with the upcoming Atelier Yumia. Bearing a moniker befitting a light novel series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-combat-and-synthesis-details-revealed-for-atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</a> marks a new series under the long-running franchise banner, picking up where the Atelier Ryza trilogy left off. In this preview session, we were permitted full access to the first few hours of the latest build on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Atelier Yumia opens in media res during an exploration of ancient ruins accompanied by party members who only make a brief appearance as footnotes to this introductory sequence before flashing back to an earlier time when Yumia herself is only just starting out to dabble in the forbidden dark arts of alchemy. It’s here that Yumia is part of an established survey corps sent out to delve into the secrets of the fall of the Aladissian Empire, where this 26th entry in the long-running Atelier series takes place.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Atelier-Yumia_-The-Alchemist-of-Memories-the-Envisioned-Land-event1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Despite a new subseries filled with brand-new mechanics, both in the fields of gathering and crafting as well as combat, Atelier Yumia kicks things off almost immediately with brief tutorials that lead up to Yumia soon taking over an abandoned building to call home as her first Atelier. It’s all in a day's work for the Survey Corps that Yumia and her fellow compatriots ascribe to serving and doing a little bit of everything from heavy lifting to monster culling and crafting. Even at the beginning of the adventure, Yumia Liessfeldt has already made a small name for herself, both as a friend to those in need with a small advance party and with a couple of other corps members who join her in combat while also being a bit of a black sheep for dabbling in the dark arts. For reasons unknown early on in the story, alchemy is seen as something not to be trusted and from an ancient civilization.</p>
<p>In order to truly engage in proper alchemy, Yumia first needs the right materials to do so. While past Atelier games would limit what players could harvest in their basket and bring back to the alchemy workshops, Yumia gives the players a nigh-endless backpack right from the start, more than capable of holding whatever ore and flowers the player can pick up along the way. Gone is the need for gathering tools, as Yumia and her gunstaff are more than equipped to help gather whatever is on hand. See some ore on a hillside that’s just out of reach? Shoot it down. For the first time in the series, Atelier Yumia gives players the option to take some of the crafting on the road and create field items, such as medicines and ammo, without needing to return to the main workshop.</p>
<p>These workshops themselves are initially little more than stripped bare buildings and structures. It’s up to Yumia and the player to rebuild these areas, first crafting up furniture like storage containers before placing them around freely within the confines of the buildable space. Some of the early ateliers appear to be somewhat limiting in how many props can be installed in each, but in a separate preview Gust showed us during our onboarding, there were the abilities to make the building layouts and designs far more intricate with exterior structures and fortifications. Gust wanted to hit on the sense of expression for players to build out these workshops in their own way, which all also double as fast travel points to get around the open world.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Atelier-Yumia_-The-Alchemist-of-Memories-the-Envisioned-Land-battle2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Each Atelier title takes its own spin on how items are actually crafted with alchemy form base materials and Atelier Yumia is no exception. At the heart of each alchemy recipe is the memory of the finished item, which is stored in Yumia’s Memory Vial. By recalling the overall concept of an item, she can then select an Alchemy Core to imbue. In our preview, Yumia only had access to a single alchemy core which could increase the air damage of the crafted tool. From here, players then need to select the key ingredients from the recipe and attach them to nodes within the alchemy core. This is where Yumia gets unusually complex, with mana essence floating about as ingredients are added to the core while extracting mana from these components. Each component added has its own resonance aura and gathers in free flowing mana within that range to boost the effectiveness of the final outcome.</p>
<p>As we only had one Alchemy Core at our disposal, our preview was limited in terms of options for truly being able to customize items. Continuously crafting the same recipe will slowly level it up to a maximum level of 10. Each subsequent level will increase the quality of the item or open up the inclusion of other Alchemy Cores. The same four-element system is at play here, but I couldn’t delve deeply enough to see how the strength of a given ingredient’s element plays into the finished outcome.</p>
<p>New to Atelier Yumia is the ability to craft on the go as well. While she doesn’t have the equipment to craft everything away from an atelier, she can at least craft some of the more useful consumables, such as bullets for her gunstaff. I’m amazed that it’s taken this long for such a simple feature to become an Atelier staple and incentivizes players to spend more time out in the open world and reaching deeper into exploration.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Atelier-Yumia_-The-Alchemist-of-Memories-the-Envisioned-Land-battle1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Atelier Yumia’s combat is such a strange beast that is a drastic change from earlier Atelier titles. If nothing else, they’ve taken some inspiration from other action RPGs like Tales. Players take control of Yumia or any of her other party members at a given time. The field of battle takes place at both close and long range with many cast members having different attacks based on range. Players can attack freely while also using abilities that run off cooldown timers. In the case of Yumia, she can create items like Flamia swords and other elemental items, while the head of Gust confirmed in our exclusive interview that they’re trying to move away from bombs being a core part of the alchemist’s toolbag. True to its action RPG roots, Yumia and cast can dodge and block incoming attacks with perfectly timed mitigations, rewarding the player with a damaging counterattack. All of these actions can culminate in a rather modestly named ultimate attack called a Friend Action once a specific battle gauge is filled completely.</p>
<p>In making the combat more free-flowing and the exploration al fresco, Gust has opened up the series to a wider generation, and that’s not including adding the Xbox platform to the mix for the first time. Series veterans may decry the loose nature and lack of a structured calendar that was the backbone of the Atelier series for oh so long, but it’s only the natural evolution of an alchemical nature.</p>
<p>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land will launch on both PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, Nintendo Switch, and PC (Steam) globally on March 21st, 2025.</p>
<p><em>[Editor’s Note: Koei Tecmo and Gust provided hotel and travel accomodations to Wccftech to attend their preview event.]</em></p>

Players vie for the $38 million prize--metaphorically that is--by competing in up to six mini-games like Tug of War, Glass Bridge, Marbles, and Red Light/ Green Light. Designed for up to six people to play, the first person to reach the Squid Head will win big in this twisted take on survival of the fittest. Like the Squid Game TV series, surviving players will get to split the money earned up to that point, so it's in your best interest to keep your teammates alive so that you have a numerical edge over the opposing team.</p><p>Each session lasts around 45 minutes, so this is a nice way to enjoy a quick round of Squid Game and not worry about being possibly betrayed by a trusted friend. Each of the six games features unique playstyles and rulesets, so you'll want to adapt quickly if you want to avoid being eliminated.</p><p>In addition to the official board game, Netflix also collaborated with Spin Master Games on an official set of marbles.

                <p>Following its recent launch, the mobile Epic Games Store is continuing to roll out free games on Android worldwide and iOS in the European Union. Two new arrivals are particularly good ones worth picking up.</p><p>From now until March 20, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Knights of the Old Republic II are available for free through the mobile version of the Epic Games Store. Both were console heavy hitters 20 years ago and defined what a Star Wars RPG would look and feel like. Characters like Darth Revan and Bastilla Shan have been fan favorites ever since, with the latter coming close to actual canonization. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlIO0CDEobo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NlIO0CDEobo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Last month, the Epic Games Store added nearly 20 third-party games. There will be new games offered each month until Epic moves to a weekly schedule later this year.</p><p>For years, Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-declares-resounding-victory-over-epic-games-following-appeals-court-ruling/1100-6513515/" data-ref-id="1100-6513515">has fought with Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-wins-case-to-open-up-android-store-but-google-is-appealing/1100-6527001/" data-ref-id="1100-6527001">Google</a> in court for the right to expand the Epic Games Store on mobile. The company says that it grew Epic cross-platform accounts to 898 million users during 2024--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-store-sales-on-pc-reached-1-billion-in-2024/1100-6529505/" data-ref-id="1100-6529505">an increase of 94 million people</a>--and this stat includes accounts created through partner platforms and the Epic Games Store. Epic is following in the footsteps of its PC store by trying to attract users with free games.</p><p>Recently, two members of Epic's board of directors <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-justice-department-investigation-leads-to-board-members-leaving-epic-games/1100-6528567/" data-ref-id="1100-6528567">were forced to step down</a> by the US Justice Department because they were already members of Tencent's board, which the government considers a rival gaming company.

"We offer the strongest AI protections in the industry to our talent, as we think their work is irreplaceable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now Miller and the company appear to be at a standstill.

<p>Nvidia's RTX 50-series makes its first foray below the $1,000 mark starting this week, with the $749 RTX 5070 Ti—at least in theory.</p>
<p>The third-fastest card in the Blackwell GPU lineup, the 5070 Ti is still far from "reasonably priced" by historical standards (the 3070 Ti was $599 at launch). But it's also $50 cheaper and a fair bit faster than the outgoing 4070 Ti Super and the older 4070 Ti. These are steps in the right direction, if small ones.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about its performance shortly, but at a high level, the 5070 Ti's performance falls in the same general range as the 4080 Super and the original RTX 4080, a card <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review-second-only-to-the-4090-for-now/">that launched for $1,199</a> just over two years ago. And it's probably your floor for consistently playable native 4K gaming for those of you out there who don't want to rely on DLSS or 4K upscaling to hit that resolution (it's also probably all the GPU that most people will need for high-FPS 1440p, if that's more your speed).</p>
<p>But it's a card I'm ambivalent about! It's close to 90 percent as fast as a 5080 for 75 percent of the price, at least if you go by Nvidia's minimum list prices, which for the 5090 and 5080 have been mostly fictional so far. If you can find it at that price—and that's a big "if," since every $749 model is <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?d=5070+Ti&amp;Order=1">already out of stock across the board at Newegg</a>—and you're desperate to upgrade or are building a brand-new 4K gaming PC, you could do worse. But I wouldn't spend more than $749 on it, and it might be worth waiting to see what AMD's first 90-series Radeon cards look like in a couple weeks before you jump in.</p>

<p>Nvidia isn't making a Founders Edition version of the 5070 Ti, so this time around our review unit is <a href="https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/graphics-cards/prime/prime-rtx5070ti-16g/">an Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti</a> provided by Asus and Nvidia. These third-party cards will deviate a little from the stock specs listed above, but factory overclocks tend to be inordinately mild, and done mostly so the GPU manufacturer can slap a big "overclocked" badge somewhere on the box. We tested this Asus card with its BIOS switch set to "performance" mode, which elevates the boost clock by an entire 30 MHz; you don't need to be a math whiz to guess that a 1.2 percent overclock is not going to change performance much.</p>
<p>Compared to the 4070 Ti Super, the 5070 Ti brings two things to the table: a roughly 6 percent increase in CUDA cores and a 33 percent increase in memory bandwidth, courtesy of the switch from GDDR6X to GDDR7. The original 4070 Ti had even fewer CUDA cores, but most importantly for its 4K performance included just 12GB of memory on a 192-bit bus.</p>
<p>The 5070 Ti is based on the same GB203 GPU silicon as the 5080 series, but with 1,792 CUDA cores disabled. But there are a lot of similarities between the two, including the 16GB bank of GDDR7 and the 256-bit memory bus. It looks nothing like the yawning gap between the RTX 5090 and the RTX 5080, and the two cards' similar-ish specs meant they weren't too far away from each other in our testing. The 5070 Ti's 300 W power requirement is also a bit lower than the 5080's 360 W, but it's pretty close to the 4080 and 4080 Super's 320 W; in practice, the 5070 Ti draws about as much as the 4080 cards do under load.</p>

<p>As a Blackwell GPU, the 5070 Ti also supports Nvidia's most-hyped addition to the 50-series: support for DLSS 4 and Multi-Frame Generation (MFG). We've already covered this in our 5090 and 5080 reviews, but the short version is that MFG works exactly like Frame Generation did in the 40-series, except that it can now insert up to three AI-generated frames in between natively rendered frames instead of just one.</p>
<p>Especially if you're already running at a reasonably high frame rate, this can make things look a lot smoother on a high-refresh-rate monitor without introducing distractingly excessive lag or weird rendering errors. The feature is mainly controversial because Nvidia is comparing 50-series performance numbers with DLSS MFG enabled to older 40-series cards without DLSS MFG to make the 50-series cards seem a whole lot faster than they actually are.</p>
<p>We'll publish some frame-generation numbers in our review, both using DLSS and (for AMD cards) FSR. But per usual, we'll continue to focus on natively rendered performance—more relevant for all the games out there that don't support frame generation or don't benefit much from it, and more relevant because your base performance dictates how good your generated frames will look and feel anyway.</p>
<h3>Testbed notes</h3>

<p>We tested the 5070 Ti in the same updated testbed and with the same updated suite of games that we started using in our RTX 5090 review. The heart of the build is an AMD Ryzen 9800X3D, ensuring that our numbers are limited as little as possible by the CPU speed.</p>
<p>Per usual, we prioritize testing GPUs at resolutions that we think most people will use them for. For the 5070 Ti, that means both 4K and 1440p—this card is arguably still overkill for 1440p, but if you're trying to hit 144 or 240 Hz (or even more) on a monitor, there's a good case to be made for it. We also use a mix of ray-traced and non-ray-traced games. For the games we test with upscaling enabled, we use DLSS on Nvidia cards and the newest supported version of FSR (usually 2.x or 3.x) for AMD cards.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>Though we've tested and re-tested multiple cards with recent drivers in our updated testbed, we don't have a 4070 Ti Super, 4070 Ti, or 3070 Ti available to test with. We've provided some numbers for those GPUs from past reviews; these are from a PC running older drivers and a Ryzen 7 7800X3D instead of a 9800X3D, and we've put asterisks next to them in our charts. They should still paint a reasonably accurate picture of the older GPUs' relative performance, but take them with that small grain of salt.</p>

<h2>Performance and power</h2>
<p>Despite including fewer CUDA cores than either version of the 4080, some combination of architectural improvements and memory bandwidth increases help the card keep pace with both 4080 cards almost perfectly. In most of our tests, it landed in the narrow strip right in between the 4080 and the 4080 Super, and its power consumption under load was also almost identical.</p>

                </p>
  </div>

<p>In every way that matters, the 5070 Ti is essentially an RTX 4080 that also supports DLSS Multi-Frame Generation. You can see why we'd be mildly enthusiastic about it at $749 but less and less impressed the closer the price creeps to $1,000.</p>
<p>Being close to a 4080 also means that the performance gap between the 5070 Ti and the 5080 is usually pretty small. In most of the games we tested, the 5070 Ti hovers right around 90 percent of the 5080's performance.</p>
<p>The 5070 Ti is also around 60 percent as fast as an RTX 5090. The performance is a lot lower, but the price-to-performance ratio is a lot higher, possibly reflecting the fact that the 5070 Ti actually has other GPUs it has to compete with (in non-ray-traced games, the Radeon RX 7900 XTX generally keeps pace with the 5070 Ti, though at this late date it is mostly out of stock unless you're willing to pay way more than you ought to for one).</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          


<p>Compared to the old 4070 Ti, the 5070 Ti can be between 20 and 50 percent faster at 4K, depending on how limited the game is by the 4070 Ti's narrower memory bus and 12GB bank of RAM. The performance improvement over the 4070 Ti Super is more muted, ranging from as little as 8 percent to as much as 20 percent in our 4K tests. This is better than the RTX 5080 did relative to the RTX 4080 Super, but as a generational leap, it's still pretty modest—it's clear why Nvidia wants everyone to look at the Multi-Frame Generation numbers when making comparisons.</p>

<h2>Waiting to put theory into practice</h2>

<p>Being able to get RTX 4080-level performance for several hundred dollars less just a couple of years after the 4080 launched is kind of exciting, though that excitement is leavened by the still high-ish $749 price tag (again, assuming it's actually available at or anywhere near that price). That certainly makes it feel more like a next-generation GPU than the RTX 5080 did—and whatever else you can say about it, the 5070 Ti certainly feels like a better buy than the 5080.</p>
<p>The 5070 Ti is a fast and 4K-capable graphics card, fast enough that you should be able to get some good results from all of Blackwell's new frame-generation trickery if that's something you want to play with. Its price-to-performance ratio does not thrill me, but if you do the math, it's still a much better value than the 4070 Ti series was—particularly the original 4070 Ti, with the 12GB allotment of RAM that limited its usefulness and future-proofness at 4K.</p>
<p>Two reasons to hold off on buying a 5070 Ti, if you're thinking about it: We're waiting to see how AMD's 9070 series GPUs shake out, and Nvidia's 50-series launch so far has been kind of a mess, with low availability and price gouging both on retail sites and in the secondhand market. Pay much <em>more</em> than $749 for a 5070 Ti, and its delicate value proposition fades quickly. We should know more about the AMD cards in a couple of weeks. The supply situation, at least so far, seems like a problem that Nvidia can't (or won't) figure out how to solve.</p>

<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>For a starting price of $749, you get the approximate performance and power consumption of an RTX 4080, a GPU that cost $1,199 two years ago and $999 one year ago.</li>
<li>Good 4K performance and great 1440p performance for those with high-refresh monitors.</li>
<li>16GB of RAM should be reasonably future-proof.</li>
<li>Multi-Frame Generation is an interesting performance-boosting tool to have in your toolbox, even if it isn't a cure-all for low framerates.</li>
<li>Nvidia-specific benefits like DLSS support and CUDA.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not all that much faster than a 4070 Ti Super.</li>
<li>$749 looks cheap compared to a $2,000 GPU, but it's still enough money to buy a high-end game console or an entire 1080p gaming PC.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pricing and availability for other 50-series GPUs to date have both been kind of a mess.</li>
<li>Will you actually be able to get it for $749? Because it doesn't make a ton of sense if it costs more than $749.</li>
<li>Seriously, it's been months since I reviewed a GPU that was actually widely available at its advertised price.</li>
<li>And it's not just the RTX 5090 or 5080, it's low-end stuff like the Intel Arc B580 and B570, too.</li>
<li>Is it high demand? Low supply? Scalpers and resellers hanging off the GPU market like the parasites they are? No one can say!</li>
<li>It makes these reviews very hard to do.</li>
<li>It also makes PC gaming, as a hobby, really difficult to get into if you aren't into it already!</li>
<li>It just makes me mad is all.</li>
<li>If you're reading this months from now and the GPUs actually&nbsp;<em>are</em> in stock at the list price, I hope this was helpful.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-unveils-new-playing-to-win-strategy-expanding-their-reach-to-more-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hasbro has announced a new company business strategy. The toy and tabletop company behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> and Dungeons &amp; Dragons has announced Playing to Win, a strategy that will focus more on play-fueled franchises and ongoing partnerships.</p>

<h2>The Hasbro Playing to Win Strategy Announcement</h2>

<p>Hasbro's Playing to Win strategy was announced alongside their <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/32a267bf-241b-4541-91ab-7745ed17693d" rel="nofollow">Q4 and Full Year 2024 Financial Report</a>. In that report, Hasbro CEO, and AI advocate, Chris Cocks discussed areas of growth, revenue, and decline for the various IPs and studios under Hasbro's umbrella.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hasbro-financial-year-presentation-slide.jpg?itok=xeMIvhOF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hasbro-financial-year-presentation-slide.jpg?itok=bA-f6-5N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One of the major areas of growth was the franchises under the stewardship of Wizards of the Coast. Both WOTC and Digital games were up 4% YoY courtesy of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <em>Monopoly Go, </em>and strong ongoing sales of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cocks even stated that <em>Magic's</em> ecosystem remains "as healthy and engaged" as it has ever been thanks to strong set sales and Secret Lairs.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> also showed ongoing growth. The new 2024 <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Player's Handbook</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em></a>, and brand-new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/2024-monster-manual-review-we-take-look-at-some-of-dds-most-well-known-monsters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monster Manual</em></a> have been breaking sales records for the best-selling D&amp;D books ever as well as increased digital revenue through the D&amp;D Beyond marketplace.</p>

<p>Notably, while analog sales of Wizards products were down by 16%, digital sales were up 3% and digital licensing was up 7%. This does align with the rise of online TTRPG play over physical book purchases and WOTC's own investment in their own D&amp;D-focused virtual tabletop, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-direct-2024-highlights-future-of-dd-and-showcases-project-sigil" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sigil</a>.</p>

<p>Within this financial report, Cocks discussed Hasbro's Playing to Win business strategy. Simply put, the plan involves Hasbro investing hard on their play-first franchises and partnerships, increasing play and appeal to older fans, expanding reach to emerging markets, and building more videogames with their IP.</p>

<p>The first part of this strategy is self-evident in Hasbro's toylines. Their toy robot franchise, <em>Transformers</em>, continues to sell to its target demographic of children, bolstered by the recent <em>Transformers One</em> feature film.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hasbro-magic-the-gathering-financial-slide.jpg?itok=hMFKzq4N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hasbro-magic-the-gathering-financial-slide.jpg?itok=DjYRirT_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As for partnerships, the company has plenty. In addition to the recent <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-magic-gathering-crossover-brings-classic-art-and-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">crossover with <em>Final Fantasy</em></a>, the popular card game will be crossing over with Marvel's Spider-Man in 2025 alongside a third unannounced Universes Beyond set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Expanding their reach to emerging markets are covered with the recently announced <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> movie coming courtesy of Legendary Pictures and a new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> TV show by Netflix and executive producer Shawn Levy.</p>

<p>Finally, building new videogames based on Hasbro's IP aligns with the announcement that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/space-marine-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2</em></a> developer Saber Interactive is working on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-devs-hasbro-tentpole-ip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new AAA game</a> based on a Hasbro franchise. Given Space Marine 2's gameplay is full of high-octane action, there's a strong chance this game will align with Hasbro's appeal to older fans.</p>

<p>In short, the Playing to Win strategy seems to be the company leaning more into digital sales, leveraging partnerships with other studios for multimedia projects, and investing in their bestselling franchises.</p>

            <p>
Developer MachineGames' steady finessing of last year's stellar <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> continues today with the launch a third major update for the acclaimed third-person action-adventure. This time around, there's support for a range of new graphics features on PC - including DLSS 4 - as well as the usually array of bug fixes and more.
</p>
<p>
Starting with those graphics features, there's that DLSS 4 support, giving PC players access to the likes of transformer-based Multi Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, and updated versions of DLAA and DLSS Super Resolution - provided their hardware supports them.
</p>
<p>
Update 3 also includes a new option for ray-traced shadows that utilises all light sources within a player's surroundings (as opposed to just the sun) when Path Tracing is enabled. Additionally, Path Tracing is now available on Intel and AMD GPUs, and there's support for AMD 3.1 upscaling and frame generation, as well as Intel XESS 1.4 upscaling.

<p>
Away from the PC-specific new features, all platforms get an <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/19eQtJoGEbNeavznlgvNMH/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3">extensive helping of quality of life improvements and bug fixes</a>. Repair kits can, for instance, now be used directly from the inventory, rather than only after selecting a broken weapon or tool.
</p>
<p>
And as for what's next, other than Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's still undated PS5 release, MachineGames says Nvidia RTX hair support is coming in a future update, and it's also looking into adding support for community requested features such as HUD modification.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if you've read all this and somehow still don't know what an Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is, allow me to point you toward <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's five star review</a>, which called it a "stealth action tour de force" and a "bold new era for MachineGames". That was before we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">crowned it our Game of 2024</a> too. And finally, Update 3's patch notes (spoilers ahead):

<li>Improvements to combat and stealth music transitions, to make them more seamless</li>
<li>Added sound for heavyweight enemies breaking out of a clinch</li>

                <p>There's a famous line in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings where Gandalf the Grey explains that a wizard is never late or early. Instead, "he arrives precisely when he means to." Video games, on the other hand, are another matter. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game/" data-ref-id="5000-604117">Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game</a> has been delayed again.</p><p>The game's developers, Private Division and Wētā Workshop, jointly announced that Tales of the Shire will now be released on July 29. Prior to that, Tales of the Shire was delayed from its 2024 release window and was scheduled to land on March 25. Now, fans will just have to wait until summer to move into the virtual Shire.</p><p>In the statement below, the given reason for the delay is that the devs want to ensure "the same cozy experience" is available on all platforms.

Tales of the Shire is all about the tranquil lives of Hobbits when they aren't out saving the world or having adventures.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-marine-2-devs-saber-and-hasbro-partner-for-a-%E2%80%9Ctentpole%E2%80%9D-aaa-game.1114860/</guid>

		<p>Hasbro and Saber Interactive have announced a new partnership to develop a new AAA game from one of the toy giant’s “tentpole IPs”.</p>
<p>Given how big Hasbro is and how many toy ranges and properties they produced, that could be pretty much anything. Hasbro owns Dungeon &amp; Dragons, Transformers, Magic: The Gathering, Monopoly, GI Joe, Battleship, Risk, Jenga, and so, so much more.</p>


<p>Of course, Saber is now best known for their excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, which launched to plenty critical and fan praise last year, and their surprising World War Z adaptation before then. We know their strengths as developers, and the technical prowess of their game engine to throw hundreds or thousands of individual enemies around on screen. It was great when used for a zombie shooter, and the perfect for depicting the Tyranids of 40K.</p>
<p>“We have many new digital collaborations in the works, but I’m especially excited to announce this one today, being a personal fan of many of this team’s games,” Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said in an earnings call. “Hasbro and Saber Interactive will be collaborating on an all-new video game partnership developed by the team behind 2024’s megahit, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Combining high-octane single-player action and amazing multiplayer with Saber’s Swarm tech, this new AAA title, based on one of our tentpole IPs, is sure to be a hit.”</p>
<p>Joining all of the dots, the answer’s pretty obvious.</p>

<p>Saber is clearly making <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/25/larian-boss-says-wizards-of-the-coast-not-to-blame-for-them-moving-on-from-baldurs-gate/">Baldur’s Gate 4</a>.</p>
<p>(Actually my money is on Transformers)</p>
<p>Answering questions, Cocks said that this would be a co-publishing deal, and that it’s specifically tapping the Space Marine 2 team to make the game – which was developed by the company’s main studio in Saint Petersburg, Russia. This sadly seems to reduce the odds of a Space Marine 3 happening, unless that project is already underway and the Hasbro collaboration scheduled to come after that.</p>

The patch added a ton of content, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-tmnt-turtles-80-90-bundle-battle-pass-s2-1851765490&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-tmnt-turtles-80-90-bundle-battle-pass-s2-1851765490">including some really expensive <em>TMNT </em>skins</a></span>, new weapons, and—most importantly for <em>THPS </em>fans out there—Grind, a skateboard park map. And it’s in here that we got out latest piece of evidence that a new <em>Tony Hawk </em>video game is soon to be announced. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>Charlie Intel </em>on Twitter</a></span>, in the new Grind map, you can find a skate shop area and in there you can spot a small poster that clearly includes the OG <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater </em>logo as well as a date: March 4, 2025. In response to the teaser, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tonyhawk/status/1892622967579832757&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tonyhawk/status/1892622967579832757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tony Hawk himself simply replied with eyeball emojis</a></span>, seemingly confirming that, yeah, this is for sure a teaser for a new game. (Xbox on Twitter also replied with the same emoji.) </p><p>Why did this appear in a <em>Call of Duty </em>game? Well, remember that before Activision was a <em>Call of Duty </em>machine, it published all the past <em>Tony Hawk</em> games. So this seems to be a bit of corporate synergy. How fun!</p><p>This is just the latest (and most concrete) evidence of a new <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-new-game-remaster-leak-confirmed-1851765242&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-new-game-remaster-leak-confirmed-1851765242">Earlier this week</a></span> a skateboarder who appeared in the last game, 2020's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://eneba-games.sjv.io/09da5O&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://eneba-games.sjv.io/09da5O" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2</em></a></span><em>,</em> claimed he’s appearing in a new <em>Tony Hawk</em> “remaster.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-activision-new-game-confirmed-thps-1851646946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-activision-new-game-confirmed-thps-1851646946">And in 2024</a></span>, Tony Hawk himself claimed the series had a future and that he was working with Activision again. </p><p>And on top of all that, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Wednesday, it was reported</a></span> that Microsoft (which owns Activision) was planning to announce and release a new <em>Tony Hawk </em>game in June as part of a yet-to-be-announced summer event.

Included with an ammo chest of new features, weapons, and more content was the return of the fan-favorite skate-themed map, Grind. The skatepark arena has been brought back mostly as fans remember it, with one exception being a giant, in-game TV screen featuring a very Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater-looking logo and a date of March 4, 2025.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Looks like a teaser for something related to Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater has been found in Black Ops 6’s Grind MP map!</p><p>Announcement on March 4. 👀 <a href="https://t.co/8efl6Qansl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8efl6Qansl</a></p></div>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It stops short of being in-your-face but is still undeniably an eyebrow-raising reference for fans who have been on the lookout for another entry in the Pro Skater series. Rumors that another installment could soon be announced began earlier this week when fellow skater Tyshawn Jones let it slip that he would soon be featured in an upcoming Tony Hawk video game (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-skater-claims-hes-in-a-new-tony-hawk-remaster-about-to-come-out/#google_vignette" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m in a Tony Hawk coming out, so that’s cool,” Jones said during a conversation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3umK3xG7Ly4&amp;t=1s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Breakfast Club podcast</u></a>. “They got a new one they remastering so that’s about to come out. I was in the last one.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a curious comment that had fans excited, with today’s newly revealed Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater Black Ops 6 Easter Egg letting them know when they can expect to learn more. Unfortunately, there’s no telling what exactly that March date has in store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision tried to breathe life into the franchise with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 5</a> back in 2015 but has yet to release another new numbered entry since. However, in 2020, fans received the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2">Pro Skater 1 + 2 remakes</a> from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-developer-vicarious-visions-blizzard-entertainment">Vicarious Visions</a>. That means it’s been five years since a Tony Hawk game hit store shelves. With so much evidence lining up for a big reveal next month, it seems the wait may soon be over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to see what that March 4 reveal has lined up, you can read up on a few of the other skateboarding-themed inclusions in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 2 Reloaded, including a pack of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activisions-costly-call-of-duty-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-crossover-has-some-players-saying-black-ops-6-should-just-go-free-to-play-at-this-point">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cosmetics that have some fans upset</a>.

Although there are a handful of crash fixes, there aren't many major issues at all in this patch, which Warhorse is calling Hotfix 1.1.2. Instead, the most exciting revision comes in The King's Gambit, where players can now keep the wine flowing for the king.</p><p>As related on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/1imfa12/kcd2_cant_pick_up_white_wine_during_the_kings/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, some players ran into an issue in The King's Gambit where the option to pour wine for the king disappears. When the king asks to switch from red wine to white, players failed the task when they couldn't fulfil that simple request.</p><p>Warhorse shared the Hotfix 1.1.2 breakdown on <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/hotfix-1-1-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. According to the developers, the primary adjustments include stability improvements and quest fixes. There's also a specific fix for the game on the Epic Games Store. Taken together, these changes may not seem very significant, but they're meant to help players have a more refined experience.</p><p>So far, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has been a massive hit for Warhorse Studios. It sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-tops-1-million-copies-sold-in-a-single-day/1100-6529264/" data-ref-id="1100-6529264">1 million copies in its first 24 hours</a>, and recently passed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-studio-reports-its-approaching-2-million-sales/1100-6529486/" data-ref-id="1100-6529486">the 2 million mark</a> as well.

                <p>EA and Hazelight Studios have <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/it-takes-two/about/friends-pass" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed information</a> about how Split Fiction's Friend's Pass and cross-play between different platforms work. There's even a free trial for players who don't own the game.</p><p>Similar to Hazelight's previous co-op games like It Takes Two and A Way Out, Split Fiction also offers a Friend's Pass. This allows players who bought the game to connect with someone who doesn't have a copy, and play through the game in its entirety. But this time, Split Fiction's version has some expanded features that weren't in those previous games, such as cross-platform play.</p><h2>How does Split Fiction's work?</h2><p>The first step is that one person has to own the game, whether it'd be a physical or digital copy. The next step is to have a buddy download Split Fiction's Friend's Pass on their chosen platform, whether it'd be PC, PlayStation, or Xbox through their respective digital storefronts. Just be aware that if you and your friend are playing on different platforms, for example PC and PlayStation, both of you need an EA account.</p><p>Next, the person who owns Split Fiction should send an in-game invite to their friend, whom then accepts the invite. Once that step is completed, both players can play through the entire game together.</p><p>What happens if neither of you own the game? No problem. The Friend's Pass offers a free trial for both players which includes the opening stages of Split Fiction. Both players will need to download the Friend's Pass version of the game, and once either of you purchase the full game, progresses can be continued.</p><p>Another aspect to note is that in It Takes Two and A Way Out, the player who was on the Friend's Pass version did not unlock trophies or achievements on their platform, while the one who owned the game did. At least in A Way Out, if the player on the Friend's Pass decides to purchase the full game later on, <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/a-way-out/a-way-out/play-a-way-out-with-the-friends-pass/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">they will retroactively earn the trophies and achievements</a> they would have unlocked while on the pass. It's unknown whether this is the same case for Split Fiction.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AAzbMPitPI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4AAzbMPitPI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>How does cross-play in Split Fiction work?</h2><p>It Takes Two and A Way Out didn't have cross-play, meaning that both players had to be on the same platform in order to play with each other. However, It Takes Two had cross-gen play, meaning that PS4 and PS5 players and Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S players could play with each other as long as they were on the same platform family.</p><p>Split Fiction is only on current-gen consoles, so cross-gen play doesn't exist. However, Split Fiction now offers cross-play, meaning that PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S players can all play together. Cross-play requires both players to sign up for separate EA accounts each, which you can <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help-home/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">make for free</a>.</p><p>Hazelight also has a <a href="https://discord.com/invite/hazelight" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord server</a> with a channel called "Looking for Player" for those who want to play Split Fiction with but don't have anyone available to arrange game sessions.</p><p>Split Fiction launches on March 6 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.
