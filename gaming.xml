Ultimate </em>and then taking a break from game directing to moonlight as a YouTuber and educate fans about game design, Masahiro Sakurai recently revealed he’s returned to development to work on <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>for Switch 2. But this past weekend, a comment Sakurai made about companies using AI in production drew harsh criticism. According to some experts, the mini-outrage was spurred on by a poor AI translation of what  Sakurai actually said, and shows the pitfalls of a  media ecosystem that increasingly relies on machine translation to understand a global medium. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196626,195697" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“<em>Super Smash Bros.</em> Director Masahiro Sakurai says large scale game development is becoming too time consuming and unsustainable,” read a now-deleted summary of an interview Sakurai gave to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.itmedia.co.jp/business/articles/2504/18/news061.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/business/articles/2504/18/news061.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>ITmedia Business Online</em></a></span>, a summary that rapidly spread on websites and subreddits over the weekend. “He believes Generative AI is an option to improve work efficiency.”</p><p>The summary relied on machine translation of what Sakurai had said, an increasingly common practice on social media where information sources for companies, many of which reside in Japan, are frequently in other languages (indeed X, formerly known as Twitter, has a translation tool directly built in, while places like Bluesky link out to Google’s tools). Amid growing criticisms that generative AI initiatives are just over-hyped plagiarism machines, many instantly lamented Sakurai’s apparent take. Et tu,<em> Smash</em> daddy?

On the other hand, the market for indie games made by solo and small groups is also growing. How do you see the future of the gaming market? </p><p><strong> Sakurai:</strong> To be honest, nobody knows what the future holds [TN: he used the proverb ‘The inch ahead is darkness’ which should mean that]. I think when we want to make a large-scale game like it is in the present day, it’d take so much labor that we’d go into a situation where it’s not sustainable. I feel like we cannot keep going on like this, but at this point, the one effective solution that comes to my mind would be something like Generative AI. I feel like we’ve come to a phase where we must change the schemes, for example by utilizing Generative AI to improve work efficiency. And we might enter an era where only companies that could deal well with those changes would survive.</p></blockquote><p>Rather than Sakurai talking about what needs to be done or what he plans to do right now, the snippet about AI is situated in a series of hypotheticals about the future. While it’s notable that he’s not asked about AI directly, and instead brings it up himself voluntarily, it’s also one small throwaway thought in a longer interview that touches on a bunch of other topics. Plus we don’t even know specifically which tools Sakurai is think of here. Procedural generation and other techniques already prevalent in large games like <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em>? Or actually using generative AI to make <em>Smash Bros.</em> character art and rig up animations for different costumes? </p><p>A good interviewer might follow up on these points but the subtle context clues that indicate the difference between wary warning and enthusiastic endorsement aren’t likely to come through in rough and dirty machine translations. “It’s the sort of nuance that a machine translator would have trouble picking up on because it means filling in blanks that it will never realize are there,” James told <em>Kotaku</em>. “So much of Japanese as a language, as you might be aware, operates by implication and shared assumptions between two people and with this wording in particular that Sakurai uses, no machine translation is going to reasonably pick up on what I’m talking about because the very context and tenor of the conversation itself informs how certain words and grammar are parsed in the Japanese.”<br></p><p>Fighting to preserve that nuance might be a losing game, especially online where so many conversations get flattened into familiar tropes and binaries to begin with. Though many threads and  stories that originally shared the incomplete machine translation of Sakurai’s comments <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.resetera.com/threads/masahiro-sakurai-believes-generative-ai-may-be-the-only-way-to-sustain-large-scale-game-development.1225143/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/masahiro-sakurai-believes-generative-ai-may-be-the-only-way-to-sustain-large-scale-game-development.1225143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have since been locked</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1lhsyd8/super_smash_bros_director_masahiro_sakurai_says/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1lhsyd8/super_smash_bros_director_masahiro_sakurai_says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deleted</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mynintendonews.com/2025/06/22/sakurai-sees-ai-as-a-potential-solution-for-improving-development-efficiency-as-costs-soar/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/06/22/sakurai-sees-ai-as-a-potential-solution-for-improving-development-efficiency-as-costs-soar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">or updated</a></span>, a less famous and popular developer probably wouldn’t get that level of follow-up and benefit of the doubt. Not to mention that there are still perfectly defensible reasons for being critical of Sakurai appearing to legitimize generative AI at all. </p><p>James argues that’s a difference between the American and Japanese contexts around AI and game development that goes deeper than translation mistakes. “AI discourse in Japan online is generally pretty far behind the west and criticism, while growing, mostly comes from outspoken individuals,” he wrote. “There is a lot of forced hype surrounding AI when it comes to advertising like in the west and certainly there are boneheads who actively shill for it, including in games. But overall at a social level, I would say it has yet to be subjected to the same level of rigor outside savvy creatives as abroad.”</p><p>The debate over what Sakurai actually said and meant is also a symptom of a growing problem in Western games media as sites lose sources and industry churn pushes out veteran staff (<em>Kotaku</em> once had three fluent Japanese speakers on staff at the same time). “Overall I do think it’s really concerning to see people recently trusting machine translators more than actual humans who have learned the languages,” Stenbuck told <em>Kotaku</em>. “Like, I do admit that the accuracy of machine translators has increased so much compared to the previous years, but there are still some phrases that are liable to be misinterpreted unless the translators know the exact context surrounding the statements.”</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ai-translation-of-smash-bros-directors-comments-about-1851784945]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Concept art from a long-canceled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman Arkham Knight</a> follow-up set to star Damian Wayne as the Dark Knight has surfaced online, giving us our best look yet at an aged Bruce.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Sabbath, as it was known, was in development at Batman Arkham Origins studio Warner Bros. Games Montreal after the launch of 2015's Arkham Knight, and would have featured two Batmen — father and son. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, however, the project was canceled by Warner Bros. and WB Games Montreal instead shifted focus to launch 2022's poorly-received Gotham Knights, a game with no Batmen at all. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Sabbath was planned as Warner Bros' next big Batman game, while Rocksteady itself explored concepts featuring other characters. Of course, Rocksteady itself circled back to its version of Batman (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-officially-ends-after-final-update-offline-mode-and-true-ending">sort of</a>) in its next project, the ill-fated Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Images from a former WB Games Montreal artist who worked on the project have now popped up on Artstation, featuring a youthful-looking Damian, grizzled and bearded Bruce, plus concepts for Killer Croc and Huntress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether this game would have been strictly part of the Arkhamverse canon has never been firmly established. On the one hand, some of the designs here — particularly a very different-looking Killer Croc — suggest this would have been something of a different take. That said, the same could be said of Poison Ivy's appearance in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which definitely was part of the Arkham-verse. And, of course, WB Games Montreal did make Batman Arkham Origins, a prequel that is considered canon to Rocksteady's core trilogy.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">New concept art from WB Games Montréal's cancelled 2015 Damian Wayne game "Project Sabbath" has surfaced, shared by character artist Rodrigue Pralier. The pieces clearly show Damian, an older Bruce, Killer Croc, and Huntress. The style and character designs further support the… <a href="https://t.co/aRwTD7caYE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/aRwTD7caYE</a></p>— Batman Arkham Videos (@ArkhamVideos) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamVideos/status/1936772762376315323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time concept art from the game has hit the internet. Back in 2021, another former WB Games Montreal developer posted images of Damian Wayne in his Batsuit — a sleek outfit with red Bat signal emblazoned on his chest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These designs also showed the same bearded older Bruce Wayne, although only inside his suit — meaning his newly-revealed face was obscured. Still, the designs suggest that, at some point, the older Bruce would still have suited up during his retirement. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>"Project Sabbath", a canceled Damian Wayne Batman game at WB Games Montreal, apparently has another wave of concept art revealed - this time by concept artist Goran Bukvic. The images match how the game was first described years ago.</p><p>Credit to Reddit user thebananapeeler2. <a href="https://t.co/TelAZeMVMj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/TelAZeMVMj</a></p></div>— The Arkham Channel (@ArkhamChannel) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamChannel/status/1457904698166546438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 9, 2021</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">After launching Gotham Knights and providing additional development help to Rocksteady on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, WB Games Montreal was downsized in December 2024, with almost 100 jobs lost. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-confirms-its-pulling-the-plug-on-new-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-content-after-season-4">Rocksteady's attempt at a co-op game featuring Batman side-characters was a flop</a>, though the developer is now <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-working-on-single-player-batman-game-monolith-productions-wonder-woman-in-trouble">reportedly working on a single-player Batman game once again</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe this will end up finally being the Bruce and Damian Wayne game fans have been waiting for?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The game is also available on Xbox and PlayStation consoles, though Battlefront 2 doesn't support cross-play between platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefront 2 has been steadily working its way up Steam's most-played games list since early May, when the game first began to climb from its usual player counts of around 1,000-1,500 in April to 5,000 concurrent players and beyond. In late May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2-is-super-popular-again-on-steam-as-fans-petition-for-a-third-game/1100-6531753/" data-ref-id="1100-6531753">Battlefront 2 broke its previous concurrent-player record</a> on Valve's platform and later peaked at nearly 19,000. Those player counts then dipped back down below 10,000 in subsequent weeks, only to skyrocket once more in the past few days to even higher heights.</p><p dir="ltr">Where, exactly, the huge surge of interest in Battlefront 2 came from eight years after the game's launch is up for debate, but it looks to have begun around the time Andor season 2 concluded on Disney+. The show in large part focuses on the formation of the Rebel Alliance and its struggle against the Empire in the leadup to Rogue One and A New Hope. The show also prominently features the Rebel base on Yavin 4 as a key location--an iconic Star Wars setting that just so happens to be a playable map in Battlefront 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Renewed interest in the Star Wars shooter has translated into calls from Andor <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">actor Muhannad Ben Amor</a> and players for EA to make a Star Wars Battlefront 3.

			<p>Funcom has announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/dune-awakening-tips-for-surviving-arrakis/">Dune: Awakening</a> has surpassed&nbsp;<strong>1 million copies sold<em>&nbsp;</em></strong>as part of an infographic that includes several statistics about how the game's launch has gone for players. The sales milestone also makes it Funcom's fastest-selling game to date.</p>
<p>According to the infographic, 816,720 players have been swallowed up by Shai-Hulud while surveying 25,529,505 square kilometers of Arrakis and consuming more than 6,110,692,000 grams of spice.</p>
<p>That's all well and good, but the Sleepers of Arrakis are likely happier to hear about the changes coming to the endgame, particularly those who would rather engage with the PvE gameplay in Dune: Awakening, and don't want to be bothered with PvP.</p>
<p>Joel Bylos, creative director of Dune: Awakening at Funcom, released a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/a-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp/">statement</a> to players today, beginning by saying, "<em>Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in.</em>"</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:3texdztqd4ued4siymm5thqc/app.bsky.feed.post/3lsbtlpe4cc27" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidqbgaaa5jcymkui276dk4nsx2q676sgwze4j43pfsfgjrc5txqeq">
<p lang="en">The Deep Desert is evolving. PvE players will have more space to explore and progress without unwanted conflict. The Landsraad is getting more variety, better pacing, and stronger rewards.Check out the letter from our Creative Director to know more about our plans:bit.ly/Dune_Awakeni...</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3texdztqd4ued4siymm5thqc?ref_src=embed">Dune: Awakening (@duneawakening.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3texdztqd4ued4siymm5thqc/post/3lsbtlpe4cc27?ref_src=embed">2025-06-23T14:54:25.908Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>"<em>We still believe in the core concept of the Deep Desert - an endlessly renewing location that resets every week and creates an activity loop for great rewards. The tension of heading out there, head on a swivel, eyes peeled for foes as you enter the most dangerous part of the most dangerous planet in the universe.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Our wish was that players would embrace this loop, forming guilds to work together to overcome the bleakness of the Deep Desert. But as Stephen King says, 'Wish in one hand, shit in the other, see which one fills up first.' One of my hands is overflowing right now and sadly not with wishes.</em>"</p>
<p>Bylos goes on to describe how there have been many players complaining that their time with Dune: Awakening is ending prematurely, "<em>due to the extremely competitive nature of the Deep Desert</em>." So, beginning "<em>soon</em>," there will be areas of the Deep Desert that are flagged as&nbsp;<strong>Partial Warfare (PvE)</strong>, while the majority of the Deep Desert will still be flagged as&nbsp;<strong>War of Assassins</strong><strong> (PvP</strong><strong>)</strong>.</p>
<p>The new PvE areas of the Deep Desert will allow those solo, PvE-focused players to harvest endgame and T6 resources "<em>without the threat of conflict they may not want</em>."</p>
<p>Bylos still stipulates though that those solo players will still find it to be a grind if they go that route, as the game is "<em>balanced around guilds and groups</em>." He also clarifies that the PvP areas of the Deep Desert will still be where the best resources can be found, and that they will remain "<em>high reward, high risk areas</em>."</p>
<p>Other changes are coming to PvP play, specifically around scout ornithopters. In the next batch of changes, scout ornithopters with rocket launchers attached will have their speed maneuverability reduced, and rockets fired from scout ornithopters will generate more heat.</p>
<p>Scout ornithopters without rocket launchers and equipped with thrusters will have a max speed boost regardless of wings to ensure they remain the fastest ornithopters available, and a T5 infantry rocket launcher will be added "<em>to help improve the dynamics of vehicle/ground combat</em>."</p>
<p>There are also more changes coming to the Landsraad, as Bylos says the team is "<em>addressing some key flaws in the Landsraad design</em>," such as how stockpiling items is currently rewarded, despite that not being the studio's intention with how it wants the Landsraad to function.</p>
<p>Bylos ends his statement asking players to be patient as Funcom works to improve Dune: Awakening and build it in collaboration with players based on their feedback.</p>
<p>"<em>Once a live game launches, it becomes a collaborative effort between the developers and the players to make it something amazing. We appreciate your feedback on what we hope is the beginning of a long journey together. Bear with us - our intention is to be clear and open in our communications and make Dune: Awakening a game that everybody can enjoy</em>."</p>
<p>The reaction from players to everything Bylos talked about in his statement has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1limep2/never_change_reddit/">unsurprisingly mixed</a>. Some think he's taking the game in the entirely wrong direction, and rug-pulling Dune: Awakening into an entirely different game. Others are rejoicing for the changes, thankful that they'll be able to take part in more endgame activities.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Dune: Awakening hasn't even been out for a full month. It'll take time for it to evolve as the meta changes and <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-will-add-more-hagga-basin-like-maps-in-future-dune-awakening-updates-new-pve-content-aimed-to-be-out-every-3-4-months/">new content is introduced</a>. And based on the fact that it has had an undeniably strong launch, it seems like Funcom is going to have the chance to evolve it for years to come.</p>

                <p><i>Batman: Arkham Knight is celebrating its 10-year anniversary today, June 23, 2015. Below, we look at how it raised the bar for not only superhero games, but for the third act in video game trilogies.</i></p><p dir="ltr">There's an old adage that good things come in threes, and that's an idea that applies perfectly to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/batman-arkham-knight/">Batman: Arkham Knight</a>. Rocksteady's final chapter in its Caped Crusader saga turned 10 years old this week, and it's still a masterpiece of superhero action that has stood the test of time. There's a lot to love about the game, from its dark storyline to its shocking twists--the Arkham Knight was a <em>red hood herring</em>--and more, but the lasting legacy of the game is that it solved the problem of video game trilogies a decade ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Here’s a familiar scenario: You fire up the third game in a beloved series, ready to be wowed. It’s good. You're having fun. But you can’t shake the feeling that you’ve done it all before. "More of the same" is a common criticism against video game trilogies' final chapters--but it's one Arkham Knight skillfully sidestepped.</p><p dir="ltr">If Arkham Asylum laid the foundation, then Arkham City was the stately Wayne Manor built atop it--bigger, bolder, and more refined. But by the time Arkham Knight came around, there were fears of fatigue. It followed the release of Batman: Arkham Origins in 2013 by Warner Bros. Montreal, which wasn't part of Rocksteady's trilogy but received considerably less acclaim. Could Rocksteady keep the momentum going?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519184-bak-8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519184" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519184-bak-8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519184"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519184-bak-8.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It did--by pushing every idea of its Batman to the extreme.</p><p dir="ltr">Arkham Knight is a finely tuned power fantasy built on three pillars: detective work, stealth, and bone-crunching combat. One moment you’re reconstructing crime scenes with high-tech forensic tools; the next, you’re a silent predator stalking armed militia; and then you're diving into balletic brawls that stitch gadgets and combos into a brutal symphony of chaos.</p><p dir="ltr">At this stage, Rocksteady trusted players to know how to be Batman. And in return, it gave them the tools to break past the limits of earlier games. Combat flowed with graceful brutality as you weaved through enemies using freeze grenades, shock rounds, and precision counters. In stealth segments, the fear mechanic hit new highs, as nothing quite matched the rush of trapping a squad of militants with a smoke bomb cloud and then quickly eliminating them one by one using new gameplay mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">But the game didn't just empower players--it challenged them. With the Arkham Knight and his private army escalating the threat level, players had to evolve. Rocksteady walked the razor’s edge between power fantasy and overpower fantasy, and never lost its balance along the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519185-bak-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519185-bak-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519185"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519185-bak-6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Then there was the Batmobile. What if Batman were a car? That’s the question Rocksteady answered by transforming Gotham’s most iconic vehicle into a game-changing mechanic. Not just a way to move across the city, the Batmobile became an extension of the Dark Knight himself--solving puzzles, charging into battles, and even taking on tanks. There's something surreal and satisfying about sneaking up on Deathstroke’s armored convoy in a 1,200bhp crime-fighting machine that could somehow still meet strict European noise-pollution requirements.</p><p dir="ltr">In the end, Batman: Arkham Knight <em>is </em>more of the same, but pushed to its absolute extreme. It's a fitting finale to the Arkhamverse--especially if you choose to ignore Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League--and a celebration of Batman that still shines a decade later.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519186-bak-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519186-bak-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519186"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4519186-bak-12.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you're looking to grab the game and celebrate its anniversary, then now is a great time to do so. The Arkham Knight Premium Edition regularly sells for an absurdly low price--<a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=10+Years+Ago%2C+Batman%3A+Arkham+Knight+Solved+The+Video+Game+Trilogy+Problem&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-06-23+09%3A55%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-23+09%3A55%3A18&amp;fnarticle_id=6532637&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=Features&amp;fntype3=Standard+Feature&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fbatman_arkham_knight_premium_edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2F10-years-ago-batman-arkham-knight-solved-the-video-game-trilogy-problem%2F1100-6532637%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">GOG has a DRM-free version for just $6</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gog-summer-game-sale-2025-best-deals/1100-6532543/">2025 Summer Sale</a>--and it's incredibly good value for money. Not only do you get the base game, but there’s a Batcave of DLC to dig into that ranges from challenge maps to standalone episodes focusing on Nightwing, Robin, Batgirl, Red Hood, Catwoman, and Harley Quinn.</p><p dir="ltr">If you've picked up a Switch 2, the game has also been substantially improved on the Nintendo platform as part of the Arkham Trilogy.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoE41LJyXh0"> According to Digital Foundry</a>, it's not entirely perfect, but it does run at a locked and mostly stable 30fps when compared to the sluggish performance on the original Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Over the weekend, Sega accidentally leaked sales figures for a number of its key franchises, revealing - among others - the sales of its open zone game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a>.</p>
<p>The numbers were accidentally included on the company's latest fiscal report and have since been swiftly removed, but not before fans shared the numbers on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-sammy-fiscal-report-mishap-reveals-sales-numbers-for-a-dozen-titles-lad-iw-1-66m-p3r-2-07m-sonic-frontiers-4-57m-p5r-7-25m-and-more.1224501/">ResetEra</a>.</p>
<p>Total sales of Sonic Frontiers were 4.57m, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-superstars">Sonic Superstars</a> was 2.43m, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-sonic-racing">Team Sonic Racing</a> was 3.5m. Meanwhile, as officially revealed by the company, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> sold 2.3m units.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the leak, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5 Royal</a> has sold 7.25m units - as expected - while Persona 3 Reload just 2.07m units. Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth sold 1.66m units, and Like A Dragon: The Man Who Erased His Name just 960,000.</p>
<p>Sega also officially revealed Metaphor: ReFantazio sold 2m units.</p>
<p>The company critically had a great year in 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> was well received by series fans, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> was an outstanding new RPG, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> was one of the best-reviewed Sonic games in recent memory. But this reception seemingly hasn't translated to strong sales.</p>
<p>Still, the figure for Sonic Frontiers does stand out. Released back in 2022, it proves the game has had a long sales tail - even if that's been spurred on by discounts. And, as the pre-eminent 3D game in the series, its sales have continued alongside both the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and 3 films.</p>
<p>Back in November 2022, Sonic Team head <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-frontiers-is-cornerstone-of-future-sonic-games-says-sonic-team-head">Takashi Iizuka stated Sonic Frontiers' open zone design was the "cornerstone of future Sonic games"</a>. There will be high hopes, then, for its presumed sequel.</p>
<p>Sonic Frontiers established the "open zone" design (rather than open world), which emphasised exploration as well as speed and took advantage of current hardware technology (despite its egregious pop-in).</p>
<p>Sonic Superstars, released a year later, has just over half the sales of Sonic Frontiers. A 2D game, it perhaps didn't sit well with fans after the forward-thinking Frontiers.</p>
<p>As for Sonic X Shadow Generations, it has sold well since its release last year, spurred on by the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film. However, it's still a remake of an older game. And it seems, as much as Sega trades in nostalgia, it's the open zone advancement in design that fans have responded to with their wallets.</p>
<p>The fact Team Sonic Racing has outsold more traditional platformers also bodes well for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">forthcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>
<p>In short, Team Sonic is heading in the right direction, and expectations will be high for the original game that follows Sonic Frontiers.</p>
<p>As Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">discussed with Iizuka recently</a>, Sonic has gone from "fighting to survive" to a global megastar in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>"When I moved over from Tokyo to Los Angeles, it was like an ‘oh my god' moment," Iizuka said. "Like, we need to save the brand, or this brand isn't going to be around for much longer."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-leaked-sales-figures-show-sonics-new-frontier-is-heading-in-the-right-direction]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Good news if you've been a bit frustrated with how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> handles PvE and PvP, specifically in terms of its treacherous Deep Desert. The game's creative director Joel Bylos has announced some changes coming in response to player feedback on both those and the Landsraad.</p>
<p>Basically, it looks like Funcom have switched up their plans to take the concerns folks have cited into account, aiming for a nice compromise between the original ideas and the practicalities of what's been happening since the game dropped in full.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/a-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp/">lengthy letter</a> to DA players, Bylos wrote that while the devs still believe their core concept of the Deep Desert as a dangerous, constantly changing place you go to get the rarest stuff, they're not aiming to force PvE enjoyers to engage with PvP just to get the good stuff.</p>
<p>So, to ensure those folks don't get locked out of the endgame, the director revealed that "starting soon, some areas of the Deep Desert will now be flagged as 'Partial Warfare (PvE)' areas where players will be able to explore testing stations and harvest T6 resources without the threat of conflict they may not want". The likes of "Landsraad control points, shipwrecks and the largest spice fields" will stay as PvP areas, to preserve the biggest rewards coming with the biggest risk.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We’ve been listening.</p><p>The Deep Desert is evolving. PvE players will have more space to explore and progress without unwanted conflict. The Landsraad is getting more variety, better pacing, and stronger rewards.</p><p>Check out the letter from our Creative Director to know more about… <a href="https://t.co/ZbHKgEBDwk">pic.twitter.com/ZbHKgEBDwk</a></p></div>— Dune: Awakening (@DuneAwakening) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuneAwakening/status/1937161730649452781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Speaking of PvP, Bylos wrote that the devs are "planning to make more changes to the Deep Desert to accommodate ground battles and reinforce the use of player builds", outlining some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">already incoming scout ornithopter tweaks</a> designed to help ensure air superiority isn't the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-players-kept-getting-squashed-by-ornithopters-so-an-update-has-made-everyone-invulnerable-to-vehicle-bashing">be all and end all</a>. There'll also be "additional changes to mechanics like respawn timers, vehicle storage tools, hand scanners, and other mechanics that we see being abused in the Deep Desert".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Funcom are aiming to address some "key flaws" in the Landsraad that folks have cited. These include problems with tasks being turned in very quickly, and folks being able to do nothing with them once they're completed. "Stockpiling is currently rewarded, but that is not our intention for this system, and we will make some changes to address it as best we can," the director wrote, adding that the system will also be "updated to provide micro rewards for solo/small group players".</p>
<p>It's nice to see the devs finding a way to balance their vision for DA with making the changes folks want. Judging by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1liirqh/a_message_from_the_creative_director_on_pve_and/">the socials</a>, the worm lovers who've been doin' the Dune are glad to see these steps are being taken, even if there's no concrete timeline on a lot of them at this point.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-deep-desert-is-getting-partial-warfare-pve-areas-so-you-can-gather-endgame-resources-without-being-pvped-to-death]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It's, uh, <em>hot</em> out. Hot enough that one shouldn't be outside. Hot enough that we're not streaming on Tuesday because Rob's afraid he would begin to melt. I kept telling my children they needed to hustle out the door this morning a few minutes earlier than usual, because every second that passed was a chance for the temperature to rise before I had a chance to mow the lawn. (It was still hot, but mustering all my fatherly energy, I got the job done. 💪) I also installed the father's gift I got a few weeks back: <a href="https://poolhacker.com/products/poolside-bar-for-aboveground-pool?ref=remapradio.com">a poolside bar attachment for our above ground pool</a>. I'm going to put it to good use almost immediately, folks. But if I enter that pool in 100-degree weather, I might not leave it, either.</p><p>-pk, who's now browsing all sorts of other goofy pool accessories</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>SGF Interviews [Part 2]</em> – At the end of the day, reporting is what makes me enjoy this job the most. It's one of those things I need to figure out with <em>Remap</em>'s future: how can I find ways to fuse this with <em>Remap</em>'s day-to-day more often? The bandwidth to do long articles isn't really there, but I'd like to find a format that's beyond me chatting with developers at the few events that I make it to every year. I've long kicked around doing a more timely interview-y show that was focused on a topic, i.e. an hour podcast talking with a Monster Hunter expert when <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> comes out. (That idea came to mind because of <em>Death Stranding 2</em> reviews hitting. How do we cover, or find our way into, games we're not all playing? We know lots of people.)</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>FGC: Firebreak</em> – We're skipping a Tuesday stream because of the heat wave that's moving through the Midwest and East Coast. My house can manage those temperatures pretty well but that's not the case in Rob's spot, which turns into a sauna. Playing a Remedy game in a literal sauna would be kinda funny, but we'd also like Rob to still be with us after the stream was over.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Wheel of GeForce NOW</em> – I think this is our last one in this batch? I'm not sure how much I'll be around for this one, because I'm prepping for a long drive for a family reunion that day. I'll try to pop my head in, though.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – I've had a pretty good idea where these were going the last few weeks, but that's just not true this week. In this essay, I will tell you what it's like to melt in the heat.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio </em>– Been really enjoying our podcasts lately, feels like we've been in a real groove. Hope you've been enjoying them, too. (There's a chance I'm missing next week, which would be funny, because it's the 100th episode of the podcast. I also missed the <em>first</em> episode while attending SGF. Alas!)</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

He plays <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">Gustave, the swordsman and gunslinger</a></span>, the first playable character you inhabit in the RPG. Notably, Cox hasn’t been that present in promoting the game, with Starr, English, and others in the cast making more appearances in trailers and panels. This isn’t too surprising, as Cox has been a bit preoccupied with his role in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-disney-marvel-news-1851714637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-disney-marvel-news-1851714637"><em>Daredevil: Born Again</em></a></span>, but as <em>Clair Obscur </em>has risen in popularity, it seems Cox has been caught off guard by all the hype.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197586" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="197586,197585,197583" data-current="197586"><div><p>Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23107.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This weekend, Cox was a guest at the Washington State Summer Con in Puyallup, where he took part in a <em>Daredevil </em>panel alongside co-stars Elden Henson, Vincent D’Onofrio, and Wilson Bethel. While the group primarily talked about their time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Cox was asked about his work on <em>Clair Obscur</em>.t The actor admitted he hasn’t actually played the game himself, and seemed a bit frazzled talking about the game, given his knowledge of it is limited to the four hours he spent in the booth recording Gustave’s dialogue.</p><p>“I don’t mean to minimize it in any way, and it’s so cool [that] apparently the game’s awesome,” Cox said to the audience. “I’m not a gamer. I have no idea. I haven’t played it. My agent asked me if I wanted to go and do a voiceover. I was in the studio for four hours, maybe? People keep saying how amazing it is and ‘congratulations,’ and I feel like a total fraud. But I’m so thrilled for the company, and I’m so thrilled it did really well. That was it. Just FYI. Ask someone else a question, I feel uncomfortable.”</p><p>It was an endearing moment. Sometimes, a voice acting role is just something you hop into a booth for one day, and it doesn’t become a months-long gig. Given how quickly Cox was in and out, it’s amazing his performance is as good as it is. Gustave is one of the most endearing characters in <em>Clair Obscur</em>, with a ton of emotional range. Cox may be surprised that Sandfall Interactive’s RPG has blown up the way it has, but I hope he also realizes how much his character played a part in its success. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-charlie-cox-gustave-voice-1851784940]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The veil shrouding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>'s upcoming Midnight expansion is set to be lifted at Gamescom 2025, with Blizzard confirming news and updates at the show about the next chapter in the game's Worldsoul Saga trilogy.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard announced fans can expect "exclusive news and updates" about Midnight "directly from the development team, along with a few additional surprises" during the five-day show in Cologne, Germany that runs August 20-24.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CE8zcDHcMA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2CE8zcDHcMA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It isn't much to go on, but Blizzard has in recent years used Gamescom for major announcements. Blizzard revealed the release date for the game's current The War Within expansion at Gamescom 2024 as part of an Xbox showcase, for example. While it's still unclear if Midnight will be released this year, it wouldn't be surprising if Blizzard gave it a definitive release date at the show.</p><p dir="ltr">Not much is currently known about Midnight. Blizzard announced an entire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-next-three-expansions-revealed-all-at-once-including-2024-the-war-within/1100-6518914/" data-ref-id="1100-6518914">trilogy of expansions back at BlizzCon 2023</a>, including Midnight, but only revealed a handful of details about what the expansions beyond The War Within would entail. In Midnight's case, it will see players revisit the homeland of the Blood Elves, Quel'thalas, as they look to stop the forces of the Void from claiming the Sunwell.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the "additional surprises" Blizzard has in store, it's hard to imagine more information about player housing, and a possible release date for the feature, aren't among them. Player housing is easily the most anticipated feature in the MMORPG's 20-year-history, and Blizzard has already teased that it will be coming ahead of Midnight proper, either as part of the expansion's pre-patch update or possibly even sooner. We came away impressed after a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">hands-on preview of WoW's player housing</a> decoration tools, stating that even the early test version we played felt loaded with endless possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">There is still plenty to tide WoW players over in the meantime. Blizzard recently revealed what's coming in The War Within's major 11.2 update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh</a>. The update will introduce the largest raid boss in WoW history as well as asynchronous multiplayer features for Delves that definitely feel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">inspired by From Software's Dark Souls series</a>. Players are additionally convinced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-are-convinced-a-new-way-to-play-demon-hunter-is-coming-soon/1100-6532569/" data-ref-id="1100-6532569">Blizzard is teasing a new Demon Hunter specialization</a>--one that could also make for a nice Gamescom surprise.</p>

It features a 17.3-inch QHD IPS screen with variable refresh rate support (from 48Hz going up to 240Hz). Powering this unit is an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 processor and the aforementioned Nvidia RTX 5070 graphics chip with 8GB of video RAM.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elio</em>, Pixar’s latest animated movie, hit theaters over the weekend. Odds are you didn’t see it, based on the flick’s not-so-great box office returns. In fact, the film now holds the unfortunate record for the worst opening weekend of a Pixar movie in the studio’s history. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197586" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="197586,197585,197583" data-current="197586"><div><p>Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23107.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/elio-pixar-worst-box-office-opening-28-years-later-debut-1236437579/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/elio-pixar-worst-box-office-opening-28-years-later-debut-1236437579/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>Variety</em></a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1561428737/?ref_=bo_hm_rd&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1561428737/?ref_=bo_hm_rd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Elio </em>brought in just $21 million</a></span> domestically from over 3,500 North American theaters during its opening weekend. For modern Pixar, that’s abysmal. Overseas, <em>Elio </em>racked up just $14 million. That means the new Pixar movie ended its opener at just $35 million. For comparison, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pro.imdb.com/boxoffice/brand/bn3530750466?rf=mojo_rl_cta_brand&amp;sort=releaseDate&amp;ref_=bo_bn__resort#table&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pro.imdb.com/boxoffice/brand/bn3530750466?rf=mojo_rl_cta_brand&amp;sort=releaseDate&amp;ref_=bo_bn__resort#table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most Pixar films earn around $50 million</a></span> or more domestically alone during their first weekend. In fact, the last time a Pixar film stumbled this badly out of the gate was 2023's <em>Elemental</em>, which previously held the record. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2023/film/news/pixar-elemental-box-office-rebound-1235691248/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/pixar-elemental-box-office-rebound-1235691248/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">However, <em>Elemental </em>had a happy ending</a></span>. Despite only earning $44 million globally after its first weekend and being called a bomb or flop by many online, the animated rom-com kept on earning money. By the end of its run, thanks largely to positive word of mouth and solid reviews, <em>Elemental </em>earned $496 million globally. That could happen with <em>Elio</em>, too. The movie is receiving rave reviews from both audiences and critics. However, <em>Elio</em> does have to compete with the live-action <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> film, which was the number one film at the box office over the weekend for a second week in a row, so it might struggle to turn things around. We shall see. </p><h2 id="h71640"><a id=""></a>Pixar might be forced to crank out sequels</h2><p>Regardless of what happens, <em>Elio </em>and <em>Elemental’s </em>lackluster opening weekend likely isn’t good for Pixar. While the studio can still produce big box office hits, like 2024's <em>Inside Out 2</em> and 2019's <em>Toy Story 4,</em> a problematic pattern is forming.</p><p>It appears Pixar is struggling to create new, original hit films that blow up and become pop culture icons like <em>The Incredibles </em>or <em>Monsters Inc</em>. If Disney sees sequels as solid money earners and original films, like <em>Elio</em>, as risky bets that have to rely on long theatrical runs to become profitable, it could lead to the Mickey Mouse empire changing up Pixar’s output. The studio might become entirely focused on sequels, with its few original projects sent to Disney+ to appease the content gods. It would be a sad fate for a studio that once had one of the best original film track records in Hollywood. And this seems to already be happening, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_films&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_films" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with only two of Pixar’s six announced movies being original projects</a></span>.</p><p>But in 2025, it really does seem like kids want stuff they know, l<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-box-office-opening-weekend-300-million-1851775046&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-box-office-opening-weekend-300-million-1851775046">ike <em>Minecraft </em>and live-action remakes</a></span>, and aren’t screaming to see original animated movies. <em>Or </em>their parents don’t want to risk spending $20+ on seeing a new movie, instead bringing their kids to Hollywood’s latest reheated leftovers. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/elio-worst-box-office-bad-pixar-disney-dragon-weekend-1851784926]]></content:encoded>
