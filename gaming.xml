			<p>Yesterday, during the company's quarterly financial report, Japanese game developer and publisher Square Enix <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-development-3-year-reboot-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> some Kingdom Hearts news. They confirmed that development on the fourth mainline installment was going forward, but they also canceled the spin-off Missing Link, which was targeting a release on mobile devices. The reason was that they could not offer a satisfactory live service over an extended period. The game's story would have been set in the Scala ad Caelum world between the events seen in Union X and Dark Road.</p>
<p>Of course, most fans are really interested in Kingdom Hearts IV. After all, it's been over three years since <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-quadratum-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's announcement</a>. Thankfully, earlier today, the official X account of the series <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819231965696436" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a new message and screenshots.</p>
<p><em>To our Kingdom Hearts community,</em></p>
<p><em>We’re currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts IV and will continue pouring ourselves into the game’s development. We’re dedicated to making this an experience that lives up to your expectations! We’ve seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts. We are equally excited and can’t wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts IV when the time is right. Until then, we appreciate your patience. Thank you for your continued support.</em></p>
<p>A few details of KHIV are already available. We know it's being made with Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and will be set in Quadratum, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-original-sora-tokyo-no-twewy-ties/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a city loosely inspired by Japan's Tokyo</a>, featuring fictional versions of Shibuya and Minami-Aoyama. Quadratum will function as the game's hub world, while Sora and his allies travel to other worlds for the missions. Story-wise, Kingdom Hearts IV will introduce the brand new 'Lost Master' story arc.</p>
<p>When it comes to gameplay, the game will bring back the reaction commands seen in KHII while also using a 'Scrap and Build' mechanic. Nomura-san and his team also plan to show off more of Sora's daily life and routines.</p>

By battling and customizing Beyblades, players can experience the excitement of actual bey battles in a form only a game can offer. This time, three further evolutions have been added.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features (Evolutions)</strong></p><ul><li><strong>EVOBATLE</strong> – <em>Beyblade X: XONE</em> was well-received for its “X (Extreme) Dash” and tactical yet action-packed bey battles in “X (Extreme) Line”-equipped stadiums.

Though franchise fans are no strangers to waiting for information and, subsequently, game launches, Square Enix wanted to update fans on how development is progressing and provide a few new screenshots.</p><p>The update came via the official Kingdom Hearts X accounts. Both the <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819231965696436">English</a> and <a href="https://x.com/_KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819279990251633">Japanese</a> accounts shared multiple screenshots combined into one image. The smaller screenshots are the same, but the large header screenshots differ depending on the account.</p>

<p>The screenshots were accompanied by a message from the development team. "To our Kingdom Hearts community," the post reads, "We're currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts IV and will continue pouring ourselves into the game's development. We're dedicated to making this an experience that lives up to your expectations!"</p><p>"We've seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts," the account continues in <a href="https://x.com/kingdomhearts/status/1922819245030899902?s=46&amp;t=NQuiqRa_BGRV8b-BEm-aYw">a subsequent post</a>. "We are equally excited and can't wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts IV when the time is right. Until then, we appreciate your patience. Thank you for your continued support."</p><p>While the large screenshots are action shots of Sora in combat, the smaller visuals released by the Kingdom Hearts team tonight feature what appear to be cinematics and an enemy. However, one intriguing screen seems to indicate that Mickey could be playable, unless it's just an unconventional camera angle.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>EA is asking employees to return to the office for three days per week under a hybrid model – and it sounds like the company will be significantly reducing remote hiring. CEO Andrew Wilson and president of EA Entertainment and technology Laura Miele sent emails to staff about the change, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring"><em>IGN</em> reports</a>. <em>Kotaku’s</em> Ethan Gach <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667401/eas-ceo-is-asking-staff-to-return-to-the-office">also reported</a> on Wilson’s email.</p><p>Corporate communications VP Justin Higgs confirmed the new hybrid model to <em>The Verge</em>. “We’ve adopted a globally consistent hybrid work model to bring teams together with greater clarity and intent – enabling faster decisions, sharper execution, and stronger connection to one another,” Higgs says. Hybrid roles will spend “at least three days a week in the office,” though there will be “flexibility” on other roles.</p><p>Miele’s email details how EA locations will have a 30-mile radius around them to help determine if an employee falls under the on site, hybrid, or remote model for work, IGN reports. Here’s what Miele says, per <em>IGN</em>:</p><div><ul><li><span>Employees who live within 30-miles/48-km of an EA location will transition to a Hybrid work model.</span></li><li><span>Employees who live outside the 30-mile/48-km radius will be considered remote unless their role is designated as On Site or Hybrid.</span></li></ul></div><p>The “offsite local” work model is going to be sunset within 3 to 24 months. In addition, “any work model exception and future Remote hires will require a CEO Direct’s /my approval,” Miele’s email says, according to IGN.</p><p><em><strong>Update, May 14th</strong>: Noted that Ethan Gach also reported on Wilson’s email.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He then went on to broadly outline that "hybrid work" would now be defined as a "minimum of three days a week in your local office," and that "offsite local roles" would be gradually phased out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a follow-up email from EA Entertainment president, Laura Miele, also viewed by IGN, she clarified further details, describing the company as moving from "a decentralized approach to a globally consistent, enterprise-wide work model":</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>These changes will not take effect immediately. Employees should continue working as directed by your Business Unit until further notice, regardless of where you live.</em></li><li><em>Work model transitions will come with a minimum 12-week notice period before any changes are implemented. The timing will vary by location and will be communicated locally with plenty of notice.</em></li><li><em>Hybrid work will mean working from your local office at least three days per week–this aligns with what’s outlined in Andrew’s EA Action. </em></li><li><em>We are introducing a new 30-mile/48-km radius around EA locations.</em></li><li><em>What this means:</em><ul data-cy="list"><li><em>Employees who live within 30-miles/48-km of an EA location will transition to a Hybrid work model. </em></li><li><em>Employees who live outside the 30-mile/48-km radius will be considered remote unless their role is designated as On Site or Hybrid.</em></li></ul></li><li><em>We will also sunset the Offsite Local work model. Depending on your location, this transition may take 3 to 24 months.</em></li><li><em>Any work model exception and future Remote hires will require a CEO Direct’s /my approval. </em></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Several sources within EA speaking to IGN anonymously said that employees were upset and confused, with some employees sharing hours-long commutes they were now being expected to make, or expressing concerns regarding childcare or personal medical conditions that had benefited from remote work. Others, classified as remote and outside the 30-mile range, expressed concern for what would happen to their roles if they were unwilling or unable to move closer to an office long-term. Two sources explained to IGN that per the breakdown sent by Miele, existing remote workers would have their "exemptions" to return to office "sunset" sometime in the next 3 to 24 months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While remote work has long been prevalent in the video game industry, it became exceptionally popular during and after the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, when stay-at-home mandates forced most AAA companies to adapt remote work as a long-term solution. In the years since, more and more companies have hired more and more remote workers, and existing near-office workers have reported moving to cheaper cities away from offices, under the impression that remote work was permanent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, other major video game companies have recently been calling workers back to office, resulting in frustration and, at times, employee turnover as workers were forced to choose between expensive or challenging relocation and their jobs. Companies such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-games-is-asking-employees-to-return-to-office-amid-gta-security-concerns">Rockstar Games</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-montreal-in-turmoil-amid-what-developers-are-calling-broken-promises">Ubisoft</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-qa-workers-protest-new-office-mandate-calling-it-a-soft-layoff">Activision</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-producer-claims-studio-is-creating-crisis-maps-as-more-employees-depart">Blizzard</a> have all faced criticism from within and without as a result of these policies. However, the return to office mandates have appeared to move apace, with more companies such as EA opting to require an in-office model once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cuts-around-300-roles-including-roughly-100-at-respawn">laid off around 300 individuals company-wide</a>, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">earlier layoffs at BioWare this year</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">termination of around 670 roles last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to EA for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages.”</p><p>Valve adds that you don’t need to change your password or phone number following this leak, though it does recommend setting up the Steam Mobile Authenticator.</p><p>The company says it’s “still digging into the source of the leak.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The open-world wizarding adventure Hogwarts Legacy is getting a Switch 2 release, and it's one of the console's launch games on June 5. The new version will include upgrades like Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, improved graphics, and shorter load times. Folks who already own the game can upgrade to the Switch 2 edition for just $10, while <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8F1SVKM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders for the physical Game-Key Card version</a> are available now for $60 at multiple online retailers.</p><div title="6531541 - Hogwarts Legacy Switch 2 Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3511" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6531541 - Hogwarts Legacy Switch 2 Preorders" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8F1SVKM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F8F1SVKM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8F1SVKM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Hogwarts Legacy - Switch 2 Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8F1SVKM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F8F1SVKM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8F1SVKM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$60 | Releases June 5</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p><span>This updated version of Hogwarts Legacy is the same open-world action RPG as the one released in 2023. However, it makes a few big upgrades thanks to the additional processing power on Switch 2. For one, it offers improved graphics and shorter load times. You’ll also benefit from crisper audio, reworked controls, and support for the Joy-Con 2 mouse sensor.</span></p>                      </div><p>Note that Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 comes on a Game-Key Card, which means none of the game data is on the cartridge itself, and instead it acts as physical DRM that unlocks the digital version. You'll need to download the game to your console before you can play.</p><p>As mentioned above, players who already own Hogwarts Legacy on Switch can upgrade for just $10. That means it might be worth hunting down a cheap copy of Hogwarts Legacy on Switch ahead of time, then dropping an additional $10 to upgrade to the Switch 2 version. If you want to go that route, Hogwarts Legacy is on sale for just $18 (was $60) on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hogwarts-legacy-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switch eShop</a>. Once it’s in your library, you’ll be able to upgrade to a Switch 2 copy for an extra $10--meaning you'll pay just $28 total, rather than $60.</p><p>Hogwarts Legacy takes place well before the events of Harry Potter. It sees you creating your own character and enrolling in Hogwarts. You’ll learn a variety of useful spells during your adventure, as you set out to discover a secret regarding ancient magic and a dangerous dragon. It earned positive reviews from critics and fans, and it looks like this jump to Switch 2 will be another chance for folks to live out their wizarding dreams.

Interactive Entertainment. Prior to the game's initial 2023 launch, Hogwarts Legacy was embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she was not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success.

Nintendo has recently shared that players can customize these buttons to map to specific actions on a per-game basis.</p><p>In an overview posted on the Nintendo Today app, the company explained that the new buttons are fully mappable by the player. This means that they can take on the role of any other button on the controller. Moreover, these mappings can be set for each game, meaning that you'll have the ability to set up game-specific controller settings.</p>

(It also gave us an alien who instantly became one of my favorite <em>Star Wars </em>creatures ever!) </p><p>Episodes 11 and 12 weren’t peak <em>Andor</em>, but I have to admit that the final slow-motion montage sequence really worked for me, and they had a political dimension I found somewhat surprising that I’ll discuss a bit more later.</p><p><strong>Zack Zwiezen:</strong> I was worried that the final episode would run out of steam as Tony Gilroy and co literally ran out of space for storytelling and had to slam the brakes to set up <em>Rogue One. </em>And while I enjoyed the montage slow-walk, I wonder if that works if you haven’t seen <em>Rogue One</em>. </p><p>But overall, the final three episodes are really good. And I think the Kleya-Luthen focused episode is one of my favorite <em>Andor </em>episodes ever. I’m so happy she got a big spotlight before the end.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Me, too. That episode also helped cement, I think, that the show recognizes how necessary all of Luthen’s efforts were, even if those fussy ineffectual bureaucrats on Yavin don’t. </p><p>This is an issue I’ve long had with how <em>Star Wars</em> has at times sanded away its own political dimensions in my view, something that <em>Andor </em>not only seeks to undo but takes farther than ever before. In truth, the act of blowing up the Death Star in the first film, that act which people cheered for in theaters in 1977 and that <em>Star Wars</em> fans for decades since have loved and admired, would, in universe, be considered an act of terrorism. That’s what the Empire would call it. That’s what governments do: they present their own violence as “legitimate” or “necessary” and the violence of those rebelling against them as “terrorism.” </p><p>But there were times in <em>Star Wars</em> history where I felt like the people at the reins of the franchise wanted to send a message that you shouldn’t be “too extreme” in your resistance, don’t be a Saw Gerrera, do it through “proper channels.” And so I loved that <em>Andor </em>gave us that scene with Bail and some other politicians all kind of hemming and hawing over Luthen while the show, I think, was emphatically telling all of us, “Luthen was right. Maybe not every single little decision he made was right, but his ethos was fundamentally right and without someone like him, none of this would have been here.” And I loved it for that.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I think, and they talk about this in the behind the scenes, it’s very important that Luthen’s fight against the empire was really because Kleya wanted revenge.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Right. She’s the humanity that he’s fighting for. She’s what radicalizes him.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>If he hadn’t found her and saved her, Luthen likely doesn’t become the rebel we know in <em>Andor</em>. And it also adds a new layer of complexity to their relationship. He was part of the army that brutalized her people. So she still has some lingering hatred for him. And yet she does care about him. And in that moment when she sneaks into the hospital to finish the job, you can feel that.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> I think that scene with the Rebel Alliance leaders also helps show the Senate mentality creeping back in as the insurgency professionalizes itself.</p><p>It’s easy to see why even after defeating the Empire in key battles it might struggle to rebuild or retain power, issues explored in <em>Ahsoka </em>and <em>The Mandalorian</em>. These last few episodes help situate Cassian between the uncompromising logic of Luthen’s spycraft and the “no one left behind” mentality of the Rebellion. Luthen’s final sacrifice is to die, and Cassian’s is to go back and risk everything just to save someone.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>We should rewind a bit and talk about that moment between Luthen and Dedra. Or even further actually, and pour one out for Lonni, who I knew was dead the moment he sat down at that bench.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Yeah. When he mentioned his wife and kid, for a moment I thought mayyyyyyyybe Luthen would be like “You know what? I owe this guy.” But alas, no.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I also loved that line Luthen gave Klaya before the meeting: “I think we used up all the perfect.” </p><p><strong>CP:</strong> So good.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> And then we get Dedra Meero walking into Luthen’s shop as he’s destroying evidence. My wife literally gasped “OH SHIT!” at seeing Dedra at the door.</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>Only two artifacts may not be what they seem!</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> In a show that so often demands that characters put on a performance to blend into their surroundings, it was great seeing those two feel each other out and Luthen pretend for a bit that she was maybe not there to arrest him. </p><p>But then, of course, he tries to kill himself, and you see that he was thinking a few steps ahead when he picked up the knife, though he made it seem like it was just part of their friendly dealings.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> When he picked up the knife I was so distracted by him mentioning it being a Nautolan artifact (Kit Fisto’s species) that I didn’t realize why he picked a knife.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Hahaha, the perils of having a database of<em> Star Wars</em> knowledge in your brain!</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> And then after he’s taken to the hospital, we get that wonderful sequence with Klaya sneaking in and taking him off life support. Anybody else want a <em>Hitman</em>-like <em>Star Wars</em> game now?</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> If that alien Kleya pushes around as she’s pretending to be hospital personnel is in it, absolutely! But yes, that was a great infiltration sequence, both thrilling and kind of excruciating because we knew what she was going there to do.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> It included some of the best Coruscant backdrops we’ve ever gotten, I think.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> One other moment from that episode that I can’t stop thinking about was the flashback scene in which we see Imperial officers drag some civilians through town, put them up against a wall, and kill them. </p><p>It was another gut-wrenching reminder of the Empire’s evil and another moment that felt weirdly resonant as more and more people are being arrested by agents who often won’t even show warrants or identification in the streets of our towns.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> On the flipside of that horrible moment that made me feel a pit in my stomach, we have Dedra getting arrested for being reckless and not following orders by chasing after Luthen long after she was supposed to be off the Axis investigation. I have to admit I smiled when I realized it was all over for her.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Man, I don’t know. I mean I absolutely hate her, don’t get me wrong, and yet that final shot of her, where we see that she’s in a prison very much like the one Cassian was in last season (if not the same one) was complicated for me. Like, I think that kind of incarceration is just wrong in and of itself and so it elicited this weird moment of something like sympathy for her, which in no way means I forgive her for what she’s done. It’s just one of those reminders that it’s ultimately a systemic evil that will sometimes grind up the people operating inside of it and supporting it as much as those being actively persecuted.</p><p>The leopards ate her face, in other words.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Space leopards.</p><p>But I agree, yes, that the Empire is evil and the way it operates (like many real-world countries) is to crush people up to fuel the fires of growth and war. And I think it was very arrogant of her to believe she would be spared. Or maybe she truly bought into the lies that the Empire was good and doing the right thing? Surely, she won’t end up in some horrible place and left to rot forever.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Yep.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>Meanwhile, her boss, after all of these failures and letting the info on the Death Star slip out, realizes what’s coming for him and knows he doesn’t want to be ripped apart by the machine he helped create. And takes an easier way out. </p><p><strong>CP:</strong> That was the first and only indication we ever got that Nemik’s manifesto is actually spreading around, right, that people are listening to it? That was a cool moment, I thought, where at first we think it’s non-diegetic, just the writers and filmmakers reminding us one last time of Nemik’s stirring words, but then we see, oh, no, Partagaz was actually listening to it, the fire is spreading. It’s out there.</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>I loved the scene right outside when the gun shot goes off.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Yeah, so clear that the guy knew Partagaz wasn’t just taking a moment to “collect his thoughts,” he knew exactly what was coming.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>The slight “stand down” gesture to the troopers.</p><p><strong>EG: </strong>I appreciate the minor moments of humanity <em>Andor </em>evokes even between the worst people.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Yeah, they’re essential IMO.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> It makes them more evil. They are human beings. People with feelings and thoughts. And yet they still do this shit.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> Something also given to Krennic when he and Partagaz wish each other luck at facing Palpatine’s wrath. Unlike the more buffoonish bad guy energy he gives off in <em>Rogue One</em>.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Also, very fun to see a character call out the Death Star name. Partagaz thinks its dumb.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I’m so happy to see K-2SO back!</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Yes. Not unlike C-3P0 he can be so exasperating at times (in an endearing and funny way), but when he goes full Terminator on Empire goons, man it feels good.</p><p>For me, the whole tone of the scene with Andor and Melshi in the safehouse with Kleya and the communications jammed changed from “Oh shit, oh shit, get outta there!” to “LMAO y’all are about to get owned” as soon as K-2SO left the ship to go in for them, and it was glorious.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Yeah. The moment K-2SO shows up, it’s basically over for those imperial assholes and I loved it so much. I also like that the show uses its limited time with K-2SO to really develop a relationship between him and Cassian. They seem like buds!</p><p>The part where they are playing space poker or whatever was great. Gilroy mentioned that after Bix leaves the place becomes a frat house, with Melshi moving in and them all drinking and partying between missions.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Ah, that totally makes sense!</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I wonder if Andor is trying to drink away some pain and fill his life with friends to deal with losing Bix? That’s my read. He needs some buds and suds.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Definitely. </p><p>There’s a part of me that still feels like Andor, the title character, could have maybe used a little bit more character development in this show, that with all of its moving pieces his own journey, both ideologically and as a person, maybe got a smidge sidelined. But I do like that we see him dreaming about his sister, since finding her was the big obsession driving him in the early episodes of season one. </p><p>Now, I feel like he’s accepted that she’s gone but still the idea of her, his depth of feeling for her and the pain of losing her is part of what drives him to create a better world, not entirely unlike Luthen being driven by his love for Kleya. And speaking of love and the things that drive us, how did y’all feel about that final-final image of the show?</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I loved it! To me it worked perfectly with a theme in <em>Andor</em>: hope.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> “There is another.” lmao.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Right, to me it did in part feel like a nod to <em>Star Wars</em>’ obsession with dynasties and legacies, like we have to believe that, though Andor himself dies, what he stands for will live on not just as an idea but because he literally has a child. And yet, I still kinda liked it. We didn’t get a lightsaber but we did get a continued bloodline!</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I think the show needed some hope at the end.</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> I think it was very thematically appropriate, even if I’m torn on the merits of mixing insurgency and family. It’s a division that feels a bit too tidy.</p><p><strong>ZZ: </strong>I think it did provide more reason for Bix leaving like she did. She was pregnant. She wanted to give her child a peaceful life and knew Andor would follow her if he knew. And in her mind, she’s thinking that they’ll get back together one day after the Empire has fallen. It’s both a very tragic final scene and also this reminder that there is more. This isn’t an ending.</p><figure id="" data-id="fad46f7e30d05a59aba45bbdb8a7cd39" data-recommend-id="image://fad46f7e30d05a59aba45bbdb8a7cd39" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fad46f7e30d05a59aba45bbdb8a7cd39" data-recommend-id="image://fad46f7e30d05a59aba45bbdb8a7cd39" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>CP:</strong> Vel even tells him not to wait too long to reconnect, and we already know he never gets the chance! Really loved that those two, Cassian and Vel, got a moment here, too, and got to acknowledge all those they’ve lost along the way. </p><p>But yes, you’re right, it was a lovely mix of deeply sad and hopeful, that final image. Luthen, Cassian, Saw, and so many others know they’re fighting for a world they themselves will likely not live to see. But that kid might.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> And before we leave, I did like that we got one more tiny moment with Mon’s husbasnd</p><p>He seems to be with the mother of the boy his daughter married? It was very fast. Couldn’t tell. But him just getting drunk in a limo on Coruscant, presumably throwing his wife under the bus and pledging loyalty to the Empire, seemed like all we needed to know about what happened to him.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Exactly. He is who we knew he was and his sad empty privileged life is his reward for it.</p><p>I’d be curious to know how that final montage plays for folks who haven’t seen <em>Rogue One</em>. It really worked for me, seeing Cassian all dressed up for his fateful mission, the cuts to Dedra and other characters, and all around him, the Rebel base on Yavin, active and buzzing, about to change the galaxy, and now we know it’s all because of the efforts of so many people but among them, one Luthen Rael, an unsung hero of <em>Star Wars.</em> Are either of you planning on rewatching <em>Rogue One</em> any time soon?</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> I wanted to hold off until after this VG chat so I came into this without the weight of <em>Rogue One </em>on my mind. I plan on watching it this weekend! </p><p><strong>EG:</strong> I will say, as a parting thought, I don’t know that I needed the show to try and line up so neatly with <em>Rogue One,</em> perhaps the worst part of which is that silly blueprint handoff that directly leads into <em>A New Hope.</em> I do think some of the broader thrust of <em>Andor </em>and the unease and disquiet within its characters ended up being subsumed a little to neatly by the end of episode 12.</p><p><strong>CP: </strong>Oh, I agree. At a certain point in the final episode you really feel the show shift into “Okay, let’s get all the pieces in place for <em>Rogue On</em>e” mode.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Yeah. It reminds me of the ending of <em>Star Wars Episode III</em>, where George Lucas sets up all the pieces for <em>A New Hope </em>and it feels less like an actual ending and more like a checkpoint.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> And I think heading right from <em>Andor </em>into <em>Rogue One</em> will be quite jarring because—sorry <em>Rogue On</em>e!—your dialogue is just not on the same level!</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Nope! And what happened to Bail Organa! Did he get a haircut?</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> Hahaha.</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> But really, if that’s my biggest complaint about <em>Andor</em>—that its ending isn’t as strong as it could have been because of <em>Rogue One</em>—I’m still really happy.</p><p>I’m not sure we’ll ever get a show like this again, or at least not for a long time. Real sets. Lots of actors. Incredible writing. Big budgets. Set in a large franchise. All this freedom. Even Gilroy has stated he’s not sure if this kind of thing will ever happen again.</p><p><strong>CP:</strong> It was glorious, and while I really hope we see more like it, I’ll try to just be grateful for the miracle that we ever got it at all. Now I just need Disney to put it on Blu-ray so I have it on physical media and it’s not trapped on a streaming service forever!</p><p><strong>ZZ:</strong> Rebellions and physical libraries of movies we love are built on hope. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>This might seem minor on face, but if true, it would actually mark a significant change for Rockstar. Children have never shown up as pedestrians in GTA games in the past, due to the violence and graphic imagery commonplace in the series, and you can count <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Children" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the number of kids who've shown up in cinematics or story beats throughout the series</a> on two hands. There is virtually no chance that kids will actually be out wandering the world, as Rockstar and publisher Take-Two would likely not want to risk the possibility of in-game violence being perpetrated against children. However, it is an interesting quirk in the studio's gradual reveal of GTA VI's world.</p><p>This is just one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-fan-theories/2900-6585/" data-ref-id="2900-6585">the many GTA VI rumors and fan theories</a> that have come out of the community. Fans have pored over the trailer frame by frame to speculate about things like listening to music outside of vehicles, the possibility of heists, and potential betrayal in the future for main characters Jason and Lucia.</p><p dir="ltr">Grand Theft Auto VI's latest trailer has quickly become <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-hit-almost-a-half-billion-views-right-away/1100-6531396/" data-ref-id="1100-6531396">one of the biggest YouTube videos in recent memory</a>, and the game is so hotly anticipated that it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-hurt-total-video-game-industry-sales-in-2025/1100-6531288/" data-ref-id="1100-6531288">affecting release strategies across the games industry</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Prince of Persia The Sands of Time - Teaser Trailer | Ubisoft Forward</p>
      </div>
<p>This release window would mark nearly six years since the announcement of the game. Ubisoft originally teased the Sands of Time remake way back in 2020 for last-gen consoles. Since then, it has had a rocky development process, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-changes-developers/1100-6503046/" data-ref-id="1100-6503046">switching developers</a> a few years ago following fan backlash to the original trailer and a missed launch date. It's probably safe to say at this point that the remake, now in the works at Ubisoft Montreal, will come to current-gen consoles.</p><p>In guidance to investors, Ubisoft is positioning the remake as part of a FY2025-26 lineup that is meant to stabilize the company's finances. In addition to the remake, its upcoming slate includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anno-117-pax-romana/" data-ref-id="5000-632093">Anno 117</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-resurgence/" data-ref-id="5000-566851">The Division Resurgence</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-mobile/" data-ref-id="5000-562223">Rainbow Six Mobile</a>. However, the publisher also announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-delays-multiple-upcoming-games/1100-6531542/" data-ref-id="1100-6531542">it is delaying multiple titles out of the current fiscal year</a> and will have to continue cost-cutting measures in the near future.</p><p>This comes on the heels of a long stretch of bad news for the company, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">several rounds of layoffs, studio closures</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-delays-multiple-upcoming-games/1100-6531542/" data-ref-id="1100-6531542">decreasing profits</a>. Ubisoft recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">a corporate restructuring</a> meant to consolidate efforts on its tentpole franchises Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry, and to integrate a large new investment from Tencent.</p>

But I don’t know that anyone expected it to get quite so much love as it has, and not just from diehard RPG fans. It’s currently the highest-rated game of 2025 on Metacritic and a possible frontrunner for Game of the Year at the Game Awards. No one could have predicted this.

Well, an oracle told me,” he joked. The<em>&nbsp;</em>director of <em>BG3</em>, which swept most awards shows the year prior, laid out what would be the defining qualities of future winners as an allegory for what he hoped more studios and companies would strive for in the years ahead.</p><p> “The oracle told me that the Game of the Year 2025 is going to be made by a studio who found the formula to make it up here on stage,” Vincke said. “It’s stupidly simple, but somehow it keeps on getting lost. A studio makes a game because they want to make a game they want to play themselves. They created it because it hadn’t been created before. They didn’t make it to increase market share. They didn’t make it to serve the brand. They didn’t have to meet arbitrary sales targets, or fear being laid off if they didn’t meet those targets.”</p><p>He continued,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>They were driven by idealism, and wanted players to have fun, and they realized that if the developers don’t have fun, nobody was going to have any fun. They understood the value of respect, that if they treated their developers and players well, the same developers and players would forgive them when things didn’t go as planned. But above all they cared about their games, because they love games. It’s really that simple.</p></blockquote><p>  The speech’s relevance to the circumstances surrounding Sandfall Interactive and its debut game hasn’t gone unnoticed among <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> fans as the developers have talked about their passion for the genre and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gestral-final-fantasy-10-1851780358&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gestral-final-fantasy-10-1851780358">the classics that inspired them</a></span>. At a time when turn-based RPGs are considered more niche, <em>Expedition 33 </em>doesn’t shy away from throwback features like a world map and separate battle screens, all in service of a story that’s not afraid to leave players fumbling for answers. </p><p>The connection to Vincke’s speech <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1klnq42/ceo_of_larian_studios_predicting_expedition_33_as/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1klnq42/ceo_of_larian_studios_predicting_expedition_33_as/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently blew up on the game’s subreddit</a></span>. “It’s not that Expedition 33 is a <em>perfect</em> game,” wrote one fan. “If you look for flaws or things that other games have that <em>E33 </em>doesn’t, you’ll find a few things. But still, the game has passion at its every corner and that’s what really sticks with us in the end. The flaws are so easy to ignore because the things that really matter are perfect.”</p><p>In a video game industry struggling to please players and hit sales targets amid swelling budgets, increased competition, and stagnating creativity, <em>Expedition 33 </em>has been turned into something of a golden child: a small team utilizing off-the-shelf tech and extensive outsourcing to bring a good idea to fruition without breaking the bank or succumbing to feature bloat. The efficacy of that roadmap for other developers is debatable, but the results so far speak for themselves. Following Vincke’s advice might not guarantee success, but not doing so increasingly seems to assure mediocrity.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>We've known for months now that Valve is expanding its Linux-based SteamOS operating system beyond the Steam Deck to other handheld PCs, starting with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/valves-bespoke-steam-deck-os-will-be-officially-available-on-asus-rog-ally/">some versions of the Asus ROG Ally</a>. This week, Valve began making some changes to its Steam storefront to prepare for a future when the Deck isn't the only hardware running SteamOS.</p>
<p>A new "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532097310616717411">SteamOS Compatible</a>" label will begin rolling out "over the next few weeks" to denote "whether a game and all of its middleware is supported on SteamOS," including "game functionality, launcher functionality, and anti-cheat support." Games that don't meet this requirement will be marked as "SteamOS Unsupported." As with current games and the Steam Deck, this label doesn't mean these games won't run, but it does mean there may be some serious compatibility issues that keep the game from running as intended.</p>
<p>Valve says that "over 18,000 titles on Steam [will] be marked SteamOS compatible out of the gate," and that game developers won't need to do anything extra to earn the label if their titles already support the Steam Deck.</p>

<p>SteamOS uses a collection of app translation technologies called Proton to make unmodified Windows applications run on SteamOS. This technology has dramatically improved SteamOS's game compatibility, compared to older SteamOS versions that required games to support Linux natively, but it still can't support every single game that Windows does.</p>

Wizkids Underdark Expeditions pack not only includes some of these creepy critters, but also features the first glow-in-the-dark miniatures from Wizkids.</p>

<p>As is standard now Underdark Expeditions is available to purchase in Blind Boxes, each of which contains 3 small or medium sized miniatures, and one large or bigger. These sizes relate to the stat block of the creature.</p>

<h2>Be Sure To Look Up When Exploring The Underdark</h2>

<p>Of the smallest miniatures I received from my eight blind boxes there were plenty of duplicates in this category. Some of the monsters were familiar to me, while others I'll need to do some investigation before I put them out on the table for a low-level party.</p>

These are fantastic examples of an Underdark twist or something your party might know to expect. The Piercers tails are reminiscent of a stalagtight, these predators hang from the ceilings of caves just waiting to drop. The Darkmantle hunts similarly, it's miniature here shown ready to drop down and envelop the head of it's opponent.</p>

<p>For the more humanoid creatures the Myconid Sprouts show off their eerieness with an unnatural blue color to them. Up close you can make out the features of crossed arms and a face, but from a distance it might even just look like set dressing to players at your table.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the size the choker just looks like a small green humanoid. A lot of the finer detail, such as the mouth full of sharp teeth, tentacle suckers on the ends of it's arms, or it's maliable cartilage body really come across for this little miniature.</p>

<h2>Aberrant Horrors</h2>

<p>The Medium creatures I pulled immediately take a further turn from the standard into the creepy and eerie. From this I pulled:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Babau</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Choldrith</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Deep Rothe</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Fire Snake</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Gray Ooze</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Quaggoth</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Shadow</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Swarm of Bats</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Vampiric Mist</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Xorn</li>
</ul><p>Starting with the creatures that are spins on what we're familiar with the Quaggoth hunches forward in its stance, leering with it's lowered head. One of it's hands clenched into a fist, while the other is poised to grab an adventurer. The Choldrith too has an impressive pose, reared up on it's hind (four) legs, with a dagger ready to slash. These cursed spawn of Lolth rituals lead others in her ways, obeying only her command.</p>



<p>Moving even further from the norm we have creatures like the Xorn and Babau. These are the kinds of creatures that defy traditional sense, looking like they have too many limbs, or not enough limbs, or just limbs in the totally wrong place.</p>

<p>This is when your players will know that they're not in Waterdeep anymore. For the Xorn specifically the mix of too many limbs and the rocky texture across their body show perfect detail with under the light. No matter where you are on the table you'll be able to see how unique it is.</p>

<p>For those with no form at all the Shadow does a good job of being way too dark and shows just slight humanoid figures. Unlike the Choker who suffers from being too close to a human form but green by making the shadow this ominous and looming form it takes it away from reality and makes it something scarier to face.</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Barghest</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Carrion Crawler</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Drider</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Giant Bat</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Hook Horror</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Umber Hulk</li>
</ul><p>Here the miniatures remained decidedly subterranean but moved further away from the kinds of aberrant creatures that were medium-sized. Making your way through a system of caves you'll likely run across creatures like the Giant Bat or Carrion Crawler. I am extremely impressed with the smooth leathery quality of the bats wings, spread out, which its beady eyes are focused on a target and teeth are bared.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this isn't the first time Wizkids has included an Umberhulk in their expansions, the last one was available in Spelljammer: Adventures in Space. What did surprise me looking at the two is that each is posed differently. Some slight changes to arm position, stance, and where the head is turning. This is also true of the Drider from Underdark Expeditions and Vecna: Eve of Ruin.</p>

<p>It's nice to have a few minis of something, but even better to have minis with variants to them, it doesn't look like you're throwing down an army of clones and can help combat feel varied.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-underdark-expeditions-glow-in-the-dark.jpg?itok=9ZTqK0qq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-underdark-expeditions-glow-in-the-dark.jpg?itok=GpnYX-yP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Creatures That Go Glow In The Dark</h2>

<p>The last creatures to mention are the glow-in-the-dark ones. From this set I got the following creatures:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Flumph x2</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Gas Spore</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Magma Mephit</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Oblex Spawn</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Venom Troll (This one I believe is Glow In The Dark, it might just be toxic green in color)</li>
</ul><p>Right off the bat, I do want to say that while each of these are marketed as glow in the dark the mileage will definitely vary. The Gas Spore and Oblex Spawn were definitely glowing when I locked myself in my lightless laundry room, some of the paint around the back of the Venom Troll also glowed, but the Flumph and Magma Mephit didn't give off any glow in the dark.</p>

<p>The other genuine question about this is… when are you going to be playing in a dark enough space that you'll be able to review your character sheet, run a session, plan combat, and also have a glow-in-the-dark be recognizable.</p>

<p>I think the charm in these is that by simply looking at them you can tell from the semi-translucent green that they're glow-in-the-dark. The idea of them being glow-in-the-dark is almost a better pay off than getting to see them in the dark.</p>

<p>The most impressive of these is the Gas Spore, this monster looking like a Beholder's distant underdark cousin sits on an incredibly detailed cloud of gas, the semi-transparency lends really well to the effect here.</p>

<h2>Wizkids Icons of the Realms Underdark Expeditions Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This set does feature a good number of strange and creepy creatures that a party might run afoul of in the Underdark. Followers of Lolth, strange adaptive creatures, and even some (kind of) glowing monsters.</p>

<p>From my mix of draws I did get a number of more common creatures from caves or sewers but it also makes sense that not everything is going to be a horror from the deep Underdark.</p>

<p>The glow-in-the-dark effect is fun on paper, in practice it doesn't quite have the effect you'd expect, maybe if you let them bake under a UV light for a bit before drawing them out you'll get a more impactful reveal.</p>

Since then, it’s been delayed three times, got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/3/23055673/ubisoft-prince-persia-remastered-pune-mumbai-montreal">shipped to a different studio</a>, reportedly started over from scratch, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/10/24126462/prince-of-persia-sands-remake-yuri-lowenthal">may have lost the original writer and amazing performances of its English voice actor</a>. But Ubisoft has revealed the game is finally on the way — and will go on sale before April 2026, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-release-by-april-2026/">as spotted by <em>Insider Gaming</em></a>.</p></div><p>In <a href="http://irtable.com/appJQntCmOa2q2a5C/tblpr7UqfWXvDuH8G/viwviiWY2XXTIhLm8?blocks=hide">Ubisoft’s latest earnings release</a>, the company reveals that it expects the <em>Prince of Persia</em> remake to be one of the games that will help its bottom line during the next fiscal year, FY2025-2026. Since Ubisoft’s FY2024-2025 ended on March 31st, 2025, that means the new game will have to go on sale before March 31st, 2026.</p><p>But that also means it could arrive any time now. We’re already two months into FY2025-2026. I’d be surprised if we didn’t get an announcement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603313/summer-game-fest-returns-on-june-6th">at the Summer Game Fest next month</a>.</p><p>Ubisoft suggests that its top games in FY2025-2026 will be <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/637717/assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-assassinations">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></em> and <em>Siege X, </em>but names <em>Prince of Persia</em> as one of the games that’ll contribute alongside <em>Anno 117: Pax Romana, Rainbow Six Mobile</em> and <em>The Division Resurgence</em>.</p><p>I’m eagerly awaiting the chance to try it, as the original is one of my top five favorite games of all time. I loved its storytelling, voice acting, incredible music, and its then-groundbreaking ability to rewind time. But I won’t deny I’m a bit worried.</p><p>Both Yuri Lowenthal — the Prince’s iconic English-language voice actor — and <em>Prince of Persia</em> creator Jordan Mechner were attached to the remake when it was announced in 2020. (Lowenthal once suggested the remake was going to “keep all of Jordan Mechner’s brilliant writing” and thanked Ubisoft for not picking a “younger, hotter actor” instead of him.) But after development moved to Ubisoft Montréal in 2022, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/10/24126462/prince-of-persia-sands-remake-yuri-lowenthal">it’s not clear whether either is still involved</a>. Here’s hoping there was good reason to overhaul the game, unlike <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495611/spider-man-remastered-peter-parker-tom-holland-ps5-playstation-5">that other time a game company replaced Yuri Lowenthal’s face</a>!</p><p>The remake is far from the most-delayed game at Ubisoft, of course: I believe <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181213/i-got-excited-for-beyond-good-and-evil-2-there-for-a-sec-but-i-guess-the-remastered-original-will-do">Beyond Good and Evil 2</a></em> currently holds the all-time record at over 15 years since it was first announced. Incidentally, the first BG&amp;E game shipped just a month after <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company did not release any specifics about what potential future licensed projects might not move ahead, or if any of the Marvel projects might be impacted.</p><p>Given the total silence from EA about its Iron Man, Black Panther, and third Marvel game in the works, some fans and industry observers have expressed fear that not all of these projects may go forward. As of yet, however, there is no reason to believe anything has changed with regards to Marvel's upcoming licensed IP slate.</p><p>With licensed IP, a company like EA is required to pay the license holder a fee.
